John Ferguson is a solemn, mostly rigid, and financially struggling minister who travels by sea, hundreds of miles, to evict a tenant farmer from his home so that wealthy landowners can make room for sheep.This is during a time – acknowledged by Carys Davies in her aftermath – of the great social upheaval known as the Clearances, which began in the mid-eighteenth century in the Scottish Lowlands. Communities of the rural poor were forcibly removed from their homes in a relentless program of systematic dispassion. Thousands upon thousands, between 1750 and 1860, were evicted or driven by famine to leave their homes and start from scratch.John is married to Mary, and he misses her sorely. On the very first day, he slips and falls fro a cliff. He is discovered and tended to by the man he is supposed to evict – Ivar, a giant of a man who is reticent and nearly mythic in his solitude. The bulk of the slim book focuses on the bond that John and Ivar form, even as John hides the true purpose of his visit. He assuages his conscience through his belief that earthly events unfold according to plan, and suffering is a punishment for our sins.Slowly, he learns a new glossary of words from Ivar. He compares this project with his own calling: “In some ways, it felt like a similar sort of project—working hard to turn words from one language into another with all the accuracy and precision you could muster.”It is hard to overstate the beauty and exactitude of the author’s prose. Every scene is infused with beauty, commanding readers to use their sense of sight, hearing, and smell to place themselves alongside John.When the ending comes, it is unexpected and, to my mind, a little too quick. Whether it works or not will be up to each reader, but I do think that a close read of the characters justifies the risk that Carys Davies takes. A few extra pages would have been helpful, but that does not distract from an evocative and memorable read. 4.5 stars rounded up....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 09, 2024","Apr 12, 2024","Apr 09, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/176443690-clear

Like her two main characters, she's not male or gay or an officer in a war. But she understands the grandeur of passion and the elements of tragedy. As a result, she has written an immersive war novel destined to become a new classic.Most male-written war literature—which I typically avoid like the plague—focuses on the pain and glory of war as if it were a large adventure. By wisely choosing to be more insular, following classmates at a high-brow British boarding school, Preshute, Alice Winn brings the war up close and personal. A fictional school newspaper, The Preshutian, traces the lives of those who went to war, and through it, we learn, along with the characters, which of their fellow alumni were killed or wounded. At times, we experience the sickening feeling of losing someone whose time shouldn’t have been up.The author is pitch-perfect in showcasing the extreme disconnect between teenage boys losing their friends, their innocence, their sanity, and sometimes their very lives at the front, while people back home in Britain romanticize the “great war.” While not calling it PTSD, so many of the characters are shell-shocked, a chasm where their memory used to be. But most of all, Alice Winn brilliantly explores “whether a mechanical man could become human once more” or whether the War irremovably marred the landscape of their character and the gangrenous bits of their souls.In Memoriam – the title borrowed from a famous Tennyson poem, in which the speaker asks that God help foolish people to see His light – exposes how teenagers are used as fodder and the moral price that nations and families must pay. One of the main characters considers: “Morphine made the vast sweep of history more logical to him than the chaotic present…he saw empires rise and fall like the swelling and abating of the tide, perpetual, each society blindly throwing its tragedies and flaws onto foreign shores.”More than anything, this novel is a love story about two young men, Gaunt and Ellwood, who are mad for each other at a time when being gay was considered an abomination. The message—that love is good and pure and that, ultimately, love heals—provides a modicum of hope. It’s impossible not to root for them.

At a time when—inconceivably—this country is banning books like To Kill a Mockingbird and Beloved, and a Florida governor is talking about the “benefits” of slavery, we need a book like James to meet this frightening moment.But first, let’s talk about Mark Twain. Percival Everett says in his acknowledgments that his “humor and humanity affected me long before I became a writer.” Indeed, Mark Twain was ahead of his time, lampooning American society and its hypocrisy when few others dared to do it. Which makes the irony of Huckleberry Finn being banned because of its use of the N-word all the more absurd.Percival Everett doesn’t shy from using that reviled word. He’s writing about his time, but he’s also correcting the perception that Huckleberry Finn is a white boy’s story. His viewpoint is that of the slave Jim’s, whose story it really was all along.As in his book Erasure (the inspiration for the movie American Fiction), there’s a lot about how Black people speak. Their very lives are hinged upon how well they master the language expectations of the “massa” (sho’ enuf, massa) or “dat be da best conebrad”). A minstrel scene about James pretending to be a white man in Black face demonstrates beautifully how silly the whole concept of judging by skin color is.It's been years since I read Huckleberry Finn, but memories came flooding back to me, particularly the scenes with the King and the Duke. Interestingly, James can tell they are con men way before Huck based on his need to size up white men quickly.James is wise and cynical enough to know the truth of the world. When he acquires a pencil—with horrible consequences—he writes, “With this pencil I write myself into being.” Too many enslaved men and women did not have the luxury to write their own story; it was communicated for them. By writing James, Percival Everett takes a step toward correcting that, by enabling James to narrate his own story. This book is phenomenally good and should be taught along with Huckleberry Finn at all schools. That is, if our democracy survives.

And that’s saying a lot, since I loved every book she has ever written.This is a novel that only a mature author could write, filled with the quintessential questions and deceptively easy answers that years of living end up providing. Fans of Strout’s past books will delight in meeting up again with her two most iconic characters: Olive Kitteridge, who is still feisty and direct at 91 years old, and Lucy Barton, the diminutive, insightful writer, who lives down the road by the sea with her ex-husband, William. Bob Burgess, her friend and love interest, also lives within these pages, immersed in the ramifications of a murder in this small Maine town.We meet them and other characters in this book of “unrecorded lives,” where ordinary people ruminate about the meaning of love, life, and what we’re meant to do during our brief tenure on earth. Ultimately, life is composed of stories (and each of us has stories) of loneliness, love, and the small connections we make in this world if we are lucky. And sometimes, life is about finding our linchpin who holds us afloat in this messy world.There were many scenes where I wanted to reach within the pages and hug these stumbling but well-meaning characters. Elizabeth Strout writes, “People suffer. They live, they have hope, they even have love, and they still suffer.” But oh, what a thing this life force is and what a powerful force hope is. At the end of the day, love comes in many forms, but it is always love. That’s a message so many of us dismiss, but it holds a truth that we can’t afford to forget.  I am so grateful to Random House for enabling me to be an early reader of this healing novel, filled with characters I have long loved, and threaded with gentle insights and wisdom about what it means to be human in these challenging times.

But it’s a page-turning, possibly cinematic, and well-written one that portends good things for this debut author.  At the heart of the book is a secret. Four-year-old Ruthie, the youngest child of a Mi’kmaq family of berry pickers, wanders away and goes missing during the annual blueberry harvest in Maine. Her family frantically searches for her – with no help from the local police – but not a clue remains of her whereabouts.This is not a whodunit, nor is it a mystery. We find out almost immediately what happened to Ruthie. She was snatched by a woman who could not bear a child of her own. Now named Norma, she has haunting dreams that her parents dismiss. While she senses something isn’t being told to her, she does not receive confirmation. She is smothered by her new parents’ fears that she will be found and taken from them.Half of Berry Pickers is told from Ruthie/Norma’s perspective and addresses the legacy of displacement and the importance of knowing and embracing one’s identity. The other half is narrated in the present by her next-oldest brother, Joe, who feels personally responsible for her disappearance and for some of the ensuing tragedies that occur to the hard-working Mi’kmaq family. When we meet him, he is dying of cancer and rueful about the mess he has made of his life through his impulsive acts and his alcoholism.A perceptive reader can see the end coming from a mile away. Berry Pickers does not hold pretensions of an award-winning literary read; rather, it is a satisfying read, written by an author whose key strength is her strong story-telling ability. With that caveat, I recommend it. 3.75 stars....more",Notes are private!,3,16,1,"Mar 18, 2024","Mar 23, 2024","Mar 18, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123036004-the-berry-pickers

If you are a fan of any of these, you are likely the perfect reader for this collection.In Trial Run, the opening story, a man living alone after a contentious divorce finds himself in his nearly empty office on a snowy day.

As he cautiously listens to the ramblings, his sense of safety becomes increasingly violated.

The couple has a little boy; even though the parents grow older, the toddler shows no signs of getting older. In Neighbors, another ordinary couple who are struggling with the aftermath of infidelity moves to San Francisco in the hopes of “redrawing the map” of their marriage. Yet what awaits them is a strange occurrence in a neighbor's home. In another, a man connects with a woman who wants him to have sex with her while her husband watches from the closet.

Like a master magician, he summons words from thin air and presents them to his readers with a flourish. He could write a city phone book, and it would sing! I went into this, his latest novel, prepared to be bowled over. He did not disappoint.For the first time, this much-awarded Irish writer sets his novel in America, specifically, the city of Butte, Montana, in 1891. Butte is filled with hard-living Irish immigrant workers, one of whom is Tom Rourke, a ballad writer and sometime-photographer. He has the heart of a poet, and yet there’s a darkness that lives within him, which manifests in drinking, doping, and even suicide ideation.Then he meets Polly Gillespie, who is a seasoned mail-order bride of sorts to the old owner of the copper mine, Long Anthony Harrington, who ties up his own wrists and whips himself into a frenzy over his love of Jesus. Not exactly a match made in heaven. When Tom and Polly exchange a look, the earth moves. They steal a horse and escape to the badland.Barry writes, “It was to a world between worlds they were drawn. They were headed into this unthinkable place without a map to it nor the sense to be afraid even, and they were in this regard heroically. Death hovered close to the lovers always. It was around the like a charge o the air. It was like a blue gunpower waft. It was like electricity. They had an aspect of cool affront to life and so it was deathwards they were drawn.”Heart in Winter weaves together – seamlessly, like magic – a lyrical tale of a bad-ass doper and his far-from-innocent lover, a Western adventure tale of gun-for-hire “Jacks” seeking frontier justice on behalf of Harrington, and a treatise about the choices we make and how these choices get rearranged as Tom and Polly lean into their inevitable fate. The patois of the badlands is channeled seamlessly through Barry’s writing as his characters leap from the page.I owe a world of thanks to Doubleday Publishers, who provided me with early access to one of my favorite contemporary writers in exchange for an honest .

First, he is a knowledgeable and insightful sportswriter (cricket in his former book, soccer in this book). Second, his books aren’t really about sports. They’re about characters who display a particular brand of naiveté and brio as they pursue the capitalist dream while holding on to the dream of a fulfilling life.In Godwin, the story hinges on Mark Wolfe, a slowly unraveling Pittsburgh grant writer, and his half-brother Geoff, who is particularly fond of using terms like “bruv” or “fam” when addressing him. Geoff, a shady soccer talent scout, seems to have come across a young African soccer prodigy named Godwin with superstar potential. But Geoff can’t personally pursue him because of a bad leg injury. He summons Mark to help out.As Mark says a little later, “The main difference between a calamity and an adventure is that in the latter case, the protagonist makes it home in one piece and lives to tell the tale.” So here we have an international adventure story that includes an unscrupulous French soccer scout, two edgy brothers, and the poisonous power of unbridled capitalism.The reader will learn a lot about the newly-created competition for African soccer players who possess the strength and explosiveness to stand out in soccer and the unprincipled scouts who pursue them at any cost and the corruption that ensues. O’Neill raises questions about the value of football (soccer is called the American football). From a diversion and pastime it has now become a calculation, a lie, a manipulation.Their story is interspersed with narrations by Mark’s work colleague, Lakesha Williams, who launched The Group, a technical-writing co-operative, attractive to employees like Mark who want to stay independent without taking a financial risk. These two stories will eventually connect. It’s a story of the corruption of colonialism and international money-making and the counterbalance of human connection and stability, held together by an arousing tale of the search for Godwin.

The fact that it’s also a story about storytelling and the purpose of literature is an added bonus.I was engrossed right from the opening page. Maeve Cosgrove, a meek, married Maine librarian, adores her job at a neighborhood public library. Yet immediately, we learn that a troubled teenage girl named Libby has accused her of spying in the next bathroom stall while she and a boy engaged in salacious acts.Oh, my! To complicate things, her favorite author, Harrison Riddles, whom she has worshipped for years, has just agreed to speak at the library at her bequest. He also intends to begin writing his new book, which will be about a Sudanese refugee – the fiancée of a younger woman she works with – whom Maeve mentioned in one of her letters.The characters are all marvelous – Maeve, her husband Jack, Libby, Harrison and his wife Dora, the Sudanese man, Willie and her colleague Katrina, and even the therapist she connects with on the phone. Each of them is a bad animal, capable of being artfully and artistically cruel (to borrow a phrase from Dostoyevsky). They present themselves in a certain way, but often, they are not in tune with who they really are (or maybe they are and don’t want to admit it). It is fascinating to see them disguise the truth, not only to others but also to themselves. Almost to a person, Sarah Braunstein’s characters relay stories that have served them well in the past and believe that a little bit of vulnerability can take the place of authentic human empathy.

If anything, it has enhanced it.I devoured this page-turning story, inspired by true events -- the 1993 government siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Going into the book, my memory of the siege was sketchy: a long-haired man who believed that the end of days was imminent, a raid on the compound approved by Janet Reno, a lengthy stand-off, and a blazing fire that killed dozens.My sketchy knowledge didn’t matter because We Burn Daylight is a work of fiction, enabling the author to take liberties with his story. It is focused on two 14-year-olds: the sheriff’s son Roy and a girl named Jaye, who reluctantly lives in the compound. They are in the throes of first love when the first part of the siege begins.Bret Anthony Johnson divides the novel into four parts, defined by the four horses of the apocalypse. The white horse signifies conquest – many believe it symbolizes Christ or the Antichrist. The black horse symbolizes war and bloodshed; the red horse stands for famine; and the pale horse is usually identified as Death. Interspered with the narratives are recorded podcasts involving the fictional characters and set in the present time.Perry Cullen (aka The Lamb), for a Christ or Antichrist figure (depending on who is doing the defining), is amazingly ordinary – Bible-thumping and repellent and able to lure people to him by making them feel they belonged with him. (Hmm…I wonder who that reminds me of?) Yet, for all his so-called charisma, it is Roy and Jaye who command our attention and remind us that innocent and guileless love truly has the power to save. At the end of the day, bloodline, prayer sacrifice, or a “glad-hearted dream of God” mean little.

No matter how caring a parent or sister or teacher or citizen or activist you are, the deficiency is in-built.”This brainy chronicle of four Irish sisters turns the dysfunctional family genre upside down and leaves you gasping for air.The Alternatives demands a careful read and an ability to wrestle with philosophical concepts that are challenging, both emotionally and intellectually. These sisters, who are single with Ph.D degrees, are forces to be reckoned with. There’s Olwen, the oldest sister, an earth scientist who bemoans the inevitable demise of our planet. After the premature death of their parents, she was responsible for her three younger sisters. These sisters include Rhona, a political scientist, a leading scholar of deliberative democracy, and the only one who’s a mother -- of an adorable one-year-old named Leo. Then comes Maeve, a celebrity chef who is absorbed with food scarcity. Rounding out the family is Nell, an adjunct philosophy professor living in the U.S. who is bisexual but choosing to be celibate.When Olwen seems to drop off the grid, her younger sisters set out to find her, and quickly, they do. To say Olwen isn’t pleased with that outcome is an understatement. But what should one expect from four willful women, all passionate about the issues plaguing the world today?Caoilinn Hughes takes a leap of imagination by enfolding a two-act drama in the midst of her prose. The multi-page drama makes readers feel like they have a front-row seat to observe all the action, without anything other than some stage direction removing them from the story. It is a risk to introduce the two-act drama, but it truly pays off by providing a close understanding of the four women up close and personal.Contemplative, provocative, at turns demanding and compassionate, the Alternatives, the novel is a reminder of the fallacy of control and the limits of causation.

But it helps. Among the familiar characters is Jacquie Red Feather, a recovering alcoholic who is facing the tatters of her past and forming a relationship with the three grandsons whom she barely knows. The eldest, Orvil, is emotionally flailing after a shooting he survives and is wrestling with what it means to be Indian.To understand what these two characters and other related characters are coping with, Tommy Orange takes us back to Colorado, 1864, to meet their progenitor, Jude Star, a survivor of the Sand Creek Massacre. After he is forcefully brought to the Fort Marion Prison Castle, the first stage of the eradication of Indian identity and culture takes place. An evangelical prison guard, Richard Henry Pratt, forces the Indians to learn English and embrace Christianity. Later, his son, Charles, is sent to the school Pratt founded, the violent Carlisle Indian Industrial School, and the next brick to erasing their Cheyenne heritage takes place.And so it begins. Fast forward to 2018. What does it mean to be the children and the grandchildren of the massacre? What does it do to you to be treated differently and dismissively because you have a different culture and darker skin? Isn’t it just as important for you to speak your stories as it is for others to hear them?The progeny of Jude and Charles would answer yes. And so we hear their stories. We hear how their family line was weakened by the effects of history, colonization, and a long war that didn’t stop even when it stopped. They – who inherit the mess, this loss, this deficit – often need superhuman strength to embrace what is good and reach out to their rightful inheritance.

A gimmick, I thought. No one can pull that off effectively.Well, silly me. Not only does Leah Hager Cohen execute her concept well, but she also creates a mesmerizing and thought-provoking novel that had me awestruck.Head you win, tails you win. I began with Fro, which focuses on Annamae – one of the most original characters I’ve had the pleasure of reading. Annamae, a quixotic young girl, discovers early on that no one could really understand anybody and it’s all language’s fault – “people mistook language for solid ground, when really it was just a net.” When her teacher assigns the class a creative writing project, Annamae balks. She has no interest in making characters up if they aren’t going to be alive or possess free agency. To do so would be way too lonely.This section of the novel is steeped in Talmudic lore – specifically, that the world came to be from the Hebrew alphabet – but you don’t need to be Jewish nor have any knowledge of the Talmud to appreciate what this author is accomplishing. All you need is an appreciation of philosophical discourse and rabbinical debates about life and existence, which are quite accessible and interesting to the reader. Annamae is holding out for a soul mate who will think and feel exactly like herself. Replication, not relationship. She does not want to be the one making it all up; it has to be real. But what if she is unreal? What if someone is making her up?Flip the book and turn to “To.” Young Ani is also on a quest. As a girl living in a parable, she travels long distances with a young stolen kitten to overtake “The Captain”, who for the past five years, has served as her way station, a lost and found. Through her journey, she will chance upon other way stations, reassess the stories she has told herself, begin to appreciate the unwritten stories that have yet to be lived, and eventually learn that all stories are intertwined.This novel’s main theme is searching – how each of us searches for understanding to alleviate the human condition. As Annamae and Ani move toward each other, we reach our own understanding of the relevance of this search in modern times. Quoting Leah Hager Cohen, “I wound up with a book in which two children from impossibly separate worlds – one of them Jewish and one whose story echoes that of the cast-out Ishmael – are driven to reach out toward each other longing to connect with a presence they sense but cannot name.”What a magnificent book!

(Any similarities to the Jesus story are, I suspect, intentional). She is wholly of and not of Earth. Her mission is to communicate with her extraterrestrial superiors by fax. Her own planet, Cricket Rice, is dying, and she is asked to report to them whether the planet Earth is hospitable.In ways, Adina is not unlike any person who feels different and apart from those who seem “normal” – people like the popular J girls – Janae, Joy, Jen, Jiselle, and the other Jen. She is far more sensitive and as an alien, she views the world with fresh and innocent eyes. She faxes interplanetary reflections like, “Human beings don’t like when other human beings are happy.” Or “Human beings fetishize no organ more than the heart”. Or more profoundly, “Every human dies. But the bad news is that every day they act like they don’t know they’re alive.”But eventually, she realizes that to do her job correctly, she must get close to human beings. By doing so, she begins to learn that human life is quick, and human life spans do not give us time to feel temporally in proportion. As she begins to understand the quirkiness – and sometimes, the blessings – of being human. When a friend urges her to share her message with the world, she complies.I expected great things from Marie-Helene Bertino after reading her remarkable debut book, Parakeet.

Throughout the novel, he remains unnamed, as if he is so unimportant that his name doesn’t even matter.He is bullied and tortured by a band of tormenters to the point that readers will find themselves begging for some kind of deliverance or intervention. It doesn’t come. The only solace he receives is through a budding friendship with a girl named Kojima, who is also bullied because of her bad hygiene. She invites him to join her to visit the art museum to view a painting she calls “Heaven.” Although his time with her is a welcome respite, he never does get to see the painting.As our narrator spins down to near despair, an unexpected encounter with one of the oppressors establishes the themes that run through this novel. Do bullies do anything because they believe they have the right, or do they do it simply because they want to? Is being a victim happenstance? “There’s no reason it has to be you,” the bully explains. “It could have been anyone. But you happened to be there, and we happened to all be in a certain mood, so things went the way they did.” The world, Mieko Kawakami’s character implies, is all about coincidence.

Who loves longer, a man or a woman?This is Question 7, and it comes from Anton Chekhov’s parody of a school test problem. I can honestly say it’s like nothing I’ve read before from Richard Flanagan, whose fiction I adore.

Richard Flanagan touches on a lot here: the unbridled affair between HG Wells and Rebecca West; the dropping of the atomic bomb by aircraft pilot Thomas Ferebee (“Bomb away!”), the same pilot who carpet-bombed Vietnam, destroying that country, too, decades later; the heinous Japanese Death Railway (where Flanagan’s father suffered as a POW); and Flanagan’s own near-death experience while navigating the powerful rapids of the Franklin River. The dropping of the atomic bomb incinerated 60,000 or 80,000 or 140,000 Innocent Japanese citizens. It also brought about the end of his father’s internment. What if the bomb hadn’t dropped? All those victims would have been alive, but Flanagan himself would not have lived, because his father would likely have perished. No father, no son. Or what if Rebecca West had not begun an affair with HG Wells? Likely he would not have gone to Switzerland to write a book called The World Set Free, and without that book, Leo Szilard might never have imagined what a nuclear chain reaction could do.

The feelings are so primal that it would be impossible to replicate in fiction. So I did something I don’t usually do: Google the author’s background. Indeed, many of the pieces do fit (although, of course, no reader can discern what’s true and what’s fiction).The basics: Jane, a talented writer, meets John, who not only writes, but also draws and makes photographs and films. Despite some qualms about how the institution of marriage can destroy creative women, she goes ahead and marries him. But the dynamics of their marriage are revealed right in the beginning: “He said the only reason we weren’t engaged was that he couldn’t afford a ring. Then he arranged to get six new shirts made.”John is all about John. He is self-immersed, never does his fair share, loves to exert his power, and makes Jane feel like she’s little more than an appendage to his needs and wants. Having a child together simply exacerbates his worst qualities. He begins to gaslight her.The way readers will relate to Liars is a sort of Rorschach test about their own feelings about men and marriage. Sarah Manguso takes a risk – and it pays off – in writing this book in a sort of staccato style, the way you would narrate a sensitive story to an empathetic friend. It draws the reader in and immerses the reader in Jane’s life.As someone who married later in life – and carefully chose a man who is both kind and supportive after going through my own share of Johns – I found myself often wanting to reach into the pages and ask, “What do you see in this guy? He’s Don’t you know you’re better than that?” I couldn’t help but think that Sarah Manguso was making an indisputable case, brick by brick, of the duplicity and worthlessness of John. The case was so airtight that I wished I had more insight into why Jane felt compelled to stay. (This question is answered, but not nearly enough for me.) For those who enjoyed Elena Ferrante’s Days of Abandonment or Claire Kilroy’s Soldier, Sailor (and I did love both), I recommend Liars.

In reality, Wolf at the Table is a meditation about the ubiquitous nature of evil and our constant proximity to it. To read it narrowly as a parable about one particular family would be, I believe, a mistake.The author telegraphs his intentions right from the beginning. The oldest of give children in the staunchly Catholic Larkin family, teenager Myra meets a stranger who claims to be the up-and-coming baseball player Mickey Mantle. With his chiseled physique and all-American looks, Mantle was the epitome of the American sports hero. We know in hindsight that he is destined to fall from grace through his heavy alcoholism, which left him a shell of the man he once was.Did Myra truly meet Mickey Mantle? Probably not. Directly afterward, we learn that a killing took place close by, which might have been enacted by the imposter. If, indeed, he was an imposter. Heroes and killers go hand in hand. We do know that Myra’s sole surviving brother, Alec, is the family’s bad seed and, as time elapses, is likely a serial killer. He preys on teenage boy athletes, who are on the cusp of breaking through their lower socioeconomic conditions through their sports prowess. In other words, these are boys primed to live the American Dream. In the meantime, life goes on around the Larkins. As the siblings settle into their roles – the responsible older sister Myra, the flamboyant Fiona, and so on – Alec lingers on the outside, sending disturbing postcards to his family. Evil continues to lurk, particularly with peripheral references to Richard Speck and John Wayne Gacy and priest abuse. As life wears away at the siblings, innocence is lost, and in his or her own way, every key character becomes complicit in the perpetuation of evil.This is a fascinating book.

You get a book that maintains its mythical feel while bringing the reader uncomfortably close to the daily existence of those who struggle to get by.Sam and Elena, two sisters born just over a year apart, live with their ailing mother, who is slowly dying. Elena, the older sister, bartends in a local golf club. Sam works on the ferry shuttle, serving coffee and finger food to dismissive and entitled wealthy commuters.

It would be made if disparate parts, flesh and bone, blood lost in a hemorrhage, stitched-together old skin. A book that would stir with uneasy life.”In an era when a mother’s fraught journey of conception, pregnancy, birth, and sometimes loss has been commandeered by sanctimonious, mostly male politicians, what Louisa Hall has done in Reproduction is really quite marvelous.She creates a book that positively teems with uneasy life and forces us to look closely at the monstrous challenges of creating a new creature – and she begins with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Our narrator, a novelist – who in no small measure is Louisa Hall herself – is attempting to write about another novelist, Mary Shelley, who dealt with a series of traumatic losses.But, since the book is indeed made up of disparate parts, the focus shifts as Louisa Hall mines her own experiences -- the devastating loss of a much-wanted child reabsorbed into her body, leaving behind a void on the sonogram screen. The torturous pain of bringing her next pregnancy to term and afterward hemorrhaging uncontrollably. Her final pregnancy and its abnormal result. And the deep aloneness that follows.Through a female friend – a scientist – who tries to engineer her own child as if she were a mad scientist – not unlike Frankenstein – our narrator also casts her eye on the morality and pitfalls of genetically engineered human babies. The narrator wonders, “What sort of risk was she taking – this insane refusal to abandon a creature to any sort of risk at all.”All of this plays out in absurd times when a woman who is raped tries to get the morning-after pill and make an appointment for STD testing at Planned Parenthood in Texas, only to find it shut down. And when women are embraced by the medical establishment when they are “with child”, only to be charged onerous fees and jump through hoops to remove a fetus who has died in utero and now represents a threat to a mother’s mental health and to her very life.The coupling of physical trials with philosophy in a country – indeed, a world – that has lost its bearings makes this book a must-read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 19, 2023","Dec 23, 2023","Dec 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62668998-reproduction

In The Adversary, he outdoes himself. This is his best book yet. Set in a small fishing village called Mockbeggar in the 18th century, there are really three adversaries here. One is Abe Strapp, a thoroughly immoral and corrupt dispenser of justice (who strongly resembles a certain political figure, which I believe is deliberate). The other: Abe’s older sister, the Widow Caines, a Quaker who is distinguished by her pipe and the donning of her dead husband’s clothing, her pet crow, and her sharp tongue. To say they despise each other is putting it mildly. The third person, The Anglican, holier-than-thou Beadle, who has yoked himself to Abe Strapp.Don't expect any “likable” characters or redemption here. This is a series of offenses and counter-offenses, with vindictive and yet riveting characters, determined to triumph in controlling Caines Mercantile, uncaring about the wreckage they leave in their wake.The novel has plenty to keep readers glued to the page: a sibling relationship that gives new meaning to dysfunction, invading marauders, Abe’s depraved brothel, scalding, amputations, public whippings, devastating storms, hypocritical religious leaders, a pandemic, and more. Yes, it’s a dark tale that focuses on corruption and ruthlessness. But Michael Crummey knows how to milk some of the scenes for entertainment. Think of the old evening soap opera Dallas. This is what you get: villainous characters who simultaneously fascinate and repel the reader.

Even those who would never consider themselves to be writers often have a story to tell. Yet, too often, people don’t believe in themselves and instead narrate some predictable, hackneyed plot copied from a sitcom.For all those people who have a story to tell – and that, Julia Alverez suggests, is all of us – here is a book that will encourage us to excavate stories that are begging to be told.I can’t help but feel that this book is personal for the author. Julia Alverez’s literary oeuvre has been defined through the years by her vivid characters, strong portrayal of sisterhood, and sharp insights into human nature. The author has been quoted as saying that stories have the ability to transform, encourage empathy, spur the imagination, and reveal our full humanity. Her character, Alma, is also a writer who hails from the Dominican Republic and whose works have found their way into the mainstream of American Literature. Alma, like the author, is now a woman in her 70s who wishes to honor the stories her characters tell and put them to rest.After inheriting an unwanted piece of land in her home country, Alma hires a local woman named Filomena (her name means “friend of strength”) to maintain the place and listen to stories that have been buried with their creators. She is a conduit of sorts, revealing the poignant and often heartbreaking story of Bienvenida, the cast-off second wife of the infamous dictator Rafael Trujillo, and also the story of Manual Cruz, a doctor whose tale is ultimately one of betrayal. Filomena’s own colorful and compelling story also weaves a fascinating tale.This emotionally engaging novel inspires each of us to embrace our own Scheherazade and understand how powerful our stories can be.

Derek Miller earnestly weaves together a tale inspired by a true-life historical event (preserving Renaissance art treasures held within Italian monastery walls), a World War II saga, a high stakes adventure heist, and a unique coming-of-age story.Whether this book is for you or not will depend upon your enjoyment of these disparate genres, particularly your tolerance for an adventure tale with a philosophical undercurrent.If so , then prepare to become engulfed in this narrative, which is filled with moral ambiguity, laden with hidden secrets, packed with fascinating insights into fine art and history, and fraught with lessons on survival. Narrated by an orphaned young Italian teen (dubbed Massimo), who was saved from an Allied bombing by the charismatic artist Pietro Houdini, the story gathers steam as the characters reveal themselves. After taking refuge at the Abbey of Montecasino, our intrepid narrator shares the unmasked Pietro: a man who develops a false rapport with the Nazis while hiding three Titian paintings from their grasp. As Derek Miller writes (in the voice of Massimo) at the start, “We are part of something larger: something mystical and beyond the realm of human understanding that impinges on our stories and our lives.” All of us, he suggests, carry stories that may not be part of something good, just, fair, or virtuous, but these stories still demand to be told.I owe thanks to Avid Reader Press for enabling me to be an early reader in exchange for an honest . ...more",Notes are private!,4,23,1,"Nov 26, 2023","Dec 05, 2023","Nov 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/176442905-the-curse-of-pietro-houdini

I don’t often say that a book of fiction changes the way I look at myself and the world around me, but I’ll say it about Wellness. The book focuses on Jack and Elizabeth, products of dysfunctional families, who arrive in Chicago and “meet cute”, watching each other from their separate apartment windows in Wicker Park (bonus points if you’ve lived significant time in Chicago, as I have.) They marry, have a son, and achieve a modicum of fame in their fields. Jack is a photographer who “photographs nothing”; he captures nothing on film, using solvents and fixers involved in photographic processing. Elizabeth, who is an integral part of a group called Wellness, which cures ill people with placebos, also deals with nothingness. Both are defined with emptiness, blankness, and absence. She parcels out her intimacies and he is an emotional hydra, “a sucking pit of need.”They are living in our too-familiar world where truth does not exist. Everything is deconstructed – language, speech, reality itself. It’s a world where “the actual world has become one big hypertext, and nobody knows how to read it. It’s a free-for-all where people build whatever story they want out of the world’s innumerable available scraps.”What stories do we tell ourselves and which stories do we inaccurately share? Nathan Hill takes a deep dive into wellness and placebos (the truth is that placebos are as effective as medical interventions for about half of chronic conditions; it’s the belief that something is being done that activates the mind to promote healing. Most of the stories we soothe ourselves with (from the benefits of relentlessly positive thinking to juice cleanses and vitamin supplement therapy) are not accurate. And the section on Facebook and other social media addictions is worth the entire price of this book and then some. The author breaks down how the different algorithms – the bots – hook us and then reinforce our most irrational thoughts, tethering us to a spot that feels safe and secure and making us feel we’re in control. Our inflexible certainty on issues from politics to government’s interference with medicine to the world-as-simulation is a pacifier for what we’re actually saying: “I am in great pain, and nobody is paying attention.”This is not, though, a book about philosophies, though. At its core, it’s a book about imperfect lovers – who often wonder, “Could you ever love someone as broken, or pathetic, as me?” can get to that one affirmative word they want to hear: YES. And it’s about how together, lovers invent the world around them. This is just a fantastic book.

You have to keep going. You can’t look down.”But what happens when you lose your footing and do look down? Can you survive or must you surrender to the emptiness?Warren, who has been married to his wife Janet for 37 years, has lost his footing. The two of them share mutual respect, but they have markedly different views of the world. Then he unexpectedly runs into Sarah, his college sweetheart, at the opera. She is now divorced from the man she left Warren for so many years ago. They rekindle what they once had. But of course, life is now far more complicated. Both have adult children, and Warren is married.That is the set-up for Leaving, and it is the launching pad for many questions that center around love, marriage, and parenthood. Is love – much like in operatic tragedies – a constant struggle between passion and honor? Are there ever moral grounds for leaving a marriage? What do we owe our children and others who love us? Is personal joy more important than being present and nurturing for those who carry our genetic code and will carry it into the future? Should adult children ever have the right to “own” their parents’ lives or to emotionally blackmail them?This is a nuanced book, and in reading it, my own questions arose. According to scientists, we are naturally programmed to enjoy about two years of constant sexual highs before settling down to a calmer, more mature love that can still be punctuated by passion. I wondered: what is it about Sarah that attracted him so deeply? She left him for the flimsiest of reasons. And his need to exit his marriage seems built on relatively flimsy reasons as well. What makes them think now they are natural soulmates? At 60 years old, are Warren and Sarah racing the clock to capture the kind of transcendental love that has been denied to them?I struggled with my rating because the answers are not clear. But I gradually decided that maybe that’s the point: there are no easy answers or instant understandings.

It quickly sold over two million copies and was an Oprah Book CThree years ago, I read a page-turning book entitled American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins. It quickly sold over two million copies and was an Oprah Book Club pick. I enthusiastically recommended it to my reading friends and one after one, they five-starred it. The book focused on a Mexican mother and son fleeing the drug cartel and their harrowing journey to safety in the U.S. Soon enough, the book was demonized by those who thought it was a prime example of cultural appropriation. The five-star s were downgraded to one star. How dare a white person try to tell the story of illegal Mexican immigrants? Never mind that the story was sympathetic and masterfully told. All writers, the narrative went, should “stay in their lane.”This is a long introduction to why I believe Yellowface is an important and compelling book. In this fictional case, a pretty good writer named June Hayward (who decides to use her birth name of Juniper Song) is destined to lurk in the shadows of her superstar novelist friend, a Chinese-American woman named Athena Liu. Then, Juniper is present during a freak accident in Athena’s apartment. Athena dies and before Juniper leaves, she steals an outline of her work-in-progress, a surefire best-seller, about Chinese laborers in Canada during World War I. She completes the work and finds herself glowing in the adoration of the publishing world.That is, in essence, the opening of Yellowface. Of course, there are differences from American Dirt, which was not plagiarized or stolen. But still, the dynamics are similar. And the scathing insider’s look at today’s publishing industry is absolutely fascinating.R.F. Kuang poses the question: are we all vultures? Are some of us simply better at finding the juiciest morsel of a story, at “ripping through bone and gristle to the tender bleeding heart and putting all the gore on display?” Has writing become a matter of professional jealousies, obscure marketing budgets and advances, and editors who mess around with their vision? Is a writer’s story now hostage to her skin color, ethnicity, gender identification philosophy, and political stance? Shouldn’t it be a living thing, independent of its creator?The author’s depiction of the feeding frenzy aka Twitter and the social media posts in general are cautionary. Just about anyone – an angry editor or proofreader, a disgruntled boyfriend, a jealous colleague – can torpedo the very best writers with untrue and unkind rumors. But Yellowface isn’t a screed. Obviously, there’s the inconvenient truth that Juniper did, indeed, steal intellectual property, taking away from Athena’s legacy. Obviously, she is also owning a story that is more aptly a Chinese writer’s story to tell. Still, when does cultural appropriation become censorship, nipping away at creative freedom and the ability to transport ourselves into an era or a culture that is not our own? Fiction is not the same as non-fiction, after all.I think this would make a fascinating book club selection.

The little girl – Margaret Murphy – is only four years old when she inadvertently kills her best friend during a game played in an old toolshed. How does a child who is barely able to process the intricacy of thoughts and feelings navigate through the burden of guilt and shame?The answer, as suggested here, is through the stories we weave and the fantasies we create – certainly not through faith or even the comfort of strangers. At the end of the day, it is up to Margaret to determine whether she will be ""the hero of her own story , or the villain, or the sacrificial lamb, or a person of no importance who will be forgotten at the end.""Margaret will reach that conclusion through the help of Poor Deer, a cloven-footed, fantastical creature who, in a manner of speaking, holds Margaret’s own feet to the fire as she recounts the story at age 16. Any time that Margaret deviates from the truth in her telling, Poor Deer firmly guides her back to the real version. In doing so, Margaret, who has spent her young life feeling guilty and unloved, will discover why we love, why we suffer, and how to make sense of our lives. And she will also learn how the stories we tell ourselves help us make it through another day.This fable-like novel is beautifully created and rendered.

Just like this.Pia, who is 15 years old, is thrust into a world that has ceased making sense. Her mother, a dedicated French biologist, is spending every ounce of energy trying to save Polynesia’s imperiled coral reefs from Mo’orea, a tiny volcanic island off the coast of Tahiti. Her father lives half a world away in New York City, is overwhelmed with the enormity of saving lives in the hospital he works at. When her parents decide that she would be better off in New York, she suddenly finds herself in isolation with her young pregnant stepmother, Kate, whom she barely knows.She doesn’t want to be there. She really wants to go back to Mo’orea, to be with a man twice her age, whose vision, passion, and social stances captivate her. As she tries to put together a plan, she ends up connecting with one of Kate’s students, Athyna, who is dealing with her own very complicated and even threatening family dynamics. With the odds against her, Athyna is struggling to recognize her own dreams.Without becoming overly pedantic, Nell Freudenberger spells out what’s at stake: the folly of mining for the coral reefs that serve important functions in protecting coastal communities. And the race against the clock fight against a disease that humanity has never experienced before. Yet through this times that are fraught with danger, the author develops a subplot that is relatable in any time – a teenager from a divorced home who is struggling to make sense of her parents, her life, and the complex emotions she can barely control.This is a wonderful rendering of a complicated time when realities shifted and changed and inner turmoil rocked our world and particularly the world of younger people. It touches on the many facets of life as it affects us now – from uncertainty and anxiety to racism and colonialism and beyond. I believe this is Nell Freudenberger’s best book yet.

At any moment, she is both enveloped by it and terrorized by it. It’s the place she calls home. And it’s populated by her beautiful but mercurial mother, who, Claudia fears, could easily disappear or even take her own life. Her much-older father is aware of her mother’s dalliances and the relationship between them is fragile. He falls into silences.Too young to totally understand – Claudia is only eight years old – she feels she is at the edge of an abyss, a profoundly deep and seemingly bottomless chasm. She inhabits a world where nothing is certain – where bigger-than-life women like Princess Grace or Karen Carpenter or a certain outgoing cousin of mother’s – suddenly disappear and exist no longer. “All my dead,” she thinks. “If my father’s dead resided in his silence and my mother’s dead were the plants in the jungle, mine were the leaves about to fall.” Portentous signs were everywhere – even the guayacans that lost their leaves and are now just bare branches with a few wilted flowers.Abyss is all about atmosphere and the toll that uncertainties take on a child who can no longer rely on the truths and security of an adult world. It is about how growing unease and adult secrets collide and how children struggle to make sense of things beyond their ken. It is a fine book and well translated from the Spanish by Lisa Dillman.

A random encounter re-introduces Dexter to his once-close college friend Elizabeth and her younger sister, Vicki. Into this group comes Philip, a musician and sometime-boyfriend and of Elizabeth, and Poppy, his daughter.There is a sort of elusive rhythmic sensation that flows through the book as characters touch and occasionally bounce off each other. It’s not a character study, not really, yet characters are revealed. Nor is it a book that’s precisely crafted to study shifting alliances, although certainly some of that. What is it about, then? As the prelude suggests: it’s about how life happens to all of us and how we subsist within the moral universe that is modern life.This is a book where every sentence – every scene – holds little gems while some puzzlement weaves through nearly all scenes.

Time after time, I’m bowled over by their emotive storytelling, lyricism, and amazing character insights.Strange Sally Diamond is no exception. For the first third of the book, I thought it was evocative of the novel of another Irish writer. Even mentioning that writer or her book would constitute a spoiler of sorts. But as this story expands, it becomes both darker and more hopeful.As the novel begins, Sally is incinerating her dead father. He had joked with her before that “when I die, put me out with the trash.” Right away, the reader knows she is some kind of strange and she takes things way too literally. We also know that Sally was adopted and lives a somewhat isolated life with the man – a psychiatrist – whom she accepts as her father.But why can’t Sally recall any memories before the age of seven – and how has she gotten so “socially deficient”? Why does a teddy bear she receives in the mail evoke a sense of connection? How will this woman, now approaching her mid 40s, even survive without her father there to help her through?Despite Sally’s lack of any filter, she is utterly engaging. As she learns to navigate the world alone, and connect with others in her town, we root for her. Although we understand she has moments of rage – and can’t quite understand where the rage is coming from – we like her nonetheless. As the secrets of her past unravel, and she enters psychotherapy, we learn along with her why she has such strong demons.There is one other narrator in this book and his name is Peter. He is very much connected to Sally and her early years, although at first, we don’t know how. The book explores how two people, exposed to the same environment, diverge in how they navigate life. There is one situation in Peter’s narrative that I found to be inorganic. It is because of that that I am giving the book four instead of five stars.Regardless, this is a haunting book that digs deep into the legacy of family secrets yet provides hopes of survival despite everything.

It makes its own case that language, indeed, has particularly potent powers.We know what is going to happen right from the opening pages: former Harvard doctoral program student Angela is writing her story while incarcerated. How did this bright young woman end up in jail?As the story unfolds Angela is a widow with a four-year-old daughter who appears to be mostly nurtured by her social-worker mother, whom they are living with. She has been booted from her Harvard program, left with tens of thousands of dollars in student debt, and in desperate need of a job. Then, thanks to her mother’s colleague, she ends up with one: helping nonverbal patients work together with her to spell words on a controversial typewriter-like machine that is not unlike a Ouija board.Her first patient is a man who is her own age – Sam – who has been unable to talk and barely mobile since he was a toddler. Angela herself is skeptical of the machine but her skepticism quickly fades when Sam begins to express himself coherently in ways that exceed her wildest imagination. He has been locked up inside his mind for years and is so extraordinarily bright that he is capable of creating a fascinating essay on Chekhov.The question that readers must wrestle with is this: is Angela stark-raving mad or deluded, or is she a brilliant linguist with a special ability to awaken Sam from his own incarceration as a nonverbal being? Does Angela’s own use of language provide hints to the answer?

In her book The FriendThis is not the first time that Sigrid Nunez – a stunningly insightful writer – has integrated an animal story into her novels. In her book The Friend, it was a Great Dane; in Mitz, it was a marmoset.Here the animal in question is a miniature macaw, Eureka, an intelligent and sociable bird who is left stranded after his human “parents” are unable to return home after COVID hits, and who is abandoned by his collegiate bird-sitter. Nunez writes, “You want to care about all the animals, even the tiniest ones, you understand how vulnerable these animals’ lives are, how vulnerable all lives are.”It is from a place of vulnerability that Nunez’s character, an academic and a writer, ruminates about life, the future, and the essence of reading and writing in the midst of unprecedented times. The unnamed character, who bears resemblances to Nunez herself, spends the early days of the pandemic in a luxury boutique New York apartment with a troubled Gen Z college vegan and the colorful (in every sense of the word) bird, Eureka.For weeks, she finds it impossible to write. What is the point? The purpose? How can one invent stories, say, about a made-up heath care worker when so many people are heroically giving of themselves each hour? What can writing—or reading – offer in such dark times. Perhaps what is wanted in our own dark anti-truth times, with all our blatant hypocrisy and the growing use of story as a means to distort and obscure reality is a literature of personal history and reflection: direct, authentic, scrupulous about fact.”That is what Sigrid Nunez presents to us in The Vulnerables. And that is why I passionately recommend this book, particularly for those of us of a certain age. The insights, that range from our much-needed connection to nature to the use of the writer’s prompt “I remember” to artificial generational barriers to important people in one’s past – it’s all here and expressed eloquently. Well-known writers are quoted as the narrator seeks to find her own truth.This novel relies on interiority, the nature of memory, and the necessity of navigating the troubling times we live in yet hope shines through as well.

There is suddenly no past, nWhen a tragedy occurs – a college-age son is found lifeless a continent away – the whole concept of time suddenly shifts. There is suddenly no past, no future, no sense of home, and no way forward. There is only the present and each moment assumes an exaggerated significance.Cormac James captures this phenomenon quite well in his searing dissection of two mothers, Alba and Lil, who race to their son Pierre’s bedside in Trondheim, Norway after his heart stops and he is raced to the hospital. We know from page one that the mothers, who have been married for 25 years, do not have the smoothest relationship. There is an undercurrent of something amiss, and beneath the surface, anger resides. We even wonder why these two women decided to be together. But the magnitude of the tragedy demands that they bond together as they begin the long hospital vigil. Except they can’t. Lil is outwardly the tougher of the two and the more adventurous, unable to express need from anyone for anything. Alba is far more emotive and relies on her faith to bring her comfort more than she relies on her wife. As a counterweight for Alba’s faith, Lil relies on her own instincts for unpalatable truths. As the fate of their son, who lays in an induced coma, hangs in the balance, so does the fate of his mothers’ relationship. Both need healing and both rely on the comfort of strangers. In the meantime, the reader – much like Pierre – is tethered to a place where the slightest word, innuendo, or variation is fraught with meaning. Is healing really possible? If so, what would it feel like?I will, of course, not reveal what direction the story takes.

Certainly that’s the case with William Boyd’s latest protagonist, Cashel Greville Ross.Within his 80+ year lifespan, Cashel Greville Ross will fight at Waterloo where Napoleon made his last stand…enter the inner circle of Percy Shelley, his wife Mary Shelley, and the legendary Lord Byron…set out in search of the source of the Nile where he will meet up with the famed explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton and the duplicitous John Hanning Speke..and become inadvertently involved in the smuggling of Greek antiquities.Most of all, this romantic will fall head over heels for a glamorous Contessa named Raphaella, who will never stray far from his mind. Although to this reader, Raphaella came across as vainglorious, manipulative and materialistic as well as (of course) beautiful, this is, after all the romantic era, and Cashel is the ultimate romantic.Do not expect deep introspection. The purpose is not to wonder what drives Cashel or what he is thinking. Instead, the goal is to surrender to a hugely satisfying good yarn that follows one colorful character through his multiple iterations – son and brother, lover, soldier, farmer, debtor, best-selling writer, husband and father, world traveler (and Ivan Turgenev look-alike). The real-life people he encounters along this journey only heightens the fun.As Cashel pursues life’s ripening and turning point, he realizes that life is not about pursuing the ifs, the maybes, the wrong turnings, the dead ends. It’s really about accepting the life that's lived and not waste time imagining the lives that could have been have lived.

As a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, screenwriter, and long-time Austinite, he has – to use his words – “long been enchanted by the politics of Texas and the vivid characters who inhabit the marbled halls of our legislature.”If you’re from Texas, this is an absolute must read. You will likely know exactly who Wright’s bigger-than-life characters truly represent. But even if – like me – you’re not from the Lone Star state, this book is a real rodeo ride and eye-opener of how politics work (or rather, don’t work) and what’s at stake,Sonny Lamb is a genial Texas rancher and Iraq vet, whose ranch has fallen on hard times. When a longtime Democrat state rep dies, a Republican lobbyist nicknamed L.D. appears at his door and asks him to run for his seat. Sonny has just saved a little girl’s favorite horse from a burning barn, and he is the hero they are looking for. He barely squeaks into office and then the fun begins.I thought I knew something about Texas politics, but this novel affirms how craven the political process is. Sonny doesn’t quite understand that he is forced to “dance with the one who brung him”, which forces L.D. to bring him down a peg or two in a humiliating way. Wright’s novel reveals how bills are stymied or stalled or are DOA, how the mettle of politicians is tested during a feral-pig hunt, how sanctimonious representatives in thrall to the lobbyists are forced to vote for bills that are not in the Texas people’s best interest. A hilarious (and sad) scene of representatives fleeing the capital, some pursued by police, so there is not a quorum to vote on an anti-LGBQT bill sounds too on-the-nose to not be true.There are a couple of missteps. Sonny is passionate about a desalination bill that will convert wastewater (a result of fracking) to usable water for irrigation, and the descriptions of it sometimes lost me. I had the feeling that I was reading Mr. Wright’s views rather than Sonny. A subplot about his cowgirl wife, Lola, and their fertility issues and marital woes sometimes seemed out-of-step with the forward propulsion. At times, Lawrence Wright seems more hopeful than he perhaps should be at this juncture but there’s nothing wrong with hope.But these are just quibbles. For the most part, I found this novel to be fascinating, particularly for those of us interested in politics.

I closed the last page strung out and hopeful and filled with admiration. Once again, this talented author has created a community, brought it into focus, and encouraged me to love nearly every one of its flawed characters.And what an amalgam of characters it is! Right from the start, we meet Jewish theater manager Moshe Ludlow and his outspoken wife Chona, who live above the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store in a neighborhood called Chicken Hill.Quickly – and partially because of Chona’s largesse – the grocery store becomes a sort of melting pot. There are “colored maids, housekeepers saloon cleaners, factory workers, and bellhops.” Also gangsters, the prejudiced rural doctor who marches proudly with the Ku Klux Klan, recently fired Italian laborers, ex-cons, and crooked politicians. Among all of these is a 12-year-old orphaned boy named Dodo, who is stone deaf after a stove explodes a few years back.Dodo is a sweet boy and a fast learner. He is also wanted by the state of Pennsylvania, who is determined to shut him away in the most notorious institution around. Chona agrees to take in the boy and hide him in plain sight. But her love and compassion may not be enough.James McBride’s set-up is not unlike Richard Russo’s in his recent Somebody’s Fool, although the writing style and plot lines are very different. Both create a world of overlapping characters, focusing in on each and then focusing out again to define how they fit into a broader world. McBride’s goal is to illuminate the comradeship and sometimes, the distrust, of people who have been exclude from the Land of Liberty. In doing so, he shines a harsh light on racial, religious and social identity.The magic of this novel is that while exposing the worst of us, McBride also illuminates the best of us. There is true hope and humanity at work here, even while brutal truths are strongly at play. While McBride is no Pollyanna – some people are just not meant for redemption – he implies that many of us are, and when the chips are down, we will try a little harder.I loved this book and the author’s ability to wring out emotion while staying clear-eyed about our complex racial and religious history.

After reading Paul Murray’s prior book, Skippy Dies, I knew I was in for a treat. I just didn’t know how much. At its core is a fable: a weary and cold traveler discovers a door in the side of a hill. Inside there is food, music, conviviality, and a warm welcome. The traveler willingly partakes. But the next day, he wakes up alone and stiff on the side of the hill and can no longer. When he arrives back home, he is dismayed to find his home reduced to a pile of stones and his family dead. While he was diverted by entertainment, a hundred years have gone by an that time cannot be regained.The Barnes family consists of Dickie, the owner of a Volkswagen dealership, his beautiful wife Imelda, daughter Cass who dreams of college in Dublin with her bestie Elaine, and PJ, who is obsessed with video games and existential threats. The family consistently is haunted by events that reshaped the past, the drama that is upending the present, and issues beyond their control for the future – such as the degradation of “normal” life through climate change. They are alienated from each other and even from themselves. They are also the architects of their own life through choices that can, at any time, reach out and destroy them. Slowly but surely, they are being pushed to that door where everything will change.Much of what they “put out there” are fables they spin themselves. For instance, the book takes its title from a bee sting that Imelda falls victim to on her way her wedding, forcing her to stay veiled the entire time. At least, that’s what everyone believes. Barnes family members put on their metaphorical veil to shelter themselves, but the outside world, along with its threats, is just a thin layer away. As they unconsciously inch closer and closer to events that will undo them and turn their world into something unrecognizable, the novel escalates in tension and the voices begin to integrate together. The last pages are breathtaking and unforgettable.This book is short-listed for the Booker Prize and if it doesn’t win, there is no justice.

The right to unburden myself and expect someone to listen?”Right from the very first page, we learn this: the barrier arm was down. A woman stops, behind two other cars. The lowered arm, the alarm bell, and the red lights all indicated that a train was coming. But there was no train.It’s a refrain that Claudia Pineiro uses over and over again, in almost exactly the same words, as if the scene was seared into her character, Mary Lohan’s, brain. Which it is. Twenty years have passed since a fatal accident occurred, in a Buenos Aires suburb with Mary at the wheel. She has changed her name and her appearance. But the devastating pain of that time remains.Now, after 20 years living in Boston, Mary is finally returning to that suburb in a professional capacity. Her past, her present, and her future are about to collide. And maybe, just maybe, with a little luck, Mary will find redemption.A Little Luck is very different from this author’s last book, Elena Knows. If truth be told, I loved both of them, but in different ways. Claudia Pineiro knows how to channel the human condition. In both books, the reader is almost claustrophobically placed within the tight confines of a person living with horrendous emotional pain.The story here is so intensely personal that it feels as if the reader has encountered a friend engulfed with the worst kind of pain and is powerless to do anything but pay witness. It will be up to each reader to judge whether Mary deserves forgiveness. My answer was an unqualified “yes”, given the back story that unfolds. Mary’s answer is mostly “no.”This raw, elegantly written novel, about the power of guilt and redemption and the unselfishness of maternal love, is spellbinding in its grasp of the reader.

Did he do it? The least interesting question anyone could possibly ask.”At its core, the case comes down to a simple question: did Farquharson suffer from cough syncope while driving – losing consciousness and driving his car, with his sons in the front and back seats into a watery grave? Or was this a heinous act of revenge against his wife, Cindy Gambino, who initiated the divorce and was now in love with another man?The front-row intimacy of the trial – and the access to Garner’s private thoughts – provides the reader with a particularly chilling look into the twists and turns of a notorious Australian trial case. As the boundaries between journalist and participant begin to slip away, so does the reader’s own objectivity.We want to believe very much that Farquharson – resplendent in his ordinariness – could never, ever, willfully kill his three sons, the youngest of whom is still feeding on breast milk. Evil deeds like that come from people who and psychopaths, and Farquharson presents himself as small, stumpy, and barely capable. And yet. And yet. The prosecutor’s depiction of him as angry, vengeful, and self-involved keeps becoming more real.Ms. Gartner combines court dynamics, delicate legal points, flashbacks to an unbearably heartbreaking night, witness testimonies, and her own reactions together.

If you’re at the bottom of the food chain you can’t do anything about it, and if you’re at the top, well, you can’t do anything about that either. It’s what you’re born into.”This pitch-perfect book – so riveting that it’s hard to set it down for very long – is mostly set in a Mrs. Price’s class in Catholic primary school in 1984. Justine, an epileptic whose mother recently died from breast cancer, is her favored student, the quintessential teacher’s “pet.”She, and all her friends, including her best friend Amy Fong, are in thrall of Mrs. Price, who looks like a movie star. Justine feels honored when she is asked to clean the blackboard dusters and make trips in her stead to the pharmacy, to pick up some mysterious brown pills. When Mrs. Price expresses interest in her widowed father, she couldn’t be happier.But there’s tension that lurks right beneath the surface. Underneath her sugary words and her indoctrination of her students into adulthood, Mrs. Price may not be all she appears to be. In fact, this book is redolent with manipulation, misogyny, and racism, clearly portraying the objectification of young women.These girls are not kind, regularly ranking each other’s attractiveness, ostracizing the weaker ones, and even helping dress and put make-up on their teacher (at least, the “pets” do.) Early on, Mrs. Price nails Justine as someone who is more like her than Justine thinks. And in ways, she might be. She, too, gradually reveals herself as an unreliable narrator and someone who wants very much to fit in and be popular and admired. When a thief begins to steal many of the student’s cherished belongings, things get a lot more suspenseful and complicated.There are a few missteps: a controversial topic is raised that might not be necessary for the book’s forward propulsion. And some interspersed scenes set in Justine’s father’s dementia home in 2014 that (for this reader) wrapped things up a little too neatly. For me, those don’t subtract from the gripping suspense that rises a notch with every successive scene.

Now I lived in your world. It was small.”Any woman who is contemplating becoming a mother may well gulp with apprehension after finishing Soldier Sailor. This is not the kind of book that glorifies motherhood or washes over the utter exhaustion and erasing of self during those relentless first several months. Claire Kilroy leaves no holds barred. As her hapless mother (aptly called Soldier) soldiers on, every nightmare scenario is brought to the spotlight: the huge bump that appears on the little boy’s head when he bangs it with frustration, his disappearance in Ikea while they’re shopping for his “big boy bed”, the swing that almost crashes into his fragile head at the playground, the mano-a-mano when he refuses to take his medicine when he’s burning with fever.All the while he’s being sheltered and loved madly by a mother who is sleep-deprived and think-deprived and probably self-deprived, a shadow of the fully- actualized woman she once was. And her husband? He’s cartoonishly uninvolved, sending smiley emojis when she sends him a photo, minimizing everything she’s doing, believing that she is in charge of their son while he dedicates himself to a higher cause: his “important” job.This is a love story (staring with “Well. Sailor. Here we are once more, you and me in one another’s arms. The Earth rotates beneath us and all is well, for now”). It’s also a sort of horror story that turns once again into a love story that dissolves into a horror story and so on. The love here is intense and overpowering and real…but so are the detours into panic and real fear and powerlessness.And the voice, have I mentioned the voice? It’s an urgent voice, a resentment-fueled voice, and sometimes, an unexpectedly laugh-out-loud wry voice. It’s a voice that tackles the double standards and the all-consuming role of motherhood and sometimes, it’s an unreliable voice. But it never ceases to be an authentic voice that runs the gamut between humor and devastation.

In Somebody’s Fool, he triumphantly returns to the place where it all began, North Bath in upstate New York – this time a decade after the passing of his main character, Donald “Sully” Sullivan.And oh, what a homecoming it is! The best compliment I can give this book is I was absorbed every minute I was reading it and sad when it ended and I had to say goodbye to these characters again.When the book begins, North Bath is in sorry state. It’s about to be annexed to its more bustling and vibrant neighbor, Schuyler Springs. Sully’s ghost (not literally) permeates the town and its inhabitants, who often stop and wonder, “What would Sully do?” And then the thread of the plot emerges – a hanging body is discovered at the deserted San Souci hotel.I say “the thread of a plot” because solving this mystery is less important than the themes at play – how the sins (and sometimes, the redemptions) of the parent travel down to affect the offspring, how those who seem down-and-out can claw their way back, and how the signals that might have saved some of them never makes it through the noise.The heart of the novel is former Chief of Police Douglas Raymer, who is living apart from his love, Charice, who is the first Black woman to hold his former title. He desperately wants her back, but there’s her twin brother, Jerome, who is OCD and quirky, to contend with. The dialogue between Raymer and Jerome about false equivalences, Black and white time, and the evolutionary purpose of plumage is…well, let me settle on the word “brilliant.” Then there’s Peter, Sully’s son, who has long been estranged from his own son, Thomas. Once upon a time he left with his older son, Will, leaving Thomas and his brother Andrew to the vagaries of his mercurial ex-wife. Now Thomas is passing through – and that leads to a whole subplot on bad vs. good cops, bad vs. good parents, and the thorny complication of relationships. Add in Sully’s former lover, Ruth, and her own daughter and granddaughter (who happens to hold an unrequited crush on Peter’s son Will) and this novel quickly catches fire.This is flat-out a wonderful book, one that engrossed me from start to finish.

The opening story – from which the title is derived – presents a young and worshipful philosophy student, K., who is obsessed with earning the good favor of her idealized mentor. The premise of the story – indeed, the collection – is laid out: “In game theory, a zero-sum game is one in which there is a winner and there is a loser and the spoils go to the winner and nothing to the loser.” K’s interpretation of the game is just delicious, particularly after she meets her mentor’s decidedly un-worshipful young daughter.Mr. Stickum – the next story – is everyone’s favorite revenge tale. A group of high school girls decide to punish their community's sexual predators by running ads that lead to their ensnarement on a flypaper contraption. JCO writes: “For always it is expected of girls, as of adult women, that we will be loving, forgiving, merciful. But Mr. Stickum has taught us that is a zero-sum game.” The longest story in this collection is The Suicide, about a brilliant and famous writer with an adoring young wife, who is fixated on suicide. He is unable to tolerate her slavishness, yet there is something about it that simultaneously titillates and repels him. The character, who is reportedly based on a fictionalized David Foster Wallace, is dark and sometimes funny. For example, the writer obsesses about his legacy: might some people think he was drawn to suicide as a result of reading a bad ?Other stories – The Cold, about a mother who has suffered a recent miscarriage, or “Lovesick”, focusing on a woman who confides to a former lover that she is receiving murderous threats from an unknown caller, aren’t quite as compelling.

That is the overriding mantra of John Coe’s latest book, which tells a nation’s story through generations of the same family. It’s ambitious, it’s clever, and it works! Wet in the southwest side of Birmingham, Bourneville was designed to house chocolate factory workers. It focuses foremost on Mary, who is a child during VE day, and overwhelmed by the patriotism and the joyousness of triumphing over the Germans.She will have three sons and two of them will have children and THOSE children will have children and, in the meantime, things will inexorably change. Even here in the former colonies, the seven events that shape this novel – VE Day, Queen Elizabeth’s coronation, the World Cup Final, the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales, the wedding of Charles and Diana, Diana’s funeral, and the 75th anniversary of VE Day – spark emotions.Jonathan Coe never gives his characters short shrift. Despite the 75-year time span and the large cast of characters, the book is eminently readable and defines characters through the events they lived through. Particularly insightful is when one of the younger characters, with pretensions of becoming a world-famous author, slams into reality when his glossy portrayal of Wales collides with the truth of Britain’s treatment of it.In addition to Wales nationalism, Bourneville touches on wartime nostalgia, the launch of the Austin Metro, the worshipping of James Bond, the so-called “chocolate wars” (named because Britain’s chocolate was made with too much vegetable oil), the rise of a journalistic buffoon known as “Boris”, the outpouring of love for the “people’s princess”, and more. Add to that some insightful glimpses into nationalism (especially when it goes awry), class mobility, and economic and social change.Predictably, the family must confront interracial marriage and the coming out of a key family member. Jonathan Coe handles these delicate issues more adroitly than many other authors. Although there is – and should be – outrage associated with lack of inclusiveness, Coe wisely doesn’t make these elements the core of the novel. His focus is how a country shapes its people and how a people shape their country. My interest never lagged through the 400 pages of Bournville.

It’s a poignant meditation on loss, an absurdist zombie story, an inventive twist on the traditional road trip journey, a philosophical deep dive into the story of human life, and a comedic look at what communication is like between the living and the dying (or the already dead).Leave it to Lorrie Moore to accomplish all this in less than 200 pages.The opening plunges the reader into the 1870s as a boarding house owner writes to her sister about a handsome Confederate Shakespearian actor – who comes from a family of actors – who tells her he desires “that we be better strangers.” Hmmmm…The novel shift suddenly to a Bronx hospice, where a history teacher, Finn, with a penchant for conspiracy theories is at the bedside of his much-loved brother, Max. Max is about to die, and Finn’s grief is palpable. It turns out this scene is prologue to the thrust of the novel: the road trip with Finn’s ex-girlfriend Lily, a depressive therapy clown, who deliberately drowned herself in the shower. Through this journey, Lorrie Moore showcases the word play for which she is well known: dark humor combined with farcical one-liners and witticisms . As Lily decomposes, so does the blurry lines between the real and the unreal and even the living and the dead.By the end of the book I faced my own question: did I love it or did I admire it? At first, I thought I was coming down on the side of ""admiration"", but the mediations on loss and grief (Death...had the black cape, he fine print, and the magic tricks.

Both Manuel and Marco were scions of upstanding Italian families and the victim, Luca Varani, was the adopted son of a merchant. When the murder occurred, the story sent shock waves up and down Italy. While the story is true, it is far from a recap of the facts. Nicola Lagioia sets his lens higher, panning it out to the shadiest parts of Rome, the most complex recesses of the human psyche, and the murkiest subjects that confront all of us today: class distinctions, drug abuse, sexual and gender confusion, narcissism and deceit.What was this senseless and vicious murder really all about? What brought Manuel, a man who claimed to be heterosexual with “daddy issues”, and Marco, a cross-dressing, intelligent, and incredibly manipulative man together? Was this a Frankenstein story (with Marco in the role of Victor Frankenstein and Manuel as the Creature?) Was it Mickey Mouse and the Sorcerer’s Apprentice? Or a classic horror story of “the monsters within”, that take over the minds of young men while they are sleeping? Did the victim’s meekness and unproved homophobia trigger something in a country where the aggression is a guarantee of survival? Or were Manuel and Marco just bad seeds, with evil waiting to sprout forth?Nicola Lagioia courageously explores all of this, and fearlessly plunges into his own psyche. Most of us, he postulates, have put ourselves in the place of the victim – what if it were to happen to us? But few have ever transposed themselves with the murderer. The author s his own past and also looks unsparingly at the city he calls home: its anarchy, breakdown, and neglect, all in the name of freedom (which may very well be another word for disaster). What happens, he wonders, to those who wouldn’t or couldn’t stop the downward cycle, those who sunk I the shadow and continued to go down the steps?Devastating and at the same time, illuminating, The City of the Living is nothing less than an investigation into the very nature of humanity.

Tessa Hadley’s intensely detailed portraits of the landscapes and venues that her characters occupy will appeal to some but not to all. And, like just about any good short story collection, there are tales that stand out. Dodo’s Lament struck a chord, highlighting a chance meeting between a “tall, anxious, distinctive” woman in her mid-thirties and the husband she had thrown over years ago. He has now remarried and is eager to give her a glimpse of his now successful life. It is not until the end of the story that we gain the opportunity to discover what the meeting has meant to him.My Mother’s Wedding introduces us to a mum who “didn’t do anything ordinary” and is about to embark on a marriage with a much younger man. Drama surrounds the wedding, but things suddenly change when an accident places the relationship between mother, daughter, and soon-to-be-stepfather in a different perspective.Old Friends gives new meaning to a relationship triangle: a very imperfect but charismatic man who dies prematurely, his best friend who has fallen in love with the man’s wife, and the wife who has decidedly muddled feelings. And one of my favorites, Funny Little Snake, focuses on a young second wife whose dealings with her husband’s detached and odd young daughter and his narcissistic ex-wife shifts and changes as the reality of the situation becomes evident.These are fine stories from a fine writer.

Daniel Mason has created a masterwork with North Wood. If he doesn’t write another word in his life – and that would be a crying shame – his reputation is sealed with this marvel of a book. It’s bound to win the next Pulitzer and more importantly, the hearts of many readers like me.If I sound overly enthusiastic, it’s because I truly am. I read this elegiac and sui generis novel with mounting awe and an abundance of admiration. The handful of pages about a lusty beetle is in itself worth the price of admission.I can see my literary friends scratching their heads and asking, “Yes, but what’s this novel about? A lusty BEETLE? The power of nature and how it heals us? A pathologically jealous sibling? A mass murder? A deep dive into psychiatric disorders? A story of unrequited and society-shunned love? A GHOST story?” My answer to all the above would be “yes” but that barely scratches the surface of things.If I had to sum up this book with one word, that word would be “connection.” Daniel Mason strips bare the tenuous connection between transient characters – those who once existed, do exist, and will continue to exist – within a setting that endures and is ever-changing. As one of the characters says about the boundaries that separate us, “One believes the world is enchanted or one does not.”By the end of the book, it’s hard not to believe that there is enchantment at work in the world. As Shakespeare wrote, “All the world’s a stage”, and in Daniel Mason’s staging, the cycle of the seasons, the scents and sounds, the birds and mountain lions and beetles all have their place as humankind too, acts out its own dramas.I haven’t yet addressed the prose. The author is like a magician, starting off by channeling Hawthorne and then quickly cycling through everything from old letter and medical case notes to poetry and mystery magazines. Moreover, no matter what voice he is adapting, he does it so well that the world melts away.If you just read one book this year, make sure this is the one.

It’s a book about – no surprise! – a trio of friends: Thora, a clever and wealthy young woman whose family has taken heat from its connections with arm dealers…August, a dreamy art school lad who has known her for what feels like forever, and Hugo, who is temporarily living with Thora’s parents in Stockholm as their lodger as he studies political science. Hugo tries to decipher the unwritten rules about “how things were done” and feels like an outsider – even more so when Thora and August connect. But years later, at the opening of the book, he receives an unexpected visit in New York – where he now lives from their now grown-up daughter.Some of The Trio is not about what is said but what is left unsaid. Little things (a word, a look, an event) can trigger larger emotions. Silences occur for seemingly no reason. This is, at its core, a novel about relationships, particularly that of two distinctly different characters and complicated by a man who views himself as an outsider.

The cover – a Cape Cod beach setting – and the description of a complicated family with secrets to share reminded me of many others with similar plotting that always appear in the early months of summer.But I read the first few pages and by the time I completed the first chapter, there was no way I was coming up for air. This book is darn good and has a depth to it and psychological insights that I did not anticipate. I devoured Little Monsters and I believe it is going to be one of those rare books that both literary readers and escapist readers can equally enjoy.The book begins with the impending retirement and 70th birthday of a famed oceanographer, Adam Gardner, coming to grips with the realization that at the end of the day, our relevance in the world is not what we believed it to be in youth. After the untimely death of his wife, he raised two children – Ken and Abby – by himself, and even though he was a remote father, both of them have displayed great promise in their fields. He also has a third child, Steph, of whom he is unaware. These are the primary narrators of this book.But drill down a little and there are unresolved traumas that must be healed and secrets that must come out. These fully-realized characters are each on the cusp of singing their own songs – much like the whales that Adam studies – and grasping control of their own destinies. The writing is confident with sharp narrative tension and sharply observed episodes that lead to growth and understanding as the book proceeds. In particular, therapy sessions between Ken and his psychoanalyst, George, are beautifully illuminated.With the Cape Cod setting in the background and the last months of national innocence before a sociopathic reality star claims the presidency, this is a snapshot of a place and a time and most of all, of a family that we come to know very well.

No other event has been so integral in testing our sense of identity -- who we are, what we are looking for, and what is really important in our lives.Now, three years later, many writers are striving to relay how this pivotal time that so transformed us. But none so far, in my opinion, are as successful as Michael Cunningham as he elegantly spotlights a family on April 5th during three momentous and sequential years: 2019, 2020, and 2021.The book begins in 2019 and introduces us to Dan and Isabel, a couple whose foundation is slowly cracking. The glue that helps hold them together is Isabel’s younger gay brother, Robbie, who will soon move out of their attic, and in the meantime, counts the ""likes"" received for his alluring online avatar. Both Dan and Isabel love Robbie in their own complex way and recognize the dynamics of their own relationship will shift when he leaves. Their two sensitive children, Nathan and Violet, who sense, but are not fully aware, of Robbie's imminent departure, and are slowly emerging into the people they will eventually become.Peripherally, Dan’s brother Garth is struggling to define the meaning of fatherhood. He agreed to be a sperm donor for his gay female friend, Chess. Now the baby is here, and to his surprise, he has developed strong feelings, not only for the little boy, but for Chess herself. A year later, the pandemic has been introduced into this petri dish, with all the family in lockdown minus one: Robbie, who is stranded in Iceland, alone with his Instagram creation. As cracks deepen, family members must get real and confront the personal avatars -- the false sense of identity that they've been sending out into the world. By the time 2021 rolls in, each character will be a little older and a little wiser as they face different reality and learn what it means to forge a new path. Michael Cunningham’s new book is well worth the 10-year rate. It’s beautifully crafted, exquisitely written, and mature with insights as he explores what it means to come home to oneself.

The essay gutted me; I have rarely read anything so powerful. Within the essay, she writes this: “Even in a pandemic, even in grief, I found myself commanded to amplify the voices of the dead that sing to me, from their boat to my boat, on the sea of time.”This may be a strange way to start a  on this courageous author’s new book, Let Us Descend. But I cannot help but believe that the roots of this book grew from that horrible time when literally and figuratively, none of us could breathe – least of all the families who knew that in America, Black lives have the same value as a plow horse or a grizzled donkey.As readers might expect, Let Us Descend is powerful. Truth-telling. Courageous. Bold. So bold, in fact, that it will likely be banned in Florida and Texas, but isn’t that the point? To proclaim, loudly and clearly, that slavery was and remains the original sin and we should never, ever forget what humans did to fellow humans – with cruelty and with impunity? Here she does indeed amplify the voices of those who were forced to undergo a Dante’s Inferno of tragedy, in the person of young Annis, who is sold south by her white sire. Nothing is held back from her harrowing journey from the rice fields of North Carolina to the slave market of New Orleans and the punishing sugar plantation. One wonders how those in Annis’ place could bear and endure the punishments inflicted on them – the ropes and chains, the continual hunger and thirst, the enforced march, the exposure to the elements, the lashings and rapes, the reduction of fellow human beings to little more than cattle. How did Annis and others retain their sense of self and their sense of hope when day in and day out, both were constantly negated? To understand how, Jesmyn Ward introduces the element of magical realism, in the form of her African warrior grandmother, who Annis simultaneously embraces and rejects in her darkest hours. Through her journey, she discovers that the world is filled with spirits –those who nurture and give and those who manipulate and take – and she becomes familiar with both kinds. Does the magical realism work? It will depend on the reader. To me, I admired more than loved the technique, and felt it distanced me more from the narrative. For that reason, it was not a five-star for me. Still, I felt as if I were reading something remarkable and for that reason, I urge others to walk south with Annis.

She’d say you got to abide with your darkness as if it were a scared child that wakes up in the middle of the night and needs to be walked back to bed…You got to walk the darkness down.”Marlene and Les reside in a world of hurt. They are married, but they just can’t get it right and their marriage is dimmed with failures of understanding and kindness. Their daughter, Angie, died years ago and although it takes us some time to know the circumstances, we do know that neither of them has been able to surmount the unthinkable loss.Isolated in every way possible – by location and by choice – each of them struggles to find ways to dull the pain. Les is part of the crew of a fishing boat , where he can lose himself in the punishing scalloping work and self-annihilating exhaustion. There he forms his own family of sort with other damaged men who are referred to only by their nicknames. (Les is called “Stray” and others are John Wayne, Booby, Monk Man and so forth.) And Marlene? During the lengthy times when Les is gone, she trolls the Villas, and picks up young prostitutes, whom she takes home and tends to and feeds. One of them is Josie, a teenager who may be fulfilling Marlene’s fantasies of a lost daughter. Both Les and Marlene strive to redefine the word “family.”Les and Marlene are two desperate loners who should have drifted from each other almost from the start, but Daniel Magariel brilliantly creates a kind of love story – two people who, at their core, love each other but don’t know how to show it. In doing so, he creates something quite unique. The writing is luminous, often poignant and in some spots, unexpectedly witty. I’ve never been on a fishing boat, but the authenticity of the scenes placed me right there.At its core, this is a book about survival against all odds.

That’s the case with Shannon Bowring’s debut book.I took a chance on it, mainly because I’ve rarely been disappointed with books I’ve chosen from Europa. And right from the first few pages, to paraphrase the author, I kept moving forward, slowly and steadily, straight into the heart of Dalton.Dalton, in Northern Maine, is the kind of town in which everyone keeps secrets – and for that matter, tries to respect others’ secrets. And it’s also the kind of town where, sooner or later, each person’s life will impact others.These characters are real as can be: two married women who are romantically linked while their husbands adapt, and the town pretends not to see. An overweight teenage boy, struggling with his own sexuality, who reluctantly has to don the mantle of unlikely hero. A young wife with an abusive husband who tries to hide her scars – physically and mentally. And, at the heart of the novel, a young husband who has loved his wife since the second grade and is powerless to help her as she struggles with postpartum depression.Despite the trauma – infidelity, abuse, depression – there is a resilience in these characters and a belief on the part of the reader that life’s obstacles can and will eventually be overcome. In other words, the characters’ struggles seem real and Dalton itself holds the characters together and shapes them to withstand the pain that life inevitably brings and survive.

But it is also an apt summary for the author’s trilogy, which began with The Signal Flame, continued to The Sojourn, and ends up here, with the third and final novel.For those who have read the first two novels, it is comforting to relax into Andrew Krivak’s splendid, finely crafted prose. His writing is so evocative that it’s easy to envision every scene he so masterfully creates. For the sheer joy of the written word, Mr. Krivak is a writer who deserves a wide readership.It is, in every sense of the word, a continuation, as we see the effects of these endless wars on Bexhet, who enlists in World War II, and later, one of his sons Samuel, who is imprisoned – both physically and psychologically – in Vietnam, and later, his own son Burne, an Annapolis graduate called to Iraq. Each is tested by his own demons and each draws his own battlefields. And in a tradition that dates back to Odysseus, each soldier must navigate his own complicated homecoming.And so, what is this final novel about? It’s about the integration between nobility and cowardness, which, as it turns out, isn’t as simple as it sounds. Sometimes, the world (or your own prescribed world) might see your actions one way when in fact, the opposite is true. There is usually a fine line between guilt and justification, truth and mythology, conflicts and healing, love and what passes for love. But one thing that remains constant during all these times is the need for forgiveness and redemption.The title itself is taken from the prophet Joel, who compares a plague of locusts that come to devour the land to war horses, and it promises a return to what was lost. And as it is written, shall the promise be kept. We all read for different reasons and for me, the novel shines when it the family members are front and center. One scene surrounding Sam’s own homecoming left me gasping for air. The war episodes are brilliantly portrayed, but maybe I have lived a little too long to read about this universal senselessness that robs young men (and women) of their lives and peace of mind. Having made this subjective statement, I believe Like the Appearance of Horses – which can be read as a standalone or more fulfilling, as the capstone of a powerful trilogy – is a book that should not be passed up.

In 2010, Tom Rachman burst upon the literary scene with his debut novel, The Imperfectionists. It was an incandescent book of interlocking stories featuring the private lives of quirky reporters, editors, and executives. Gradually, the stories deepen and complement each other.Tom Rachman – and all of us –have aged, and so have his characters. We are introduced on the first page to Dora Frenhofer, a Dutch-born novelist of some (but not a lot) of regard, who is becoming increasingly aware she is losing her mind. Does she have one more book within her? Can she bring it to fruition before she is unable to finish?The resulting chapters position Dora as a sort of Scheherazade, who is weaving tales to stay alive. We know from the chapter headings that she will write about her brother, her daughter, her former lover, her last friend, and even the deliveryman who stood at her doorstep during the lock-down year of COVID.This book, though, is marginally about the fully realized characters. It is mostly about the stories we create and how we maintain sanity when life doesn’t go our way. It’s about what we remember and what we forget and how we choose to position our personal stories. It’s about making things up and letting things go. And it has a last chapter ending that will blow your mind, and which puts everything in perspective.The book, like The Imperfectionists, also casts a wry look at the business of writing and attempting to stay ethical in a world that’s spinning out of control. One chapter – A Writer from the Festival – is about a literary author with marginal sales who has just written a formulaic best seller. As he awaits the results of what he suspects will be a bidding war, he attends a writer’s conference. I laughed, I winced, and I ached for him. Another, about a marginalized non-white young man who had endured too much in life, is editing for a whacky company with no scruples, that spins far-out conspiracy theories. Tom Rachman expertly captures our times.This meta-fiction book – at times wry and sardonic, at times wrenchingly poignant – was a sheer delight to read.

Miracle Creek was an out-of-the-gate winner, with complex characters, an autistic child, a trial with overwhelmingly circumstantial evidence, and an array of secrets that lead to failed marriages and misunderstandings.So let’s get this out of the way very quickly. Happiness Falls is not Miracle Creek. The first was propulsive and this one is more contemplative. It, too, deals with a child with special needs and the secrets we keep. But it is an even more ambitious book, and it won’t be for everyone. Yet, it is rife with its own rewards and after finishing it, I find myself constantly thinking of it and talking about its key points with others.At its most elemental level, the book is about a father who doesn’t come home one day after leaving that morning with his younger son Eugene to visit a park with high cliffs and raging waters. The son is nonverbal and has Angelman’s Syndrome – motor planning difficulties masked with a smile. When he arrives home, he has blood under his nails and jumps and screams for hours, trying to calm down. His older twins (son and daughter) and wife are forced to protect Eugene while trying to figure out the father’s whereabouts. What happened to the father? Did the boy inadvertently or intentionally harm him? Or is there another explanation?But that plot description just skims the surface. Angie Kim layers her novel with a number of compelling subplots. How do non-speakers overcome the erroneous presumption that they are severely intellectually disabled? Does lack of verbal communication equate to intelligence? (The answer is an absolute “no.”) The father, it turns out, is obsessed with discovering the “Happiness Quotient” – how to measure happiness and how to achieve it. Did that contribute to his disappearance? There are totally intriguing forays into how to establish a happiness baseline, how heuristics figures into our behaviors, whether cosmic consciousness comes into play, and much more. This is a book that educates as well as engages and will change your mind about what it truly means to be happy and what we need to do to fully understand and embrace those with special needs.It is riveting, thought-provoking, contemplative, and filled with big ideas and relatable characters.

But Alina Bronsky breathes so much life into it that we can’t help but empathize with Walter Schmidt, a curmudgeon if there ever were one, and his denial that his wife, Barbara, is in the process of dying.What isn’t said is every bit as poignant as what is revealed. We know that Walter is the epitome of an authoritarian German, stamping out all the Russian vestiges of his frailer wife. Her favorite comfort foods are banned, and her Russian accent and habits are carefully replaced. And then one day, decades into the marriage, he finds Barbara on the floor and bleeding from a head wound. Suddenly, Walter’s carefully controlled world is no longer working.Poor Walter can’t even cook an egg or figure out the coffee machine. His two adult children are mostly fed up with him and his stubbornness. There appears to be a dark underside to his life with Barbara, but we’re not quite sure what it is. The one thing we are sure of is that Walter depends on and loves his wife but does not have the ability to express it. His life falls into a pattern of denial: Barbara isn’t dying. Of course she’s not – even though everyone in the town knows she is, and the evidence is right before his eyes.As Walter discovers Barbara’s favorite online chef and becomes part of his Facebook community to learn how to cook Barbara’s favorite recipes, we see the power of resilience in action. As Walter begins to reinvent himself and question some of his most deeply-held “truths”, his world begins to expand – despite himself.

We discover early on that Laura elects to get her tubes tied rather than give into societal expectations. The thought of having her biological instincts overcome her reason and put her “real life” into grave danger is anathema to her. Her friend, Alina, goes in precisely the opposite direction, joining the hordes of women who choose motherhood. (Note to readers: whatever you do, do NOT read the back of the book blurb. It contains a massive spoiler that is not revealed until half-way through the book).We do know early on that Alina’s baby carries a very rare birth defect and is not expected to live. We also know that Laura, who observes and occasionally interacts with Alina, has developed her own attachment with her next-door neighbor’s unruly child. And what do we make of all this?While I would prefer to let readers discover for themselves, the overriding theme is that love arrives in the most unexpected of ways, and that everything can change at any point. There is really no way to control or understand the ramifications of making one choice or the other and views are bound to consistently be put to the test. How we think we will react – what we think will transpire – simply happens. And sometimes, complications are thrown our way that we can never envision.The confident prose is subtle, nuanced, filled with complexity, and masterfully crafted, thanks in part to the seamless translation of Rosalind Harvey.

Courage is the root of change—and change is what we’re chemically designed to do. So when you wake up tomorrow, make this pledge. No more holding yourself back. No more subscribing to others’ opinions of what you can and cannot achieve.”Chemistry is a book with a message and that message is hammered home from the very first pages. The main character, Elizabeth Zott, is a scientist in the 1950s, when women scientists were basically non-existent. After almost getting raped by her boss at her last job, she ends up at Hastings Research Institute and falls in love with Calvin Evans, the damaged Nobel-Prize nominated star of the Institute – but she does not want to marry him or compromise her own work integrity.In the background, I continually could hear Helen Redding’s song: “I am woman, hear me roar.”I, too, am a “career woman.” I was a Vice President at an ad agency when I was only in my mid-30s. I’ve run my own business. And yes, I know that sexism does exist. But the arc of this book – even though I realize it’s meant to be comic – defied the imagination.Elizabeth’s field – at a tender young age – is abiogenesis (the original evolution of life from inorganic or inanimate substances), which, of course, is complex enough that many scientists in their later years are still coming to grasp with it. She is also an expert on food science, which shows up in a major plot line later in the book. Oh, and she’s an excellent rower, able to take on Seat 2 after a rather brief introduction to the sport. And, she has a young daughter who is reading literary classics at age four and a dog who understands 931 words. Just your average, run-of-the-mill intelligent woman.All the men she runs across (except for Calvin) are chauvinistic bastards who only want to rape or demean her or plagiarize from her because, of course, in her 20s, she knows everything. Most every woman wants to take her down a few pegs. She is very beautiful though – an irony in itself because it implies that unless a woman is beautiful, her chances are even more next to nil). So, as we find out from the book jacket, she becomes the host of America’s most popular cooking show, Supper at Six. There, she introduces the science of chemistry into everyday cooking.So, this is in the 50s. The unlikeliness of the “average housewife”, who is harried and overworked, making this show a hit (the chemistry she sprouts is way beyond the head of someone who is not into science and who is likely working from family recipes) is – well, mind-boggling. Her blunt approach, her atheism (in the era of McCarthy) and her feminism would surely have made this show DOA.But it doesn’t. She becomes a super-star (in addition to all her other attributes). Yes, I realize this is supposed to be an outsized “laugh out loud” comedy. But I just didn’t buy it. Having said that, Bonnie Garmus is a good writer and I was invested enough in the book that I wanted to read on and finish it. Still, I couldn’t help but think I was being spoon-fed a “you are woman – you are strong – you can do whatever you want” diatribe. I believe I can – but I couldn’t help but feel the agenda.

To the right of the photo is a French stamp, placed upside down.The woman is Neomie Rabinovitch, the aunt of the author, a brilliant and talented young woman who, at 19, had ambitions similar to Anne Frank. She, her brother Jacques, and soon after, their parents would be savagely rounded up, subjected to the most inhumane treatment, and callously left to die in the Nazi concentration camps. Fortunately, her niece, whose grandmother Myriam was the only one to escape their fate, does not allow her to fade into obscurity. She bears witness. And in doing so, she creates a masterwork that will bring tears to anyone who truly has a heart.Right from the start, we know that Anne’s chain-smoking mother received a touristy postcard with a photo of the Opera Garnier on the cover and four names, written as a list: Ephraim, Emma, Noemie, Jacques. The postcard was mailed in the early 1990s, decades after the genocide. Who sent it? And why was it sent?The resultant quest, written somewhat like a detective story, begins with a straightforward narrative of the family of four who were murdered at Auschwitz in 1941 – a loving, intelligent family with so much potential it made me ache to think of how wantonly it was snuffed out. We have, unfortunately, hear stories like this before: after all six million Jews were murdered in monstrous fashion.But then, the narrative begins to veer towards more unfamiliar territory. As the author’s mother Lelia says, “The characters in this story are only shadows now. There’s no one left who can describe their lives in exact detail.” After doing an admirable job of filling in those shadows, Ann Berest questions what it is like to be a Jewish child without a synagogue – a non-observant Jew who still feels Jewish right down to her bones. As someone who can claim that status, I will say that the reflection, examination, and deeper question of that word whose definition remains elusive (“What does it mean to wonder what it means to be Jewish?”) may be the most poignant and yes, authentic, that I have ever read.The Postcard, at its core, is about why it’s important to never forget and to continue to tell the most unsettling stories. As Anne Berest reveals, the forces of hate that elevated evil to a whole new level were and remain at work after the Holocaust – in the deeply-ingrained anti-Semitism of too many of the French population and even today, as it raises its ugly head over and over.Surely this will be my best book of 2023.

Narrator Martin Neumann (a little play on words here) discovers that his landlord, the legendary Robert Ableson (perhaps another play on words?), a maverick of liberal causes, died years ago but is now a very fit and spry man in his 90s. The years have gone by and he’s not particularly “woke”, but his heart is in the right place.The thing is, this news would shake up everything in real life. It would not be just another news story. But Elliott Ackerman who obviously is a Civil War scholar, has another angle in mind. As a historian and professor, his focus is on the great compromise –a cultural coming together of north and south following the disruptive Civil War. His interest is in determining whether nuance and compromise are even possible today, when compromise is out of favor. For some reason I’m not sure I understand, all this is going on during a Gore administration (prosecutors found the “smoking gun” in the Lewinsky affair, Clinton was tossed out, Gore plans to pardon him, and George W., a more practiced politician, is threatening to undo all of Gore’s scientific progress). My question is whether that small but highly significant bend in history is needed. It could have easily stood by itself without revisionist history. In addition, a petition to remove a Confederate monument and the debates that follow seem to have been addressed in many public forums.Although there is an interesting premise at work here, my belief is that the very possibility of vanquishing death (and the hustle to be one of the test subjects) would far override the theme Mr. Ackerman chooses to rest upon: how the future we must embrace must first focus on our shared history and who is affected by it.

But then Mira chances across Robert Lemonine, a cartoonish billionaire who is ready to hand over $100,000 to this group for a nefarious reason of his own (and the fact that Mira is attractive, and intriguing also doesn’t hurt). The land in question is owned by a Kiwi pest-control empire farmer who gladly is willing to turn the property over to Lemoine as a result of a recent earthquake.Yet I couldn’t help but feel that this time, Eleanor Catton, an excellent writer, was a little too ambitious for her own goals. As a character-based reader, I had to ask myself: is being a billionaire necessarily “bad”? It’s all too easy to paint this kind of caricature, but Robert Lemonine is over the top – secretive, greedy, full of himself, and dare I add, evil? There were many actions he took – to mention them would create spoilers – that seemed at odds with the “smarts” of a consummate businessman who carefully examines all contingencies. And was Mira THAT appealing to him that he was willing to use Birnam Woods to advance his plan?I also felt as if I were reading two separate books. The entire first half is slow to gain steam with a drill down look at the characters and their philosophical motivations. I was waiting for lift-off and I got it in the second half of the book, which suddenly claims thriller, or at the very least, cinematic territory. Was I interested? Oh, yes. But in the grand scheme of things, was the plot line fully plausible? In more than a few instances, I wanted to say, “Wait! Limonine wouldn’t do that, given what we know about him.” It’s certainly a good book, with a fair share of political and philosophical rants, drones and surveillance, characters we can easily imagine making it to the big screen, and a Hollywood type ending.

I read it with a growing sense of marvel.IF there’s a common theme that runs through most, if not all, of these 15 stories, it can be summed up in a line from his penultimate story, Jimena: “Sometimes I find myself so hard to hold on to that idea of who I used to be, you know? It’s painful to let that go.” These are characters who are in the process of experiencing a loss, a disappearance, a need, a defeat, a metamorphosis from a younger self. And each of them is so real you can swear you know them.In the first story, Austin, a married couple with a young child meet up with a group of old friends who are almost frozen in time. Home early, the husband reflects on how he feels adrift and somehow disconnected with things. Bumps in the night bother him now. As he hears young people shouting outside, he wonders, “When did I become the person who listened to such sounds ant not the person who made them?In Bees, a man and his young daughter are beset by bees that swarm the back fence of their yard, off the laundry room window. But he has scarier things to think about: his wife has been living part of the time in her own apartment, dealing with depression and dysfunction. He keeps hanging on, even as he feels as if she’s uncovered a shameful secret: “that I was attracted to the part of her that scared me the most.’In Silhouettes, a professor who was denied tenure believes his friend was the one who cast the defining vote against him, and the once strong friendship veers into disturbing territory. During one last dinner at his friend’s home, he recognizes that it will be the last time they see each other. And in Breathe, one of my favorites, a father of a young son endures one imperfect moment and realizes that the relationship with the boy might be forever altered.I could literally choose any of these stories to demonstrate the aching moments that uncover our truest emotions and force us to reevaluate how we’re living our lives and what really matters to us.

It’s hard to summon words to convey how resonant and remarkable this book is.The reader is instantly plunged into Trinidad in the 1940s and the inexplicable disappearance of wealthy landowner Dalton Changoor. His wife Marlee, whose mysterious past is questionable, lures barrack dweller Hans to move to the farm as her night watchman, in exchange for a healthy stipend. Her motives are less than transparent.That decision, initially supported by Hans’ wife Shweta, sets forth a propulsive chain of events that rises to the true definition of tragedy: a tragic hero in his prime who is disastrously brought down by his own flaws, in this case, trying to escape from an impoverished and restricted life. The organic trajectory of the plot is breathtakingly wrenching and painstakingly profound.As Hans, Shweta, and their young teenage son Krishna forego their solidarity with each other, the forces of a nature and entrenched social structure rise up to cut them down. The novel is peopled with hungry ghosts – Hema, Hans and Shweta’s first child, whose death from a catastrophic illness cannot be mentioned and whose presence never recedes for one. In the course of these pages, we also meet an ensemble cast of indentured laborers, and who encounter the most treacherous betrayals, far-reaching blood feuds, blood-curling misogyny and unspeakable desperation.I cannot recommend this book highly enough....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Mar 02, 2023","Mar 11, 2023","Mar 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61109596-hungry-ghosts

While killing is a fact of life at the farm, Paule is determined to give each of their short lives meaning by writing a brief bio on the label that goes with each chicken she sells at the market.

In the broadest sense, a commitment is an agreement or pledge to do something in the future. But it can equally mean being willing to give your time and energy to something you believe in, binding yourself to a course of action, or choosing a course of continued love, happiness and fidelity. For an unfortunate few, it can also signify being voluntarily or involuntarily committed to a hospital setting.All these definitions of commitment are explored in Mona Simpson’s latest novel, which explores the effect of a mentally ill mother’s collapse on her young family and the saving grace of sibling connections and friendships.When Diane Aziz falls into a deep depression, it falls upon her best friend, Julie, to create a sort of home for Walter, Lina and Donnie. Each of them experiences the reverberations of Diane’s long-term hospitalization in his or her own way. Walter, the oldest, excels at Berkeley, where he is driven to be the master of his own destiny, first by studying medicine, and then by pursuing a career in architecture. Through sheer force of will, he creates a profitable and stable life.Lina, his younger sister, who is equally bright, takes an “all or nothing” approach to getting into a prestigious Ivy League college. When her high stakes gamble doesn’t succeed, she pursues a love of art and also of a man she is head over heels about, who also elicits feelings of potential loss that may be lurking right around the corner.And Donnie, the youngest, is left behind (literally and figuratively, since his role is only defined much later in the novel) begins to drift and feel the seductive siren call of escape and drugs.Ms. Simpson foregoes bells and whistles and inorganic plot twists to simply let these characters reveal themselves, their yearnings and struggles, and their various approaches to creating lives that are filled with individual meaning.

Both are serious writers who leverage their own lives to create introspective and often personal books that are perceived as bastions of feminism. And both – to one degree or another – are attracted to Wah’s husband, Charlie, a scholarly philosophy professor who Tessa perceives as a potential intellectual equal. Tessa’s conversations with him catch fire as they both rely on imperfect nihilistic filters (Camus for Tessa and Nietzsche for Charlie) to understand the world more clearly. But here is where the similarities end. Tessa, the narrator of this book, is an outspoken proponent of feminism, a self-deceiving and bitter white woman who considers Wah, a mixed-race Asian, to be an “insult to womanhood.” Wah’s devotional demeanor, her feminine appearance, and her fawning subservience is everything that Tessa abhors.The questions that are raised by this rivalry simmer as the two couples (Tessa and her second husband Milton and Wah and Charlie) increasingly are in each other’s company. Are there unspoken rules that separate a good feminist from a wannabe one? Is service to another or deep feeling a form of weakness or an ultimate strength? What happens when self-deception conceals one’s own reality? When can women give themselves permission not to hang ourselves on the expected rope of self-sacrifice?My Nemesis belies its spare size (less than 200 pages) by demanding the reader to pay careful attention at every step. As Tessa reveals more of herself by what she does – and does not – say, her rigidity and inability to accept another’s inner life nudges the book to its necessary conclusion.

Children were trained to answer: ‘We become everything we pass until we become the thing we created.’”For several months, How High We Go in the Dark had been patiently waiting its turn on my shelf. I passed over it time after time – first because I am not a huge sci-fi fan and second, the comparisons to David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas (which I admired but did not love) were daunting.Then last week I picked this haunting book up. And I remain in its thrall. Make no mistake, this is a dark book to read. Certain parts of it will leave you gutted. Other parts will bring tears to your eyes. But chances are, you will not soon forget it. Because above all else, this is a book about death, grief, and humanity and hope.It starts with the discovery of an 30,000-year-old girl in Siberia with possible Neanderthal characteristics. As scientists excavate and examine her, they discover an unidentified virus that appears to instruct host cells to serve other functions – for example, brain cells in the liver, lung cells in the heart – and eventually, normal organ functions shut down. As the Arctic Plague infects the researchers and enters the mainland, death becomes a fact of life like never before.The ensuring stories each stand alone and also bleed into the stories of others – not unlike humanity as a whole. A few are totally heartbreaking. In “City of Laughter”, former comedian Skip accepts a job at a “euthanasia park”, where very sick and suffering children are given the Disneyland experience before heading to the park’s focal ride, Osiris, where they die painlessly during the height of their exhilaration. Another poignant one is “Songs of Your Decay” about a female forensic scientist whose marriage is faltering. She begins to fall in love with a dying plague victim who has willed his body to science, and to whom she will devote her research.This novel explores the ramifications of this pernicious plague in all sorts of ways. Scientists scramble for solutions, ultimately striving to grow alternate human organs in pigs for human transplantation – and then one pig ends up growing human consciousness and speech. A starship is launched to find another suitable planet, with its travelers in cryogenic suspension as their homeland, Earth, continues to advance tens of thousands of years. A young man who lives in post-plague Japan becomes attracted to an older woman through a virtual reality app. A newly pregnant Japanese girl, now living in America, shuns a shared burial urn society in her hometown to launch her own more hopeful life.Ultimately, the father of one of the original scientists, who ends up being a traveler on the starship, writs this to his granddaughter: “I want nothing more than to hold you and join the wonderful family gatherings I hear so much about. But there is still work to be done. There is still hope.” In the midst of so much pain and sorrow, hope continues to burn bright.

And maybe that’s good, they‘re not shut-off, they know what reality is.”Chilean Poet is, no surprise, about Chilean poets. You’re going to see plenty of names sprinkled throughout here, from Pablo Neruda to Gabriela Mistral to Roberto Bolano to Gonzalo Rojas and then some. The author himself is a respected Chilean poet. After all, Chile – a Latin American country of 17 million – has produced two Nobel Laureates for Literature and many other prolific writers. But this novel goes beyond the creation of poetry to consider the creation of family and connections. Gonzalo – a poet and lecturer – connects with Carla back in high school. What follows is a realistic and squirm-worthy description of the first throes of physical love – nothing like the movie version of it. They break up and meet again, nine years later, when Carla is again single with a young son named Vicente.Gonzalo, with his love of words, cannot adequately settle upon a word to describe his relationship with Vicente. The word stepfather – padrastro in Spanish – seems inadequate, particularly since they are not married Still, Gonzalo fantasizes about Vicente telling is friends, “My padrastro is a poetestro.” Both are hard roles to fill. By all accounts, Gonzalo plays the father’s role – in fact, there’s a particularly affecting chapter where Vicente’s beloved cat, Darkness, needs surgery but the cost is astronomical and it breaks Gonzalo’s heart – yet he knows the suffix -astro, he believes, stands for contempt or illegitimacy.Compared to Gonzalo, other fathers in the book fall short: Vicente’s self-centered and mostly uninvolved biological father, his very promiscuous octogenarian grandfather, and so forth. Vicente is more like Gonzalo than his blood relations; both are passionate about poetry and in fact, Vicente may be the true Chilean poet.I very much enjoyed this book that explores how a love of poetry can shape lives and open up new doors to strengthen connections.

For craven eugenicists – such as (Leonard Darwin, who is the only child of Charles Darwin who had no interest in science – and greedy politicians and developers, Apple Island is a cauldron of sin.The island consists of those considered perverse: incestuous siblings and their mentally impaired children, a righteous Civil War veteran named Zachary Hand to God Proverbs who lives in a hollowed tree, the formerly enslaved Benjamin Honey and his Irish-born wife with their children of various hues of skin colors, and so on. Of course, things are bound to head south when a well-meaning Christian schoolteacher-turned-missionary decides to better the lot of the island’s children – particularly if that missionary holds a visceral repulsion to Blacks. As the island comes to the attention of the politicians, the missionary determines to “rescue” Ethan – a green-eyed boy who can pass as white – and foster his art talents in Massachusetts. The others are headed for institutions so that the island can be developed as a vacation destination.The Other Eden echoes themes and events that humanity has grappled with to this day. Must those who are different and misunderstood be considered as “less than” and be deprived of dignity and community? Will intolerance always reign? Gracefully written in magisterial and poetic language, Apple Island itself becomes a fully developed character. Despite its slimness (a bit over 200 pages), the book demands concentration and focus but the rewards are abundant. Thank you to Book Browse and W.W.

It shattered me to my very core.This may seem a strange segue into Dust Child, which gives voice to the “dust children” of Vietnam – those Amerasians born to the American GIs and Vietnamese women in the shadow of the Vietnamese war. Yet once again, the echoes of American GIs, who may (or may not) have had good intentions, shattering the lives and dreams of innocent Asian girls is powerful.I suspect that is not the main goal of Que Mai’s novel, although it is one that reverberates. This talented author (I read her previous book, The Mountains Sing, which made me want to be an early reader of her new one), is most interested in exploring families lost and found and how the need for healing and forgiveness never ceases.With her Vietnamese heritage and her understanding of human trauma, Que Mai works with three intersecting narratives. One is of two teenage sisters, Trang and Quynh, who leave their rural village to become bar girls in Sai Gon. Their purpose is laudable -- to help their parents pay off crushing debt – but the emotional cost of becoming intimate with American GIs in exchange for money is crushing. The author has researched well, and the lives of these two sisters are brilliantly brought to life.Interspersed with this story is that of Phong, the child of an unknown Black American GI and a Vietnamese mother. Spurned, ridiculed and abused, he fights back mightily to claim a better life and hopefully, immigrate to the U.S. The final leg of the book is that of a helicopter pilot, Dan, who is now much older, and continually haunted by the love affair he had while in country, and the cowardly way he left. He and his wife are determined to achieve closure.Combining the lives of her Amerasian, Vietnamese and American characters, the author drills down to depict the legacy of war from a very human standpoint.

The fact that these characters are inspired by, and even based on, people who actually lived adds an extra level of poignancy to this gripping tale.As in any massive tragedy, the inner essence of these characters is illuminated: those who are courageous and generous of spirit and those who are little more than cowardly savages. The publisher describes this as a “moral thriller” and indeed, it is. Within these pages, we see the worst of humankind: a baseless plot to deflect culpability by falsely blaming the fire on a slave uprising, placing the Black population at extreme risk. And the causation of a disproportionate number of female deaths as important white men scrambled to save their own skin. We also see the best of humankind, as virtual strangers work around the clock to help each other.There are a couple of instances that caused me to take pause: a slave owner who is so obsessive and demented around everyone he knows that his depiction seems barely human. And the moral quandary of Jack, the young boy who knows the truth of the start of the fire, who zig zags so much that he comes across less sympathetic than I suspect was intended.These quibbles aside, this novel is so deftly crafted and propulsive that I can’t imagine readers not being totally immersed in it.

Her previous book, The Great Believers and the exquisite story collection,Let me start by saying that Rebecca Makkai is one of my literary goddesses. Her previous book, The Great Believers and the exquisite story collection, Music for Wartime, have a prized and permanent position on my bookshelf.The first thing is that it’s important for readers to put those books – and others this author has written – out of their minds. This is a different kind of book, a psychological suspense book and a deep dive into collective memory, racial, gender, class-based schisms, and an abysmal justice system – all of which define and sometimes even destroy us. At first, I didn’t like it until I did, and when I did, I was all in. The story centers around Bodie Kane, a not-so-privileged teenager who ends up in a privileged New Hampshire boarding school. Bodie has had tough breaks: two deaths in her immediate family, excess weight, and an inability to fit in and banter like her roommate. That roommate is Thalia, a popular and attractive girl who has a boyfriend, Robbie, and is also bordering on an inappropriate relationship with a young, married teacher (who is addressed as “you” throughout the book). And then she is found dead in the swimming pool. A Black man is accused.All this is set up quickly. The bulk of the novel focuses on the adult Bodie, now successful, attractive, but damaged podcaster, who is called back to the boarding school for two weeks to teach a small group of students. She is plunged back into these pivotal high school years, this time with an ability to question the validity of collective memory, including her own.At first, my fear was that the premise would be too reductive. There is a lot of time spent setting the scene and restating what an insular and privileged place Granby Hall (the boarding school) is and introducing a host of student names. A sometime-love relationship Bodie is involved in seems underdeveloped. I shouldn’t have been a doubter. When this book ignites, it becomes unputdownable.Rebecca Makkai tackles issues that are prevalent then and now: patterns of violence against women who are verbally and physically attacked (along with referrals to true-life stories: “the one where her body was never found…the one where he left her body for dead under the tarp.”)She takes on an over-zealous #MeToo movement as well as concerns about objectifying and obsessing about violent deaths, particularly if the victim is attractive. Most victims are “young, as we prefer our sacrificial lambs.” The rush to judgement , the insidiousness of misogyny, the untethered power of Twitter and other social media sources that shape opinions without asking us to ferret out the facts. The ending is nuanced and organic. ...more",Notes are private!,1,67,1,"Feb 21, 2023","Mar 02, 2023","Dec 22, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61053829-i-have-some-questions-for-you

Is it time to be held accountable?Much as I believe that many good Germans had little choice but to keep quiet during those insane times – or else risk their own lives and those of their families – I still felt uneasy about a mainly plot-driven book that did not quite succeed in answering the “whys” or depicting the senseless genocide.

Scott, the 19th century portrait painter of Lexington, the greatest racing stallion in America’s turf history and a prolific sire (Preakness is one of his heirs). One might argue that the racing is also a mirror that reflects America’s own reflection as well. The book trots before it gallops. In its opening pages, Geraldine Brooks painstakingly draws her canvas, introducing us to the key players who comprise her novel: Jarett, an enslaved groom with a near-spiritual connection to one of most magnificent horses who ever lived, the white racehorse owners who commoditize the horse, the artist who captures him on easel. Braided with this story is a modern-day tale of a Black art-history student working on his dissertation and his happenstance new relationship with Jess, an Aussie working for the Smithsonian, who loves the interior architecture of living things.Just as I was about to write off the novel as an exercise in well-researched historical faction, it takes off, and when it does, it’s a breathless, all-hands-on-deck sprint to the finish. As the author intended, I loved this horse. I read with bated breath, hoping that nothing evil would befall him. Like Seabiscuit, Lexington is a tale of a horse who triumphs against all odds and makes winning feel seamless.But scratch the surface and the real subject is who tells and advances the story. Jarret is a true hero in the story of Lexington, and he is sold part-and-parcel along with the valuable horse from one wealthy landowner to another. Both man and horse are only good when they are helping their master to profit. The damning phrase of appropriation is lurking in the background: can a white woman truly take on the reckoning with racism from her “position of privilege?” I can almost feel Geraldine Brooks wresting with this question and the result is that her Black heroes – Jarret and Theo – are almost too perfect. The points are made: America has and continues to struggle with systemic racism and the result is that Black horsemen AND Black intellectuals and their accomplishments are left unsung.The book is fascinating, and its story is mesmerizing and unforgettable.

There is Stephen King, William Kent Krueger, Richard Russo, Ann Patchett – everyone’s list will differ.In her heart of hearts, Deepit Kapoor is a storyteller, and in around 550 pages, she spins a story that is so cinematic that it’s hard to imagine it not being on the screen soon – and indeed, I just read that it will be.In the age of vice, money and wealth, greed and corruption, forbidden pleasure and family power intertwine, and those who don’t have the cunningness and cruelty to adapt will be unable to make it. The story is told through three perspectives: Ajay, a young boy who becomes an indentured servant and eventually is noticed by Sunny – the scion of the powerful and corrupt Wadia family. Also falling into Sunny’s orbit is Neda, a young and attractive journalist who loves him but hates the hold his family has on him. Each of these three characters ultimately sees himself or herself as a victim, not a willing accomplice. And each of them learns a hard truth: that some people are born to rule and thrive and ultimately fail. For the rulers, life’s outcomes are viewed as their God-given right. The wheel of life, the author suggests, will keep turning toward the dissolution that will swallow us all.The fact that the novel is set as India sits poised to modernize and change adds intensity to the propulsive plot.

And what if the chief suspect is your own father What if, after an uneventful breakfast and an ordinary family day, your mother, Jane, just vanishes? And what if the chief suspect is your own father who, to say the least, is unlikeable.Let’s up the ante a little. Your father happens to be a brilliant criminal defense attorney, who is a master at outfoxing mere mortal men, such as detectives. There is no physical evidence, no witnesses, no murdered body, no major motive, no reason to connect your father – Dan Larkin – to any sort of crime, much less murder. But your mother's sister is very suspicious and gradually, doubts corrode whatever peace of mind you possess. As you grow up, the doubts become more and more pervasive.That is the premise behind William Landay’s compelling follow-up novel to Defending Jacob. It asks the reader to consider: how far does family loyalty and fealty go? Is your allegiance to your victimized mother or to your father, who has never laid a hand on you (or on your mother) but who you instinctively believe is a murderer for no concrete reason? As the three adult children age, each of them take different paths: Alex, the oldest, is his father's defender, Jeff, the middle son, is diametrically opposed to his brother, and Miranda, the youngest, is plagued with feelings of guilt and wanting to do the right thing. This is, after all, William Landay, so you can anticipate a compelling courtroom scene and a couple of breathtaking twists and turns. The title, by the way, comes from the Latin phrase omnia mea mecum porto, which implies that one’s possessions are not material things, but rather character traits and wisdom.

For those who are far from those aging milestonLoneliness, loss, and a sense of incredulity and amazement: that’s what getting old really feels like. For those who are far from those aging milestones, Margaret Atwood’s latest short story collection may seem almost like an anthropological study. But for those of us who are rapidly reaching (or have already reached) our Medicare years, these stories ring with a poignant and authentic truth.Margaret Atwood is 83. Her husband and life partner, the writer Graeme Gibson, died a few years back. Ms. Atwood believes she was descended from a woman lynched for supposedly being a witch. It’s important to keep all this in mind while delving into these stories, which, at their heart, are at least a little bit autobiographical.About half the stories revolve around an aging married couple named Nell and Tig. Particularly worthy for me is the one entitled Widows, where Ms. Atwood writes that, “Time has ceased to be linear, with life events and memories in a chronological row like beads on a string. It’s the strangest feeling or experience, or rearrangement. I’m not sure I can explain it to you.” Some of the Nell and Tig stories lose their emotional attachment through the details of everyday life; others shine.Others that are sandwiched in provide a bit of comic relief mixed with irony and headshaking. Chief among these is Airborne, where professional women gather together to work on creating a panel. During their time together, they reminisce about the devolvement of language, joke about passwords and political correctness and feminism, and ruefully consider the changes that have taken place. Another good one is Metempsychosis, about a snail who is reincarnated within the body of a female bank teller. The Dead Interview, a dialogue between Ms. Atwood and George Orwell (one of her influences), is illuminating and well-crafted.Although this is not the strongest of Margaret Atwood’s short story collections, it is perhaps her most personal, and as such, a must-read.

Passion and vulnerability are two emotions she has never allowed herself to experience. Until, on a business trip to Iceland, she meets Mack, the subject of her photo shoot – a glassblower who shuns involvement every bit as much as she does and yet awakens the craving and desire within her. This is a book I did not expect to like. In fact, while reading it, I kept imagining a literary friend who I discuss books with a lot whispering in my ear: “Don’t you see that this is manipulative? Would Cathryn really make this decision at this time? Can’t you see the ending coming?”My friend would be right. But still. I was too caught up in the narrative to care. For starters, as someone who spent a couple of weeks in Iceland, I can attest that this author captures Iceland beautifully. I would urge anyone who has been or is considering going to Iceland to read this before they go. It is an absolutely wonderful evocation of a land that – for me and, I suspect, for most people – is magical.For another, it’s been a while since I’ve been swept up in the story of a complicated but fated romance. Mack, who is tortured, enigmatic, and isolated (physically and emotionally) reminded me of Heathcliff or other Victorian men who are impossible to get close to but maybe, just maybe, worth fighting for. And Cathryn, in her willingness to toss out the latest PC rules (women don’t need a man to complete them, women need to follow their own star) is surprisingly accessible and relatable, willing to take risks to once again feel alive.In the course of this book, the reader learns a lot about the glaciers and thermal lagoons of Iceland, the delicate art of glassblowing, and the vagaries of the human heart.

I called it “one of the first delights of the New Year.” Now, as the year draws to a close, I am once again enchanted by Dutch author Marijke Schermer’s new book, Breakwater.Once again, Ms. Schermer dives deep into the human psyche. And once again, the focus is a couple: Emilia, a statistician and trauma survivor and her husband Bruch, a physician. Together, they have two young sons and seem to have a great life, but the PTSD of what Emilia has been through – and is psychologically unable to share – is threatening to pull them apart.Ms. Schermer searingly and successfully captures the emotional pain, shame, and terror that anyone who has gone through a violent rape and physical assault carries with them. As Emilia continues to unravel, questions arise that encapsulate the themes the author is exploring.Is it a mistake, a missed opportunity, or a form of indecency not to be completely honest and transparent with your partner? Should you turn your back on a key story of your life for the purpose of moving forward with one shared story? Is there a true connection between the facts and the truth, or for that matter, between candor and intimacy? What does “being happy” really mean anyway? When does a prolonged silence fall into the category of a lie?Like the rain torrents outdoors that are threatening this couple’s physical survival, the inner torrents are tearing apart their emotional survival.

I believe that any experience, whatever its nature, has the inalienable right to be chronicled. There is no such thing as a lesser truth.”Forcing a woman to carry and give birth to a baby she doesn’t want – and then demonizing and shaming her, without any consequences for the male – should have effectively ended half a century ago. For the vast majority of countries, including truly religious countries like Mexico or Italy, it DID end. Not for the United States though. No siree. A woman’s reproductive life has stepped back decades, thanks to a handful of conservative judges, who are ruled by their personally held religious beliefs rather than by any legal precedent.Now that I’ve gotten that rant out of the way, Happening is a devastating look at Nobel Prize winner Annie Ernaux’s own abortion in the dark ages when it was outlawed in France. It’s a short book and it’s almost like some kind of Rorschach test: the emotions it will evoke directly relate to a reader’s own personal views on abortion.Annie Ernaux is unsparing on her examination and dissection of what she went through back in 1963. As someone who is pro-choice, I expected to relate to her decision 100%. And I did – until I didn’t. Her authentic reactions to the expulsion of her fetus (which is not for the faint of heart) and her feeling of triumph and pride was not something I could fully embrace. I surprised myself by exercising a bit of my own moral judgment.But isn’t that what this book is all about? The biggest takeaway is that each woman will react through her own experiences and values. And it also illustrates the extremes that a woman will go to – even causing herself harm or death -- in order to not bear an unwanted baby. No one can legislate that most intimate of decisions or force a woman to conform to their own judgments. It’s hard to imagine anyone reading this who will believe going back to criminalizing abortion will result in anything positive.

What is the difference between a novel and a memoir? I couldn’t tell you. Permission to lie, permission to cast aside worries about plausibility.”When writing about one’s mother – which, to most people, is a story based on fact but front-loaded with mythologies and misrepresentations by the very nature of our most-intimate relationship – it is hard to separate fact and fiction.Ms. McCracken understands the fierce privacy with which her mother shielded herself. Writing about her is an act of extraordinary love (“Why are you writing about me? Because otherwise, you’d evanesce, and that I cannot bear.”) But it is also an act of betrayal to a mother who never wanted to be the character of a book.Here, she is not just a character. She is a hero. Elizabeth McCracken solves her dilemma by introducing a fictional hotel clerk and changing some of her own biography (in real life she is married, not single, for example). She adds in for good measure, “You family is the first novel that you know.”Through this novel, she performs the magic trick of bringing her mother alive – tiny in stature, disabled and Jewish in small-town Iowa, disabled by cerebral palsy at birth and relying on canes to walk, a major hoarder and a lover of theater, a fiery and sometimes cranky personality. This is not a vengeful book about a daughter revealing her mother’s flaws. It is, instead, a layered book of a unique woman who made an oversized impact on her daughter’s life.At the end of the day, it’s a book about how we grieve. How we write.

A fussy and curt English painter, Mr. Lloyd (we never do find out his first name) takes an unstable currach across the Irish Sea with a lofty goal: to be known as the “Gauguin of the Northern Hemisphere.” There he takes residence with the Gillans, and meets their son James, who, at 15 years old, has natural painting ability and the burning drive to get away from the fishing life he seems destined for. There is one more interloper on the small island: a French linguist of Algerian descent named Jean-Pierre Masson who specializes in languages that are threatened with extinction. He is passionate about the dwindling island population not becoming bastardized by the English tongue (for example, he obstinately refers to James as Seamus, which irks James no end).At times slow-moving with one-sentence paragraphs interspersed with dense pages of steam of consciousness, the book nevertheless captures the imagination. As it becomes increasingly obvious that neither Lloyd nor Masson really care about the island, but rather, are obsessed with their own aims. Both are in pursuit of an authentic experience, but neither understands what’s in front of their own eyes. At regular intervals, Ms. Magee provides snippets of the senseless sectarian violence that is killing young men and fathers on the mainland.The questions the author poses are about Ireland. About us. About the British relationship with Ireland: “the sea between us tinged with the blood of ordinary people of men doing the dishes at home, of women out shopping for their mothers, of children on a boat with their grandfather…” Through Masson, the author extends the analogy, drawing on another occupation: that of France’s colonizing of Algeria. As importantly, who gets to determine how others live—and why? In a particularly poignant exchange between Lloyd and his so-called protégé, James, who is the less derivative and more genuine artist, Lloyd grandly tells James that his masterpiece is “my interpretation of the island” James responds “That’s grand, Mr. Lloyd. It’s just nothing to do with my work. My work is different. Yours is like everyone else’s work.” The Colony is definitely not like everyone else’s work.

It may not be for everyone – certainly not for readers who gravitate to action-filled plots. But it certainly was for me.At the heart of the novel is Abby, an economist who has just been denied tenure because a book she wrote that went viral has been deemed derivative. The following day, she has been invited to deliver a guest lecture to a room full of people, and she’s floundering. She views herself as a failed academic with an inconsequential book and a bleak future.And then she receives a visitation by none other than John Maynard Keynes, the very economist she will be speaking about in the lecture. What follows is a “memory palace” tour though each room of her house, where she assigns segments of the speech. Keynes is right there with her, prodding her on.The result is a kaleidoscope of insights, most stemming from Keynes’ Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren (the New Deal was lifted directly from that playbook). What did Keynes really wish to communicate? Are those in power justifying whatever schemes served their own needs, sullying the meaning of his long-fought plans for government investment and public works? What would you choose to do in a Keynesian utopian alternative universe? (I was surprised to read what utopian really means.)Perhaps, Abby postulates, everyone is in the wrong world at the wrong time. Is failure contained in the greatest success? What is a way of life more than an attitude of ideas? In addition to Abby’s metaphysical musings, she enters the realm of memory, encompassing her childhood, the first almost-lover who influenced her, her husband (who appreciates work for its own sake) and young daughter, her misplaced career ambitions, and more.

Then the males castrate the other males…Then you have a bloody mess.” -- Flint Michigan resident, 1989In this wildly inventive, brilliantly written debut, Tess Gunty sets her story in the fictional town of Vacca Vale, Indiana – a rust belt, decaying Midwestern town, once the home of the (also fictional) Zorn automobile company.  Its glory days are far behind it, and what remains are burnt-out people who live in an apartment complex that is colloquially called the Rabbit Hutch. There, remote strangers go about their lives, aware but not connected to the other residents who have converged into a shabby and confining space. One of these residents is Blandine – aka Tiffany – a product of the foster care system who has thrown away her ticket for success after experiencing a betrayal from an authority figure. Now she lives with three troubled teenage boys, who also aged out of the system.We know from the start that this story will not end well from the first three sentences: “On a hot night in Apartment C4, Blandine Watkins exits her body. She is only eighteen years old. But she has spent most of her life waiting for this to happen.”Throughout, the luminous writing and insights took my breath away. For instance, here is Ms. Gunty’s description of one of Blandine’s fateful interactions: “Confronting his naked, endangered face for the first time was like seeing a tiger in the zoo, subdued and therefore doomed, and it sent a shock of pity through her, made her want to look away but also save his life.” In one sentence, the author defines one of her characters and also a crucial relationship.Other characters – the recently deceased child star of a Hallmark-type TV show from years ago called Meet the Neighbors, her maladjusted adult son Moses who is marked by his hatred of his mother, and another Rabbit Hutch neighbor Joan, who monitors an online obituary portal (and attracts Moses’ vengeance, are equally well-portrayed.This would have been a 6-star read for me had not Tess Gunty become a victim of overreach.

All too many hobbyist writers use the Holocaust as a plot point to add suspense or adventure to a novel when in reality, the evil perpetuated there was so heinous and unimaginable that it is hard for the human mind to fathom how anyone could ever have been privy to it. For this reason, I typically gravitate to books that reimagine the Holocaust and show how art triumphs over evil: I’m thinking books like The White Hotel, Blessing on the Moon, and Mischling.So I began reading Remote Sympathy with some trepidation, anticipating that I would not like it. Reluctantly but fortunately, the book won me over. Catherine Chidgey eschews artificial sentimentality and trite plot twists and delivers a layered fictional world where sympathy is, indeed, remote.There are three key narrators here. One is Lenard Weber, a Munich physician who identifies as Lutheran who may be on the verge of inventing a technological advance in the fight against cancer. Because he has a tiny smidgen of Jewish blood, he eventually finds himself at the Buchenwald concentration camp. His sections are written as letters to the young daughter he had with his Jewish wife. Then there is SS officer Dietrich Hahn, based on a real-life Nazi officer, who gladly accepts a post at Buchenwald, complete with all the luxuries and perks his new position encompasses. His entries are written as post-war transcribed interviews and some of them were lifted verbatim from the real transcripts. Finally, there is his much younger wife Greta, who is ill with ovarian cancer and desperately needs treatment, even if the treatment is unproven. It is not a stretch to believe that metamorphically, she physically embodies the diseased Germany of the 1940s. Juxtaposed with these three narrators are short musings of the Weimar townspeople, written in third-person plural.The yawning gap between the horrendous conditions of the prisoners and the utter lack of sympathy for them by the officers and townspeople, who have been conditioned to see them as less-than-human, is astounding. So is the denial of Dietrich Hahn, who works with vigor to ensure each prisoner receives precisely the amount of food required…no more, no less. I write this  at a point in time when our own democracy is undergoing an enormous test and when we badly need an injection of sympathy for others.

But the author wants to examine the choices we make, what it means to belong, and the fervent allure and tragedy that draws people to (and forces them away from) Africa.It particularly focuses on Alisa, who was born the daughter of a Jamaican slave and adopted by an Englishman, leaving her to straddle the white/black divide and experience herself as rootless and ultimately, melancholy and lost. Large segments of her journal are revealed that are more expository than emotive or introspective. While her feelings of oppression are revealed, the tone of the journal keeps readers at a distance from a true understanding of a heinous act that Alisa commits early on in the novel.Ultimately, my reading experience was mixed. On one hand, this author writes beautifully and lyrically, introducing ancestral myth and ritual into her narrative and composing passages that are memorable, mesmerizing, and profound. On the other, there are narrative choices (such as the journal) that, for me, broke up the spell that was being created and not fully allowing me to immerse into the story.

Particularly after meeting and falling in love with a conservative and handsome Swede – who, in another time and place, would be considered a kind of Prince Charming rescuer – she questions who she is and what she’s doing.

Is it possible for those whose lives are secure and comfortable to see beyond an imposed definition of right and wrong? And perhaps most importantly, “was it possible to live and narrate a story at once without sacrificing one or the other to censorship?”As Leyla imposes layer upon layer between herself and others to shield herself from emotional pain that inevitably ensues, she struggles to accept her own truth in life and trust it to take her where she needs to go.

One of the key characters, Marshall Green, is suffering from Lewy Body Carolina Moonset spoke to me right from the start, and in a very personal way. One of the key characters, Marshall Green, is suffering from Lewy Body Dementia, which, in ways, is like Alzheimer’s disease but with two key differences: long-term memories stay mostly intact, and hallucinations become more frequent. It is the same disease that my mother valiantly fought, and ultimately succumbed to, four years ago. For adult children, it is heartbreaking.Add in that Marshall Green and family – including the first-person narrator, Joey, his only son – lived in Chicago (where I happily lived for a few decades) and now reside in the Carolinas (where my husband and I moved two years ago), and it’s easy to see how this book was an irresistible choice.Briefly, the set-up goes like this: Joey is visiting his deteriorating father and pickleball tournament-bound mother when a prominent Beaufort citizen is murdered. A number of signs point to Marshall, who has justifiably hated that family for many years. But without a short- term memory, it’s impossible to get to the truth. Joey, along with his new romantic interest Leela, a clinical psychologist, aim to get to the bottom of it while nurturing their budding relationship. The author, Matt Goldman is a playwright and an Emmy Award-winning TV writer for shows such as Seinfeld. That’s good and sometimes not-so-good. The dialogue is sharp, witty and sexy particularly between Joey and Leela, and the story in general is propulsive and compelling. The main characters are authentic and very likeable, and the sprinkling of psychological insights is apt.As the book proceeds, more of the plotting becomes cinematic.

But when it comes to historical fiction such as Hamnet or The Marriage Portrait – well, she’s so breathtakingly good that it’s hard to come up for air.I won’t even try to compare Hamnet and The Marriage Portrait. They are both excellent in their own way. What we know about Lucrezia, the third daughter of Cosimo I de’Medici, ruler of Tuscany, is that she is that she chafes against the severe restrictions that were enforced upon young women. In the 1500s.Would that she had been an easy child! Maggie O’Farrell crafts vibrant scenes that may or may not have occurred – such as when young Lucrezia reaches in to touch a tiger, one of the exotic animals in the basement of her father’s palazzo. Like the tiger, Lucrezia isn’t one to be easily tamed but she has been bred for captivity: at barely 13, she is “sold” to Alfonso II, poised to become Duke of Ferrara, who is over a decade older than she. Like others of her status, she is used as a link in the chain of power, to produce heirs for Alfonso. The stakes in bearing him a son could not be higher.But who is Alfonso, anyway? In today’s vernacular, he might be viewed as a sociopath: handsome, charming, carefree and magnetic on the outside, but manipulative, dominating and outright dangerous when crossed even a little. In real life and in this book, Alfonso is one bad hombre.How does a cloistered young girl – now chattel for a man who only wants his dynasty secured – cope? Was Lucrezia murdered – as some historians suggest – less than a year after she marries because of her failure to produce an heir? Or, as other historians hint, was she small and frail to begin with? Weaving together fact and fiction, Maggie O’Farrell creates the most satisfying story of a young woman’s battle for her very life. Ultimately, the author succeeds in making her readers believers that the possibilities of imagination trumps linear historical fact with a sleight of hand that left me gasping because of its sheer inventiveness....more",Notes are private!,1,56,1,"Sep 08, 2022","Sep 13, 2022","Sep 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60353768-the-marriage-portrait

A former model and a talented photographer, her work was avant garde and her relationship with Xavier, a radical artist, was thrilling albeit a wee bit dangerous.Now she is slipping into middle age with all the accoutrements of a life well-lived surrounding her: a successful older architect husband, a 12-year-old daughter, a coterie of upscale friends, and a position that still lets her get her toes wet in the art field she has long loved.And then an artist-environmentalist-activist named Gabriel comes along. True to his name, he is a young man of strength and conviction, not yet out of his teens. A disciple of sorts to an artist who called himself Hundertwasser – meaning hundred waters – he is cynical about humankind and believes that after the foods sweep humans away, the animals will inherit the Earth. Many of his highly disturbing artistic works embody this theme.Slowly but surely, both Louisa and her daughter Sylvie become mesmerized with him and are pulled into his orbit. For Sylvie, Gabriel represents a heady freedom and a passage into adulthood. For Louisa, he may represent a tinge of Xavier and an escape back to her exhilarating youth when nothing was safe, and everything was possible. When yearning and despair are ignited by an illuminating and powerful force, there is bound to be combustion.While The Hundred Waters is a page-turning read, Gabriel’s character needs more development. It was challenging to decipher whether he was a sort of nihilist who just wanted to destroy everything around him or whether he was a manipulative visionary who would do anything to get noticed.

The old Hong Kong of laws and judges in British wigs had been deconstructed overnight and in its place there had emerged a wild twilight totalitarian world in which rumor, hyperbole, hatred, tribalism, and supposition were regnant.”Lawrence Osborne has an uncanny ability to write immersive novels about Americans or Brits who end up facing moral dilemmas in exotic locations far from home. That location itself – Bangkok in his last book The Glass Kingdom and now Hong Kong in On Java Road – becomes a character in its own right, rich with lush details and fragile melancholy.Here, the narrator is Adrian Gyle, a not-to-well-known reporter, who has reached the pivotal age of 50 and perceives that he casts no shadow on the sidewalk. Although he has spent the last few decades filing freelance stories, he has begun to recognize that Hong Kong is declining, and its moral ambiguity is becoming more and more pronounced.Take his old Cambridge friend, Jimmy Tang, for instance. Jimmy comes from a dynasty of shipping magnates, drinks the best liquors and has a particular passion for luxe suits that he freely buys for his himself and Adrian. Adrian witnesses all his excesses, including his married friend’s new “toy”, a young woman half his age, also from a prestigious family, who is part of the student rebellion.When the young woman – someone Adrian imagines himself with if he were younger and in a better socioeconomic status – disappears, Adrian discovers that the unrest that permeates his adopted city also permeates his own being. Is his long and loyal friendship with Jimmy – which is repaid by access to some of the most connected parts of Hong Kong society – worth turning a blind eye on his excesses…particularly if the excesses might have led to foul play? And has he also been turning a blind eye to the attacks on the ideals of democracy and free press, which are overtly occurring in Hong Kong and perhaps less overtly, in the U.S. and Britain? Can he, in fact, stand up for himself and for what’s right or is the price too high?The pace of On Java Road is languid and Lawrence Osborne takes his time getting to the crux of the story, and deliberately keeps the ambiguity going. Put another way, his aim is not to provide answers but instead to pose questions. The book affirms for me once again why I am a big Lawrence Osborne fan.

Or of a specific crime that resulted in murder. Or maybe embezzlement. Or maybe none of the above. We know that he is fleeing his former life and in doing so, is shedding all the trappings that add up to an identity. The only thing he has with him is an envelope of substantial cash that should keep him going for a couple of years.Our narrator discards all personal ID, avoids any kind of surveillance including Internet and chain store cameras, and strips himself down to the bare minimum – a ramshackle room in a run-down house on Sugar Street in a working-class city, owned by a tattooed landlady with issues of her own.As he attempts to reboot – or more accurately, eschew – his life, he is haunted by questions: “What is my role in the world? What is my place? What a white question, to assume or even imagine I have one.” For him, the very idea of flight from his identity is laughable. Still, he pushes forward, striving to be blameless, to lighten his footprint, to escape surveillance, both targeted or not.Still, it is human nature to strive for connection, and his attempts to engage – while not REALLY engaging – with the immigrant school children who pass by his window raises the question of who really is invisible in society and who is just playing the game.What Jonathan Dee does so well is to keep both the protagonist and the reader in the dark about who this man really is and what he is capable of doing.

The author was Kamila Shamsie and I couldn’t wait to read her next novel.Best of Friends starts off with a lot of promise. The two young besties, Maryam and Zahra, come from two different social classes in Karachi. Maryam is slated to take over the family business, Khan’s Leather, and has spent her young life sheltered, imperious, and entitled. Zahra, whose father is a popular Cricket television commentator who has gotten on the bad side of General Zia’s military dictatorship, has to study harder and walk the line a lot more tightly.As in Home Fire, certain themes begin to form: a country in flux. ambition vs. humanity, loyalty vs. self-preservation, patriarchal power vs. female justice. The girls find themselves in a potentially dangerous situation and the outcome of that evening will reveal their characters and will change everything.Fast forward. We meet the girls many years later in London, where both have reached the pinnacle of professional success. Maryam has gravitated to the world of venture capitalism while Zahra is a lauded human rights attorney. Still, their childhood friendship endures. Shamsie writes, “Perhaps that was the key to the longevity of childhood friendships – all those shared subtexts that no one else could discover. And perhaps shared subtexts felt even more necessary when you both lived far away from the city of your childhood and that was itself the subtext to your lives.”Fair enough. But here is where my interest began to wane. As adults, their values, interests, and what matters to them displays a wide divergence. Perhaps, as Shamsie suggests, the problem with childhood friendship is that you fail to see the adult in front of you because you have such a fixed idea of who your friend is in the past. But the author places a lot of weight on the permanence of early friendships while as most of us have learned, some of these are mean to endure while others do not.Both women show that they have the resilience and strength to overcome childhood obstacles and rise to the top of their professions. Yet inconceivably, they cannot let the situation go and are still mired to the past – which becomes crystal clear when some figures from that night emerge. By then, their stellar lives and their confrontations feel a bit false, as if they’re being plotted, rather than organic.

Narrated from their perspective, Frith Farm is a never-ending revelation of ramshackle picnics, wheelies, birthing cows, rescued caged-in hens, baled hay, and bucolic settings.It’s not easy for any writer to present the world from the viewpoint of children, who are seven when the book begins and twelve when it ends. The Children’s Bible, by Lydia Millet, comes instantly to mind. And loss of innocence is a theme that has been often leveraged.But Sadie Jones handles the pitfalls well. She is a darn good writer and uses metaphor in similar ways that she did in her last novel, The Snakes. There, actual snakes were used as a counterpoint to a venomous family, who needed to shed their protective skin and morph into their real essence. Here, in one vivid scene, the families must dispense with writhing rats, writhing around in a bin. No one wants to smash them to bits and leaving them to starve is cruel. One of the children speculates, “I bet they’re eating each other…or having sex.”Indeed, while the families are in no danger of starving, money is a ubiquitous issue. None of the couples are natural farmers and schisms begin to be noted (and sometimes, dismissed) by the unsupervised children. As certain allegiances begin to grow, the outside world is allowed in and fault lines begin to appear.As with most novels about children, a loss of innocence is inevitable but when it happens, it still packs an enormous punch. Amy and Lan are portrayed authentically, and my only quibble is that their voices seem interchangeable. I’m giving this a 4.5 rating, rounded up.

Ta-Nehisi Coates’ protagonist Hiram Walker has the power – called Conduction – which, on contact with water, transports himself and others across massive distances. It’s a power he shares with Harriet Tubman, who is revered and called Moses.We see that power play out early on in this novel, when Hiram drives across a bridge and suddenly envisions his mother as a water dancer. His half-brother – the elder son of Hiram’s white father – is in the overturned carriage and drowns but seemingly mysterious power transports Hiram out of the water where he awakens safely on the grass. He has been Conducted.Later, someone will tell him, “Well, this thing with you, this Conduction that pulled you out of the river, you are not the first, you know? You know the story – Sainti Bess and the forty-eight coloreds.” Santi Bess is Hiram’s grandmother, a pure-blood African” who, according to legend, led 48 enslaved people to freedom, descending with them into the water and remerging in Africa. There are hints of a mythological or collective memory, and if Ta-Nehisi Coates had focused on this theme, the novel would have soared.But that is not the case. The second half of the book brings him to Philadelphia where he is recruited by the Underground Railroad – a series of safe houses and routes running to the free north – where he actually meets up with the legendary Moses. At this juncture, Ta-Nehisi Coates tends to drum home the message to readers rather than allowing his written words to transport them. There is prose like this: “You are not a slave. Not to your father. Not to me. Not to anyone. You asked what this was. It is freedom.”The Water Dancer soars when it focuses on the mythological – the fervent desire to escape bondage through magical powers. Hiram knows that his Conduction powers are fueled by his recollections and his connections to a past when his ancestors lived as free men and women. The war against slavery is not only about improving the world, but also remaking it.At its finest, The Water Dancer is a lyrical and insightful novel that combines a poignant and heartbreaking slave tale with magical realism and a coming-of-age trope. At its worst, it falls victim to cliches and plot-driven mechanisms that really “don’t hold water.” The Hero’s Journey of Hiram to unlock the full potential of his Conductive powers and determine his own destiny is ambitious is powerful.

They grow in different directions ,yet their roots remain as one.Meet the Izquierdo family. With my smattering of college Spanish, I know that izquierdo means from the left or left-handed. Who knew that it also meant “you have always been cursed”? Certainly, the Izquierdos feel that way. Papa Tavo, the family’s patriarch, believes strongly that his neighbor Emiliano Contreras has placed a curse on him and his family because of his jealousy of his fortune.In reality? The Izquierdo family – and we meet various members of it, who take their place on the stage in linked chapters – is a colorful and imperfect mixture of disparate personalities that somehow morph into one unit with the same roots.Ruben Degollado convincingly brings these family members to life: those who have fallen prey to the excesses of religion or superstition (which, in my mind, too often are one and the same), the struggles to claim one’s place in the family order, the jealousies and flirtations, the boisterous gatherings, the stories – some real, some invented – that ultimately define our history and who we are. And also the songs of courage, joy, and love that weave through the stories.Despite the individual stories that distinguish each character, ultimately, it is the family that endures – whether it’s a family with several branches or “a nation of two.” My thanks to BookBrowse and W.W.

Our unnamed narrator is stopped at the airport by a one-time classmate whom he hasn’t seen in years. Since their flight is delayed, he consents to accompany the man – Jeff Cook – to a first-class lounge and there, an uncanny tale unfolds.Years ago, Jeff was responsible for saving the life of a famous art dealer Francis Arsenault, during a near-drowning episode. Francis is whisked away by the arrival of paramedics and never knows who was responsible for saving his life. But Jeff can’t get the man out of his mind. Before long, he tracks him down, and without telling him who he is, manages to secure a job at the luxurious Beverly Hills gallery. Soon afterwards, he begins dating the man’s daughter.There are many questions that emerge as Jeff tells his classmate about what ensues, and the one that’s most compelling is: why is Jeff revealing the story (that he has never shared) now? Is he a reliable narrator of his own life? Is he a good man or is something a bit more sinister at work? And most of all, is Jeff an agent of his fate or is he its pawn?As the tale gathers steam, our narrator asks himself, “Did he really expect me to believe he’d done so ingeniously, blundering forward with a heart full of the best intentions? I think he did. What was more, at that moment at least, he seemed to believe it himself.” The novel explores how we ultimately write and narrate our own stories and how we create our own circumstances.

The novel would be heartbreaking if it were not for the resiliency of Demon Copperfield, who emerges with a heart that overflows with goodness and a powerful survivor’s instinct.Barbara Kingsolver states that she was inspired by Charles Dicken’s David Copperfield and his impassioned critique of institutional poverty. Indeed, English literature majors like me will see the parallels between Dickens’ work and this one – the young boy whose father died before he was born, the violent stepfather, the helpful Peggots (in Dickens, the nurse was named Peggotty), the idolization of a boy who doesn’t deserve it, and of course Agnes (renamed Angus). But here, the setting is not urban London but the misunderstood and often caricaturized Appalachia. If any children need a superhero to recover their dignity and self-respect, it is those children, who are spurned by foster care and child protective services and victimized by oxytocin and meth addiction and actively supplied with the tools to cook out their brains. Indeed, this is a Victorian saga transposed to our modern-day times, and the sad thing is, too much of the way we discard and dismiss children hasn’t changed. For shame.Like David Copperfield, Demon must wrestle with his own invisibility in a rural backcountry where superheroes do not exist unless you strive to become one yourself. The novel asks: can we change our trajectory in life with the odds so much against us? Can we – to paraphrase T.S. Eliot – go back to the place it all began and know the place for the first time? What gives our lives hope and meaning? This book is just phenomenal, and I can’t thank HarperCollins enough for granting my request to be an early reader in exchange for an honest .

You’re not going to like Paul, a progressive Luddite who has just been demoted to adjunct professor (translated: no health insurance) and who bumbles his way forward in his relationship with his increasingly skeptical pre-teen daughter, Mabel.For the rest of us, this is a page-turning, unputdownable book that had me alternating between laughing out loud and sighing with recognition of how far we’ve descended.You’ve probably met someone like Paul before. He’s the guy who reminds you of software that hasn’t been upgraded in decades. He proudly displays his folding phone and has only condescension for influencers who count their “likes” on Instagram as a crowning accomplishment. He’ll bore you to death trying to “educate” you about all the ways we are turning into an authoritarian and self-destructive dynasty without really offering solutions on what to do. Just when you want to ring his neck, he’ll do something loveable although misguided.Paul believes in the great man theory of one person shaping history. He believes that during this time period, we are dealing with one awful man who is actually deforming history. And he thinks that by writing his Luddite Manifesto, maybe, just maybe, he can make things right.Within this framework, there are split-your-side-laughing scenes of his daughter’s birthday party with liberal mothers refusing to let their 11-year-olds ride in the front seat and gluten-intolerant girls who get deathly ill if they have even an iota of gluten. There are students at the college he’s teaching at who elect to read dumbed-down blogs in lieu of anything that can actually teach them anything literary. And of course, there are the trigger warnings to not dare teach anything that a marginalized student might possibly be disturbed by. There is his octogenarian mother who secretly watches the Mackey Show (think: Fucker Carlson).There’s also honest-to-god pathos: the inability of so many to get health insurance, the allure of iPads and iPhones and social media that hinder real connections, the socioeconomic chasm, and saddest of all, the disintegration of our ability to understand the right thing to do. When Paul meets one of Mackey’s key people, whom he wants to woo to get his moment of glory on the show, things head south fast.

Over and over if we have to, until we get it right.”In The Angel of Rome, Jess Walter’s characters all go through a process of self-discovery and reinvention and surprisingly, most of them end up embracing hope. Individually, these are sparkling little gems that are, in turns, poignant, heartwarming, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.The two longest stories – the eponymous Angel of Rome and the last story, The Way the World Ends, are perfectly wonderful. In Angel, a rootless Nebraska boy named Jack Rigel exaggerates his accomplishments and ends up “earning” a church-sponsored year in Rome to refine his Latin. Problem is, his Latin is so bad that there’s little to refine. Then fate intercedes and he meets another American, a character actor whose trademark line is, “here’s trouble”. As his interpreter and eventual script doctor, he intercedes in the actor’s favor with a beautiful Italian actress who once starred in a campy movie that fueled his adolescent fantasies. During his time, he learns an important lesson: who are you if you can’t make it up?In The Way the World Ends is so darn good that as soon as I finished it, I read it again. It’s about two stranded climate scientists who, unbeknownst to either of them, are competing for the same professorship job in a Mississippi town. As the only two guests in the Butler Guest House, they meet a young man who is manning the desk, who just days ago, came out as gay. Their nihilism about the fate of humankind just as he’s embracing his authentic self, forces him to ask them a question: “So, I guess that’s what I wanted to ask you…if you think we’ve done everything we can?” They recognize that maybe, just maybe, they haven’t.The rest of the stories are also magnificent. A young woman, who has been dealt a horrible blow with a cancer diagnosis, wants to see her one-time lover. She recalls the time when she texted to tell him she’d gotten into law school, and he texted back with a blurry picture of his dick. Sensitive he isn’t but maybe, just maybe, he has a certain life force she needs.A gay adult son is forced to repeatedly come out to his demented and macho father and discovers the perfect place for him: Town & Country, a senior place that’s off the grid in Idaho where residents get to relive their ""golden years"" when meat loaf was $2 and a beer was 75 cents, when there were four channels and rotary telephones and no blacks or gays. And a curmudgeon and his wife, during a lunch out, encounter a student writer who is stealing bits and pieces of their conversation – and in ways, their life.As always, Jess Walter kept me under his spell in each and every one of these stories.

But there was another law, deeper and more insidious, and that was to survive.”The Betrayed, set at the end of the Marcos dictatorship in the 1980s, is a book about survival and the lengths we go to ensure that we are safe. It is also about love – imperfect love, unrequited love, unintentional love, and misunderstood love.In the midst of a tumultuous time of upheaval (Marcos is on his way out and Cory Aquino is on the rise, although neither name is mentioned), an aging dissident who sought refuge in San Francisco with his wife and two daughters is gunned down. For reasons that vacillate between love and survival, the stunning older daughter, Lali, marries the dictator’s handsome and well-bred son, Arturo, who becomes the family’s ticket to return in safety to Manila. In many ways, the two are mirror-images of each other. The problem is that her younger, more inelegant sister, Pilar, is also in love with him and in some sense, he is attracted to her as well.The unspoken character is the Filipino soul, and the author delves deeply to showcase the core of the Philippines that outsiders do not get to see. Defined by its lusciousness and beauty, the country is also rocked by its superstitions and irrationality, its religiousness, its violence. When a ship sinks, guests who are invited to an elegant dinner are afraid to eat the fish because they are convinced that body parts lie inside of them. Skin moles are regarded as physical evidence of deception.Within this environment, people want to be saved but they don’t want to change. They know things – overtly or innately – that they don’t want to reveal. They are willing to tell the stories of strangers, but not their own. Often, they lose their compass and their sense of self. It’s a landscape that’s ripe for betrayals and slowly but surely, the betrayals begin to add up and the betrayed need to live on.Whether these betrayals take the form of warring political factions, infidelities of the heart and body, recrafting of past histories or worst of all, betrayals of one’s very own values and sense of self, at the end of the day, we are all complicit in some form or another.

In terms of prose and thematic insights, it’s a wow.Our narrator, Kristina, was born, she believes, with a monster in her soul. She is one of many female heroin addicts who ply their trade on the street, reliable there in different varieties and constellations. From the start of the novel, we know that she eventually meets her fate in the form of a man with impassive eyes who takes her to an isolated wooded area and eventually decapitates her and cuts her up into seven pieces.Yet in a formless manner, she lives on and from this ghost-of-sorts, we learn who Kristina is and how she arrived at her destiny. She is a nihilist, a neglected daughter who loves her mother but never really connected to her, a mother of a son and daughter whom she loves but couldn’t nurture or safeguard, the wife of an imperfect man who is also prey to his addictions. At one point, she muses, “Everyone weeps apart from me, but something inside me has frozen. It isn’t just the tears, it is something else. A disillusionment so deep, so penetrating, the freezing pint of blood, the ultimate Antarctica of love.”Over and over, she circles back to those minutes preceding and following her murder, with the narrative slightly changing: was she, indeed, as impassive and fatalistic as she portrays or did she plead for her life in the end? Do we suppress or rearrange memory to prevent ourselves from going under? Was the murder the last event in a long chain of chance events that we call life? And what are we forced to give up to save others?In exquisite yet fatalistic prose, Swedish writer Sara Stridsberg delineates the cycle of life: formed form carbon and oxygen and nitrogen, the same substances “that are involved in the decomposition of a body and turn it into stardust.” Death itself may merely be outside time, and we may each be just a second in eternity, yet each of us has complicated stories to tell and people whose lives we touch.This will be one of my personal Top Ten books of the year.

Rather than spend her time playing canasta or bingo, this octogenarian did something quite amazing: she wrote a book about the sexual and romantic life of other older women who defy the unfortunate stereotype of aging.There were two stories that particularly stood out for me. One was the titular story, Cat Brushing, which focuses on an elderly woman who is relying on the largesse of her adult son and his wife, who happen to have an old Siamese cat who “arched her back with delight and raised her head so that I could touch her throat, the most vulnerable part of her.” She recognizes her similarities with the cat – both are supposed to be sweet and fluffy and obedient, and both are expendable. Among other strengths, it’s a powerful look at the power shift between mother and child as one ages.The other story that stood out for me was On Being Alone. Here, a woman who reveled in her aloneness meets another loner late in life – a skinny nervous woman with a thin, anxious face. Slowly but surely, they begin to depend on each other and then love each other. As she finds out, love has no expiration date.Certainly, Jane Campbell knows how to weave a story. I badly wanted to love every single one and indeed, the author is not shy about exploring the female libido or moving her stories into the dystopian realm where technology has been created specifically to deal with an older generation. At times I felt an unevenness and a lack of narrative tension that kept me from fully engaging with the stories.I applaud the author for her courage on taking on a little-discussed topic and for busting through the prevalent misconceptions of aging and the de-sexing of women after a certain age.

Sleepwalk – my new favorite of all his books – has everything: an opening that sucked me in from page one, fast-paced intrigue, an indictment of the ever-encroaching surveillance state and the mercenary corporate structure, and a yearning for true connection in a time when we are all becoming increasingly tribal and untrusting.But most of all, it has Will Bear, certainly one of the most memorable and fascinating characters recently created. Will lives outside the grid (no Social Security number, no social media trail) and has had so many aliases that he thinks of himself as Barely Blur. He’s spent his life as a useful tool – perpetuating acts of industrial espionage, burning down the house of a potentially problematic blogger, bringing those who owe the organization he works for to “justice”. There’s nothing he won’t do, even, in rare cases, baby trafficking.But that doesn’t mean Will doesn’t feel remorse. He rescued a pit bull named Flip from a notorious dog-fighting ring and he lavishes Flip with affection to turn him around. The baby? He dreams up a happy ending where the baby goes to a good family and is adored. He’s learned that people respond to flattery, so he makes sure to either compliment others or resort to his trademark “right on!” to show he agrees with them.Early on, Will is driving in the Guiding Star (he loves his van, too) and suddenly all his burner phones go off at once. He’s untraceable – so what gives? Turns out it's a young woman named Cammie who claims to be his daughter (Will donated sperm when he was in his early 20s)…or is she? Is she one of many “Cammies” who have a nefarious goal in mind? Is she artificial intelligence or some tech-savvy hacker? The problem is, Will – who never knew who his father was and had a – shall we say – antagonist relationship with his mother, really wants to believe he has a daughter. And the plot takes off from there.Sleepwalk is suspenseful, poignant, humorous, addictive, and at times, even tender. Underneath the compelling story, it asks important questions: is it easier to kill than to suffer the agony of empathy? What happens when our worship of technology and profit supersede our craving for connection? What does it take for us to make us wish for another life for another better version of ourselves? What does it really mean to be human?I totally loved this one.

There are two girls at the center of the story, set in rural France: Agnes and her closest friend Fabienne. Imagine a minefield where one girl walks everywhere as if there were not a single mine ready to detonate…and the other is too leery to take a step because she sees the entire world as that minefield. Our narrator Agnes, reflecting from a distance of time, thinks, “She had her will. I my willingness to be led by her will.”Fabienne who has an abundance of talent but is neither polished nor attractive, devises a game. She will write a book – a disturbing and unsettling book that touches on a newborn being left in a pig pen, a madman having sex with a cow, a headless chicken and so forth. Agnes, with her perfect penmanship, will write it out and get to enjoy experiences that Fabienne could never dream of seizing for herself. In this way, the world will perhaps get a taste of their pain.From a plot perspective, I will go no farther than that. Suffice to say that their complex and obsessional relationship intensifies as the two friends want – and are unable – to either destroy or save each other. Through the books they nurture, they cast the world aside for a while (for reasons that become clearer in the novel) and create games and even fantasies that feel real. But eventually, true reality always wins and the world has its way. Only one of them is clearsighted enough to understand that.The Book of Goose, written by the grown-up Agnes, stems from her eventual knowledge that a story must be written out or how else do we get our revenge on a soul-crushing reality? I could easily read this book all over again with careful attention to its nuances. In the meantime, I can say that this is a book that shouldn’t be missed.

And now, in Haven, she once again holds eager readers in her sway – this time, in seventh-century Ireland in the isolated and rocky spot now known as Skellig Michael.Expect a slow burn of a story. Emma Donoghue has obviously done massive research and the novel is fascinating in its recreation of an ancient time and a foreboding destination. Depending solely on God’s will, the three monks exist on a day-to-day basis on a land that offers little in food, drink, and shelter and how they manage to get by is fascinating to learn.But like any Emma Donoghue novel – and I’ve read the last six of them – the suspense and the drama ignite, because the author’s desire is not to just tell, but to delve deeply and explore the human psyche. This story is limited to three characters: a fanatical and zealous prior named Artt who dreams of forsaking the “filthy world” and its distractions in order to build a pure relationship with Christ. His two charges, Trian – a young man surrendered to the monks when he was only 13 and an older man, Cormac, a late convert who is renowned for his inspiring stories of faith – are there to help the prior fulfill his vision.The questions she poses are compelling: Does a didactic knowledge of the Bible and a vow of obedience and extreme sacrifice justify a holier-than-thou attitude? Is nature God’s holiest language and are its glorious beings, its birds and plants, our sisters and brothers? Or have we been truly awarded domination over all of it and if so, at what cost? Should monks be as humble as slaves, even when their own survival is severely threatened and every core of their being cries out against what is being demanded?As a non-believer, I have always marveled at how some “holy” people twist the message of love into a message of disdain for the world and its many varied people they believe God created. To me, we create our personal heaven and hell and diminish ourselves by ignoring our true Garden of Eden – the earth we are fortunate enough to inhabit – through our willful destruction of the planet and its wildlife. Needless to say, this book resonated with me.The ending is both organic and unexpected. I am so grateful for @LittleBrown for enabling me to be an early reader of Haven in exchange for an honest .

(For instance, in the story American Girl, she writes this about a very hot senatorial candidate with a trio of adoring women: “…as for his fiancée, he had never seen the marks on her wrist because there was now a numerical tattoo on one of them and on the other, she wore a bangle made by starving girls in Uganda.” In another, Maid Marion, a woman notes that her ex-lover’s wife has “a waffle-knit bathrobe that weighed more than Noni’s whole life.”) Continually, I’d encounter sentences like these and gasp at her incredible power of observation.Speaking about these characters, though – most of them are unfulfilled, hedonistic women who are inevitably svelte, hungering, living in rarefied air, and very aware of their own looks in comparison to friends and competitors. For them, men are often an elusive and quixotic prize (in Maid Marion, Taddeo writes about Noni, “It was the opposite gender that had always eluded her. It seemed they always wanted something she hadn’t thought about. It was like going to the market for tea cake ingredients and coming home without the fucking English Breakfast.” Another description of Noni: “Noni was different. Neither gleaming nor wrecked. She was broken but perennially glued together.”)These women feel empty and discarded once they reach a certain age – their late 30s. Much attention is paid to appearances and comparing appearances. (In Air Supply, the narrator says, ““Sara was –and still is—prettier than me in a slutty 1990s sort of way.”) As a straight, married woman who adores her many girlfriends and who doesn’t think one woman loses when others win, this was a steep hill to climb.But still. Many – not all, but many – of the stories captured me and Lisa Taddeo’s writing is masterly and astute. Her concepts are powerful: for example, in the eponymous story, the dating app Ghost Lovers enables more ordinary girls to pursue their crushes while remaining composed in a Cyrano de Bergerac ruse. Other stories I loved are Air Supply, Maid Marion, Grace Magorian, and American Girl. I may not be the ideal reader but I’m still glad I read the collection of nine stories.

Each possibility leaves a trail ahead of you and behind you illuminated with the gold tint of pain.”“I can write the saddest verses tonight”. So wrote Pablo Neruda, an extraordinary poet who glorifies experience and is famed for conveying to others what we are. Neruda in the Park is an apt title for this debut book – in turns, riveting and exasperating, poetic and melodramatic, savvy and a tad naïve. Cleyvis Natera wants to have it both ways in creating both a literary tour de force and a crowd pleaser. It is credit to her talent that, while I preferred the first, I hung on, sometimes breathlessly, to the final page.Lux is 29 years old, a Harvard graduate, a highly ambitious lawyer on the partner track, and the only child of Dominican Republic immigrants. She is also a Black Latina who lives in Northar Park, a gentrifying area that is being plagued by a real estate developer’s vision of building luxury condos. In the very first chapter, she is blindsided by being fired from her law firm and not long afterwards, falls into a sweltering romance with an extraordinarily handsome, affluent and dare we say, sensitive white developer who is causing the havoc in her community.Fortunately, Cleyvis Natera sidesteps the stereotypical tropes about white-black unions and about “bad” developers versus “good” idealists or activists. Her focus is on something else: the meaning of home and authenticity and perhaps most of all, the emotional price tag that comes with the choices we make. The scenes between Lux and her mother, Eusebia, an integral part of the neighborhood who raised her daughter to be an achiever at all costs, are mesmerizing. As readers, we learn more about what drives Eusebia and how she has evolved are fascinating, and also meet Lux’s father, Vladimir, a New York cop who possesses his own work ethic and dreams.So are the observations of the great costs of pursuing beauty and the so-called American Dream and the sacrifices of achieving both. While gentrification is the theme but not the major focus, an understanding of the costs of displacement and socioeconomic distinctions, are well portrayed.I enjoyed this nicely crafted book and with the many questions it raises, I think it’s an ideal choice for a book club as well as personal reading.

The conversatiMidway through Mr. Watson and Me, the “me” character – a young Greek woman named Calista – ruminates on film with a potential paramour. The conversation centers on what great film should be in the 1960s – exposing the dark underbelly of the American Dream or leveraging the gentle, quintessentially Middle-European cynicism with elegance slyness and obliqueness.The scene isn’t a pivotal one, but for me, it sums up what Jonathan Coe has so masterfully accomplished in writing this novel. At a time when so many books fall into the category of dystopian or spec fiction (and there’s nothing wrong with that), Mr. Coe forgoes the bells and whistles and writes a beautiful, deceptively straightforward novel that, to use his words “suffuses you with its amber glow.”Mr. Wilder is, of course, Billy Wilder, the iconic Austrian-born Hollywood film director. Here, he’s at the end of his career, working with his writer partner, the great Iz Diamond on the film Fedora, and recognizing that he is falling into irrelevance now that the “kids with beards” (think: Spielberg) are nipping at his heels. Calista, on the other hand, is at the start of her own musical film career. She’s young, naïve, and brings a fresh perspective to the business, which is why Billy Wilder invites her to be his Greek interpreter when the filming of Fedora begins on the isle of Corfu. Now at age 57, with twin daughters about to embark on their own lives, much of this novel is in the form of reminiscences of a mature woman, looking backward.There is much to recommend the novel. The author has obviously done much research into Billy Wilder – who I know only from name and from some of his famed films – and brings him intimately to life as a fully-fleshed character. Within him, Wilder holds dark memories of the time he was compelled to leave Germany and of the people who were lost to him. There are definite tendrils about how art defines or captures the times we are living, the changing of the guard as a younger generation of filmmakers picks up the mantle, the unique perspective of filmmakers who have been molded by the heartbreak of a heinous world war, and the blending of art and life and how each impacts the other. All of this is blended with a memorable coming-of-age story Bittersweet, satisfying and captivating, Mr. Wilder and Me engaged me from start to finish.

Each individual has his or her own distinctive sound but when blended, the result is a single, richer sound.So it is here. The seven Shaw siblings experience the same version of a “truth” – their mother Marie, who suffered from severe depression, apparently chose to take her own life. The motherless siblings will contend with “own set of stories to negotiate, to tell or not tell, to remember or forget, to honor or dispense with, their own private collections of darkness and light, truths and lies.”Narrated by the siblings and their father, Jim, the chapters span in an unchronological order from 1911 to 1959. Each chapter is its own little gem and could easily stand alone as a short story, but when read together with all the other chapters, a multi-layered portrait of a family emerges. One theme that emerges is how unknowable each of us is to each other as we assume our family role and identity. Wendy, the oldest, is the appointed caregiver; Lane, the middle child, floats beneath the radar; Henry, the youngest, is the most sensitive; and so on. Yet each lives his or her own version of the shared story. For example, one sibling goes into near panic mode when his wife is not precisely on time (will he be deserted the way he was as a child?) Another experiences neurological symptoms and, when referred to a psychiatrist, wonders if she’s becoming her mother. Yet another becomes pregnant while very young (was it a rape or was she a wiling participant?) And another one, when in a position to perform an act of kindness, deliberately chooses not to. As the focus shifts from the child each of them once was to the adult each has become, the perspective deepens as we get hints of how the past impacts the present. In some instances, we see how the past reverberates not only to the next generation, but to the one after that.This is a beautifully written novel, remarkably crafted and insightfully written. It is particularly for fans of Elizabeth Strout, since the individual chapters that lead to a satisfying whole is reminiscent of Olive Kitteridge.

Geographically, culturally, geopolitically – countries have crossed into us, over us they’ve burnt us and built us back up. That does something to a place, to its identity. To be neither on one side nor the other-that is a different thing about being a bridge. You are neither here nor there. You are simply between.”The same description could be applied to Min Ford, a biracial Korean American who goes back to Seoul after living in LA to find “that elusive and tenuous sense that he’d finally come home.”Instead, his quest for fitting in and feeling whole never truly reaches fruition. He becomes involved with a Korean woman, Yu-jin – a brilliant and beautiful young woman whose controlling father happens to be the National Minister of Defense. The father is ornately proud of Yu-jin – as he would of any prized possession – and personally charts her life, starting with a prestigious college and moving forward to the financial and political arena.All begins to go off track when Yu-jin is matched by an algorithm with So-ra for a roommate with a 98% probability of success. As Yu-jin begins to discover and reinvent herself and as her attraction to her independent and strong-willed roommate grows, her father’s scrutiny increases. Crushed by familial and cultural judgments, Yu-jin dies of a suspected suicide early on and Min is determined to find out the truth behind this desperate act.Told in alternating chapters – Yu-jin’s and Min’s – the book questions how well any of us really know each other. The yearning for a more authentic self is shared by both, although Min’s chapters tend to pale compared to Yu-jin’s, who is the more interesting character. The glue that holds Min and Yu-jin together takes time to understand, as these two outsiders recognize something in each other.Overlaid with this story is the tendrils of a country that squashes non-conformity and by doing so, sets in motion the tragic events that occur. When choosing one’s own destiny becomes impossible, when that most basic desire is crushed, the result is despair.When We Fell Apart is a cinematic book – perhaps overly so. The scenes take shape before the reader’s eyes and at times, the author controls the nuances.

Was it an alleSomewhere, early on in this inventive and sometimes disorienting book, I gave up trying to pigeonhole what kind of genre I was reading. Was it an allegorical tale about the journey of motherhood? A fabulist story of a mother who gives birth to an owl-baby who is very different from her dog-baby cousins? A thinly veiled tale of a new and insecure mother who begins to lose her grip? Or perhaps a feminist story of women and she-babies who need to rise up and claim their own power?I simply surrendered to the lush linguistics, the hallucinatory plot, the sheer and arresting beauty of this work. In the three nights I read it, it began haunting my dreams when I put it down. And I realized that this story – combining the best of experimental fiction with realism – is not to be pigeon-holed.After all, that is the enduring message of Chouette, which asks, Is life nothing more than a continuous retreat from our own true selves, as we’re hammered into shape by special schools and social cues? What is a normal life, anyway – and is it something to truly strive for? What if it’s just okay to be whomever we were born to be – an owl- baby, a dog-baby, a cow-baby – without yielding to the pressure to conform? Tiny, knows from the moment she is pregnant that she is destined to give birth to an owl-baby. She names the baby Chouette and her owlness is with her from the very beginning. She sleeps too much, crawls too late, bites and shrieks. Tiny’s husband – who insists on calling the baby Charlotte – is first distanced and appalled, then determined to “fix” his daughter. But what if she doesn’t really need fixing?I am not a mother myself. But I have seen so many parents try to shape and mold their children into something they’re not. This is a novel that anyone can relate to --- the quest for truth and authenticity in a world ill-equipped for non-conformity.I loved the sui generis tone that is, in turn, poignant, darkly humorous, incisive, horrifying, and wise. I should add that Tiny hears music all the time and the author helpfully provides a list of that classical music at the end. I’m familiar with some of the compositions but not all of them, and intend to play some of the music for an added appreciation of this tale.

And indeed, she may be right. After the mess we’re making of the world – with pandemics, climate ravages, wars and demagogues masquerading as “putting America first-ers”, it is tempting to wonder what a start-over might look like…or consider alternative scenarios for our world, such as simulations.Sea of Tranquility is a bold and dazzling novel that captured my attention from page one and just did not let go. Such is the power of Emily St. John Mandel’s prose. It starts in 1912 when the rascally scion of a well-positioned English family is exiled from that family and finds his way to Canada. There, he enters a black forest, where he becomes disoriented by the sounds of a violin seemingly echoing in what may be a train station, airship terminal, or cathedral. It shakes him to his core.That experience is repeated in 2020 – the first year of COVID – where a composer is playing an old piece of video that erringly resembles what was heard over a century before. Fast forward again to the 23rd century, where Olive Llewellyn – raised in a globed lunar colony – is on an earth tour to promote her book Marienbad, which happens to have a scene that is coincidentally close to what was experienced in the other two sections. Finally, Sea of Tranquility makes a leap to the 25th century, and the reader begins to gain glimpses about what is going on – and where this book is going.Sea of Tranquility asks, “What is the nature of reality and what happens when moments of history bleed into each other? Does humanity feed on crisis? Are we narcissistic enough to believe we are uniquely important– or should we just accept that sometimes things are random and no star burns forever? Are the catastrophic erasures we experience every day (the death of a loved one, for example) no less compelling than events that rock all humanity?Sea of Tranquility is incredibly mesmerizing, immersive, and haunting.

In fact, I can’t ever remember encountering a character like her.Prematurely old in her 60s, Elena suffers from the curse of Parkinson’s, which she addresses as Herself (because when she thinks about it, she thinks “fucking whore illness.”) Now her adult daughter Rita – forced into the position of being her caretaker – has been found dead, hung from the belfry of the church. Suicide, plain and simple – except Elena knows different. She knows that Rita hated going out in the rain and never would have gone to church that day.This astounding novel is about a lot of things, but perhaps no more so than mothers and daughters and what each of them is capable of enduring. The portrait of Elena’s disease isn’t pretty; she lives from pill to pill and plans her days around how her drug, levodopa, is assimilated into her body. In fact, the book is divided into morning, midday and afternoon, the times when Elena takes her second, third and fourth pills. Hunched over, drooling, unable to accomplish the basics of daily living, Elena perseveres, and she is unable to imagine her daughter not being able to do so.Rita, however, lives a life of quiet desperation. And it’s Rita who brings the third person into this novel – Isabel, a woman she saved years ago from the “sin” of abortion, bringing her to Elena’s house. Elena now thinks that reaching Isabel, whose daughter is now grown up, to help her find the truth about Rita’s death will evoke answers. After all, Isabel owes her…doesn’t she?Some of the scenes that follow are electrifying. Certainly, it shook me to my core. It will shake up any glossed over ideas you may harbor about aging, disability, and yes, abortion. It will make you wonder who owns a woman’s body: the unforgiving church, another person, or each woman herself. This book couldn’t be timelier and Claudia Pinero’s prose couldn’t be more masterful.

If this book doesn’t win prizes, then there is no justice.Lia has cancer and she’s going to die. This we know is true. Is death a first-person or a third-person experience? The unusual choice of narration – sometimes from Lia’s perspective and sometimes from the perspective of her disease – is a stunning balancing act that this author pulls off with aplomb. As Lia weakens, a number of characters – all of whom have left their mark on Lia’s life in one way or another – interact with the disease: Harry (The Gardener) who has been nothing if not loyal and steadfast; her teenage daughter Iris (Yellow) who, as a babe, literally inhabited the color; her mother Anne (Dove) who is there for her now but may never have loved her in the way she needed; her ex-lover Matthew (Fossil) who came to her home as a boy and who may have usurped her mother’s love while commandeering her own; and more.Along with the malevolence of her disease come searing scenes from her outward world: Lia, exhausted from the “red devil” chemo, who is approached by a drunken man who grabs at her breasts, only to find empty space…or as a young girl, resting in a hospital after a car accident with Matthew and not knowing who her mother is referring to when she says, “I couldn’t live without...” or the sweet mother-daughter word-games that Lia plays with Iris, knowing time is short.It is words that carry the story. At one point, Lia asks Iris, “Will you promise me you’ll always think like that?” “Like what?” “With limitless possibility of what things are, what words are?” The words here are filled with bursting energy and they swirl around on pages or boldly stand out or take the shape of poetry or sometimes, of myth. Like Lia’s cells, the words sting and recede and mutate and even take the shapes of the people who have shaped her life, like the Dove. This novel is astonishing and will likely be my top pick for 2022.

It meant that if you could define what was absent, create a map for the missing, that was also a way of knowing a thing.”When Tang Yitian, a professor of mathematics in America, returns to his Chinese rural village to find his missing father, he must contend with the pieces of his life that have also remained maddingly obscured through the years.In creating a map of what is missing, debut writer Belinda Huijan Tang has written a spellbinding book about memory and place and familial duty and finding one’s own path when the going isn’t easy. This is an astoundingly good book and I envy anyone who has yet to discover it.The author creates a world where the only ticket out of a confined and monotonous rural existence is the coveted gaokao – an exam that only a very small percentage of Chinese pass. Yitian, a country boy, has very little chance of passing while Hanwen, a sent-down Shanghai girl (a girl who is placed in the country’s rustication campaign after her mother fell out of favor with the Cultural Revolution) is far more likely to earn her escape route to a prized Chinese university.After the results are in, it is years before the two of them see each other again. As their trajectories intersect once more, the missing pieces becoming more glaring. We know that Yitian is estranged from his father – but why? What has happened to Hanwen in the interval? How do our past histories and memories converge with our current histories and realities and can we ever really go home again? At the end of the day, how do we reach forgiveness and open ourselves to receiving other’s gifts?Along the way, we gain exposure to the ancestral bonds that bind us at the same time that our future casts a narrow shining light. We learn about the post-Cultural Revolution in China, the unimaginable stress of passing the gaokao, the deeply-ingrained mores and values of Chinese life, and the bittersweetness of imaging how life could have been different.This is a wonderful novel, filled with humanity, rife with meaning, and deeply felt.

And I feared what I wanted, the urge to jump over, dive deep. What he’d done was crack something new inside of me and let it break the world.”From the very first page of Little Rabbit, I was spellbound. I read it eagerly and voraciously, not at all sure where I was being led, but gratified where I ended up.Our unnamed narrator is barely 30 years old, on the cusp of her writing career, experiencing all the possibilities of life – including her own sexuality. She identifies as queer, and she is part of a trio of supportive friends who seem to genuinely care for each other. But early on, she meets a much older (51-year-old) man, a renowned choreographer, at an artists’ retreat in Maine. Suddenly, she is in uncharted territory, expanding her own body’s boundaries, wondering, “How did I get here? You are so unexpected.”The question that permeates the book is: “Can a queer young woman who is in the state of becoming truly desire a confident and celebrated older man without deleting the very essence of herself?” The answer is not easy. Our narrator’s roommate and best friend, Annie, is invested in preventing the transformation of the woman whom she knows so intimately. Her parents are far from on board.Our narrator consistently feels the push-pull of wanting something so badly that the wanting threatens to obliterate her. The allure of power and sex combined in a man who truly wants her with every fabric of his being is as threatening as it is intoxicating. The result is explosive and invigorating, enormously sensual and downright hypnotic. The novel digs deep into the thin line between healthy versus punishing love and ravenous desire versus obsession. Along the way it touches on the nebulous boundary between art and real life (what happens when art begins to encroach upon your real life), and the various ways we define self – from sexual identity to the negativity of ageism. And it explores the very chemistry of erotic love and sexual fluidity and freedom.To say I was enthralled is an understatement.

The village needed embalmers and William, with his newly minted embalmers designation, answers the call. What he witnesses there is so horrendous that he resolves never to have children of his own. It almost, but not quite, causes him to leave the love of his life, Gloria as well.But, as Gloria tells William, “This isn’t just about Aberfan.” In fact, William is a very talented choirist, trained at one of the best schools in Cambridge, and singled out to sing the most prestigious solo there. Why did he turn his back on such a promising future and join the family business as a funeral embalmer? Why is he often more comfortable with the dead than the living? And what caused the break with his widowed mother, who seems to have an intense dislike to his father’s surviving identical twin Robert and his life partner, Howard?There is much to love about this book, which draws you in and moves you along. But too often, just when Ms. Wroe needs to take her theme just a little bit further, she cops out. Homophobia is rampant in the 1960s and it is evident that this must be the main reason why Evelyn (William’s mother) dislikes Robert and Howard and is afraid of their influence on her son. Yet the reason given is that Evelyn can’t bear to see her dead husband’s identical twin be “happy in love” when she has been deprived. I don’t buy it. I think the reason is far darker.I also thought that William’s pure selfishness – bordering on narcissism – towards his mother and later, towards Gloria – was way out of proportion to what he experienced. In the case of his mother, the incident that took William away from his music career and ended his relationship with his mother is given a great deal of buildup. Yet it fizzes out when the reader finally finds out what happened at Cambridge. Similarly, his treatment of Gloria – which he blames on Aberfan – seems to trivialize the real tragedy there (parents losing their children) as William commandeers it to justify his own loss of innocence. This book captured my attention but is not without its flaws.

It is where they feel truly alive and what they look forward to more than anything else. It is their passion. But eventually, there are cracks – first one, then multiples. Eventually, “the crack opens to onto a second and deeper world that lies just beneath the surface of ours.” Cast out of their routine and forced to submerge, these swimmers are now treading water once again. One cannot help but think of COVID and its transformation of society.The first half of the book calls up the lists that were such an arresting part of Ms. Otsuka’s Buddha in the Attic. Each of us becomes part of a “we” – the first-person plural – that embraces us while holding us a little bit on the sidelines.All that changes in the second part. Suddenly, we plunge into unchartered waters as we are set inside one of the swimmer’s changed circumstances – Alice, a woman with dementia. No longer part of the “we” community any longer, Alice is now in a facility, losing her memory, becoming part of a new and regimented community where each member of it is, in essence, alone. Little by little, she begins to disappear.As Alice fades, her daughter – a novelist of Japanese descent – returns. There are cracks in their relationship, too, yet the bond between mother and daughter is strong. They are not unlike two swimmers, in different lanes, that every now and then, touch.I will end this  on a personal note. My own mother died four years ago of Lewy Body Dementia. Our bond was close and witnessing the deterioration was shattering. At one point, I asked her, “Do you love me?” and she seemed not to understand. A few minutes later her face lit up and she said, “I remember something. I love you! I do love you!” When she died, I eulogized her with a variation of Julie Otsuka’s Diem Perdidi chapters – what was remembered, what was lost.

In his spellbinding Man Booker Prize nominated book, HisThis is not the first time Scottish author Graeme Macrae Burnet intertwines fact and fiction. In his spellbinding Man Booker Prize nominated book, His Bloody Project, he presents a series of fictionalized historical documents focusing on a gruesome triple homicide by a teenage Scottish farmer who happens to share the author’s last name.In Case Study, again, the author begins with a breathtaking confession: after he blogged about a notorious 1960s psychotherapist (who wrote a book with the audacious title, Kill Your Self), he received a series of never-before-revealed notebooks written by a female patient of the “great man.”The woman had sought out Braithwaite under an assumed name after her sister did in fact kill herself after being ministered to by the psychotherapist. Did Braithwaite even exist in reality? The answer is yes. He was a sort of guru of his times, eschewing all doctrine, and believing that the self, as it were, is a fraudulent conceit His archetypal line is, “To escape despair, don’t kill yourself; kill your Self.”Intriguing premise, for sure. As in his former work, Burnet enjoys layering the possibilities of fiction with veritable reality – and not-so-veritable reality. The problem I had is that the author of the notebooks – self-named Rebecca Smyth – seemed, to me, to be a more well-defined and fascinating character than Braithwaite. When the two are “in session”, the book simmers and sizzles. But too much time is spent away from these interactions and the Braithwaite sections – which may or may not be true in entirety – read more like pages of researched biography.The prose, surprisingly, seems more aligned with turn-of-the-century than the more free-wheeling counterculture 1960s. Perhaps the early century inspires greater trust or maybe Burnet is layering one time frame upon another.

She’s the person who shies from the spotlight and who lets others shine while retreating into the background.Fukyuko is the perfect foil for an editor like Hijiri Ishikawa who appreciates her work ethic and who is more than happy to befriend a woman who demands so little for herself and is always a wiling ear for Hijiri’s vibrant and outspoken ego. She supports Fukyuko in going freelance, befriending her and providing her with a steady flow of work.All might have gone on like that had Fuyuko not met a considerably older man named Mitsutsuka, a high school physics teacher.

Far from an awkward and deadened woman, Fukyuko teems with life. The book is a masterwork of dissecting perception and reality: none of these three main characters act or are precisely as you might imagine.

Both books, at their core, are about brilliant tech entrepreneurs who invent ways to gain access to every memory ever had.Egan’s version is a new technology called Own Your Unconscious – sharing every memory in exchange for access to others. Vara’s version is an Internet-connected device called The Harmonica, which provides access to all memories. Both books present estranged citizens who have rejected the new way, called the “eluders” in Candy House and the “exes” in Immortal King Rao.I am not suggesting that either of these talented authors “borrowed” from the other; the books are being published at almost the same time. I do think it is an interesting commentary on our post (or present) pandemic society that writers are exploring the theme of memory preservation and human longing for real connection.The concept of an India-born biotechnological genius and his daughter, Athena Rao, who tries to escape him after being implanted with his memories to make him immortal, is compelling. King Rao’s Coconut Corporation is evocative of the Apple Corporation with a dystopian spin – a corporate-run government where everyone (at least everyone who doesn’t opt out) is a Shareholder. Everything is determined by an algorithm (or ALGO), which is unerringly spot-on with where capitalism appears to be heading.Equally compelling is the human-interest story. There’s a touch of Miranda, from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, in Athena. The technological aspects do not undermine or overshadow the human elements: the complicated relationship between father and daughter, the themes of betrayal and love and longing and understanding, and the courage it takes to open up to one another. The end message is poignant and timely: as we continue to drive ourselves to extinction, what if we could “gather up our stories and hold on to them for safekeeping?...

Elizabeth Alexander writes, “…if we believe that striving for absolute truth with the word is one of the ways that human beings an communicate deeply enough in order to overcome that which is not understood between us…might we ask: What is the power of our words? How are we responsible for them? What can we do with the , and do words move us closer to the hoped-for ideal of beloved community?”This spare but powerful book is proof absolute that words do move us closer. By using history (which does repeat itself – the current campaign against critical race theory is almost identical to the campaign used against John Hope Franklin’s groundbreaking book in the 1960s), as well as poetry, literature, and personal experience, this Pulitzer Prize finalist and empathetic human being’s voice is ever-strong.One of the saddest and most astounding examples she gives is a question – from an academic, no less – whether “Blacks cry.” If they don’t cry, after all, they’re not really human, are they?

After a while, you become so invested that the outer world melts away as the characters completely demand your attention – and empathy.Such was my reading experience of three best friends, starting in 1986 – young schoolmates Adrien and Etienne and the girl Nina – which is interspersed by chapters set in 2017, when they have grown up and grown apart.With the passage of time comes a metamorphosis that tests the limits of friendship as all three are molded by their fate and their secrets. One of the characters will harbor a secret that is existential in nature and will change the very essence of self-identity and outward perception. Another character is on a quest to determine the responsibility for events that occurred in youth. And the third suffers a tragedy that forces a choice and a chain of events that leads to a feeling of suffocation.I’ve teased out the scenarios because the discovery of what the three must individually face is a big part of the joy of reading a novel like this. Suffice to say that Valerie Perrin is a master at racketing up interest and suspense. We root for these characters, despite the fact that each of them is badly flawed and sometimes makes the wrong choices. There is so much humanity in each of them that we identify with their outsider positions and want them to break free. The dialogue set up between the past (1986 onward) to the present (2017) is particularly compelling, giving us information that the younger-self characters do not possess.At the end of the day, this novel is a book about friendship: how it changes, evolves, mutates, and ultimately, endures despite the world and all its challenges.

As one of those characters eventually says, “I don’t want to pretend that Anne was all that different from the way we were…I want her to have doubts, real doubts—like the ones you have, the ones I had—but by the end, she comes to believe in the people around her and in the power of telling them her story.”The message is clear: our stories save us during or even after a time when the world destroys us.In their high school years, these teens – many of whom are wounded themselves – try to understand and shape what their stories will be. Some stories are recontextualized, misunderstood or just plain made up. The stories that are created now will come back to haunt them decades later, when the sanctity of childhood is sullied by the presence of something close to evil.When speaking of evil, it’s hard to not tie in the Trump years and the damage of another lesser type of monster who has turned truth into lies and lies into truth. The hunting down of immigrants – children, really – echoes to some degree the malignant excesses of the Gestapo in its murder of Anne Frank, who was barely 16 when she died. History repeats. It’s repeating still.Finally, as a Chicagoan for many decades (prior to a recent relocation to Durham), I cannot even begin to express how much I loved Adam Langer’s sense of place. It gave me enormous pleasure to revisit the neighborhoods, sites, restaurants and so forth that made Chicago such a diverse and fascinating city.

Overlay the New Hampshire opioid crisis that is robbing too many people of their lives.Mix it all together and you have the makings of a quirky, charming, small-town saga where (as the author states in her author’s notes) everyone is rooting for everyone and loving a place.The place is Everton, New Hampshire. The “everyone” is Emma, a 22-year-old medical school drop-out, her opioid-addicted brother Auggie, their father Clive (who is dying of a brain disease that can only be diagnosed upon his death), and a number of supporting characters, many of whom are in the fifth grade. Emma’s in a pickle. She doesn’t know where her life is going, her best estranged friend, Crystal, is missing, her father is hanging up posters all over town, and to top it off, she has lost the power to save his life (and in a more existential way, her own).The question that haunts the novel is: how do we once again believe in the miraculous when our earliest hopes and dreams have deserted us?At first, I thought that I was reading a cross-over YA novel. But before too long, I recognized that the book was actually a sort of fairy tale filled with poignancy and offbeat humor and sprinkled with the kinds of exaggerated oddities that define a beloved small town.Intertwined with a treasure trove of Ernest Harold Baynes photos (Baynes actually lived in Meriden, a village of Plainfield) and his repurposed writings, this lovingly crafted book casts a spell that is sorely needed in these current times of stressful times.

Two books that instantly come to mind are The Dry by Jane Harper and Disappearing Earth by Julia Phillips.Haley Scrivenor is not seeking to recreate the wheel. What she IS looking to do is tell a darn good story that keeps you up past bedtime and engages you with fully dimensional characters who you truly care about.Getting to the crux of the story: a 12-year-old girl named Esther seems to vanish into thin air in Durton, Australia (known by its locals as Dirt Town). Well-liked by everyone, her best friend Ronnie and their other friend Lewis (who is harboring a secret of his own) are devastated. We meet a cast of characters that range from these children to abusive or unhappy or secretive adults and a gay detective, Sarah, who has just detonated a relationship with her girlfriend and harbors secrets of her own. All of this is backed by a choir of children (the “we” chapters) who live in this claustrophobic town, where everyone knows everything and everybody but in fact, know nothing. The author writes: “It had seemed natural that [she] knew what had happened like the town was a living, breathing entity. Information would be carried on the wings of small, dull-colored birds and the backs of open-mouthed lizards, drawn through the dry dirt by the whispering of gnarled roots, swept overland on hot breezes.”The prose – and the insights – are elevated from other books of this genre and honestly, when I began reading, I couldn’t put it down. The missing girl’s life affects the landscape for the rural Australian town and reveals we are who we are because of each other. Young Esther will always be a Dirt Town child, as we all are – always imperfect, but also always a catalyst for revealing truths about ourselves and where we live.My reading experience was a 5-star.

Who don’t murder them, but lose them. What are they called, how do you say it, who is someone whose child has died?”There are no words for a woman who loses her twin six-year-old daughters – Alessia and Livia. Not in English, in German, in French, in Italian, or in Spanish.The very concept of a woman whose estranged husband takes the girls, on a weekend not unlike any other, and takes his own life. Of the twins, there is not a space. They vanish into thin air. Most likely, they are dead. But without closure, there’s always the possibility they are not.Anyone expecting a wrenching story of a woman who can barely control her emotions will find something quite different here. Irina is a survivor. Obviously bereft for her daughters – her whole life is transformed – she has the courage to say “yes” to life. Based on the true story of Irina Lucidi, who was married to a Swiss husband, the case received much publicity in Italy (but not here in the United States).Particularly frustrating is the way the case is handled – or should I say, mishandled – Swiss authorities who carry biases against southern Europeans and women in general. Much of this book is in the form of letters to various authorities (one of them in particular lays out all the ways that the investigation was bungled or caught up in ridiculous red tape) or letters to people who were kind to her in the past (a younger brother, a dear friend).Irina’s conscious choice to move on with a new and healthy love is inspiring. One of the saddest lines is her new love’s insistence that their new home contain a room for the girls in the event that they return. While Irina pragmatically knows her daughters are very likely dead, that gesture is very comforting to her.Both the mother (who launched Missing Children Switzerland) and the author have turned a personal tragedy into a work of hope.

You savor it, word by exquisite word. And when you turn the last page, you slowly awake, as if from a spell.At the core is a father-son relationship that becomes more and more menacing until the unnerving and unexpected (but not inorganic) conclusion. Lucas is the son of a mother who has gone mad at the hands of a father who is cruel, unemotional, and Napoleonic. Watched over by a trio of nursemaids, Lucas watches his father’s worst traits ignite when two strangers, Eloy and Felisberto, first arrive.As images of rot and filth and insanity begin to build, we realize that Lucas is looking back at the initial scenes across time. “I am the creator of a father…a father who drags himself through my mind: repentant, a prisoner of my memory.” The power of the father over the son after all these years has not abated, and now, years later, the visceral hatred he carries when he returns home, has taken on a life of its own.Lucas has learned well from his father: everything that rots is sacred, everything that rots is called life. Alienated from god and man, Lucas does find a curious sense of symmetry and rightness in the world of insects – particularly the world of arthropods, who the world belongs to more than it belongs to us.There’s so much here that it would be unfair to deprive any readers of the heady experience of discovering a debut writer whose words soar and transform.

What are the fictions that compose our identity? Or do our lives eventually become the written and verbal fictions that others craft?Since I am an early reader, I had the joy of discovering the alchemy created by Hernan Diaz without any advance knowledge or perceptions. In this , I’m going to try hard to ensure that others are equally spellbound by some of the more intriguing shifts.At the start, the author pays evident homage to Edith Wharton in his presentation of the legendary financier Benjamin Rask. In unadorned but elegant prose, we learn the story of Rask’s ascension to the economic stratosphere (of course, it didn’t hurt that he was born into family money) and the influence of his wife, Helen, who hails from a family of old money that is now in a precarious state. So convincing is that portrayal that I actually Googled this couple, and when the results proved lacking, I refreshed and googled again.For nearly 100 pages, we are immersed in their compelling story but I have to admit I thought, “Okay, good writing that’s rather evocative. But what’s the big deal?”The “big deal” is revealed through the next three sections – revealed in a novel-within-a-novel, an unfinished manuscript, a memoir, and finally a diary – as other narrators take the stage. As layer upon layer is added, we view the first 100 pages with whole new eyes. Who the narrators are – and what is revealed – is for the reader to discover.Certain themes and motifs begin to repeat. One surrounds the allure of money: is it merely a fiction – a dirty stack of bills that we use as a measure to value all other commodities? Does that then make finance capital a fiction of a fiction? Or is it the god of commodities and the foundation of making all things possible?For those (to coin Thomas Wolfe) “masters of the universe”, how do we separate the ever-present myths from the realities? Where do the women who stand with them fit in? Why force women into stereotypes , putting them in their place for the purpose of providing a better story of themselves for history? And finally, are we all complicit in the stories we create if the price is high enough? The more I consider this novel, the more blown away I am with it. It is an exhilarating read that goes to the very core of distinguishing fact from fiction.

This was, aFirst, a full confession: I became an early reader of Secret Identity on a whim, not at all sure I would be the right reader for the book. This was, after all, a novel about comic books and how interesting could the topic really be for a serious reader? Especially a reader who can only remember reading Archie comics and Betty and Veronica as a child?Well, let me tell you something: it only took a few pages to get me hooked. By the time I was half-way through, I couldn’t turn pages fast enough. This author, who wrote a number of comic books himself, knows the inner bones of the comic book business. And it reveals itself in every word he writes.The book showcases Carmen Valdez, who cramped childhood room was loaded with boxes of comic books because “she had to be become someone else to survive.” She is an assistant to the chief honcho at Triumph Comics in the mid-1970s, when women, with a few notable exceptions, were shut out from writing for comic books. And Carmen is also a mostly closeted lesbian, her own secret identity at a time when the LGBTQ movement was still years away.When her friend Harvey Stern, a lanky and ambitious junior editor, invites her to collaborate with him to pitch a new series, she is ecstatic that her long-time dream of being a writer may actually be realized – first as a ghostwriter and later, stepping into the spotlight. Together, mainly with Carmen’s insights and talent, they create a female superhero called the Legendary Lynx. She is the biggest hit in Triumph Comics meager collection – and then Harvey is murdered.Secret Identity functions well on so many levels. It gives readers a gripping look at the inner workings of comic book companies, who depend on underpaid and overly ambitious freelancers to create a masterwork. It succeeds mightily in exploring the minefields that women – particularly gay women – faced in the 1970s in trying to achieve – well, anything. It reveals the sheer joy of creating a piece of mythology – not just “another grown, tough perfect hero-man – another steel-jawed Superman” but a character with real-world problems, empowering teens to imagine themselves as the hero. And it truly captures New York at its grimy, sinewy and electrifying best – and worst. Also, it’s interspersed with fantastic actual comics from artist Sandy Jarrell – oh, and the prose? Well-paced and mesmerizing.If I had one issue with the novel, it’s that very early on, I believed Harvey Stern was not Carmen’s friend but an over-striving people-user. It was hard for me to understand why Carmen did not reach the same conclusion and why she insisted on referring to him as a good friend and a nice person. Her character is too smart for that self-deception.But this is a trifle in the grand scheme of things. My rating is 4.5.

It wasn’t merely in where they came from but in where they were going and how they would get there.”This can’t be a debut novel. It’s too spellbinding, too unflinching, too darn GOOD. I could sum up this  in just two words: READ IT!It spans just about every genre you can think of: literary fiction, coming of age, social justice, Filipino mythology and serial murder fiction. Melissa Chadburn has a voice and style that is sui generis.From the very first pages, we know that Willie, a “pakshet trick” kills Marina, described as a “throwaway” in a filthy room in a pig farm. We know something else, too: Marina didn’t totally die that day. Her body is taken over by an aswang, who has been passed down in her family line through heredity for seven generations. The aswang can only activate within a lineage when someone has died with unfinished business. This is the aswang’s final round: seven generations of duty, love and magic.Marina indeed has unfinished business. In heartbreaking detail, we learn how and why Marina – who survived through a wrenching childhood and the totally dysfunctional U.S. Child Protective Services – did not survive her inevitable destiny. She may not realize it, but through her lost life, she steps closer and closer to her murderer, who is also lost and seeking a kind of mercy that life holds back from him.The book derives its name from a scene in which young Marina is striving to save a bird that has gotten itself stuck in the water heater. Her Ma shoves the bird up into the fat drum of the heater until there is a crunching of bones. When Marina shakily asks her mother what she did, the answer is, “Just what we have to do, sweetie. Help a hurt thing on its way–a tiny upward shove.”The symbolism of this line haunts the rest of the narrative. There are dizzying forays into some of the worst elements of humanity: societal apathy and carelessness, sexual violence and self-hatred, addiction and despair and every now and then, a glimpse of the power of connection and love. I couldn’t put this book down. I didn’t want to put it down. And I envy every reader who is coming to it anew.

That is to say, she is a master at it, uncannily capturing all the eccentricities and quirks but never, not for one minute, judging or belittling her characters.As you can tell, I’m an unabashed Anne Tyler fan, and I’m so delighted to see that at age 81, she is still going strong. I don’t just read Ms. Tyler’s books – I surrender to them. A day or two later, I emerge, blinking a little and re-acclimating myself to my own world after being happily submerged in hers.Like many of her past books, French Braid is about a mismatched family that consistently misses the connection that is more evident in larger, more boisterous families. The patriarch and matriarch are Mercy – a housewife-turned-artist-of-sorts and her emotionally awkward husband Robin, who have three children – Alice, Lily and David – who in turn have their own children.As with other families, this one hides their uncomfortable truths, allows a few self-deceptions, and provides little kindnesses and little cruelties. As each character takes his or her turn dancing into the spotlight, the authenticity is so achingly real it sometimes took my breath away. It is not Anne Tyler’s way to build up to a crashing crescendo. It’s the little moments that stick in our minds: the wistfulness of a husband whose wife spends most of her time in her art studio while he mines their memories for a 50th anniversary surprise…the granddaughter and grandmother with a special connection whose train journey doesn’t go precisely as planned…another grandmother, decades later, who draws a deep breath of the scent that her grandson has left behind. The title, French Braid, comes from a tightly woven hairstyle that, when undone, falls in little leftover squiggles for hours afterwards. One character says, “That’s how families work, too. You think you’re free of them but you’re never really free; the ripples are crimped in forever.”That is the beauty of an Anne Tyler novel. She notices things that we’ve known all along and then expresses them in a way that’s so beautifully-said and so spot-on that we wonder why we never thought of it in quite that way before.

Who will be afflicted – and more importantly, why?Alexis Schaitkin, who blew me away with her debut novel Saint X, is back with her sophomore novel, a work of speculative fiction, that has nothing in common with her first book. And I’m glad to report that it’s good. VERY good. Turn-the-pages good.We are instantly immersed in the logic of this world, where strangers are scarce and everything outside of it is “elsewhere.” Wives prick their husbands with a silver hairpin and comingle their blood. Women mostly hang out in threesomes. When motherhood comes, it opens women to pain and great heights of beauty and of love that “people elsewhere would never know because they did not know what it was like to love in the shadow of our affliction.”Vera, our first-person narrator, will embark on a sort of hero’s journey as she early on meets her first stranger, gets married, and becomes a mother. It would, of course, be unfair to provide what this journey entails. It would be easy enough to read this novel on its simplest level: an atmospheric fairy-tale-of-sorts of a strange town.But dig a little deeper and Alexis Schaitkin is tackling the very nature of motherhood and the anxieties and transformations that lie in wait. It may well be that every newly minted mother worries whether her love is healthy enough, lives in fear of separation, yet reaches a point where that separation is inevitable. And it may also be true that we all come from a place we will never move on from, that we hate and love in equal measures, and that others who live elsewhere can never fully understand.Delving into the most basic of questions, Alexis Schaitkin explores, “What is home? What is motherhood? What is healthy love?” The fact that she can do it in such a magical and hypnotic manner reveals that she is a writer to be reckoned with.

Add to those stories this one.”Vigil Harbor is a story about human endurance, set in a small and insulated peninsular east coast town where a group of loosely connected individuals are staking their patch of ground in an increasingly uncertain world.It’s a world with which we are sadly becoming more and more familiar, day by day--blighted with the effects of climate change, plagued by spectacular storms, contagions, pandemics and pandemonium. But now we are propelled 10 years into the future where all these factors have become part and parcel of everyday life.Julia Glass brings her trademark insights into her characters, who, despite the losses they’ve experienced – both on a macrocosmic and microcosmic level – never lose their humanity. We meet several of them: college student Brecht who is coping with the fallout of a terrorist attack in NYC and is now back in Vigil Harbor; Celestino, a landscaping expert whose status as an illegal immigrant makes him consistently wary; newly minted friends Mike and Margo, whose spouses have run off with each other; Austin, a famed architect whose lifework is to build homes that can withstand hurricanes…and more.Each of these characters is in stasis, coping with past losses and fears and obstacles to moving freely forward. When two more people arrive on the peninsula – a former “friend” of Celestino who is not at all welcomed by him, and a woman in mourning for her recently deceased love, it is bound to ignite a greater crisis, and just maybe, a stimulus for personal growth.There are the emotional devastations the characters feel individually – and those that affect them as part of humanity. At times I felt a touch of authorial intrusion as Julia Glass consistently drums home how actions have consequences and what we can anticipate if we go down the path we are currently on. I would have preferred a bit more nuance (although I most solidly agree with her on her conclusions). One of the themes that is explored is whether we are long past the age of needing to believe in magic. A fantastical element she introduces suggests that we most certainly are not.Despite the bleakness, there is much hope: when we connect, when we give ourselves over to love, when we pursue our most authentic selves, and when we recognize that sometimes our knowledge of what is “real” is actually a dearth of imagination, we survive and even thrive. In essence, the author maps out a blueprint to what we need to consider important in this crazy world.

They cry out for an epilogue.Over two years ago, I read A Girl Returned – a book narrated by a young teenage girl whose life is turned upside down when she is returned to her birth family by the people she believes to be her parents. We never learn her name but we learn about her poignant story as she adjusts from being a beloved single child to a living with a large, poor family who are her flesh-and-blood. And we meet her younger sister, Adriana, who shares her bed and worships her fiercely.The book ends in a harrowing manner. It’s not a novel easily forgotten. So I was overjoyed when I heard that Donatella Di Pietrantonio was writing a sequel. This time, we meet up with the narrator – still unnamed – as she reunites with her “alive and dangerous” sister Adriana who shows up at her door with a baby boy in tow.Our narrator is married now to a dentist, a love that is forecast by her mother to end in doom. Both sisters share “sacred, slightly twisted loves” and are, in essence, girls who ran away from home, even though they have run to different paths. The author writes, “With my sister, I shared a legacy of words not said, gestures omitted, care denied. And rare, unexpected kindness. We were girls of no mother.”Throughout the book, there is a push-pull between the sisters, who on some elemental level, need each other and yet who are uneasy when together. As readers, we navigate their back story, which will surely be more textured for those of us who have read A Girl Returned. And we explore the tapestry of their lives that range from the smorgasbord of emotions elicited by a complex mother to the complex feelings derived from casting one’s lot with damaged men. There are moments that are so beautifully conveyed that readers are bound to ache with empathy. The timeframe can switch suddenly with the fluidity of consciousness and sometimes it can catch the reader off balance. More than once, I scrambled to right myself. With that one caveat, the book is a fine continuation of a sister’s story that is as universal as any story of two sisters yet unique in its own special way.

The first are the “warm” books – the ones that embrace you in a bear hug and pull you into their fictional orb. The second are the “cool” books that hold you at an arm’s length and that you end up admiring but not particularly loving.Run and Hide is the latter. I was intrigued by its premise: “an intimate story of achieving material progress at great moral and emotional cost.” And I was even more interested that it was purported to tackle the inequalities of gender and class. I knew I had to be an early reader.The author is a renowned Indian essayist and non-fiction writer, and this becomes obvious in the prose. The prose drills down in its granularity, swooping in on finite details about the remote rural town that Arun – our narrator – grew up in. At a prestigious technology school, he meets two students who share his socioeconomic background but, unlike him, have a fierce and relentless drive to succeed.But as the novel coalesces, and his counterparts become powerful men, Arun takes another path, retreating to a Himalayan Village to look after his mother and share his insight with Alia, a writer who is focused on Inia’s new global power brokers – including his classmates.Throughout, there is a lot of philosophizing about where India is heading and an essay-like recounting that moves us from the characters to a more macrocosmic view.

Only children expect otherwise even as myths and fairy tales warn us: Rumpelstiltskin, King Midas, Handsel and Gretel. Never trust a candy house! It was only a matter of time before someone made them pay for what they thought they were getting for free.""The candy house in question in this dazzling new novel by Jennifer Egan is collective consciousness. What if individuals were able to access every memory from their entire lifetime and upload them to a cloud-based Mandela box in exchange for access to others’ memories? What if we could roam through the odd, twisting corridors of one another’s minds and presumably experience a global rise in empathy and understanding of each other? What would it cost us in terms of our freedoms and our humanity to take a bite out of this candy house?It’s an audacious concept and it’s hard to determine whether it’s prescient or part of an inevitable journey that we are already on. With the explosion of social media and the continual uploading of all our thoughts, experiences, relationships, and feelings, the concept hits uncomfortably close to home. That’s particularly true as Jennifer Egan shines a spotlight on Bix, a new iteration of a tech genius held in thrall by his Vision to launch Own Your Consciousness, thereby revolutionizing how we connect to one another.Sure, there are the labels – the ""counters"" with their algorithms that identify and exploit desires to the ""eluders"", who take all measures to evade being part of the collective unconsciousness But The Candy House is not primarily a sci-fi or a dystopian tale; largely, it is a character study, allowing each successive character to enjoy his or her moment in the spotlight. Each chapter focuses on characters that range from Bix Bouton, the charismatic technological creator of the Mandela Box, to Lulu, a citizen national security spy who is also the daughter of the publicist Dolly from the Goon Squad. Music producer Bennie Salazar – also from the Goon Squad – also makes an appearance along with his grown children. One by one, the damaged, the egotistical, the striving, the searching introduce themselves.What’s truly a joy is that every character has his or her own voice and own role in this fast-moving kaleidoscope of a tale where the parts transition into an amazing whole. Jennifer Egan exploits multiple voices, tenses (omniscient narrator to first-person plural) and even multiple forms – including a somewhat lengthy epistolary section and a multi-page series of tweets – to weave a spellbinding tale.But at the end of the day, the theme is centered in what price we pay for innovations that work against individuality and privacy in their quest for uniformity. To feel the collective without any machinery may be worth a thousand candy houses. It’s up to the characters – and ultimately, we readers – to determine whether we give way to the seduction that new technology offers.I am thrilled to be an early reader of this brilliant book and thank Scribner, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, for providing me with an early galley in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jan 16, 2022","Jan 22, 2022","Jan 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58437521-the-candy-house

Inspired by a true story of a young woman who lived in isolation with a male dolphin in the name of science, this book explores the social experimentation of the 1960s and the quest to teach dolphins to talk.To raise the stakes (or to use the author’s words, to “use every trick”), the young woman, named Cora, is near-deaf, relying on hearing glasses and lip-reading. She is also a slightly built woman in the mid-60s, when most women played subservient roles to men. The connection – being trapped by a male-dominant world – is played out as Cora and the dolphins create a bond. (In one particularly telling line, the author writes about a male linguistic professor, “It seemed possible he found a woman involved with science more remarkable than a dolphin mimicking English.”)The reader will learn a lot about dolphins in this book – their fierce intelligence due to their large, furrowed cerebellum, their consciousness, their enormous ability to empathize, their social connection to each other, their playfulness, their yearning to be free. Similarly, there is a lot here about the hearing impaired and how those with that impediment are like a mouse in a field of grass, needing to pay attention to survive. Mostly there is a lot here about the egotism of so-called “great” male scientists and how this egotism plays out in cruelty towards the so-called weaker sex (which is hardly that) and the intelligent lives we share our planet with.I must unabashedly admit that I fell in love with these dolphins and when the social experiment gets going, I found myself enthralled and protective towards the youngest dolphin, Junior. I wanted him to keep safe. The bond that develops between Junior and Cora is as riveting as any bond between two humans can be.I owe an enormous thanks to Europa Editions for enabling me to be an early reader of one of my favorite authors in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jan 09, 2022","Jan 13, 2022","Jan 09, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59147214-the-dolphin-house

To read this novel as historical fiction – or, for that matter, as a story that remains faithful to religious dogma – would be dismissing the greater truth that Lauren Groff is tackling.We know very little about the historical Marie de France except this: conceived as a result of rape, she was the half-sister of King Henry II, was highly educated and multi-lingual, and created poetic narratives –lais – that had a large impact on the literary world. Her subjects were often about women imprisoned by elderly husbands.From this scarcity of background, Lauren Groff reimagines a deep-throated, socially inept woman “three heads too tall with a giant bony body” who is part noblewoman, part reviled bastardess, who incorporates both the traditionally-defined female and male within her. This Marie de France yearns for the love of Eleanor of Aquitaine, a wife of Henry II, who eventually casts Marie out, placing her in charge of an impoverished and mismanaged abbey.Marie eventually channels all her efforts and strength into using her greatness for the benefit of her sisters, creatin a vast labyrinth to protect them. She builds around the other women “an abbey of the spirit to protect them from cold and wet, from superiors waiting to gobble them up…an invisible abbey made out of her own self, a larger church of her own soul, an edifice of self in which her sisters would grow as babes grow in the dark, thrumming heat of the womb.”Was this fictional Abbess Marie a brilliant strategist who worked up ideas in vision form to sell to her sisters or was she truly a mystic? Combining historical realism with fantastical elements, one of the visions presents Eve, “the first matrix”, who kisses the “salvatrix”, Mary, mother of Jesus, presenting a sisterhood. (“And without the womb of Eve, which is the House of Death, there could be no womb of Mary, which is the House of Life.”)The intertwining theme of female unity and unbridled ambition may not sit well for those who believe that the Church is inviolate and that women are consigned their own narrow roles in it. The sheer majesty of Ms. Groff’s prose transports the reader back to this earlier century where some women had little choice but to go unwillingly into a life of religious service. In particular, the punishment for “sins of the flesh” are hard to take and the physical cravings – resulting in (no surprise) lesbian sex, are, I suspect, truer than not.

I was hooked from the very first sentence and blew off a work assignment for another day because I couldn’t tear myself away.Not unlike some of his other novels – Emily, Alone, for example, or Last Night at the Lobster – Ocean State digs deep into everyday people who are slowly suffocating in working class America. Set in coastal blue-collar Rhode Island, it centers mostly on Angel and Birdy and the teenage boy they both are obsessively in love with, along with Angel’s mother Carol and younger sister Marie.Like an ocean, the currents that move these women have far-reaching effects. We know from the first line that Angel helped murder Birdy because she was in love and didn’t know what she was doing. This is not a “whodunnit” as much as a deep dive into what drove her to do it. Using ocean parlance, the answers are right beneath the surface.The mother Carol has a long history of choosing unreliable men. Stuck as a nurse’s aide while she singlehandedly raises her daughters, she pins her hopes on an older man, Russ, who may just be the ticket to a better life. Angel is a chip off the old block. Willowy, golden-haired and misdirected, she has spent her high school years with Myles, a good-looking and popular teen who is on a track to college while her own track forward seems dead-ended. For now, she’s holding on to him for dear life even though he’s a known flirt. When he begins a tryst with Birdy – who has more in common with her than she thinks – her insecurities and jealousies reach a boiling point.All this is observed by her younger sister, Marie, who is nowhere as glamorous as her older sister and whose understanding is skewed by her age and her inexperience with the feelings engendered by teenage love. But is it indeed love that fueled this tragedy? The author suggests that blind love alone is not an excuse; rather, it’s a combination of class-based roadblocks, social media overkill, and insecurities.Ocean State is not for readers who are seeking splashy courtroom drama or air-tight answers. Rather, it is a incisive look at women who live hard lives when the wrong man with the right words seems like a form of deliverance.

For the characters that inhabit this propulsive and gut-wrenching novel, enduring love – which includes true intimacy – is a near-impossible goal.The core couple, Terri and David, have been married for 25 years and share two coming-of-age daughters. But Terri is – get ready for it – “feeling suffocated.” She asks herself, “Can a family be a happy one if the individual members of that family are not?” And she most decidedly is not. Dependable, loyal David, in her eyes, has sucked all the joy out of living. He won’t skydive or learn Italian or – well, a number of things. So she gravitates to Lucas, a good-looking, narcissistic bachelor who believes that we should all be – to coin the cliché – free to be you and me. In the meantime, David, who is reeling from the betrayal, gets on a dating app and meets Sev, with whom he can share emotional intimacies and physical fantasies without meeting (at least for a while.) Then there is teenage Krista, in the throes of a first love – albeit a disassociated one – and her younger sister Ally, who witnesses it all and reels from what she views.This could be predictable stuff, but in the hands of Dutch author Maryke Schermer, it’s anything but. She explores the ripple effects of a broken marriage, and she does so beautifully. What happens, she asks, when sex, love, intimacy, understanding and nostalgia are not truly disconnected but lead to one partner believing they add up to, “Just this, you and me, and this island in time?” What happens when the place where love was supposed to dwell becomes occupied by a reservoir of secret thoughts? Does it then become stagnation – or tranquility? Is the erosion of love inevitable? What do we owe ourselves – and those who trust us?

Born to a couple who met in the aftermath of a hideous tragedy and who struggled with infertility, the Oppenheimer triplets – Harrison, Lewyn and Sally – are conceived during the early days of IVF petri dishes. A fourth embryo, who much later becomes their sister Phoebe, remains in the clinic’s freezer.From earliest memories, these triplets feel unconnected from each other and from their parents and those vestigial feelings mature to outright loathing of each other. Their individual journeys will lead them (and readers) to explore the themes of infidelity and trust…grief, guilt and redemption…privilege and race…hoarding and letting go, and progressive education gone amok vs. blinded conservative assumptions. Along the way, the failings of religion, the complexities of sexuality, and the generational divide will also be touched upon.It will ultimately be up to the latecomer, Phoebe, to understand the poisonous family dynamics and move this very fractured family to consensus – if she is able. But Phoebe is not necessarily the eponymous latecomer; that title can easily refer to any one of the Oppenheimer family members. As they each move to embracing a more authentic life and to understanding what it means to become a more cohesive whole, each of these flawed characters learn to let go their resentments and to accept who they truly are.The Latecomer is a propulsive, layered and character-driven novel by an author who has a solid track record of making sure that readers are turning pages.

That foreign body is no longer foreign, it belongs to her, firmly held in a bundle of muscle fibers, barely eroded by time.A story that begins when we are barely old enough to process its impact in any meaningful manner will create ripples that affect our own lives – and the lives of others.Chloe has a dream: to become a professional dancer someday. At 13 years old, she signs up for a Modern Jazz class and while pursuing her passion, she catches the attention of a refined middle-aged woman Cathy, a talent scout of the Galatea Foundation, who can “sniff out talent”. Little by little, she seduces Chloe with visions of a life far beyond what she has ever experienced: taking her shopping and out to fine dinners, feeding her fantasies.Only one obstacle remains: Chloe must undergo a judging process to determine if she is “mature” enough to benefit from the fellowship that the Foundation purports to give out. Her ensuing interviews with the panel of middle-aged men will change the trajectory of her life.We will meet other characters as the book progresses: victims and perpetrators, sometimes within the same person, and we will get a close-up view of shame, guilt and redemption. Most of all, we will be forced to ponder these questions: does the Galatea Foundation mirror our own malaise? What truly has the power to destroy us: what we are forced to do or what we consent to do? And perhaps most importantly, in our craving for heroism, what happens to those who don’t pull through or only with difficulty, without glory?

It is said by religious scholars that we still bear the image of God, but we also bear the mental, moral, social and physical effects of sin.I start here because In His Own Image is a particularly moral book. It dwells on Antonia, a Corsican teenager who receives a camera on her birthday from her uncle -- her godfather -- a priest who will later officiate at her premature funeral (that fact is revealed early on). He reflects that if a photograph exists of the death off Christ it would have shown nothing more than a tortured body left to eternal death.

Rather it is meant to uncover an eternal and ubiquitous truth: a photograph is powerful because it can slice through the flow of time like implacable Fate, and that is something git alone has the power to do. Especially i wartime, photographs can capture the image of an entire century.It is the impassive camera lenses that sees without judgement.

I devoured it within days, and I was sorry when it was over. That’s a high compliment to give to a book but it’s well-deserved.From the title, many readers might jump to the erroneous conclusion this is a book about John Wilkes Booth, the infamous assassin of Abraham Lincoln. It is not – at least, not in totality. There is equal emphasis on all the Booth family including his immensely talented and alcoholic father Junius — a tragedian Shakespearean actor, his mother, and his siblings. The siblings (there were 10 in all) include his oldest sister Rosalie, a hunchbacked girl who is forced to bear the brunt of all the ensuing children, his tortured older brother Edwin – a fine Shakespearian actor in his own right, and Asia, his high-spirited and charismatic older sister.Then, of course, there is Johnny, the handsome next-to-youngest son who becomes fanatically pro-slavery and pro-secession, despite being raised in a vegetarian, anti-slavery family that today might well be labeled “progressive.” How did doted-upon Johnny morph into the historically despised John Wilkes Booth? The answer might well be to remember the words of Cassius, in Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar. He says “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. Cassius appears to be saying that it’s not our fate that dooms men, but instead their own failingsOr is it both? Karen Joy Fowler leads us to believe it may be. Fated to grow up in a very unorthodox family plagued by alcoholism and emotional instability, JWB is also affected the unsettled times in which he lived. Not unlike today, families are being torn apart by the moral quandary of slavery, politicians are most uncivil, women are limited in their self-actualization, and class delineations and faux “holier than thou” stances are widespread. Mob mentality pervades many areas. It doesn’t take too much of a stretch to compare the times to today, with John Wilkes Booth as the ultimate Trumper.Yet JWB is still very much a character of his own making. Unlike his older brothers (and younger brother Joe), he chooses his destiny. His action will change the course of the nation’s history. Most certainly, it will reverberate inside his own family, causing repercussions and unimaginable grief to his mother and siblings.Strongly researched but also partially imagined (particularly when creating the personage of JWB’s sister Rosalie), this is a wonderful example of historical fiction that works.

If so, then Lily King has created a galaxy.These stories – these little worlds – sparkle, and perhaps none more than the eponymous story. An emotionally shut-down Maine bookseller is deserted by his wife and left to raise a pre-teen daughter (in a wonderfully descriptive line, he recalls that his wife relayed the most emotion he had ever shown her was during a debate about the use of a comma in a grocery shopping note). Into this wintry life comes a new employee Kate, with her faded, untucked shirts and jeans and her capacity to thaw him. The push-pull of his fear and desire are beautifully explored and the reader can’t help but wish for a happy ending.There are other spot-on stories that also resonate: in “Creature”, a young teen babysitter whose homelife is in shambles “tries on” the heroine roles of novels such as Jane Eyre, only to realize that the hero she cast in her fantasies is really a bad guy who has little more than his own interests at heart. In “When in the Dordogne”, a young teenage boy – an accidental latecomer from a wealthy family-- finds himself in the care of two college sophomores while his parents travel abroad—and finds himself in the process. In “Hotel Seattle”, a gay man who a long time ago had a crush on his college roommate meets up with him years later in a surprisingly painful encounter.Many of the characters that populate these pages are young and on the threshold of innocence and experience. Several come from rich backgrounds, although the money does not shield them from the vagaries of life. Others are navigating communication gaps with their children who have lost fathers, mothers, or emotional security. Often these children and teens rip apart their parents own security blankets as they search for honesty and truth.There is true humanity in these rewarding stories.

He took on Boss Tweed.At the age of 83, he was gunned down in front of his Park Avenue house by a Black man named Cornelius Williams, for no immediately understandable reason. It is 1903 and racism is overt so it is no surprise that for a short time, the murder is sensationalized.The murder is interspersed with a bigger story, of a very private man born to a struggling farmer who, through his own imagination and powerful work ethic, seizes the “cathedral of possibilities” offered by New York City, where he arrives as an apprentice. Early on, he becomes “intimate friends” with Samuel Tilden, who rises to become the governor of New York and even wins the popular vote for the presidency of the U.S. The bond between them is palpable but cannot be actualized – particularly in that time.Jonathan Lee handles both the racial and gay undertones of this novel with admirable restraint. His goal is to bring a city on the verge of greatness to life and to explore the gaps between action and inaction. “So much of a life happens offstage, in silence,” Green muses. One’s past is often as much a work of imagination as one’s future.The novel often rises to lyricism, particularly in the passages where Green oversees a sugar plantation in Trinidad, losing much of his innocence and in truth, some of himself. In the heady later years, his exhilarating successes are tempered by his inability to grab life for all its gusto.The title of the book refers to another of Green’s accomplishments: a consolidation plan to prepare a charter for the City of Greater New York, the five-borough city that exists today, which received a lot of pushback in his day. But the astute reader will recognize many other applications for the title, even including the last day of his life.

Perhaps most important, what if we came to the jolting realization that individual thinking must be subjugated to collective thinking and action for us to save ourselves?By weaving in a variety of characters – from a contract hit man to a Nigerian pop star to a writer on the precipice of enormous fame – and comparing their reactions to an extraordinary phenomenon, Le Tellier might be suggesting that free will and individuality exist…to a point.

A chimp shares 98.9% of his DNA with a human being. Yet we believe that the 1.1% difference gives us the right to test and prod and abuse and discard and betray because we fool ourselves into believing we are vastly superior. I am an unabashed animal lover and this book – well, I couldn’t stop turning pages and at the same time, I couldn’t wait to stop turning pages. T.C. Boyle is very successful, albeit a tad manipulative, in his writing, which, in some ways, brought to mind Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. The plot is linear: Guy Schermerhorn, a professor specializing in animal behaviorism, raises a juvenile chimp names Sam and teaches him to speak in sign language, expressing his needs and feelings. Aimee, an undergrad, signs on as his assistant and forms a powerful and enduring bond with Sam. That bond is tested when Guy’s own professor, Donald Moncrief, a raging megalomaniac, appears on the scene and throws a wrench into this scenario. In the meantime, the linear progression of the novel is interrupted with chapters that are narrated from Sam’s own limited view of the world.The book jacket presents questions: “Do apes have God? Do they have souls? Do they know about death and redemption?” These questions might be intriguing to some, but I prefer to think of it as, “Do we all have worth as sentient beings?” I was more interested in T.C. Boyle’s (through his characters) insights into how we can treat animals like disposable property and deceive ourselves into believing that they cannot feel or grieve or form close attachments.Despite the forward propulsion of the narrative, there are times when characters are created with a too-heavy hand. For example, Moncrief is downright evil (even wearing a pirates eye patch and requiring the chimps to kiss his ring). I wished that he showed a smidgen of empathy for his subjects to make him more real. Aimee is so obsessive about Sam that I needed to know her back story and why she was willing to risk so much.

And in the process, we –the witnesses to their fight—fall in love with them.Would that every girl had a Grandma as filled with life and joy as Swiv’s!

Whether it’s sneaking behind a wheel, downing a glass of wine or joking with her own daughter about a man’s – ummm – equipment, Grandma is a force to be reckoned with. And Swiv takes right after her, suspended from school and not suffering fools gladly.Into the mix is Swiv’s mother, an actress who (for reasons we eventually find out) feels unworthy and depressed. Her husband has left her, her career is far from satisfying anymore, and oh yes, she’s very pregnant with Swiv’s soon-to-be brother or sister.In the hands of a lesser writer, this scenario could end up twee and formulaic.

It’s a fairy tale, a fantasy you sell yourself because the alternative is to admit that you’re the last important character in your own story.”Recently, a fellow booklover proposed that 2021 should be dubbed the year of the story, with many novels highlighting the importance of stories in these turbulent times.Perhaps no story is as poignant as the tale of the global refugees who give up their homes and their families and risk life and limb to embrace a promising new life. Yet often, they exchange one nightmare for another, as they arrive on new shores to find themselves hunted, rounded up, and despised.Amir is a young Syrian boy who surreptiously follows his Quiet Uncle, now his stepfather, onto a ship, not quite understanding that they are leaving their homeland. The ill-equipped and dilapidated ship is filled with Ethiopians, Egyptians, Lebanese – all kinds of oppressed people on their way to the Greek island of Kos, where they will eventually head west.As the book jacket reveals, he is the only person who survives this tumultuous passage. But Colonel Kethros has made a vow to preserve law and order, dispel illegal immigrants, and keep the island safe for rich tourists who don’t want a little thing like human rights to interfere with their long-awaited vacations. The only one who can save Amir is a young local girl Vanna, a few years older than him, who is determined to have his story end happily.The novel reads almost like a fable – two innocents adrift in a world of cynical people who believe that the only two kinds of people in the world are engines and fuel – and fuel is always dispensable. Alternating chapters depict the “before” and the “after” and answer the questions, “How did Amir end up on the boat and how does he survive?

That’s especially true in these polarizing times – and perhaps no subject is quite as polarizing as abortion.But the very people who would benefit from opening Mercy Street probably won’t because its main character is a 40-ish unmarried woman named Claudia, who counsels abortion patients at Mercy Street, a clinic in the heart of Boston.That would be a shame because Claudia is a nuanced character. Growing up in a trailer with a difficult mother, now rudderless in her personal life, Claudia could use a little mercy right now. For that matter, so could the other complex characters who inhabit this novel – Timmy, her pot dealer who befriends his customers without ever knowing their full name or details…Anthony, who collects disability and spends most of his life online…Victor Price, Anthony’s “second-best friend” who is an antiabortion zealot and a white supremacist.All these lives will come together, some in surprising ways, but Jennifer Haigh has bigger fish to fry. She broadens her lens to view our society at a crossroad, where so many of us are alienated and disconnected, where we soothe our emotional pain through the balms of online encounters, pot, and intimacies that are really anything but intimate. All the while, we deceive ourselves that we are actually on the “right side”, particularly when it comes to abortion – being fiercely protective of the unborn while, too many times, allowing that vulnerable baby to be utterly dependent on a woman who is unable to raise her and doesn’t want to.Filled with desperate characters who want to love and connect and don’t have an inkling how to, Mercy Street delivers a fair share of mercy even to the most unlikable.

Even though the brothers in question here are the three sons of Leo Chao, “the consummate American id, an insatiable narcissist, a shameless capitalist who wanted to screw everyone”, the framework of the classic Russian novel and its themes are solidly cemented in place.Like the Brothers Karamazov, the plot is fueled by the relationship of a father with his adult sons. The older son, Dagou (like his counterpart, Dmitri) is in need of an inheritance, which is being withheld by his father, whom he passionately hates. The middle son, Ming (Ivan) is sullen, isolated and intellectually brilliant. Young James (Alexel), the youngest, is the likeable youngest brother and the moral compass of the book. When Leo, who believes only in the primacy of self, is found dead, nobody is unhappy but someone has to pay. Can a flawed but heartfelt Asian man get a fair shake in a quintessentially American justice system?Had Lan Samantha Chang crafted a modern-day version of an all-time favorite classic, this novel would have been a success. But she goes further, exploring the passions and rivalries of an “outsider” family in pursuit of the American Dream. Merging humor with pathos, Ms. Chang expertly navigates the subtle and overt prejudices and biases of “real” Americans toward Chinese immigrant families (even those who have been here for a few generations) and the plight of those immigrants who profit from the Dream while being held at arms-length.By merging a family drama, an immigrant story, a literary mystery and a deep dive into what it means to be American, The Family Chao succeeds on many different levels.

I’m here to say that with Crossroads, he most resoundingly did.By playing to his strengths—creating a microcosmic world that focuses on a damaged family—he offers up manna to those of us who are character-based readers. His goal is not to focus on bells and whistles and plot-based twists, but rather to evolve the characters so that the readers know them so well they are totally emotionally invested.The family is headed by Russ Hildebrant, the associate pastor of a Chicago suburban church who has fallen out of favor at the youth-based group called Crossroads—a group determined to meet teenagers “where they live” with honest talk and artificial connections and—well, whatever it takes. Russ is married to Marion, whose life, before she married Russ, is filled with darkness and secrets that even he has no access to.Clem, the older son, is an atheist who believes in moral absolutism. Then there’s Becky, the most popular girl at high school, who is dipping her toes in the Crossroads culture. Perry, her younger brother, is a near genius who is poised to destroy himself with using and selling drugs. Lastly, there is 9-year-old Judson, who is likely being groomed to take over as a key chronicler of Book 2 (Franzen is planning to write a three-book series).So what is this book about? It’s about family, secrets, boundaries, the failure and grace of religion, the complications of coming of age in the 1970s, morality, hubris and jealousy, being pulled back into family lineaments each is trying to escape, good and evil and the chasm that lies in between.But most of all, Crossroads is about answering the questions: is being pretty good good enough? Is it its own reward or does it always serve some personal instrumentality? What does it mean to be good, anyway? Is sinning inseparable from feeling alive? In one searing scene when Perry attends an adult party in his parent’s stead at the home of the main pastor, he confronts a reverend and a rabbi with these stunning words: “My question is whether we can ever escape our selfishness. Even if you bring in God, and make Him the measure of goodness, the person who worships and obeys Him still wants something for himself. He enjoys the feeling of being righteous, or he wants eternal life, or what have you”On one way or another, every character in this novel will come up against this question as he or she walks the fine line between trying to be good and needing to be selfish. Each will come to an organic reckoning point. The characters, particularly Marion, an incredibly complex and intricately drawn woman, are pitch perfect.We leave these characters, aptly, at a Crossroad. I cannot wait to read Jonathan Franzen’s next book, which will presumably bring this family and its offspring into the 21st century.

In effect, Lucy “takes upon her body the sins of apartheid like some dungaree-wearing lamb of God.”I begin my  with a look-back to J.M. Coetzee because It’s importance to know the basics to fully appreciate the inventiveness and audacity of Fiona Synckers. In this must-read book, she brings Lucy Lurie to life and provides her with a voice that desperately wants to assert its own agency and story. Lucy in this novel is a fiction of a fiction. She is the fictional junior colleague of J.M. Coetzee, who was a professor first, who shares her name with the fictional Lucy Lurie of Disgrace. She is, for all intents and purposes, the lacuna—the missing piece of the novel. She is also one of the most unreliable narrators of all time, trying out various stories and then discarding them for other, presumably truer stories.The book touches on the theme of appropriation: can anyone other than the victim commandeer and relay a story? Or, as J.M. Coetzee himself once said, is a book the property of the readers once it is launched? Interestingly, Ms. Synyckers is guilty of the same transgression in her reimaging of J.M. Coetzee’s writing decisions and in his depicture but that, perhaps, is part of the complicated themes she takes on.It is the questions that the fictional Lucy Lurie asks that are the most fascinating. Should a brutal rape ever be a metaphorical device that leads to redemption? Isn’t patriarchy as dangerous, in its own way, as racism – especially when the patriarchy enables powerful white males to diminish the horror of rape (even if the intentions on doing so seem noble?) How do we navigate a world of privilege, where those of us with means get therapy and those of us without get silenced? For that matter, how do we navigate law and social media that twist words and shape opinions? Most of all, how do we reach a point of self-care, when we stand up and say, “I will not be violated or appropriated. I will tell my own truth.”Lacuna is a thought-provoking novel that doesn’t hold back, and which raises vital questions about the lacuna – the gaps – in our society. In addition to Disgrace, it also has wisps of Moby Dick, as Ahab goes in search of the White Whale (in the person of J.M. Coetzee). I am now eager to read Disgrace again to find out how my perception of this central scene has (or maybe has not) transformed. For those of us who love insightful books that spark our mind, this is a must-read.

Burntcoast it is extraordinary, proving once again (to quote the first line) that “those who tell stories survive.” And few writers tell stories as well as Sarah Hall, author of The Wolf Border.The book is about a lot of things: the uneasy alliance between life and mortality, the ways we morph and adjust to accommodate our definition of life, and how everything becomes altered in nature, damaged and resilient—whether it’s a work of art or the human heart. Its main character, Edith, inhabits a moment in history that greatly resembles ours: Britain, and indeed the world, has fallen prey to a virus (called Nova) that is even more contagious and fatal than COVID-19. A talented sculptor who has already achieved awards and fames, Edith purchases Burntcoat, a utilitarian warehouse she calls a “hag in a bright mirror”.Edith is no stranger to the capriciousness of life. She was forced to adapt and fill the gaps when her mother, Naomi, suffers a massive brain aneurysm, forever transforming her and welding Edith’s concept of how a life can be diminished and still be worth living. Later, she meets Halit, a Turkish refugee with whom she has a sensual love affair. While the virus, which unlike the refugee, has no respect for borders—“perfectly composed, star-like, and timed for the moment of greatest chaos”— rages outdoors, she and Halit create their own perfect truth, passionately making love and in doing so, affirming life. As Edith reflects, “The body is a wound, a bell ringing in emergency—life, life, life.Throughout the book, Edith achingly remembers the stories—stories from her unconventional childhood, stories of past abusive loves, stories of her creation of a masterwork of art—with a special emphasis on how and why we live and create in unprecedented times.Burntcoat is an amazing book, perfectly crafted to resonate with these times of fear, uncertainty, and search for meaning.

Can fact ever equal the imaginative heights of fiction?These are two questions that were in the back of my mind as I approached I Love You But I’ve Chosen Darkness (what an incredible title!) I first discovered Claire Vaye Watkins in her short story book, Battleborn, an incredible work that borrows (at least in one story) from her family history: her father, Paul Watkins, was a right-hand man for the infamous Charles Manson. And I read with awe her next dystopian book, Gold Fame Citrus.From these books, I knew CVW was willing to go to dark places in service of her fiction. In her new book, her narrator—also named Claire Vaye Watkins—has an incredible amount in common with the author herself. I did not google to find out what was true and what was not, but I suspect there is a great deal of truth (or at least, truthiness).I suspect that because in some parts, it seems that CVW is yoked to the truth, bringing to consciousness “how things really happened” and trying to be an honest narrator. We read in detail about her father’s mercurial life and how quickly he flamed out, about her unstable mother, and about her own ability to bond with her baby daughter. CVW has a lot of unfinished business, or so it seems: digging deeply into her confusing upbringing and flawed parents, confronting teenage loves and false friends, and all her choices—from how to craft her professorship to deciding whether to return to her husband and daughter. Interspersed are letters from her mother Martha, which seem too faithfully rendered.At the end of the day, I had to conclude that CVW – despite a life that is unorthodox and at best, fascinating – is not quite as compelling as her flights of imagination.

To know the country is to love it – the alluring scents, the frosted-glass slats, the hidden passages and tapas bars that stay open until the crack of dawn, the lushness that gives rise to unmet yearnings.Barcelona is the backdrop of three stories, each of which has tendrils into the other stories as long as you’re paying close attention. In the first, The Giant of Sarria, Amy—a British middle-age woman—hazards across a young Moroccan immigrant who is half her age and pitifully crying. She takes him as her lover and their throes of passion begin to transform her, until racism bares its ugly head in the person of her prejudiced neighbor. What ensues threatens to unmoor Amy until a fantastical giant – someone who is no stranger to prejudice—creates yet another reversal in her life.The next, The King of Castelidelfis, features Nacho, who turns out to be the alcoholic ex of Amy’s friend, also involved with a lover much younger than himself. She, and her young son, are the focus of Nacho’s life. Gradually Nacho becomes connected to the real-life famous Brazilian footballer, Ronaldinho, who plays for Spain; he hopes to leverage this connection into gaining the admiration of the son. But as Nacho falls down the rabbit hole, drink by drink, we are left to wonder what is real…and what is fantastical.Lastly, the Carpenter of Montjuic, goes even further into fable, as Jordi, a translator who works with Nacho’s ex-wife, becomes party to his neighbor’s mystical tales about a very special chest. His unrequited yearning and his connection with his neighbor eventually awaken him to the reflection that, “They open up new worlds, they treated you to things you weren’t accustomed to and hadn’t asked for, things they insisted on, and then, when you were clearly in their debt, they began to exact a kind of payment.” The type of payment is identified in a story-within-a-story, a sort of French morality tale that Jordi is working on.The merging of the real with the fantastical, the giant, the football legend, the craftsman of the wooded chest, give way to dreamlike imaginings and a very satisfying read....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Sep 28, 2021","Oct 04, 2021","Sep 28, 2021",,Unknown Binding,view (with text),/book/show/55649654-barcelona-dreaming

They wake up, scavenge for a few half-eaten slices of last night’s take away pizza, and then they’re on their smartphones, scrolling through the news headlines to decide who’s upset them today.”If the above paragraph offends you, you are precisely the target that John Boyne takes on in his wickedly funny new book. And you probably won’t get through it without being offended by—something. The author takes no prisoners as he skewers the Woke society that is “McCarthyism hidden beneath the umbrella of Wokeness.”The patriarch of the Cleverley family, George, is so Woke that he named his first son Nelson Fidel – yep, after Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro. He hosts a famous talk show and has been touted for his liberal views. But his family life is falling apart. His wife, Beverly Cleverley, a well-known romance writer, uses a ghost (i.e., ghostwriter) to pen her all-too-predictable novels. His daughter, Elizabeth, is a would-be poet whose one goal is to get the “blue tick” next to her name on Twitter, officially designating her as an influencer. Nelson is not self-aware in the least, and everyone knows he is gay except for him. And the youngest, Achilles, is a handsome lad who is dubbed “the idiot” by his father. His plans on getting rich include larceny.Together, this modern family is tethered to smartphones and Twitter accounts and living its life appealing to the favorable verdict of strangers. When George gets into a mess by having the audacity to compliment and cheer on a receptionist who is transitioning, his inadvertent use of the pronoun “he” instead of “she” launches a maelstrom with ripple effects.There is a lot about pronouns in this hilarious book. When Elizabeth’s woker-than-woke boyfriend, Wilkes, decides he does not want to be labelled with the “heteronormative constraints of male and female identities”, George answers, “I labeled you as a complete moron from the moment I met you.” The irony, of course, is that Wilkes is anointing himself with a label – non-binary – in opposition to other labels.John Boyne, as anyone who has ever read his other marvelous books knows, is a gay man, and he cannot be labeled easily with the “patriarchy” designation (another term that he has a lot of fun with in The Echo Chamber). If there is any overriding message in this book, it’s, “Get off your social media, lighten up, and stop all the silly tar-and-feathering of anyone who doesn’t adhere to the new Woke manifesto.” And maybe, practice a little tolerance and forgiveness when someone inevitably and inadvertently strays, as long as the intent is good....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Sep 21, 2021","Sep 28, 2021","Sep 21, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57638052-the-echo-chamber

I have too many inconvenient questions for him.”Right from the start, you know you’re in the hands of a master storyteller. Although the main narrator is Sasha—a young man with a three-month-old daughter who is suffering from a major trauma—the story most definitely belongs to his neighbor, Tatyana Alexeyevna, a 90-year-old with early Alzheimer’s disease. Her own life is a study in tragedy and her story captivates the heartbroken young man. As it does the reader. Tatyana brings us back to Josef Stalin’s Great Terror. Arriving in Moscow, “the epicenter of history”, Tatyana lands a plum job in the NKID—the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs—where she is charged with translating official letters. Her husband, an architect, is in the war, while she works and cares for their young daughter.It is while she is performing her duties that the absurdity of the Russian position becomes clear to her. Any soldier who becomes a POW becomes an automatic traitor (brave Russians, in the eyes of the proletariat, fight to the last bullet and to be caught is akin to treason). Not only are they considered traitors, but their wife and children are as well. Sasha Fliipenko, the author uses actual historical documents—internal Soviet memos, telegrams and letters from the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross—and you can almost feel his righteous rage in sharing documents from a country that was so scornful of its own POWs and so abhorrent in the treatment of their families.The book takes its title from the little red crosses that Tatyana leaves on doors, “a history and metaphor, a warning and a landmark.” As Tatyana enters the land of forgetfulness, the red crosses are eternal symbols of remembrances. This is a chapter of Soviet history that must not be forgotten.I am torn between a 4- and a 5-star rating for one reason: the character of the young man, Sasha, is steeped in melodrama and not nearly as compelling as his elderly neighbor’s. Both have been touched by tragedy and God’s unfairness and both have daughters, but I think the author could have done more with this unlikely friendship.Still, because of the sheer lyricism of the writer, the expert translation by Brian James Baer and Ellen Vayner, the eye-opening look into a chapter of Soviet tyranny that I knew little about, the propulsive story, the moral dilemma at the core of the novel, and so much more, I am rating this 5 stars with the hope it will reach a wide audience.

Still, I can’t help but compare The Twilight Zone to a book I started the year off reading—Hades, Argentina by Tomas Ortilla. In that book (set in Argentina), hauntings are everywhere as the character’s own ghost appear in his memories, in the street, in the auto plant that he worked that was used for ultimate tortures.The Twilight Zone is set in Chile during the years of Pinochet’s dictatorship. It centers around the man who tortured others—a military officer with a distinctive moustache—who decides to confess his participation in the torture and disappearance of so many victims to a magazine editor who shares the author’s last name. Many years later, the narrator encounters “the man who tortured others” again, this time as she’s putting together a TV series about the deadly times—and him.Her conceit is clever: she compares the Pinochet era to The Twilight Zone, actually recounting episodes of it, to showcase the absurdity of this parallel universe where innocents are whisked from the street to disappear forever, enabled by a collectively terrorized and therefore silent society.Early on, Fernandez frames the questions we must keep in mind: “Why should I talk about a man who was part of it all and at some point decided he couldn’t be anymore? How do you decide when you’ve had enough? What kind of line do you cross? Is there such a line? Will we ever emerge and give the world the bad news about what we were capable of doing?”This literally haunting novel functions best when it zeroes in on unforgettable images of the victims—three brothers who are simultaneously captured and the devil’s bargain one must make to save the other two, or an ordinary man on the bus with his wife and kids who is suddenly set up and taken away in full view of them. Also, the author adroitly uses a variety of lenses in which to view the story: memory, pop culture, video games, and so forth. The writing rises to poetry in places, its beauty contrasting with the ugliness of the content. If the novel has a fault, it’s that at times it becomes almost repetitive – another snatching, another torture, another person disappeared.

As in the past, she takes four millennials – Alice, Eileen, Felix and Simon—and sets them loose in a broken world, a world where the natural world is dying, and our shared cultural forms have degraded into mass marketing.It is a lonely world where self-preservation competes with the craving for something meaningful. The characters are richly drawn. Alice is a writer of two literary books and is in high demand—not unlike the author herself—and is questioning the meaningfulness of what she has accomplished and why she is receiving so much worshipful acclaim. She meets Felix--who scans shipping boxes at a warehouse and who is near illiterate—through a Tinder date and somehow, they connect. Her best friend Eileen is barely getting by financially, editing a literary magazine. She has been in a relationship-of-sorts with Simon whom she's known since childhood, a very handsome man with religious underpinnings who keeps his emotions and feelings closely vested.There is deep authenticity in the portrayals and in the aching of the characters for something of value. The seduction and ensuing sex scenes are exquisitely rendered. But “only connect” has a secondary meaning; it’s the connection between author and reader that begins to take focus. In long, didactic emails, Alice and Eileen—both literary—detail their feelings, sometimes about situations that the reader has just read. From the shelled-out literary process that creates “specialness” when none really exists (“they never tire of giving me awards”) to the failure of religion, the false aesthetic ideal and emphasis on a profoundly ugly worshipping of ‘beauty’, to alienation from a system intent on destruction, the friends get deep into dialogues that ironically, are enabled by technology and not face-to-face connections. In the finale which is written mostly without paragraphs, the insights and evolutions of the characters quite literally took my breath away and accelerated my heartbeat. I could barely come up for air. As one of the characters begins to sense “the nearness, the possibility of beauty, like a light radiating softly from behind the visible world”, hope emerges—hope that is shared by the characters and the reader.

But I cried unashamedly while reading Once There Were Wolves. I cried for the possibilities we let slip between our fingers and our inability to appreciate the wonder and interconnectedness of our beautiful world and I cried the loss of the natural order that, if respected, can lead to our own Eden here on Earth.The book focuses on Inti Flynn, who travels with her mute identical sister Aggie to rewild the remote Highlands of Scotland with wild wolves. I normally roll my eyes at the plot introduction of identical twins—too often it is used by lazy writers to contrast one personality with another.But here, it works very well. Aggie is Inti’s shadow sister, and the true meaning of that designation will not be revealed until the very last pages. Suffice to say that the two of them are intricately connected and have been since they were toddlers. Inti has a condition called mirror touch synesthesia, which means her brain recreates and deeply feels the sensory experience of people and sometimes animals. Put another way, if someone is slapped, Inti will physically feel the sting.Inti is that most complex of creatures: a wolf biologist with powerful boundary issues, easy prey because of her sensitivity that must learn to be a predator and “become the thing I hunt and feel it all.” She is a protector that needs to be protected but refuses to acknowledge it. Her only true human contact is with her sister and with chief of police Duncan MacTavish, who is nursing his own inner pain.Charlotte McConnaghy knows her stuff. Readers will learn a lot about wolves—how they are birthed and how they hunt, how they communicate and in what circumstances they become killers. We learn about their fierce attachment to each other and how they survive—and why so many of them don’t. And we discover why saving the predators is the key to saving ourselves.The book doesn’t get preachy, although the author is clearly passionate about her subject. The comparisons of wolves to humans – that thin line between predator and prey, the ways we get consumed by what is wild within us—is breathtaking. I loved her former book Migrations but this one?

Particularly that of a precocious three-year-old child who insists his mother is NOT his mother, despite ample evidence to the contrary?That is the foundation of an often ingenious, plot-twisted novel by Michel Bussi, which dives deep into the memory of Malone, whose insistence on a previous life that included pirate ships, rockets, and ogres seem highly fantastical. He insists his stuffed toy Gouti is telling him stories about the past—but how could that possibly be? Only one person fully believes there is more to these musings: school psychologist Vasily Dragonman. As a student of memory, he knows that forming memories that will last a lifetime doesn’t begin until a child reaches the age of four or five. While a person’s values, tastes, and personality can be shaped early on, our capacity to retain direct memories of events is a complete void. But even in a young child, traces do remain: sensory memory, or the sensorimotor stage of development.Vasily knows he is in a race against time to extract these memories before Malone forgets them entirely. He involves Captain Marianne Augresse, a Le Havre police officer whose biological clock is ticking very loudly, to help get to the bottom of it. The captain though, is very involved in tracking down a potentially dangerous gang of robbers, one of whom is wounded. She doesn’t believe Vasily…until certain events make her a believer.The book had me going through nearly 500 pages and I can absolutely see it as a cinematic series. The one big flaw, for me, was the depiction of the single and not all that maternal captain, who (for me) comes across as obsessed and silly in her quest for a baby father. Each man she meets is sized up for his baby-making potential. Lieutenants who work under her are judged by their sexiness and fidelity rather than their professional qualifications. Even in life-threatening situations, she considers her own allure.

We know that New York became disorienting to her after her father’s death and her mother’s sudden retreat to Singapore. We know she views herself as unanchored and even incorporeal. She is, in every sense of the word, an interpreter of complex moralities and connections that pass as “intimacies.”In short order, our narrator becomes involved with a tall and handsome man named Adriaan, who is separated yet still encumbered by his absent wife. She befriends a woman named Jana who is flirtatious and, one senses, unreliable and she also becomes close to the sister of victim of a seemingly random act of violence. In her professional life, she is called upon to interpret for an arrogant former president who has been accused of heinous war crimes.In all these cases, we suspect that our narrator is a cypher-of-sorts, someone who reflects, rather than interacts, with these personalities and provides them with cover for their lacks and their excesses.Katie Kitamura, through her narrator, explores nothing less than the wavering line between authentic and manipulative intimacies and our sense of what is ethical and what is moral. The interpreter she creates is a perfect foil, fluent in many languages and identities, cognizant that our identities are mutable and change the course of our lives. In one stunning scene, the war criminal, during his trial, acknowledges the faceless interpreter in her booth. She reflects, “I was certain that I would never grow accustomed to this moment of recognition, the meaning of which remained unclear to me. Was it mere politesse or was it something more sinister, more calculating and exploitive?” That question pervades both her personal and professional lives. This is a superb, if disorienting novel, that creates a spell of tension and anticipation that lingers long after the final pages....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Aug 22, 2021","Aug 26, 2021","Aug 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55918474-intimacies

It is set in 1929 in India, where women are regarded as little more than breeding mares, and Mehar is chosen to be the wife of one of three brothers. Which brother it is doesn’t matter, although we find out rather quickly that her husband is the eldest of the brothers.Women are veiled and “the act” takes place in darkness with the briefest of verbal exchanges, so what could go wrong? Just this: Mehar falls in love with Suraj, the middle brother, believing he is her husband, and he, in turn, falls in love with her. This profane love cannot bode well.and carries grave risks.The story, inspired by Sunjeev Sahota’s family history is created with strong story-telling skills and a fair share of claustrophobic tension. The novel takes his title from the cramped china room – complete with willow-pattern plates—that the breeding mare (Mahar) must go to when requested by her officious mother-in-law to meet her “husband” and hopefully, “get with child.”Interspersed with this story is that of a young man who is sent to his uncle in rural Punjab to get through the ravages of heroin withdrawal. As it turns out, he is the great-grandson of Mehar. Living in Mehar’s former house and building a crush on an older female doctor who visits him there, he tries to separate facts from legends.Sunjeev Sahota is a powerful writer, but the Mehar story is far more intriguing than the narrative of her great-grandson.

When the book opens, Sunday, the sole daughter, has just wrecked her car and injured herself in L.A. while driving drunk. Her eldest brother, Denny, swoops in to take her back to their tony hometown in the Westchester area in NY.But lots of secrets are lurking there. After a five-year exile, she has to deal with her ex-sweetheart Kale, whom she deserted for no known reason, and who has married and moved on…or has he? Denny is in business with Kale and they’ve just bought a bigger pub but there are secrets lurking there, too. Middle brother Jackie seems to know Sunday’s secrets but he’s not talking. Why? And lastly, Shane, who is developmentally disabled, is loved by all his siblings but in the dark about the hidden secrets tearing apart his family.It’s fair enough to think, “Big and seemingly close-knit Irish family with dysfunction in the background? Been there, read that.” But Tracey Lange adds a twist of sorts. As we build empathy for each of these muddling siblings and become invested in their struggles, we recognize what fueled all this from outsiders’ perspectives. We see what it was like to NOT be a Brennan—to not have community respect, a big house, and all the accoutrements that a good living will earn. We see the havoc that they have left in their wake and how their secrets have caused heartache.

While there, he attends editorial meetings where the staff s manuscripts from would-be authors. And a question arises: should a laudable but flawed book that contributes mightily to goals of diversity be published?When it comes to Uwen Akpan’s own book—an ambitious, shattering, at times unforgettable, sprawling and uneven novel—I wouldn’t have to think twice. The answer is yes.The strengths of the book are remarkable. There are several key strands that are explored, but two of the most prominent are the prevalence of racism in an educated publishing house and in New York in general and racist assumptions about Africa. Juxtaposed is a story of Ekong’s Hell’s Kitchen apartment, which is rife with bedbugs and turns his days into agony. It does not take long to recognize that the two stands have something in common: racism and a bed bug invasion are both infestations that need massive effort to stamp out—and even then, they reappear over and over again.I would have liked the focus of this book to be narrowed to delve deep into this metaphor. Indeed, scenes of duplicitous colleagues, boorish neighbors, a racist priest, and a publishing industry behind the times is a searing condemnation, particularly when combined with Ekong’s personal bug infestation hell.But Uwem Akpan is more ambitious than that. He weaves in scenes and back-history of the Biafran War, which are haunting and instructive. Thy deserve to see the light of day and provide insights into Nigeria and its heinous Biafran War in ways that the rest of the world needs to understand. As a human being, I applaud the effort. As a literary reader, I sensed the wizard behind the curtain – authorial intrusion – and felt that Uwem Akpan was trying to merge two essential stories into one novel with mixed results.I wish this author had written two distinct books.

So re-encountering Lucy Barton—whom I “met” in a previous book six years ago was an unexpected delight.Lucy Barton is a truth-teller. Her impeccably honest voice is a breath of fresh air in a world where so many of us dissemble. Her recognition that “we are all mythologies, mysterious” encapsulates her philosophy of living and the woman herself.Much has happened to her since My Name is Lucy Barton. She is widowed and grieving from the loss of her second husband, her daughters have grown, and she remains connected– as friends—with her first husband, William, who is going through a bad spell. Why she is still connected is a mystery to her, but the reasons become less murky as the book progresses.But what elevates this novel is not the plot – which is in itself arresting—but the narrator and her ability to convey simple truths and unvarnished feelings about so much that composes the human condition. Whether the issue at hand is how a lack of childhood lever can skew one’s view of the world, how family secrets often lurk right beneath placid surfaces, how acts of hurt and tenderness are never far from us, and how we experience joys when we least expect it, Lucy is our guide to what it means to be human.Once again, Lucy’s story tells us who we are and what we think and what we do.

But Ketty Rouf’s Josephine is a whole different woman entirely, a 30-ish philosophy teacher who breaks free from her boring life each night as an exotic pole dancer. It’s a fascinating view of a woman who crashes through boundaries in her attempt to inhabit all the women who live within her.Working as a civil servant by day, Josephine is quickly losing herself in an environment where a love of learning is subjugated to a “playing by the rules and whatever you do, don’t ever push a student to actually learn” mentality. In the highly sexualized school, she dresses in drab attire, never wears accessories perceived as flashy, and moves through an endless cycle of days where she merely exists.Then she takes a pole-dancing course on a whim. Not long after, she goes from granny panties to a lace G-string, stiletto heels and stockings, and from spitballs and endless essay correction to being an object of worship for many nameless men who worship her body and celebrate her as an idealized woman.A teacher named Josephine by day, an exotic dancer named Rose Lee at night, and never the twain shall meet. Until one night, they do.This book is a special read for a few reasons. First, there is the philosophy underpinnings that bring us to an understanding of why Josephine chooses to do what she does (“knowing how to live means choosing the ideas that won’t run us”). In an absurd existence, with all of us headed towards death, what is it that saves us? And second, Ketty Rouf’s portrayal of the exotic dancer’s life—the sisterhood of the dancers, the freedom of revealing oneself, the sometimes therapeutic role that exotic dancers play—is downright fascinating.Thanks to an excellent translation from the French by Tina Kover, the book comes alive as both an erotic narrative as well as a mind-based one.

A frog, after all, is a symbol of transformation and change. And when the ex-president’s younger self – an imprisoned guerilla fighter – is about to give up hope, it is only fitting that his spirit animal should guide him forward. How did this broken person we meet eventually become “The Poorest Person in the World” and what inspired his love of his country and the people in it?This spare novel goes back and forth as the nameless president (who, the book jacket tells us, is inspired by Uruguayan president Jose Mujica) converses with the loudmouthed frog in the past and then, speaks with a Norwegian reporter in the present. The person who emerges from these dialogues is a leader who many have yearned for: a visionary who not only believes in, but also practices the ideals of a more equal and compassionate economic path and a caring of other beings and of the land itself.Trump is alluded to—how could he not be?—and herein, perhaps inadvertently, lies the sorrow of this novel for the U.S. reader. With our innocence lost, our morality compromised, and our ugliness revealed, can we really think differently about the shape of our world or even the survival of it? I suspect that some readers will warm to this allegory of the resilience of the human spirit and the need to dream bigger while others will label it as more rhetoric from the “radical left” – as if it’s a radical thing to aspire to be better.

But in reality, beauty is a complicated burden to bear. And if there is a message in this stunning novel, it is that great beauty and terrible ugliness have coexisted right from the start.Elinor Hanson is a beautiful woman, a one-time model. She is also a complicated woman, having grown up in North Dakota as the daughter of a Korean mother and Caucasian father. She has visible tattoos up and down her arms and doesn't hold her liquor particularly well. When we meet her, she is on her way to Bakken, a dusty town that has suddenly become revitalized due to an oil boom and the fracking business.Now in her 40s, Elinor has a newly-minted college degree and finally caught a professional break: her college professor and former lover has handed her a plum reportorial assignment to return to Bakken—not far from where she grew up—to write about the transformational changes that have occurred.Many people in the town have become rich overnight and the town is straining against its success. But this isn’t the story that Elinor wants to follow. As the quintessential outsider, the oozing ugliness of the town gradually reveals itself: the raping of the environment, the misogyny towards and objectification of women, the racism that boils right beneath the surface, the unbridled effects of run-amok capitalism, the gaping chasm between the have and have nots.O Beautiful isn’t preachy. These recognitions unfold along with the story, which is as old as the hills: one woman’s return to the small town from which she escaped.

It is well-written, well-researched, and is a hypnotizing story of naked ambition, female friendships, lust, power, humiliation and rage. But a funny thing happened to me as I sailed my way through to a 5-star . And it seems like it’s the exact opposite of what other readers are relaying. I loved the first half, which was a studied and poignant and authentic look at three ballerinas on the verge of a break-through. But then in the second half, it fell apart for me as the author seemed to chase an elusive idea of turning the book into a cinematic thriller.At first, we see a gain a real inside glimpse into the world of ballet, where swirl glue is placed around the toes to harden them, where the slipper shank is cut down to accentuate the foot’s curve, and where only a tiny percentage will make it to sujet, soloist, and dance short. Delphine’s mother made it in her time and now, Delphine is wildly ambitious to follow in her footsteps. Her two closest friends, Margaux and Lindsay, are equally determined to do whatever it takes.At one point, Delphone asks, “Don’t they know that we’re all covered in the most disgusting sores under our shoes?” The answer: “Of course they know. That’s why they like to watch.”Powerful stuff. If this debut author had followed her vision, I think this book would have been marvelous. She certainly knows how to spin a story. But instead, the second half introduces a hideous betrayal of trust, a serial philanderer, even a murder. In the exhaust of #MeToo, every man (even the ones we liked in the first half) morph into predators and control-freaks. Increasingly, the message is that men are powerful and therefore can’t be trusted and women need to break free in order to seize their own potential.I consider myself a feminist, but my definition of feminism is that we (women and men) can win together; in other words, there doesn’t have to be a loser for there to be a winner. In a few instances, I felt their depictions of characters was not in keeping with how they were originally and their actions were over-exaggerated.That is not to say that the book isn’t good reading. Lines like this – Delphone is communicating her mother-substitute – are excellent: “How we’re scared of things that we might break. SO much of our focus goes there. Protecting them, caring for them.” “Well, what should we be afraid of instead?” “Why, the things that might break us, of course.”With a little less ham-handedness and stage-whispering of its message and a little more nuance, this book could have been a true contender.

I’d go further: this is the book that humanity needs at this fraught point in time.The story is simple enough.

The son of an unwed mother, things haven’t turned out badly for him and he grew up with the caring that each of us needs.

Is it possible to live your life without once being brave enough to go against injustice and yet call yourself a Christian and still face yourself in the mirror?Claire Keegan captures not only the nuances of small-town Irish dialect but also crafts scenes that are authentic and atmospherically rich.

I know his books but never knew much about his background: his pretentious mother, his burning desire to become a writer, his marriage to a wealthy, Jewish and boy-like wife (while his proclivities were more towards his wife’s beautiful twin brother), and his unconventional partnership which produced six children.Juxtaposed with the story of his life is the story of Germany—its sparking of two World Wars, and Mann’s own loss of his homes and exile to America.Colm Toibin has obviously done exhaustive research but as a reader of fiction I wanted more I wanted Thomas Mann’s inner thoughts to come alive and I wanted Colm Toibin to imagine Mann as well as narrate his life. This novel deserves kudos for its contribution of a greater understanding of the forces and circumstances that created Thomas Mann. As a result, it will appeal to readers who appreciate that kind of scholarly reportage.Thank you to Scribner for allowing me to be an early reader of this ambitious and in many ways, masterly novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jun 16, 2021","Jul 15, 2021","Jun 16, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56897459-the-magician

Even though it is barely 150 pages, it took me a few days to read it and mull over the relationship complexities it presents.Interestingly the premise at the heart of it brings to mind Jhumpa Lahiri’s opening story in Interpreter of Maladies, entitled A Temporary Matter. In that story, a married couple attempt to mend a failing marriage during an electrical outage, confessing more and more of their secrets to each other until they finally “weep for the things they now know.” Jhumpa Lahiri is the translator of Trust, and here, two lovers, Pietro and Teresa, decide to confess something they’ve never told anyone before. Rather than uniting them, shortly afterwards, they break up. Pietro marries, has children, achieves career success. But he has forever bound with Teresa, who is, in effect, an exacting Super Ego by knowing what he is capable of.Trust is narrated in three voices – Pietro by far has the longest story, then his daughter Emma speak after a long passage of time, and finally we hear from Teresa. At the heart of the story is: what improves us? The pedagogy of love or the pedagogy of fear? Does confessing our innermost secrets free the real person who lurks beneath the person who seems real, but are really invented by us?Trust is that paradox that is emotionally powerful while keeping the reader at arm’s length. Another way to phrase this is it is a book of the mind more than a book of the heart. It left me with much to think about regarding the relationships and how they are constructed, the constructs of fidelity, and whether “love is a lava of crude life that burns the refined one.”I owe a debt of gratitude to Europa Editions who provided me with a galley of Trust, which will be out this fall, n exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,1,13,1,"Jun 05, 2021","Jun 10, 2021","Jun 05, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57609340-trust

And she does such a superb job at it that the characters leap off the pages and assume lives of their own.Right in the opening pages, a 70-year-old woman named Dot dies in a ramshackle cottage where she lives with her twins, Jeanie and Julius. Neither has much experience living in the real world: Jeanie has a heart disorder and Julius has remained at home caring for her. The early descriptions make them sound very much like naïve teenagers; in fact, they are 51 years old.Suddenly thrust into the world (I couldn’t help but think of William Blake’s Poems of Innocence and Experience), they have difficulty navigating ordinary matters: providing for themselves, dealing with the bureaucracy of getting their mother buried, figuring out how to survive in the cottage.All the while, secrets are lurking in the background. There are hints of something untoward in the death of their father when they were young. They have grown up in their cottage due to the benevolence of the landowner, yet they actively dislike him. Their mother seems to have asked others for money but no hint of that money remains. What does it all mean and how do these threads come together?Where this author excels is bringing the reader into these narrow lives, having them feel every humiliation that the twins are forced to endure, uncovering the threads of dignity that they have despite their near-impoverishment, and revealing the simple things that sustain people who have very little to live for from the perspective of a greedy outside world.The narrative opens up and surrenders its secrets, leaving me incredibly moved and filled with emotion.

Unfortunately, I don’t believe The Revival is one of them.It’s not the subject matter; as I stated, I find the subject matter intriguing. It’s the voice, which didn’t feel authentic to me. The writer wants to have it both ways: present a young narrator named Miriam who has been raised from birth to believe and at the same time, have her be a feminist and an agent of change. The two are pretty much incompatible.Any kind of religion brainwashing at a young age creates submission. That is why the vast majority of children grow up to believe in what their parents believe and refuse to question it. Yet Miriam displays a lot of spunk, confronting her father who commits an act of violence and standing up for her own possible ability to heal. It wasn’t believable.Perhaps most troubling, any novel with the title “The Revival” owes it to its readers to deliver a charismatic revivalist and draw the readers into the circle of hope. Surprisingly, that didn’t happen. The father from the start presents as a charlatan and I never got the feeling he could inspire anyone. The fact that the novel presents a Southern, Black, evangelist community somehow gets lost. It’s easy enough to believe, for example, that this is a Northern and white saga.This debut writer definitely has writing talent and I believe she has the chops to write more authentically in her next effort.

Marcus is a good guy and appreciates quality work. So when his father dies, he asks Ed to get his father’s house in Orkney ready to market.Ed is an uncomplicated fellow. He gets anxious around large ships and has never been far from home. He likes Marcus, though, and he particularly likes Marcus’ sister, Claire, a city financier, who is way out his league.

One senses that it is only Ed’s lack of education, not an intrinsic flaw, that makes him less able to grasp, say, economic or historical issues.

Wynn, the “gentle giant”, is more emotionally driven, preferring to believe the best of the world and the people who inhabit it.”Wynn, the idealist, dies. Jack, the pragmatist, lives. And I never was able to get the heart-pounding story of what happened to them on the river out of my mind. So when I heard that Peter Heller was writing a sequel-of-sorts, I knew I had to be an early reader.It helps to have read The River before diving into The Guide, but it is not essential. Here we meet a slightly older and more somber Jack, who has become a seasonal fishing guide at the luxe Kingfisher Lodge, which caters to celebrities who can afford to spend a fortune to fish anonymously. Like in Dog Stars, another of Heller’s gems, the book takes place in the future where COVID-Redux is creating fear and uncertainty.Jack is assigned to Alison K, a well-known singer. It doesn’t take long before he, and his famous client, recognize that something is not right at the Lodge. In fact, the happenings take a downright sinister turn. Without delving deeper into the plot, I will say that this is the most cinematic of Heller’s novels. It ultimately requires a suspension of belief in its depiction of Jack as a futuristic yet old-fashioned hero, but I could absolutely see scenes being played out in my head.

A ruined Eden you had convinced yourself, in some fever dream, to stake a future on.”Our nameless narrator, an aspiring writer who works at Australia’s Triple Zero all center—think of it as a 911 center—is gradually becoming disassociated from the feelings that threaten to rage like wildfires within her. Day after day, she answers emergency calls from frantic Australians who are on the verge of death or catastrophe.When she is not at the center, she pursues a man who is living with a “good woman” yet cannot contain the wildfire of lust he feels for her. Desperately, the two of them crave the bodily release that gives their lives immediacy and meaning.

The novel is designed to help a struggling literary publisher get back on its feet financially, and it is written by a very beautiful, enticing, and unstable debut author named Anya. Naturally, Simon falls head over heels for her.The fictional book, entitled The Vixen, the Patriot, and the Fanatic, with its lewd plotline, is in direct contrast to Simon’s sense of value and dignity. His mother, after all, was neighbors with Ethel and has often quoted one of her final statements to her lawyer: “You will see to it that our names are kept bright and unsullied by lies.” That line is repeated in this book. A lot. So are Simon’s fears and guilt about causing his mother grief. We hear about that a lot, too.This good-looking Harvard graduate is so awkward and bumbling that his social interactions border on cringeworthy. Later in the book, he is described by a key character as malleable. It is hard to believe that anyone could get through college years – even in the 1950s – and be so rudderless and self-lacerating. Simon also has a habit, it seems, of falling in love with just about any female who is placed in his path. It is easy to see why he would be lustful towards Anya. But to fall so deeply for a woman who appears to have his polar opposite values, little moral compass, and who is quite likely mentally disturbed is a hard pill to swallow.I won’t give away the plot points. It wouldn’t be fair. But I will say that I had the uncomfortable feeling that art was imitating life. The state-mandated murder of the Rosenbergs for a level of crimes they did not do (Ethel, for example, was only the typist of materials and paid for that with her life), has long held a sort of prurient interest. The fictional Vixen capitalizes on that interest and in ways, so does its namesake. The urge to publish a best seller that will appeal to a broad audience (we later discover who that audience is intended to be) also has some tendrils in the Prose book. All the kinds of characters that appeal to readers are here – the naïve acolyte, the scheming and lascivious publisher, the beautiful and damaged damsel, the secondary characters who are not what they appear to be.But in writing this soon-to-be best-seller (and I suspect it will be, because the storyline moves fast and I never did want to abandon it), the theme becomes heavy-handed and the characters in places become caricatures. When Simon moans that all the people around him have lied to him and betrayed him, it’s almost a laughable moment because he has lied by omission to many of them—and most of all, to himself.Now, I love Francine Prose. I have read many of her past books and have totally enjoyed several of them. So it gives me no great joy to depart from several literary s who are calling the book “dazzling”. I want to thank HarperCollins—which is a FAR better publishing house than the one portrayed in these pages!—and NetGalley for enabling me to be an early reader in exchange for an honest .

Melancholy at times, rhapsodic at other times, this is the tale of Daniel, a long-distance runner (both literally and metaphorically) who loses his core self when he escapes a downtrodden town in Florida to make a life for himself in New York.What brings him back is the untimely death of a redneck girl named Aubrey, who gave Daniel a sense of worth. The son of a father and older brother who both beat him and loved him, so that the beating and loving became intertwined in his mind, Daniel is both Black and gay—or at the least, bisexual. He is an outsider with secrets that have to be guarded.But he has his “peeps” – teammates who cheered him, fought him, teased him, and in a very real sense, saved him. Daniel reflects, “They guarded me because they weren’t sure they were going to get out of Palm Coast themselves. But if I escaped, we all did.” They know Daniel through and through, and they accept him, even when he frustrates them. Elias Rodrigues has the patois down pat. The lilting dialogue is a pleasure to read. Daniel thinks, “Been fronting so long, I done forget everything. Then Aubrey died and I started thinking about home…just one generation later, we gone from rivers to fridges, dirt paths to roads, and I’m up there in the biggest city on Earth, running around and I ain’t know if I’m country or I’m city.”This is not a book with a lot of action. The journey Daniel takes is mostly internal, populated with track-team buddies Twig and Desmond, Des’ girlfriend Egypt, and Jess, a chef and friend of Aubrey. The advance blurbs play up that the crux of the story is Daniel’s confrontation of the man who was in the truck with Aubrey when she was killed. In reality, there IS no crux – this is a journey of a young man who is not at peace with himself who is grappling with his family’s Jamaican history and folklore, his impoverished Palm Coast abusive childhood, his new life in New York, and what it really means to feel at home – physically and within himself.

Miller to revisit his octogenarian and cantankerous and debut character, Sheldon Horowitz. In NorweIt must have been enormously tempting for Derek B. Miller to revisit his octogenarian and cantankerous and debut character, Sheldon Horowitz. In Norwegian by Night, we meet this retired watch repairman, haunted by his son’s death in Vietnam and his beliefs that the Koreans—he served in the Korean War—are still pursuing him. The young Sheldon we meet here is not quite formed yet but certainly, we – as readers—gain a deep understanding of how he became the Sheldon we meet at the end of his life in the former book. Some of the same themes abound: the bonds between fathers and sons, vengeance for a murder (in this case, the murder of his father), the tragedy of war, and the callousness of nations as Jews were being rounded up like cattle and herded into an unimaginable genocide. Here, as in Norwegian by Night, there is a merging of an adventure novel, an allegory, and a sociopolitical musing.This book can be read as a standalone; the reader need not have read Norwegian by Night although by doing so, there are richer rewards to be gleaned. Without reading the first book, it is enticing to compare this one to Michael Chabon’s The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. In that novel, two Jewish cousins become major players in the comics industry during World War II, where they experience the highs and lows of fame and tragedy. Sheldon and his best friend Lenny – an aspiring stand-up comic in the Catskills —have similar adventures and the similarities are unmistakable – and also acknowledged by the author (“I feel like this book is in conversation with that one.”)I would have liked a little less of a Chabon vibe. Derek B. Miller is a wonderful writer in his own right and particularly during the first third, the adventures threatened to overshadow the themes. Eventually, I settled into the flow of the novel and the author’s compelling story-telling ability and pages begin to turn. The YA adventure tone – a young, orphaned boy and his sidekick, out to extract revenge, take on the world, and stake their claim in life—combines with an immersion into dark times where true evil was right under our noses and the world failed to see what was beyond the horizon or immediate sight and to recognize that effect follows cause.Lastly, as a reader—and as a Jew—I am indebted to Derek B. Miller for showcasing the heinous anti-Semitism and the outrageous view of Jewish immigration as a “national security issue.” Through the character of Abe, Sheldon’s older cousin, the author gives voice to the injustice of the treatment of Jews as “inferiors” and the disregard of those who refused to acknowledge what was happening.

At age six, Amor was struck by lightning and lost one of her toes and she exudes a morality that is lost on the others. All she knows is that her dying mother promised Salome, the family’s Black maid, the cabin in which she and has lived in for many years. Of course, under apartheid, Salome cannot possibly legally own the cabin—but this, in Amor’s young eyes, is only a minor impediment to fulfilling her mother’s wishes.Her older brother and sister, Anton and Astrid, have wasted their potential. Physically beautiful, there is rot within each of them as they strive to find contentment and some meaning in life. Both fail miserably. Their father is under the sway of a dominee (also called a pastoor) who wields his power to convince the father to provide land for his church.With wry and dark humor, Damon Galgut skewers the hypocrisy of religion—whether it’s the born-again Jewish mother, the oath-breaking Catholic priest, the pastoor and his manipulations, and the “new age” guru who councils Astrid. About the priest hilariously named Timothy Batty: “…seldom does he feel less fallible than when he stands up here among a grieving thong, the master of God’s ceremonies”The promise is of course also metaphorical for the promise made and broken to the nation of South Africa, and the tragedy of apartheid. Its characters flirt with existential and physical threats and still cannot quite do the right thing. As a result, promising lives are guttered and a Black family becomes ultimately resigned to promises not fulfilled. Damon Galgut is always confidently in control of his story, which will likely be one of my Ten Favorite Books of the Year.

His inability to tell a lie quite literally marks him as a child. He quickly confesses to throwing a snowball and is branded with an anvil horn by the victim. He reflects, “Father had told me that telling the truth was a sign of love. Truth was a gift. Back then I was sure that was right.”That belief is sorely tested later on in life when his need for the truth conflicts with a nebulous sort of morality. Unworldly and naïve, Friedrich arrives in Berlin from Switzerland as the Nazi party ascends into power. There he becomes obsessed with a model in his art class named Kristin and he also makes a friend Tristan. Tristan is a member of the Nazi party. And Kristin?

The savagery of the Nazis has been well-documented and there are certainly more glimpses of their inhumaneness in Stella. But this book is really about the inability to face the truth and develop a clear sense of right and wrong. Is it right or wrong to betray one human being to save another – or to save oneself? What if the truth is too much to bear? What if the truth is defined by evil people and it has no semblance to the real truth? What then?“Life turns us into liars,” Friedrich concludes.

They raise unanswerable questions, and they rob us of our humanity. Sometimes, those at the vortex of the shooting can see their way through, but it takes time and work.All of this is explored in Kim Hooper’s compelling novel, No Hiding in Boise. The shooter suddenly appears at Ray’s Bar in Boise one night and kills five people, severely injures two more, and ends up taking his own life The author spends minimal time on that night; correctly, her focus is on those who suffer the consequences, which include Angie, the wife of one of the injured who has no idea of what her husband Cale was doing at the bar in the late night…Tessa, a bartender and a fortunate survivor, at least bodily, who may have been the love interest of Cale …and Joyce, the devastated mother of the shooter who must mourn her only child, condemn his actions, and wonder why she didn’t note the signs. The other victims receive their own chapters and chance to relay their stories.There is a lot of authenticity in these characters and particularly how a tragedy of this inexplicable nature causes each to drill down to what is important and what is essential. Each goes about the activities of daily living—playing with an innocent two-year-old who needs mom, trying to fake the way through a relationship that’s failing, trying to reach out to others who have been impacted. Yet the world has changed for them. The “mystery” of what Angie’s husband, Cale, was doing at the bar is readily apparent for observant readers – so much so that I suspect that Kim Hooper may have wanted readers to figure it out way before her character does. No spoilers but some of the dynamics of the eventual reveal left me questioning. An epilogue, that I regarded as unnecessary, wraps up the characters more than I believe is necessary. I would have preferred to have imagined where life would lead them.These are quibbles.

I read over 100 First, before I do anything else, let me bow my head and give praise to the creative muse that sparks the talent of Richard Flanagan. I read over 100 books a year and this book may well be one of my Top Five favorite contemporary books ever. It’s a 10-star.What is it about? Succinctly, it’s about how we as humans were not ejected from Eden; rather, Eden was ejected from us. Many years ago, the poet Matthew Arnold wrote, “Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers – Little we see in Nature that is ours.” Now, more than a century later, we accelerate this loss and Richard Flanagan fiercely proceeds where Arnold let off.The “main event” centers around Francie, an older woman whose time has come. She wants to die. But Anna and her younger brother Terzo refuse to give in to natural forces. To the dismay of Francie and her older brother, Tommy they fight for unwarranted medical intervention and pony up hundreds of thousands of dollars. As a result, Francie is dying but is never dead—wretched and emaciated, she lies on her side listening to platitudes about “how she needs to be a fighter.” She is condemned to the ongoing delirium of life that is admittedly, no life.The impact on those of us who have been present as ancient parents imploded into eternity—my own mother was 94 when she recently died—is indescribable. The descriptions of what is forced upon Francie to endure in the name of love is brutal to read and a testimony to the sloughing, flaking, disintegrating of a body that is forced to live no matter what living might now mean.At the same time, Anna and her brothers numb themselves by not seeing the reality and instead, numbing and medicating themselves with social media – Instagram, Facebook, Twitter—which lulls the with a constant stream of the tragedies that are occurring all around them. This is the year of the Australian fires. And just as Francie’s mind and body are being ravaged, so is the beautiful world that has also been overlooked and ignored.In the midst of all this, Anna’s body parts start vanishing: first a finger, then a knee, then another finger, a wrist, one breast. Just as the fish, birds, animals and plants burn and teeter on the edge of extinction, so do we. The irony is that hardly anyone recognizes or acknowledges the vanished parts. Richard Flanagan writes, “…all if it, all the world in her, all of it all of her vanishing—shot, bulldozed logged mined developed poisoned choked beaten burning burnt.”The Living Sea of Waking Dreams is startling and it is horrific and it is authentic and most of all, it is important. It is a stunning achievement from a master writer at the top of his game. And, despite is disturbing tone, it is worshipful: Anna and her brother “would watch never ceasing to be amazed at the miracle life conjured out of empty water. For in the returrning net were so many, many fish, so much food, and the goodness and joy and fecundity of it, the blessing of the sea…” There is a some solace here: we have it within us to bring Eden back to us....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Apr 07, 2021","Apr 10, 2021","Apr 07, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/54282408-the-living-sea-of-waking-dreams

He's your godson and you're crazy about the kid. So you go out looking on an icy evening. Your car swerves on the ice. When you awaken from the accident, your memory of what happened is gone.

Each relies on a degree of repetition and each is haunting in its own way.In the first—Touring the Land of the Dead—Natsuko, the daughter of a delusional and socially scheming mother, marries beneath her purported station to a man named Taichi. Her mother and sycophant brother, who crave a lavish lifestyle and unrealistically believe that Natsuko owes it to them, do not accept her husband from the start. Soon enough, Taichi is forced to stop working because of a neurological disease. The novella centers on a trip the couple take to a one-time luxury resort hotel—now a spa—that Natusko’s grandfather had taken her mother to many years back. On first read, it appears that Taichi, with his four bad limbs, burps and tics, is a terrible burden to bear. But gradually, Natsuko gleans the truth: her husband is a special, kind, accepting and much-loved man who, from the start, was in danger of being consumed from within from her family’s illness. It is they who are truly distorted and it is he who saved her from their ugliness.The second novella, Ninety-Nine Kisses, is a bit more of a conundrum. Our narrator, Nanako, is the youngest of four unmarried sisters, each one a quarter of a whole. When a stranger, dubbed S, comes to town, the older three all vie for his attention and his love. The one who remains disenchanted is Nanako, whose feelings for her sisters borders on incestuous. “You see, we’re all one person. So long as one of us sisters played the role of the man, it would be all self-contained. We ought to be able to do that. We’re a perfect whole. Like Adam before Eve. Or like a hermaphrodite.”Nanako’s invasion of her sisters’ minds and intents by itself feels incestuous. Her realization that soon she would become a woman as well, filled with contradiction and stubbornness, is her own form of resolution. Yet for me, this novella doesn’t rise to the excellence of the first, although I applaud the author for delving into the mystical bond of sisterhood.

The controlling husband who recognizes in an interaction with his wife that his choice was being denied or being accommodating in such a way so as not to suffer defeat. The father and son, both named Mardon, who are at the mercy of their past, unable to find the panacea that will allow them to spend an evening together.

What is that “something unreachable” that we carry within us that can’t be mimicked or duplicated?The book focuses on a young teenager named Josie, who chooses a solar-powered AF – Artificial Friend – from a department store. This AI, Klara, is not the latest technological model, but what she lacks in gimmicks is more than made up for in her empathetic ability to understand deep truths, or, in Klara’s words, “The more I observe the more feelings become available to me.”From the naïve prism of Klara’s mind, we know that Josie is unwell and that she is experiencing the blush of first love with a boy named Rick, who was not “lifted” the way she has been. The import of being “lifted” is only slowly revealed. Klara’s fierce loyalty and growing emotional attachment to Josie leads her to want to be her savior. Klara – and other Ais – have their own god to worship, the Sun, and their belief in him and his ability to grant miracles is not unlike the mythic and sometimes primitive beliefs of humans and the gods that they create.Many questions arise within the pages of this book: what does it mean to be “lifted” and how does it divide one group of people from another? What happens when technology becomes so advanced that robots are capable of deep feelings? What do we owe them? Can artificial life ever become so advanced that it’s able to replicate what makes us human? Ultimately, another question arises: will parents play a lottery game that causes their children to be sick – even die – if it means giving them a better place at the table? The beauty of this novel is that Ishiguro is borrowing from a world that is very close to already being what he envisions. Klara’s field of vision appears in squares and panels, calling to mind the way we view the world through computer screens and iPads and iPhones. The desire to “lift” children at the expense of their health and happiness is sadly, all too common.Of the two books – and they do complement each other – Never Let Me Go packs more of an emotional wallop.

Yet he is easily replaced when Nives chooses to bring a chicken with a chewed-up claw named Giacomina, into her home. Her remembrances of wonderful moments with her husband are supplanted surprisingly easily by Giacomina’s company. And then, while watching a Tide laundry commercial, Giacomina becomes paralyzed.If this whimsical and wacky premise appeals to you—well, you’re in for a treat because you “ain’t seen nothing yet.” Nives calls the town veterinarian, her old and alcoholic friend, Loriano Bottai to help revive the chicken.

Rosa, who was emotionally aching, according to Bottai, is the ultimate metaphor for what keeps us up at night. As minutes yawn into hours and the conversation shifts and deepens, we begin to wonder if Nives and Bottai are really each other’s Rosa. As the conversation veers from lost love to nostalgia to the double-sword emotions of joy and despair, these uniquely-drawn characters discover the strength it takes to get by despite long-held secrets, subjective memories, and wounds that never completely heal.My thanks to one of my favorite publishers Europa Editions, for sharing a galley with me in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Mar 17, 2021","Mar 17, 2021","Mar 17, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55155433-nives

They’re not homes per se, more like portals, gateways, that propel you on the way they did in life too. Only problem is, the deeper down you go, the more muddled they get.”Tomas Orilla is called back to Argentina after a decade abroad in the U.S. to visit the mother of his one-time love, who is dying of cancer. He has not set foot in the country since 1976, when he disappeared with an altered passport, yet he has been haunted ever since. All those years back, he was held thrall to a mostly unrequited love with a leftist insurgent --- a woman named Isabel who fought to dismantle the deadly authoritarian regime responsible for the Dirty War.Besotted with love for her he allowed himself to become her tool as a double agent: spgying against a man known as the Colonel—his benefactor—and using his medical skills in a concentration camp for dissidents. There he is complicit in the detailed tortures that go on while reporting names and details to Isabel to ultimately save more lives.This elegantly written book is all about hauntings and combines the horrors of past memories with the surreal. Tomas’ own ghosts appear everywhere—in his memories, in the streets, in the Automotores, the auto plant that he worked in that was used for ultimate tortures. The author, whose own half-sister Isabel was “disappeared” in the Dirty War, does not hold back in his description of what went on and as a result, there is an authenticity that cannot be replicated by hobbyist writers.It is the themes, rather than the plot itself, that are showcased. What happens when we confront monsters? How do we keep ourselves from becoming one? What choices do we have and which ones do we own? How do we cope with the guilt and regret that continue to rule and shape our lives?Tomas’ benefactor – himself a ghost – aptly defines why Tomas has come back: “Fleeing your life, abandoning your marriage. Venturing to the underworld for the disappeared to pluck a sexy, lovey one out, disturbing all those who griever here just to heal your itty-bitty little bit of emptiness.”I want to 5-star this courageous and intricately layered book. Only one thing stops me. I had a hard time suspending belief that an ordinary person with intrinsically good values could allow himself to be a long-time pawn of a manipulative woman such as Isabel. The experiences he has would, I think, break most of us or at the very least, make us want to abandon his mission quickly. Tomas may, indeed, be an empty cipher but I wonder how even someone who is half-empty could bear all that he is forced to bear. Still, this novel will certainly haunt my own dreams....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 11, 2021","Mar 17, 2021","Mar 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52644994-hades-argentina

Lorenzo has not seen or heard from his mother in many years, but it is obvious that she has played a big role in shaping who he is. Years ago, she took off with a man Lorenzo refers to as “her partner”—both in a business sense and a “friends with benefits” sense. What is Lula’s business? She is the manufacturer of a weight-loss machine, shaped in the form of a giant egg. The egg seems deliberate, a metaphor for the maternal bond that links Lula and Lorenzo. There is an unsettling bond between mother and young son that borders on emotional abuse. The confidences they share, the intimate wrestling, all of it seems like a hint that Lorenzo has an unhealthy love for his mother.We don’t know quite what this relationship did to him, but the author casually drops some hints. At one point, Lorenzo is at a guard rail and reflects, “I’ve always been afraid of getting too close—my legs might take over and make the leap for me.” What is the author really implying? As readers, we don’t know, but we can guess.Throughout, Romania and its troubled history mirrors the troubled back story of Lorenzo. There are many references to the oppressive reign of Ceausescu. At his palace, tourists take photos, mindlessly skimming over the havoc and horror of the Ceausecu years. They capture an image but not a reality.The title of the book comes from Psalm 130: “If you kept a record of sins, oh Lord, who could stand with you?” Lula may have sinned but she was also sinned against—cold and distant parents, a lover who eventually deserts her, and a life that is ultimately in shambles.

Before we read another word, we know this will be the story of a toxic—perhaps dangerous—father and the disillusionment of a young son. We know something will happen and it won’t be pretty.That is the genius of Benjamin Wood. He lets us in on the arc of the story right away yet he still rachets up the tension and suspense so tightly that at times, it’s next to impossible to exhale. This is a psychological character study, a story of a boy—now a man—who went on a journey with his father, estranged from the family, with the hope that he will prove his constancy, and instead, finds himself in a situation that few sane people could hope to endure.Their one shared interest is a children’s TV program—The Artifex—which, no coincidence, centers around a child who has greater insights and innate powers than others of his age. That child almost succumbs to an asthma attack until he is lifted into the air by a strange and exotic being from another world. She promises to make him feel brand-new and he mutters to her, “Thank you for saving me.”It is up to the reader to uncover the connection. The father—Fran—works on the set and his son, Daniel, knows every script by heart. Daniel is promised access to the set—a magical promise to a young boy. But instead, Daniel becomes party to a real-life horror show that his young mind, years later, has trouble understanding. Who to believe? Is the memory of a child—for that matter, the memory of anyone—the key to the truth?This is a hold on tight to your seat, make sure your schedule is cleared kind of book. I had already read this author previous novel, The Ecliptic, so I knew I was in for a treat.

They are all enigmas, not only to those around them, but also to themselves. And now all of them—the Syrian mother Mazna and her Lebanese cardiologist husband Idris and their three grown children, Ava, Mimi and Naj—are about to come together in the ancestral home in Beirut for the first time in years.This is a novel that mines deepest emotions—long ago passions secret loves, rivalries, shame and desires—and mixes it with the external world of smoldering tensions, class differences, the ongoing Lebanese Civil War, the difficulties inherent in uprooting to another country. The result is a page-turning saga of fully fleshed characters who are coping with complicated relationships and the debris of lost dreams and ambitions.Particularly riveting is the triangle of the patriarch and matriarch of this family, Mazna and Idris and their back story that includes their Palestinian friend Zakaria. Close friend to Idris, love interest to Mazna, this hypnotic man lives on and casts a wide shadow over their marriage—even though we, the readers, know from the first few pages that he is killed. Their adult children are all on the cusp of a decision: Ava, who is married to a WASP from a prominent family who is processing her husband’s short-lived affair, Mimi, a musician who has just walked away from the rock band he founded, and his more successful sister, Naj, who enjoys a stellar music career in Beirut and is dealing with the emergence of her one-time lover.“We don’t choose what we belong to. What claims us,” Mazda reflects at one point in the novel. This novel has it all – powerful characters, a mesmerizing plot, and even the fig leaf of redemption.

Set in remote Northern Ontario in 1972, it is narrated by three characters. Seven-year-old Clara is alienated and mourning her missing teenage sister and finds solace in caring for the cat of her elderly neighbor who is in the hospital. That neighbor, Mrs. Orchard, harbors a secret from her past and is trying to make late-life amends. The third person, Liam, is emotionally stunted for reasons he doesn’t quite understand, and is inexplicably given the house by Mrs. Orchard. Slowly but surely, the reader comes to understand what bonds these three disparate characters together as integrated layers of grief, regrets and flashes of understanding pull them forward. At one point, Liam questions, “How do you know another person’s mind? How do you know your own?” Although no person gets full clarity on those questions, the characters get a little closer to the answers.Interestingly, Anne Tyler blurbs the cover, writing, “I’ve been trying to tell everybody I know about Mary Lawson. Each of her novels is just a marvel.” I definitely see commonalities between the two writers: the ability to dive deep into the psyche of imperfect people, preserving their respect and dignity while getting readers to nod self-knowingly in acknowledgement of their foibles.

Her scoundrel father has abandoned the family, her older sister Anna has died in childbirth, and her mother spends too much time in bed under the shadow of depression. Outside her personal world, the rumors of an imminent Nazi attack pervade everyone’s thoughts.But Hettie has her dreams: to become one of the world’s first female zookeepers. That dream takes a step forward when she is charged with caring for a three-year-old elephant named Violet, displaced from Ceylon. For this young woman in mourning, Violet gives her life purpose and meaning. Each, in her own way, is alone and needing solace from the other. And so it goes until Belfast is truly attacked and Violet’s very survival—and perhaps Hettie’s as well—is at stake. Hettie then must take extraordinary measures to get her out of harm’s way and in doing so, save a part of what is good and true and real.This is a story of loss and resilience and it may sound as if it’s been done a million times before. Trust me, it hasn’t. Author S. Kirk Walsh has obviously done her homework about the tensions in Belfast – the Protestants vs. the Catholics, Ireland vs. its enemies, and what it was like to operate a zoo in the midst of sheer chaos. It authentically creates a window into a coming-of-age story when those on the cusp of adulthood had to grow up fast. Hettie makes some bewildering choices, particularly in men, but given the time and circumstances and her mourning state, none of them are all that surprising. At its core, this is a love story about the human-animal connection and in places, it is heartbreaking. Violet is portrayed in an authentic way (put another way, she is depicted as an elephant, not a human).On a personal note, as someone who has been on a photo safari in Kenya, I learned about the immense capacity of elephants to bond and to mourn.

At the start of the millennium, a teenage boy named Iggy sets the First Baptist Church on fire, killing most of the worshippers inside because “darkness begets darkness and love only got me into trouble.”He is one of the voices that is heard within these pages, which starts with a chorus of townspeople—saints and sinners—who pay witness later to what happened in their town.

Although the book is well-written, with prose that sometimes sparkles, it might have been better served with a narrower framework—fewer characters, perhaps, or a more singular focus on, say, oppressive religion on already alienated teens or the role of imperfect memory in recreating and trying to undo tragic consequences.

It’s a fantastic character study of five women, in their 30s and 40s who live in Leipzig, Germany, whose stories are so compelling that they leap off the page. I didn’t want the book to end.The stores, as one might suspect, are about love – aspirational love, toxic love, well-meaning love gone wrong (and sometimes, right). As one character ruminates, “Love comes as it should come—unprovoked, blamelessly and compellingly. It can’t be controlled and can’t be stopped. Any attempt to rebel against it is a pointless waste of time and effort.”But to pigeon-hole this novel into “stories of love” would be doing it a disservice. The women we meet within these pages could be women we know. They could be us. They’re familiar yet they embrace their own unique stories. There is Paula, who navigates the gap between wishing and reality, dealing with an unsatisfactory marriage because of her desire for a family. Judith is a doctor, toxically seeking a connection from personal ads, whose experiences have left her with a disdain of these men. Brida is a friend of Judith’s whose desire to be a published writer at the expense of her marriage pushes away her husband—who she doesn’t want enough until she can’t have him. Malika is the woman who her husband left to pursue his relationship with her—a musician whose life has been defined by the rejection of her parents and then her lover. Jorinde, Malika’s sister, is an actress whose third child was a result of an affair with a famous actor and who now must balance acting with her role as mother.Keenly observed and full of empathy, this novel touches on so much of a woman’s life in her role as mother, daughter, sister, daughter, lover and ex-wife.

When she enters her teens and falls for her classmate Alexandre, a dazzlingly handsome, charismatic, and ambitious boy, a chain of events begins to fall in place that builds momentum as the book reaches its conclusion.A sense of bestiality pervades this novel, from the opening pages when we envision Blanche and Alexandre consummating their young love, to the inhuman squeals and terror of a pig being slaughtered outside their window. The visceral brutality of animal existence at Paradise is intertwined with the sensual and uncontrollable urges, emotional heartache and scheming intentions that consume humans. By the time we reach the ending, we know what has to happen and yet the ferocity still takes us by surprise.This novel, beautifully translated from the French by Tina Kover, is a true “wow.” Thank you to Europa Editions, who once again engrossed me in hours of reading pleasure in exchange for a most decidedly honest . ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,Feb 2021,"Feb 05, 2021","Feb 01, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54812506-a-beast-in-paradise

Can anyone say for certain what really happened to us back then? If we’re blessed, though, a few words might remain by our side…”This one story encapsulates themes that occur in many of these stories in this collection. The first-person singular narrator relays that he is would like to tell a story about a woman but the thing is, he knows next to nothing about her. He can’t even remember her name, or her face. It turns out that she writes tanta poetry and eventually sends him a self-published book. Much later, he tries to recall her and says this: “Each and every moment our bodies are on a one-way journey to collapse and deterioration, unable to turn back the clock I close my eyes, I open them again, only to realize that I the interim so many things have vanished.”Other stories pick up on this theme. In With the Beatles, the first-person singular narrator has an encounter with his then-girlfriend’s brother, who has a rare condition: the sequence of his memory gets messed up. One part of his memory gets stashed away in the wrong drawer. Later, he meets this brother again, who delivers some very unsettling news. Memories come back that must be reexamined for clues.And, in Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey, the first-person singular narrator feels as if bits of reality and unreality are randomly changing places when he encounters a talking monkey at his inn. The monkey confesses to stealing human women’s names, thereby causing them to lose a piece of their own memory: “But even if love fades away, even if it’s unrequited, you can still hold on to the memory of having loved someone, of having fallen in love with someone.”There is music that lurks in the background of many of these stories: Charlie Parker and imaginary jazz albums, renditions of Robert Schumann’s Carnival, the Beatles – all constituting a wallpaper of a life. In one of the stories, focusing on baseball, the narrator himself is named Murakami.How much is personal? I can’t help but feel as if just about every story here incorporates a little bit of the author as he muses about the three important “M’s” in life: memory, mortality and music....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 14, 2022","Jan 16, 2022","Feb 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54614599-first-person-singular

Spence possesses the trifecta of a good life: a happy marriage, critical acclaim for his work (he’s even earned a MacArthur!) and the means to live in Morningside Heights, where the median price for a home is close to a million dollars. But then, in his mid 50s, he gets felled by early-onset Alzheimer’s. And that changes everything.What makes this novel soar is its nuanced portrayal of the characters, who are so real they could walk off the pages. That connection I alluded to? As a New Yorker of Jewish descent, like Spence and Pru, I was forced to pay witness for 10 years to my superstar mom’s slow decline from dementia (in her case, Lewy Body Disorder). The authenticity of some of the scenes crafted by Joshua Henkin are amazingly accurate.The family dynamics are set up first, and those are beautifully crafted: the dynamic auburn-haired wunderkind professor who is a student favorite, the loving wife from an Orthodox Jewish background who places Spence ahead of her own career plans, the grounded daughter who is on her way to medical school and the dyslexic son, raised by Spence’s bohemian and narcissistic ex-wife, who struggles to fit into a family where intelligence and structure and ambition are all valued.When Spence begins to lose focus, each family member is affected, particularly Pru, who is forced to transform from a sometimes proud and worshipful wife to a protector and caregiver. The indignities of Alzheimer’s – from being forced out of a career to soiled pants and forgetfulness — are all written with nuance, as is Pru’s desire to find some sort of connection with someone else while honoring the bonds of her marriage vows.

No, like there’s nowhere I can be.”The Secret Talker does an excellent job of diving way into the psyche of a repressed woman named Hongmei who has lived her life hiding thoughts and feelings from those closest to her—and more troublingly, from herself.She is married now, for the second time, living with a professor named Glen in Northern California. But one day, out of the blue, she receives an email from a secret talker, who has observed her in a restaurant and proceeds to analyze every breath, bite and laugh. He assures her she shouldn’t be alarmed—that he wishes her no ill will—yet the emails keep coming. He (or is it a he?) seems to know everything about her. And unlike so many stalkers, the aim is not to flatter Hongmei; in fact, the secret talker often mentions how disappointed he is in her, consistently misspelling the word.Intrigued yet laid bare, Hongmei begins to reveal herself to her secret talker, providing details of her life that have not been shared with anyone else. The lure of not being tied down with beautiful misunderstandings or lies is liberating to her. In return, she finds out a few things about her stalker’s own hidden life. Let me be clear that this book is not a thriller, and anyone coming into it with that mindset will be – well, disappointed. Rather, it is a psychological study of how we yearn to reveal ourselves and ease our burdens (think of the stalker as a priest in a confessional). And how by freedom is the byproduct of the highest degree of honesty. The twist at the end may be guessed by observant readers but satisfies nonetheless.The Secret Talker, scheduled to be turned into a movie, suffers from what I suspect is a less-than-ideal translation from the Chinese. As someone who reads many translated books, I believed, in several instances, that a more proactive translator could have created that extra level of angst or suspense.

This author has a voice, style and story that’s all her own. It’s not for the faint-hearted. The topic of incest never is. But for those who can handle the subject material, the pages can’t turn fast enough.Our narrator, Roan Montgomery, is 15 years old when we meet her and is well on her way to becoming an Olympic gold-medal winner someday. Her father and coach is Monty Montgomery—a handsome, virile, famed equestrian in his own right with all the medals to prove it. Her unreliable mother is a self-centered and damaged alcoholic. Roan lives the life of privilege in an estate in the Shenandoah Valley, with servants and horses and her own heavily followed blog. But despite her fairy-tale like life, Roan is hiding a devastating secret. From the time she was a young girl, her father, a raging narcissist and control freak, has been sexually abusing her…and the abuse threatens to continue indefinitely until Roan meets a boy with whom she feels a genuine connection.Most incest victims become permanently damaged by their isolation, shame, guilt and need for secrecy. We learn early on in this novel that Roan has a spine; she fights back when a classmate leaves a smutty cartoon of her mother in the arms of the headmaster on the classroom easel. Her equestrian career has also taught her to not state or portray her emotions and to dissimulate when she’s not coming out on top. All this serves Roan well. But Roan is no match for a master of manipulation who has the physical strength, money, and power to take her down if she disobeys him even in the smallest ways.Her feelings are multi-layered: for example, like most incest victims, she feels that she is at fault for not stopping and even enjoying at times the forbidden sexual relationship. It takes some excruciating occurrences for Roan to claim her strength and there are scenes that are very difficult to read. But incest shouldn’t be an easy beach read. Susan Mihalic made me cry and cheer for Roan and she made me not want to come up for air. The ultimate theme is resilience, which should make this a winner in both the commercial and literary reading circles. I'm concerned, though, that Roan's outlier experience with incest—the typical incest victim is unable to compartmentalize or triumph quite so easily as Roan—might offer unrealistic expectations of how hard it is for most incest victims to ever put it behind them.A big thanks to Scout, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, for providing me with an advance reader’s copy in exchange for a most decidedly honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jan 22, 2021","Jan 25, 2021","Jan 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892208-dark-horses

Consider this: a young and aspirational would-be writer named Florence Darrow works at a publishing house in a low-level position. Early on, the reader catches glimpses that she’s not the millk-fed small towner she appears to be; she has a dark side to her. Suddenly, a major opportunity falls in her lap: she is asked to become the assistant to “Maud Dixon” an anonymous novelist who has written a phenomenal best-seller. She becomes one of a handful to learn Maud Dixon’s identity and she moves to an obscure upper New York town where she’s at the novelist’s beck and call. When the novelist asks her to accompany her to a Morocco research trip, she jumps at the chance.Interestingly, some elements of this plot have been all the rage with novelists this year—The Plot by Jean Koritz and The Golden Kingdom by Lawrence Osbourne, to name just two. That being said, Alexandra Andrews provides her own twists to the novel as a sinister chain of events begins to unfold. The theme of misplaced identity looms large as does the theme of unvarnished ambition.But I found myself wondering at times how Florence—not exactly the most likeable character in the world but who cares about THAT—is so naïve and short-sighted. Could she really not have foreseen some of the complications that arise from her decision? How could she have moved forward with certain plans knowing that in today’s interconnected world, it would be hard to pull it off?I’m trying hard to avoid spoilers. I was pretty sure I knew where the ending was heading – and I was right – but it did not spoil the reading experience for me.

They then have a son, Nando, who is born a U.S. citizen. A third baby, Talia, comes along right at the time when Mauro is caught on trumped-up charges and deported back to Colombia. Elena can find menial work and someone to look after her older two, but not the baby. She arranges for Talia to return to her grandmother – and father – in Colombia with the hopes of reuniting.So there is the plot, in a nutshell. One child who is Colombian by birth growing up in a land where she is looked at askance. A son who is born in the U.S. and actually lives in his birth country. And a daughter, a U.S. citizen by birth, who is forced to grow up back in Colombia. And, of course, two parents who love each other but are separated, perhaps permanently.Yet it’s not the plot that drives Infinite Country. It is the artistic risks that Patricia Engel takes and the themes she tackles. Only Talia is given an active, exterior life and only Talia is firmly rooted in the present. The other characters are provided with back stories or internal reflections that are highlighted in spare and sometimes fragmented paragraphs or chapters that reveal a lot. For example, this: “Emigration was a peeling away of the skin. An undoing. You wake each morning and forget where you are, who you are, and when the world outside shows you your reflection, it’s ugly and distorted; you’ve become a scorned, unwanted character.” Just wow.Interspersed with the narrative is Colombian folklore, which provides a mythic framework to provide meaning to the present. The themes are universal: how do we define home? Are we choosing to traffic ourselves when we choose to emigrate? Is leaving home a kind of death or a renewal or can it be both? What are the costs of living in a land where you don’t truly belong and never really know its folklore, customs or extended family?Those who prefer a book with multi-dimensional characters who spearhead the narrative won’t find it here. The themes reign, but the themes are devastatingly presented. The story of Mauro and Elena and their family is a human story and most definitely a universal one.

What if Prince Charming turned out to be not quite so…charming? What if Cinderella got “woke” years later to find that she had traded in her own dreams to live a sterile life with an unhappy man who ignored and at times despised her? In other words – what if Cinderella became trapped in her own fairy tale? And what if, above all else, she wanted her prince dead?This audaciously imaginative, wildly creative and lyrically written new novel by Olga Grushin is a true marvel. It’s populated with all the archetypes and legends of fairy tales—the witches, the fairy godmother, the dancing mice (who have delightful back stories of their own), the stepsisters (who turn out to be nowhere as bad as Cinderella imagined.) Hints of other fairy tales abound—Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, Hansel & Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood—and are woven seamlessly into the narrative.In a fairy tale world, Ms. Grushin suggests, things are run by their own logic. Young maidens are always beautiful and fair and princes and kings are always valent or sometimes, blood-thirsty. Witches weave spells and stepsisters are evil. And woe to the fairy tale character who tries to break out of this preordained life.But, the author suggests, if fairy tales constrict—and they do—doesn’t a princess feel more clearheaded, awake and present when she embraces her messy real-life possibilities—filled with hope and promise and unpredictability? Don’t true-life ""fairy tales"" occur when we break free from the battling the tedium of stale fairy-tale coupledom? And aren't there bound to be greater rewards awaiting the generations of unhappy women who collectively try to dream themselves into a life that transforms the chaos of pain into some kind of order—while giving up something important in the process?Cinderella, then, becomes every woman who gives away her freedom and her fire—her untold stories and her future selves—in exchange for a “handsome prince” and a big house to call home. Without ever stretching herself beyond her one-dimensional role, no wonder her prince begins to feel stifled too.We, the readers, never do know Cinderella’s real name until she goes through her own Hero’s Journey and emerges with realizations of who she really is and what she really wants.

In the interest of true honesty, he reveals his past marriages, his desertion of the children he helped bring into the world, his betrayal of a best friend, his demythologized role as a deserter to Canada in the Vietnam War, and his forays with Bob Dylan and Joan Baez during that time frame.But it would be a mistake to view Foregone as a plot-focused novel or to even take it at face meaning. Banks is setting his own spotlight on the role of memory: the complexity of our stories and their moral ambiguities, the reductive and selective way we remember them, the way that fantasies confabulation and even hallucinations affect what we recall, and how we shape how we want to be remembered.Leo Fife tries to break free from his image—a fictional character created by others—to own the truths of his life, without anyone else doing the directing or editing of it. Russell Banks writes, “…standing at the meaningful center, is the hologram named Fife, Leonard Fife, a remembered version of the man as remembered by the man himself.”To complicate the picture, Fife is the ultimate unreliable narrator, mixing memories and dreams and imagined details and memories, embedding whatever drifts his way. Are his memories accurate? Are they mostly accurate but rearranged by the intervening years? And then the reader also needs to look at the puppeteer—Banks himself—who, at 80 years old, shares some of the plot details with his character. Banks cautions us not to try too hard: “It’s like trying to tie a novel to the author’s real life…You can’t do it.” And indeed, the reader truly can’t. Russell Banks is unique but not unique—his story of how we remember is universal. This is an affecting and self-challenging work that may turn off some readers who want to view it solely from the prism of Leo Fife’s life rather than expand it to the role of memory on elucidating that life.

Both his American and his Thai-born wife have two children each, and surprisingly, the wives they master the art of restraint in dealing with each other.And then it spirals out from there.

And then we meet Rachel, whose brother Saul is dying of cancer, and Bud who was raised by John Birchers, and Tara from transitioned from Kathmandu to Berkeley and other characters, some of whom have six degrees of separation.The quest for happiness, Joan Silber seems to be saying, is universal as we span countries and genders and ages and ethnicities. And sometimes, the lessons we learn are not the ones we expect to learn: that happiness can come from leading an authentic life or letting go of a material possession or an expected way of living our life. A one-time lover from far away, the dying lover of a current lover, a husband’s secret second wife—all of them provide insights and ways to move forward.Joan Silber, as always, writes as if it were effortless (and this is merely an illusion) and infuses her nuanced characters with a kind of quirky wisdom. Despite some situations which at first appear to be sad, what ties these stories together is the hope of redemption and the belief that the possibilities of some form of happiness exist, even if in impermanence.

A story can be 1% true and 99% made up, or 99% true and 1% made up, and the reader won’t know the difference, the writer doesn’t have to declare. It means he can tell the truth and take the Fifth simultaneously.”I don’t know how much of A Lie Someone Told You About Yourself is true. But I’m assuming that much of it is, indeed, the author’s own experience. The fact that he can mine it to write this work of autofiction is courageous.The characters—referred to as the father and the mother—find out that the baby she is carrying likely has a rare condition called mosaicism—too many chromosomes in some of its cells. The list of what the baby may be born with is four pages long. Single-spaced. There is a small chance that the baby might, in fact, be born normal but the odds are high that she won’t be. The couple decide to have what is referred to as a “virtuous abortion.”Those readers who have rigid beliefs about abortion—that it is never right or never wrong—may not be the ideal readers for this book although they SHOULD be. There are many nuances here, including the ongoing feelings of shame combined with the belief they did what they had to do. In any event, they decide to try for another baby and this time, the mother carries their son full term.The mother and father then enter the purgatory of parenthood—the initial loss of self, the fears of witnessing that child, who may or may not be on the spectrum grow, the efforts of keeping love alive. Interspersed with dark comedy—both parents are writers and their repertoire is riveting—Peter Ho Davies never falters in his soul-baring depiction of modern marriage and parenthood. It’s all depicted here—the shame and guilt, the rawness and fury, the aching love and the absurdities. At one point he asks the mother, “Do you mind my writing about it?” Her answer: “It’s your version. Your side. I didn’t take it as the whole story.” She also ponders what their son will think of it in the ridiculously distant future.I, too, wonder. Will he be comfortable with the exposure and raw intimacy of the book? Or will he recognize the fierce and passionate love for him that informs just about every page of this candid and authentic work? I suspect the latter.The last pages were rushed as if the author were trying to sum up his thoughts way too quickly.

It’s about shifting shapes, ghostly shapes and dark shapes and it’s about accepting that change and growth is a constant in life.But perhaps most of all, it’s a look into how you shape a city and how a city shapes you. The city in question is Sydney, where our narrator and three housemates live in a share space, a temporary dwelling as they figure out their lives. Sydney doesn’t lead to a lot of interiority, nor had it made the narrator feel settled in her bones. Nor has it been easy for her to separate the city from herself. At one point, she questions, she questions, “Are we all superimposing ourselves onto our backdrop, forcing the geography to come alive with our own loss and love?”Indeed, in ways, the narrator is. Still young and not quite formed, she has lost her father to cancer in the city and she still smarts from her loss, reaching back to memories of him while trying to make sense of her life in the present. As a result, to others, she seems inscrutable as she hardens herself against the demand to feel all the time.The novel is divided into four seasons and ends with spring, the metaphorical time of rebirth. Each season includes vignettes, many of which could function as short-short stories, which provide propulsive lyrical insights into the narrator and her friends, her dreams, her grief, her dabbling into taking her place as a multi-ethnic Australian.

Amadeo Padilla is a most unlikely Jesus, who has experienced the five wounds of the soul, including rejection, betrayal, and humiliation. His young immensely pregnant teenage daughter, Angel, whom he deserted as a child, arrives at his door as he prepares feverishly for the role. When he tells her he will be carrying the cross, her sarcastic answer: “And I’m the Virgin Mary.”The story (also entitled Five Wounds) is powerful and for the first few chapters, we are on familiar territory. But it is the author’s intention to fill out her story, dig deeper, and introduce us to characters who are so real that it is hard to leave them at the book’s close.The theme is love as both gift and challenge. And that describes Angel’s baby, Connor, to a tee. A joyful baby who nonetheless is demanding—as all babies are—is the glue that brings together Amadeo, his mother Yolanda, his ex-wife Marissa whom Angel is estranged from, and drop-out classmate moms who, like Angel, are preparing for their GED. Each of these characters must muddle through the murky issues of their past and somehow, just somehow, take themselves in hand to forge forward to a better future.I loved this book. I loved his big-heartedness, its gritty authenticity, its depiction of our human sins and frailties and its promise of redemption. I found myself rooting for Amadeo and Angel at every turn.

And then his narcissistic student at a low-residency MFA program arrogantly shares his own plot, which is a surefire best seller. And then circumstances change and the novelist—Jake Finch Bonner—is able to take the framework of the plot and turn it into a success beyond his wildest imagination. And then something happens, and his veracity is about to be exposed.To write a novel like that, you have to deliver the goods. What would this surefire plot be about? For what feels like the longest time, the author withholds it. But when the story comes into focus, it all starts to make sense. And there’s that a plot twist that I never saw coming (and I think I’m pretty good at ferreting those plot twists out).But behind the mechanisms of the storyline, Jean Hanff Korelitz’s theme is appropriation. Who gets to tell a story? Is any plot just an idea until an enterprising novelist grabs hold of it and gives it wings? Are there indeed original plots and if so, doesn’t it fall upon the writer’s talent to bring it into the spotlight? Can anyone simply lay claim to an idea?It’s fun reading—the character of Jake, as well as the author, share Macmillan as a publisher and the reader is treated to some behind-the-scenes looks at the writer’s world and interactions.

In many ways, Callan Wink explores the duality that cuts like a river across August’s life over a decade-long period. He’s caught between his mother and his father—who are now divorced—and between the dairy farm of Michigan and the wide-open spaces of Montana. He is forced to decide between his intellect (following the herd to college) and his brawn (becoming a hired hand for a young man named Ancient) and between crafting his own life or letting him become part of the stampede.The pace of the book is leisurely, like a Montana river, and like that river, just as the reader is leaning back and enjoying the scenery, the pace quickens and the adrenaline surge is on. The cat scene is reprised: sheer horror to animal lovers but a necessary element to demonstrate what farm life is all about. Then there’s a vulnerable girl named June who finds herself in a threatening situation—will August take part or do the right thing? There are dangerous, life-threatening tasks that August must undertake and only some of them are physical. Navigating the realm of the opposite sex is almost as scary as nearly getting his foot cut off. But with all these situations, August learns—in his own self-made college of everyday life.Montana itself is a strong character in this book.

Our Sympathizer is blessed with the curse of sympathizing with conflicting perspectives, often uncovering the preening and pretentiousness of those involved. I read it with awe and couldn’t wait to be a first reader of its sequel.The Committed follows the dual agent, half-French Sympathizer as he arrives in Paris in the early 80s as a refugee, where he becomes a hashish dealer (and capitalist). The focus is on his survival as a Vietnamese outsider in post-war France, trying to understand his shady past and fuzzy future.The writing is still stellar and the observations—that range from capitalism vs. communism, political commitment, cultural assimilation, French colonization, sullied loyalties, and cognizant dissonance—are thought-provoking. But the irony and absurdity is replaced, to a large part, by philosophical musings. While these musings fully display the author’s brilliance in understanding the issues that define the exile of his multi-faceted original character, it does not thoroughly immerse this reader.Right from the first few lines, which echo its predecessor, it becomes obvious that this book shouldbest be read as a follow-up rather than a standalone. Since I read The Sympathizer a few years back, there were times I needed to search my memory about, say, the narrator’s re-education experiences or certain meaningful connections he had (such as Man). I think it could be challenging for a reader who came into this cold, without familiarity with the back story.Read it for the lyricism, the intellect, the brilliance of the prose, the historical insights, the unsparing observations.

As a young man, he is faced with a devastating choice: choosing personal happiness with a man named Luca or serving a so-called “higher purpose”,His adult niece, Maura, has her own conundrum. As a long-time wife and mother – with a son who has emotional issues – her choice is to do what’s considered the right thing and stay in her marriage or cast her fate with a fellow artist who truly makes her happy.And finally, there is Britta – Paul’s widowed sister and Maura’s mother – who was able to experience what eludes the other two: a passionate, healthy love. Yet with her husband’s sudden death, she is forced to struggle with her loss of happiness just as powerfully as the others struggle with that happiness being robbed from them.These are real characters with raw emotions and all three are crafted beautifully by an author who obviously knows and cares about his creations. The descriptions of emotional upheaval and physical desire and visceral struggles are wonderfully achieved.

The two form a kind of bond.We know that Akhtar’s father was, in fact, a famous cardiologist. But did this event happen? Is it true or made up or just enhanced? And, does it really matter?That is the mastery of this auto-fictional novel that often crosses the boundaries to essays and memoir. Anyone who has followed Ayad Akhtar’s career – and I’ve both read his books and seen his plays performed – will automatically pick up many true details. But they will also sense what is left out and what is toyed with. The only thing is, the reader will never know for sure.To say this book is courageous is an understatement. To say that it is lacerating and wrenching and self-revelatory is as well. Ayad Akhtar deles deep into what it means to be an American-born Muslim in today’s ‘Murica – the probing questions of strangers, the white-hot anger and categorizing in the days following 9/11, the clashing emotions of being an American who is not really accepted as one.As the plot threads and weaves across the fortunes and misfortunes of father and son, Akhtar reveals the poison at the heart of the American system: the systemic collapse of the American Dream caused by the distortion of money in our current society—our supreme defining vaue, our sport, and our pastime. He leads us to the seething, about-to-spill-over anger of the rural have-nots (and in doing so, exposes the key reason why Trump won so many of their votes) and the hedonism of the newly and not-so-newly wealthy and the rewards they enjoy.There are up-close-and-personal views of Akhtar’s dalliance with the prestigious lifestyle as he aligns with a Muslim billionaire hedge fund manager and predatory debt reassignment, college-as-customer-experience rather than higher learning, love and death and syphilis and family bonds.

She lives a small and bleak life: no friends, no ambitions, wears the same clothes every day, works in a local chip shop called Salt and Battered and watches her favorite TV series, Dallas. Yet the narrow focus on Majella belies the important events going on around outside her.

This book can be read as a companion piece to her last book, The Friend, which was about a writer grieving the death of a fellow writer. Death looms large in this book as well. The narrator's good friend, who is very estranged from her own daughter, is dying of cancer. A request will be made and honored. And by doing so, the narrator will understand more about herself and her own mortality.For those of us who have lived more years than we have allotted for the future, there are many pithy observations. In between the forward propulsion of the narrator and her friend, there are gems about so many things: the sadness of once being a beautiful woman and now just being old, the falsity of language in describing transformative moments, the incredulity of once knowing someone well and realizing that life has gone on and you really know very little about that person. The book is interspersed with tales: of being roped into visits with a crabby shut-in neighbor to alleviate the worries of her son, a cat's tormented tale of its life before adoption, for example.This narrator, like the one in The Friend who is similarly unmarried and alone, derives meaning from connection - not with a dog (as in the Friend) but with a dying friend. Yet the book is not grim; rather, it fully captures the richness of living in ordinary moments and the humanity that connects us all. Sigrid Nunez, in explaining her title, quotes Simone Weil, who wrote, ""the love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means being able to say to him, ""What are you going through?"" Wryly, she says that the question becomes more powerful in French: ""Que est ton tourment?""

But when she is viciously attacked by a teenager named Izzy as a result of her art early on in the novel, her peace of mind is temporarily shattered.The author wisely doesn’t focus on this pivotal moment as much as he mines the past and present of those who are somehow connected to the incident and the site—from Izzy and her parents to a religious zealot who is in search of her. Scott O’Connor never falls into the trap of turning this novel into an abstract navel-gazing homily about “what does art mean and why is it important”.

For Kieran Elliott, who returns to his hometown, Evelyn Bay, in Tasmania, it means putting one foot after the other. Years ago, he survived a fierce storm that claimed the life of his brother Finn and his business partner Toby.as well as a young girl who went missing. Now a young art student – a photographer – has been found dead. And old memories begin to ripple to the surface.This plot-driven novel focuses on a small-town community and what remains submerged. The cohesiveness of the town relies on people remaining “close-knit”; “once that trust is broken, they’re stuffed.” Perhaps that is why the townspeople have never delved too deeply into what really happened to that missing girl years ago. But now is a whole other story.We meet a number of characters – many introduced in the first several pages. There is Kieran, his partner Mia and their baby Audrey. Kieran’s mother and father, who is succumbing to dementia. His old “mates”, Ash and Sean and Sean’s troubled nephew. The thriller writer G.R. Barlin who is getting fodder for his next best-seller. There’s Olivia, Kieran’s old love interest And of course, Bronte, the art student who dies early on in the book.But more than those characters, there are the Survivors – iron statues facing the sea, a memorial to the crew who died in a shipwreck nearly a century ago. Half-submerged, they are a poignant symbol of the main themes of the book: loss and survival, submergence and clarity, guilt and redemption, weakness and resilience, the past and the present.The Survivors is wonderfully page-turning and atmospheric, and once I dove in, I was in all the way.

What reduced them to the most untrustworthy animals, worse than reptiles?”Giovanna, the alluring narrator of Elena Ferrante’s latest stellar book, strives to find the answer as she becomes ensnared in lying behaviors and the false faces that adults present to the world. At the beginning, she hears her very proper and respected father tell her mother that Giovanna is “getting the face of Vittoria” — the sister he has long been estranged from. That chance comment leads her to want to seek out Vittoria and finally, with her father’s reluctant consent, she does so.Their meeting sets up one of the book’s most seductive contrasts: the sedate, educated parents she lives with whose marriage is mostly a lie, and her uneducated and vulgar aunt, who has befriended the family of her deceased married lover. Trying to be both a dutiful daughter and earn the love of her bawdy aunt leads her into a quandary of doubts.An elegant bracelet – supposedly given to her father by her aunt upon Giovanna’s birth to present to her as she got older – is a symbol of her shifting thoughts. Throughout the novel, the bracelet changes hands—from the vulgar to the refined, from the poor to the rich. Giovanna muses, “And yet for me, the bracelet pressed them into one another and confused them, confusing me.” Put simply: all that glitters is not gold. The accoutrements of elegance does not define a person as deserving or good.Like any good coming-of-age story, Giovanna will waffle, first forming an opinion based on scant facts, then revising the opinion, and ultimately doing 180-degree shifts. Giovanna’s own face changes – both physically and metaphorically – as she goes through the cognitive dissonance of trying to hold two opposing viewpoints of her parents and her aunt, not yet mature enough to realize that viewpoints must have nuances.Elena Ferrante is too good a writer to wrap all of this in a big red bow and present it to the reader.

From hawks and falcons to snow-colored snakes and adorable puppies, the stories leverage animals to tackle the very human tenets of commitment, betrayal, loss, and growth.In the first, Terrible Things Happen To Us, a couple involved in an illicit affair – both married – experience a seismic shift in their relationship when the woman loses her husband. We see the effect of this shift from all perspectives, including innocent participants – the man’s wife and both of their children.“There Might Be Blood” focuses on a woman who is on a temporary break from her unhappy marriage, who must deal with aggressive sea gulls who take over her terrace. She hires a sea gull remover with a hawk to chase them away, but the avian aggression lays bare her own rage and thirst for revenge.In the eponymous story, two couples – one an established gay couple and the other a new heterosexual pairing – experience insights and transformations in their relationship when they share a Greek Island holiday and all co-parent an adorable lost puppy. Other stories deal with a happily married woman who goes on a sojourn to New Mexico to help her bipolar ex-lover, a woman just out of rehab who follows a snake-charmer and joins a circus, and a film director in Rome who happens across an actress who inadvertently was responsible for his older sister’s death years ago.

The fReading the fourth and final novel in Marilynne Robinson’s brilliant and luminous Gilead series reminds me of traveling home to a beloved place. The first time you visit is very special: you can’t even imagine any experience ever surpassing it. But then each time you go back, you see it from another perspective; even though the emotions change, the enduring love does not.Those of us who have had the privilege of reading the other books know Jack, if only peripherally. He is the son of a preacher who is the best friend of John Ames (the main character of Gilead’s) best friend and he is a paradox: the destructive and alienated prodigal son who is sometimes called the professor because of his love of reading and his deep thinking.Jack knows himself all too well. He is a gifted thief, he lies fluently, he is a bad but confirmed drunk, he has no talent for friendship. He struggles with differentiating faith from presumption His goal in life is to limit the harm he does—that’s a theme that comes up frequently—but he is very good at persuading himself that he is not doing harm when, in fact, he is.He is also very drawn to the beautiful and pure teacher-daughter of a powerful and respected family in the Black Methodist Memphis community. Jack is—to put it simply—a white bum. And they are living in St. Louis at a time when miscegenation charges abound and when people are thrown in jail for intermingling. Too often, a situation like this leads to pandering or preaching but Marilynne Robinson is too good a writer. For Della, the match-up seems predestined: “But once in a lifetime, maybe, you look at a stranger and you see a soul, a glorious presence out of place in the world. And if you love God, every choice is made for you.” Jack represents freedom; the ability to break free from the high yoke of expectations from her family. For Jack, Della may represent salvation or at the very least, a pure soul who finally believes in him and offers unconditional love.One oft-repeated line in this novel is, “If the Lord is showing you a little grace in the meantime, He probably won’t mind if you enjoy it.” The theme of Jack is grace and guilt. Is Jack enjoying his moment of grace? Is he truly considering what he actually knows or is a life with Della enhanced by his imaginings? Does he, indeed, analyze the rabid racism all around him or does he blithely expect to just circumvent it? Every attempt by the reader to determine how this will all end will likely be for naught. Ms. Robinson, as always, is enormously nuanced.For those who have read the series, I will add that the novel Jack is situated before the character Jack returns to Gilead twenty years later. So those familiar with Home will possess some awareness of what will later happen to Jack and whether the loyalty that restores both Jack and Della will end up being enough.

If I did not know better, I would believe that Katherine was a real character. The intertwining of the lives of mother and daughter—the nebulous bond, the fascinations, the dependencies and the stories that obfuscate the daughter’s real back history—are somewhat intriguing. As I anticipated, secrets are revealed and Norah gains a greater understanding of her mother and herself.I admired Anne Enright’s craft but found myself plodding through Actress.

Although well-loved by her grandparents, Kirabo feels as if there is two of her and one flies out of her body. Early on her grandfather’s lover, Nsuuta, a local witch, tells her that the reason is because “our original state is in you.”“We were not squeezed inside, we were huge, strong, bold, loud, proud, brave, independent. But it was too much for the world and they got rid of it. However, occasionally that state is reborn in a girl like you. But in all cases, it is suppressed. IN your case the first woman flies out of your body because it does not relate to the way this society is.”The beginning of this saga employs magical realism but as the plot evolves, it becomes a realistic coming of age story—and in many cases, a page-turning one. With an unabashedly feminist overtone, there are instances where feminism is explored across class lines, tribal lines, racial lines, and even colorism lines. All too often, Kirabo is forced to exist in a world that still wishes to silence women or to play them off against each other. This saga has many strong points: a relatable protagonist, a page-turning plot, and a fascinating look at the folklore and daily life of women in a changing Uganda. It is also a tribute to the power of storytelling, particularly of origin stories, which are their own act of resistance. As Nsuuta says, “The minute we fall silent, someone will fill the silence for us.”At times, there is a degree of authorial intrusion that breaks the flow as Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi provides background or leads the reader on how to interpret a certain incident. At other times, the feminism message can be a bit obtrusive. Still, even with these flaws, I found myself eagerly turning pages and very invested—indeed, riveted--in Kirabo’s journey.

It’s a searing look at Zimbabwe life, particularly for a driven woman who is now under-achieving. Written in the second person, which typically “twins” the reader and the narrator, in this book, the second person tense in this book oddly feels more distancing and reproachful—as if the narrator has separated from herself.She muses, “When you were young and in fighting spirit, growing mealie cobs in the family field and selling them to raise money for your school fees, you were not this person that you have become. When and how did it happen?” Some of the reasons are circumstance: a rural family life, a sister who was maimed in the war while she was safe at a private college, a preference towards whites in the career market. Others are internal: her own resentment and simmering rage that spill over to ill effect.This is a novel that doesn't shy away from the hard topics misogynistic violence, a joke of an education system, the egregious manipulation of the working people by largely white opportunists. From time to time, there is a scene that is truly gasp-worthy: for example, Tambu’s inability or unwillingness to react when a hostel-mate is turned on by a mob or her inexcusable violence towards someone in her charge. But for the most part, the pages turn at a glacial pace, punctuated by powerful episodes like these.Ultimately, I was intrigued but not engrossed, much as I wanted to be. There was a lot to admire here, but not enough to make me love this book....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 15, 2020","Aug 20, 2020","Aug 15, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36479936-this-mournable-body

Life is so wicked. So cruel.”In a bewitching and fugue-like fable, an unnamed couple travel to an unnamed snowy northern European city to claim the baby boy they are adopting. The woman is in the end stages of cancer. The man is concerned that they can do this last thing together—bring home their new son for however long she has left.Exhausted, they check in to the Borgarifjaroasyla Grand Imperial Hotel, with a bar that never closes and quaint touches of a former imperial age. In ways that – for me – were reminiscent of Ishiguro’s The Unconsoled, the couple meet a variety of characters who will play a part in their journey: an flamboyant older woman in a Russian bear coat with a thick, lush pelt who takes a shine to them, a faith healer who deplores trickery, a debauched businessman who insists he has met the man before, and a stoic bartender who observes and provides liberations.What kind of journey is this, anyway? Because it is a journey, and adoption is not the only thing at stake. As the book progresses, dreams turn into nightmares and some nightmares become dreams as the man and woman search for enduring truths about themselves and their marriage and what matters. In unsparing and mesmerizing prose that weaves a magic spell, Peter Cameron succeeds in creating a fabulist portrait of the ways we get lost and found....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Aug 12, 2020","Aug 15, 2020","Aug 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50698585-what-happens-at-night

Here, once again, almost the entire novel is set in Emma Donoghue really shines when she sets her novels in constricted areas—take Room, for example. Here, once again, almost the entire novel is set in a tiny room, this time a constricted maternity area where expectant mothers who have had the misfortune of catching the 1918 pandemic flu, are cloistered together, waiting for – in every sense of the word – deliverance.The novel centers on a 30-year-old maternity nurse, Julia Power, whose greatest power is the skills she brings to her job. Exhausted and overwhelmed, even with just a handful of mostly poor patients, her own deliverance comes to her in the form of a young, unpaid, uneducated volunteer named Bridie. A real-life Sinn Fein activist Dr. Lynn is the one humane doctor in a sea of overworked and often under-caring male physicians.The vivid and realistic details of the state of what passed for obstetrics a century ago is not for the faint of heart. Emma Donoghue has obviously done copious research and the stories of the women in the ward run the gamut from premature babies to obstructed labor, breech birth, forceps delivery, the breaking of pelvic bones, and so forth. Long labors and longer lying in periods and breast binding seem quaint in today’s times, as was the high fatality rate of Caesarian births.But even more than the compelling stories, Emma Donoghue’s aim is to shine the spotlight on an Irish Catholic culture that expected women to bear baby after baby – twelve was the goal – despite failing health. If the woman was unwed or impoverished, there was a good chance her baby would get lost in the pipe—Magdalene laundries, orphanages, reformatories prisons. It was as if the stars were aligned against them from the start.In her aftermath, Ms. Donoghue reveals that she had begun writing this book on the 100th anniversary of the last great pandemic. Little did she know that by the time it was ready for publishing, a new pandemic would have reared its ugly head. As a result, some of the wording is prescient: “The human race settles on terms with every plague in the end”, a doctor tells one patient. “Or a stalemate at least.” Living in the midst of another superstitious age with primitive information that passes for fact from a sociopathic “leader”, one wonders how we will reach our rapprochement.

The rhythms and melancholy of Irish banter and the lush beauty and stark isolation of the Irish countryside is always part of his novels.It is, I think, no accident that he ends his new collection of short stories with a tale about the American poet, Ted Roethke, who spent time with his wife off the coast of County Galway. The poet, whose work was also characterized by intense lyricism and love of the natural world, says at the end of the tale written about him, “…brokenheartedness is the note that sustains always and this he can play at will.”There is brokenheartedness in these stories as well as yearning and longing that, in sometimes leads to self-recognition. In the opening story, we get a sense of what’s to come when a young man meets a girl who seems too good to be true and manages to blow it (or at least, it appears that way): “He could handle just about anything, he felt, shy of a happy ending.”We meet a vagrant crouching near a lonely old dog in a Spanish love-starved town and a tiny old man with the smell of the woodlands who rescues a poor knacker childIn one of the more humorous stories, we encounter a man named “Who’s-Dead McCarthy” who is obsessed with death and moves out from reporting on actual occurrences of death to considering in advance the shapes it might yet assume. We come across an old folk singer who narrates a song about a love-possessed herdsman who is cruelly played by the object of his desires. And in “Old Stock” we discover Uncle Aldo, a neer-do-well, whose nephew “inherits” his magic that has “broken the hearts of nuns and blind girls.”Part poet, part gnome, part chronicler of a timeless yet changing Ireland, Kevin Barry never disappoints.

There are, after all, many books that are set on the eve of the Depression and the start of Germany’s Third Reich—so many that it is easy for one more to be derivative.But Florence Adler won me over and I think because it is so achingly real and the acts of sacrifice are so heart-rendering. It is not a spoiler to say that the eponymous title heroine does not last more than 12 pages. Florence is a competitive swimmer with a dream: to swim the English Channel. Inexplicably, she drowns while training, and the rest of the book focuses on how the family tries to keep her death a secret from her older sister Fannie who is confined to the hospital because of a difficult pregnancy.Rachel Beanland weaves in a lot of small details of the mid-1930s that capture the era: a very pregnant mother-to-be sharing a cigarette with her nurse or thinking back to another childbirth where she was tethered to the table and placed into an ether-induced twilight sleep. Fannie’s husband Isaac – of dubious moral fiber – chases the “get rich quick” American dream in the Florida home boom-and-bust following the Great Depression. Anna, the daughter of a woman Florence and Fannie’s father knew back in Hungary, strives to help her parents flee the Nazis and we learn about the despicable red-tape that the Americans were also complicit in allowing. Other characters, such as Fannie’s seven-year-old daughter Gussie, and Stuart, the disenchanted heir to his anti-Semitic father’s grand hotel, leap from the pages as well.This is a gentle book of secret-keeping and lies that obfuscate an important truth: that sometimes, lies are important when the goal is to protect those we love. This debut author has written a page-turner and the fact that the story is actually based on a true family story is remarkable. You can almost smell the Atlantic City salt air and glimpse the mirage of Florence swimming out to sea with confident breast strokes.

And yes, this debut novel requires bravery. It is, after all, about damaged characters (and aren't we all a little damaged?) who hide their hurt or in some cases, wear it on their sleeve. It is about women who allow the men in their lives to fill them with emotional toxins until they figuratively writhe on the floor as collateral damage. It is about bad people who prey on these women and good people who turn the other way or rationalize what they know deep down and won't admit.In short, it's about the challenging world we live in-a world of possibilities that is also laced with misogyny and racism and unfaithfulness and class distinctions and addiction and grotesque rape and what it feels like to finally break through the so-called moral silence.The book takes place in a restaurant called The Hazel in Newfoundland during a Valentine's Day snowstorm. We meet Olive first, who is a quixotic spectator-of-sorts who loiters outside the dining area. Her role is not fleshed out and it will be a while to truly meet her again, but she is the moral compass of the story.There is John, the celebrated and good-looking chef who is bankrolled by his wife Georgia. Iris, the mixed race hostess who has had the misfortune to fall in love with him. Damien, a gay man who is self-destructive and morally challenged. And Calv, who is an enabler for his friend Roger, who is just a bad guy. These characters overlap as the storm swirls outside-and inside, in their own lives.Certainly this is not a book for those who love Pollyanna characters and linear plots. Megan Gail Coles is a playwright and it shows - in the dialogue, in the sui generis voice, and in her careful use of settings and ambiance. There is gloriously-crafted language here, punctuated by deep insights into the human psyche. For those of us who don't want to be spoon-fed our plots or characters-and I am one of them-take a deep breath and dive in.

A young American named Sarah Mullins pulls a con job on a famous and aging author whom she befriends by selling her letters in Hong Kong and siphoning off a few hundred thousand dollars. Her plan is to lay low in Bangkok at a glass-fronted complex named the Kingdom, where the wealthier tenants live according to social hierarchy. There she befriends a half-Thai woman named Mali and her glamorous ex-pat friends.Osborne writes, “…here life was in limbo. Things never evolved or progressed. It was a paradise of enforced mental idleness…It was a refuge, a prison, a fantasy, and a luxury living machine all at once.”No one is precisely who they appear to be and evryone is on the take. Lawrence Osbourne is rightfully called the master of atmosphere, and The Kingdom and its outside environs are characters in their own right. The stultifying heat, the frequent and unexpected power outages, the reptilian underlayer of bats, lizards and geckos that roam the complex freely, the civil unrest, the air ripe with decaying mangos and other fruit—all of these contribute to the seductive and menacing ambiance that the author painstakingly creates.The glass façade of the Kingdom belies the lack of transparency of its inhabitants, for whom Sarah is no match.

That person, nicknamed Pew, is cautiously embraced by the townspeople who are programmed by their beliefs to do the right thing. But in a world where we are defined by our bodies and our revelations—who we are, where we came from, how we blend in—what can a town make sense of someone who defies definition?Gradually, Pew’s very silence is a catalyst for various townspeople opening up to him/her. Pew becomes the receptacle for confidences, inner yearnings and secrets. Some project parts of themselves on Pew. Others see a foreboding threat.

So believable were these men that I was sure the book was inspired by real factual events. It is—in a way. But the magic of this novel is that it captures the heart and soul of Ireland—the lyricism, the mythology, the complicated reality—and presents them in a compelling new way.The launching point is the ban on British beef, put in place by the European Union in the mid 1990s, to prevent customers from the burgeoning BSE crisis, better known as mad cow disease. At the heart of the novel is the never-ending clash between folklore and superstition versus profit-driving modern farming. The Butchers represent the old ways: the adherence to preventing the fulfillment of an ancient curse. According to lore, if eight men do not touch each cow in Ireland before its death, the land will be plagued by pestilence. Cuch is one of the butchers, leaving for 1996’s sojourn and leaving behind a loving wife Gra and his daughter Una, who longs to be the first female butcher. In a parallel story, Fionn—a nonbeliever of the world of the Butchers—and his son Davey are driven by other needs and desires. And in the midst of all this is a talented young photographer, Ronan, who is intent on capturing the story.And what a story it is! Early on, we learn that one of the eight Butchers is found hanging upside down, suspended by rusty hooks in his feet, not unlike how the cattle are dispensed with. A message or a ritual? This book encompasses it all: from the sheer brutality of cattle killing to the mystical rites and ancient, unorthodox rituals of the dwindling believers…from families at the cusp of crisis to the connections that sustain us.I was totally riveted from beginning to the end.

The Drive refers to a drive he takes with his loving father to the MHO – Mental Health Organization – who will decide his future.The difficulty I have in writing this  is that I viewed the narrator as narcissistic, childish and unpleasant—and I’m not entirely sure if the author intended him to be. If so, then he succeeded well. But from time to time, I suspected that Yair Assulin wanted us to sympathize with him. A reader can do both, of course, but in this instance, I found it a challenging task.This narrator, right from the start, describes himself as a “picky eater” and appears to have parents who dote on him. Right from the start, we discover that “mommy” is making calls to the commander after he calls home, sobbing and miserable. Then we get this sentence: “Two soldiers told me there’d been a terrorist attack and he’d gone to a meeting called by the brigade commander. I have to honestly admit that I couldn’t have cared…”Wowza! There is a lot of whining how he is “really unhappy here and can’t be here.” But he is not on the frontlines and—when he is asked to do mundane tasks like pick up trash—indicates that this kind of stuff is way beneath him. His insistence on taking sick time to go home translates to other soldiers being forced to give up their own leave. So here’s my problem: at some point, I felt that Yair Assulin had to show his hand. What is this book about? Is it about the way that the army sucks the soul out of those who resist regimentation and the erasure of individuality? Or is it the opposite: a story of a young narcissist who selfishly refuses to go beyond the “I” to embrace the “we” (not unlike young people today who won’t wear masks even though it will save lives)?

But whWhen people are forced to cope with traumatic situations, they sometimes reassure themselves by believing that everything happens for a reason. But what if life is causal? What if something happens and other “somethings” just organically flow from that event?Margot Livesey sets up an early situation where three teenage siblings—Matthew, Zoe, and Duncan—spot a boy in a field on their walk back from school wearing long red socks (actually, trails of blood). They quickly act to alert the police and the boy, Karel, survives. Another writer—a lesser writer—might have used this scenario to either set up a mystery (whodunnit and why) or launch into an exploration of good vs. evil. Margot Livesey has a different goal in mind.She explores the ramifications of this event from the vantage point of each of the three teens. Matthew, the oldest, bonds with Karel’s estranged brother to find the perpetrator and also with the detective on the case; his focus is on the very nature of evil. Zoe, going on 16, becomes involved with an older philosophy graduate student with whom she discusses “big ideas” and discovers first love. The most interesting character, Duncan, who was adopted very early on and looks different than the others, becomes fascinated with finding his “first mother”. As their individual quests move on, their new dog, Lily, is a wise barometer of the emotional temperature of her new home.Those who like their stories tied up in a big red bow won’t find that here. There is no real resolution—not the type that readers expect, at any rate—although there is certainly growth. This book is more about a journey, not a destination. Margot Livesey expects her readers to intuit and fill in the blanks of what might be going through her characters’ minds rather than connect the dots and impose her own interpretation.As a reader, I admit to wanting to know more about the troubled victim and his inner workings, although I accept that often in life, we simply don’t get the answers we seek. I also wondered if the last chapter, which serves as an epilogue, was really necessary. But all in all, The Boy in The Field delivers what I expect from Margot Livesey, whose work I have often loved—a deceptively simple yet profound look at human failings and growth.

Because this surely is a slice of America – the early 1900s where hobos, union agitators (Wobblys), tycoons, a red-haired vaudeville star, a shady police chief and on-the-make detectives comingle on the pages. Some are real – such as 19-year-old Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, an impassioned union organizer at a time when women were widely seen as nothing more but homemakers and baby-makers – and some are fictional, such as Dal Dalveaux and Early Reston, two Pinkerton detectives with fluid allegiances.Yet at the focus of the novel are two orphaned brothers, 16 year old Rye and his 23 year old brother Gig, and it is through their eyes that we are privy to the action. This forward-moving tale is punctuated by intervals in which first-person characters recite their own stories or takes of what is going on. Without spoilers, readers need to pay particular attention to these intervals; what Walter does with them becomes increasingly evident and astonishing.In addition to resurrecting a fascinating time of history, Jess Walter reveals social injustices that are timely today. It is no accident that both brothers are fans of Leo Tolstoy, who grew to believe that life is too complex and disordered and inherently unfair to ever conform to rules. As Rye evolves to recognize that whatever the little people do, there is a roomful of wealthy old men where everything is decided—and worse, that on some level, he wants to belong to that group—the story really takes on a new gravitas. “Beliefs and convictions, lives and livelihoods, right and wrong—these had no place in that room, the scurrying of ants at the feet of a few rich men.” This dichotomy never seems to be resolved.This is just a darn good book, with universal themes of brotherhood and love, rich and poor, loyal and self-serving, dreams and realities and more. It straddles the genres of swashbuckling adventure, social justice, and historical fiction. In other words, it’s a winner....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,Jul 2020,"Jul 05, 2020","Jul 01, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50358038-the-cold-millions

Thirty years or so ago, I marveled at his breakout book Endless Love, aScott Spencer knows a thing or two about thwarted love and frustrated longing. Thirty years or so ago, I marveled at his breakout book Endless Love, a ferociously sexual book about the obsessional love a teenage boy had for a girl named Jade and her family.That unrequited and dangerous love is again mined in the author’s latest book, but this time, the characters are Kip Woods, who works at a high-end boutique investment firm, and his long-term obsession, Thaddeus Kaufman, a married screenwriter whose is on a downward financial trajectory.Thaddeus is a charmer and a manipulator, who lives with his wife and two kids in an estate called Orkney that he can ill afford. Kip is a closeted gay man who has long lived under “the intricate nature of barricades and blind alleys” with which he had for virtually his entire life hidden his nature. Long ago, Thaddeus’ uncle—also gay—predicts to Kip that his nephew will destroy him. As readers, we know from the first few pages that Kip is waiting to be sentenced for—something. We know the dark trajectory this story will take but we don’t know the plot twists and details.As we pay witness to Thaddeus’ incessant and sometimes cloying need for favor from his far more successful friend—who keeps his ardor for Thaddeus hidden—questions arise about the very nature of love and obsession. Does the yearning become its own reward—more satisfying than anything that could ever be achieved by moving on? Is each person allocated just one other who loves us without question, without reason, and without recourse—and what happens when that person does not reciprocate? Is the price of freedom from that kind of painful longing worth the ensuing feeling of emptiness?Set against a backdrop of societal inequalities and money-worship gone amok, An Ocean Without A Shore begins rather slow and then gradually builds suspense and tension. Scott Spencer’s writing and insights are beautifully and sensitively rendered. At times, I wondered how the two key characters could be so blinded to each other’s real natures and why Kip would still be so enamored of his cloying friend, but that is part of the story: the pursuance of the love object becomes its own fathomless end.

For readers like me who have read just about everything he’s ever written, the publicaOne fact is beyond dispute: Larry Watson is a born storyteller. For readers like me who have read just about everything he’s ever written, the publication of a new book is a thing of joy.Why? Let me count the ways. His dialogue is pitch-perfect: there is not one inauthentic note or one word out of place. His characters leap off the page. His ability to create and hold tension is just about unsurpassed. And there’s always a plainspoken quality that manages to reveal simple truths without a lot of unnecessary pyrotechnics.In The Lives of Edie Pritchard, he provides one more reason to love his writing: he is that rare male author who can truly get inside the head of a female main character. Edie Pritchard is that character and we meet her at three crucial phases of her life: as Edie Linderman, a 20-something wife of Dean, whose twin brother Roy possesses a deep and unholy attraction to her. We catch up with her 20 years later when she has left that marriage and become Edie Dunn, married to a possessive and jealous husband and the mother of a teenage girl. Again, 20 years after that, we cross her path when she is single and has reclaimed her birth name—Edie Pritchard—and in some ways, is watching history repeat itself.From the start, Edie is defined as a beautiful woman who unwittingly (and sometimes willingly) attracts men like a magnet. But at what price? At one point, she confides, “…it just seems like every time I run into someone who knew me then, I feel like a part of me vanishes….I mean, all of us are someone else in the eyes of others. And for all I know, maybe that other is as true, as real, as the person we believe we are. But the thing is, when you’re back home, you never have a chance to be someone other than who you were then. Even if you never were that person.”So at the end of the day, this book is about understanding and reclaiming who you are without allowing yourself to be shaped or defined by others. But along the way, Larry Watson grips the readers with his storytelling skills that keep us eagerly turning pages.

The stories are set in the “last-chance towns of southwest Louisiana” but most importantly, the best of the stories are set around some quirky and unforgettable characters.The first—So This Is Permanence—deserves to be anthologized. A reluctant 16-year-old girl named Sarah who improvised her maternity wear out of death metal T-shirts, is totally unprepared to handle the bawling baby she resents. Let’s just say she is not about to win any mother of the year contest.In another, An Attachment Theory, a mother and her young daughter Lindsey strike out on their own to buy a trailer home away from extended family. Recognizing that the daughter she loves in the most gut-wrenching way does not offer unconditional love back, she makes a shameful decision that draws them closer.Other winners: the eponymous title story that shows what unbridled privilege can do (and this story may remind you of a certain Supreme Court justice). Camera Obscura spotlights a displaced Louisiana woman whose new husband is ill as she fantalizes about connection with a fellow schoolteacher. The last story, The Bocherie, is a part comic, part tragic, always poignant tale of Cajuns who conspire with a Sudanese family to hide a runaway cow and the ending is gasp-worthy. And the story Haguilory—about a misanthrope man in the aftermath of a hurricane—well, what can I say except it will break cat-lovers hearts.Stephanie Soilieu excels when she dives deep into the human condition.

This book.”Some books just burst out of the mold and are reflections of the writer’s wild imagination (I would put a recently read book, Parakeet, in this bucket). Others are “softer” books that connect the reader with essential truths about themselves and those they know. All The Acorns on the Forest Floor definitely falls into this category.I found myself crying several times while reading it, not because it is sad but because it is so poignant and the character development is so powerful. I KNOW these women I met through the pages. I AM these women.I am the woman who, too late, recognized that pondering something like (having) a child is a luxury of the young. My cousin is the woman who chose to use a donor’s egg and successfully carry a child to term when she reached age 50. My friend is the woman who got pregnant as a teen, had to make the excruciating choice to give up her daughter only to have a Hollywood ending much later in life. A neighbor is the woman who went into premature labor and went through the heartbreak of holding her pound-and-a-half child, knowing that she was certainly going to lose her. And plenty of women I know have dealt with the issues of infertility and in some cases, eventual adoption.There are truths in this book, which is in the format of interlocking stories (one character from one story will pop up in another character’s story). Most of the characters we meet are mothers or wannabe mothers or mothers who gave up or lost babies or mothers who became mothers in untraditional ways. Some are stories that focus on connections to those we love—a husband, a mother. Not one of the stories is anything less than gripping and well-written.The title, by the way, comes from a line that a nurse says to a woman who has decided to go the route of artificial insemination: “Nature is very wasteful.

A man who loses his wife a thousand years ago feels the same grief as someone today. A woman who learns that her child is mistreated experiences the same furor, regardless of location or point in time. A person who is betrayed by someone they trusted, a teen who feels the first pangs of overwhelming love, a man (and usually it is a man) who cravenly misuses his power—all these instances are never confined to a certain spot in time.Indeed, “love does not change, anger never varies. Hope, desperation, fear, longing, desire, lust, anxiety, confusion and joy; you and I endure these emotions just as men and women always have and ever will. We are a small people in an ever-changing universe.”That, in a nutshell, is the ambitious mission John Boyne sets out for himself: to show that fundamental emotions and our reactions to them are part of the human condition. It takes a little while to get into the flow of these tales, which remind me of parables and ring of basic truth. In Scheherazade-type fashion, the tales keep coming, but the location shifts and the names of the characters shift while the story progresses. We, the reader, are privy to the trajectory: “I climb aboard a ghost ship, watch as a spectre appears on the stage of a theatre and hear cries of terror ascend from the base of a well. I listen as prisoner speaks his final words, witness a man being shot for telling the truth and stare through a window as an army of tanks rolls into the street before me.”Woven into these stories are people we know—Attila the Hun, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, William Shakespeare, and others—and they, like all of us, are bit players who (as Shakespeare would say), “strut and fret our last hours on the stage.” Spanning cities and countries around the globe, the bonds that unite us are far more enduring than those that differentiate us.John Boyne, a fantastic storyteller, sometimes oversteps. One constant across time – that women have traditionally been powerless and that gays have long been viewed as an abdomination—is very true but somewhat overplayed. The one story set in the United States seems tacked on rather than organic—much as I totally agree with John Boyd’s sentiments. As in any novel composed of interweaving stories, some are far stronger than others. Still, the sheer audacity of John Boyne’s vision is cause to celebrate. Despite the book’s length – nearly 500 pages – there was no time when I wanted to put it down.

This journey, for those of us who are not steeped in certain German intellectual philosophies may make us begin to feel lost along the way. Never fear, Mr. Kunzru ties it all together in a way that becomes more accessible.The plot focuses on a Brooklyn writer undergoing an early mid-life crisis who accepts a paid-for residency at the fictional Deuter Centre off of Berlin’s Lake Wannsee—not coincidentally, the place where the Nazi Final Solution was cooked up. Deuter himself is an ex-Wehrmacht officer turned industrialist who is committed to whitewashing the Nazi past. To our narrator’s dismay, he discovers that the institute is all about transparency and openness, which runs directly contrary to his own beliefs about privacy. As his mind unravels, the narrator becomes obsessed with Heinrich von Heist, a late eighteenth century German dramatist and lyricist who tended to irrationalism and restlessness and was tormented for a longing for death. That obsession becomes transplanted by binge-watching of a U.S. crime series called “Blue Lives” – filled with violence and brutality and interspersed with occasional philosophical thoughts by Comte de Maistre, a little known rigid medieval mind shocked to find itself in the Age of Reason. The obsession extends to Anton, the creator of the series and his sometimes nihilistic, sometimes Darwinian beliefs.I freely admit that there are several connections as the plot moves forward and there is a good chance that some of them soared over my head. At times, I would have liked to see more coherence. Having said that, I am not sure that an absolute understanding of all of it is completely necessary to appreciate and understand what Kunzru is trying to accomplish.Is normality “a paper screen over something bloody and atavistic that is rising up out of history to meet us?” Or is it the ability to remain at a certain remove from the alt right culture and our dark past the key to keeping oneself sane? The answers will come together forcibly with a nod to our present times. Don’t expect an easy read. But do expect a rewarding one.

I recognize the glittering, hematite eyes, the expression of cunning disapproval.”Wow! Where does an inventive and imaginative author go from here? As it turns out, very far. Our ethnically ambiguous narrator, referred to as The Bride, is about to marry an elementary school principal, predictably titled The Groom (and that’s the only predicable part of this stunning novel). But as the wedding date approaches, her psychological landscape begins to become increasingly fragmented and fantastical. Our Bride, we learn, is defined by traumatizing events and invisible injuries. And as she bravely forges forward in her quest for understanding and resolution, we meet some of the most quixotic characters and creatures that have graced the pages of a novel. And that includes parakeet-costumed performers who recreate the Bride’s life and s suited-up blogging reptile at a diner at the end of the world.If all this sounds far out and inaccessible: it is not.

The themes are universal: confronting the demons that plague us, recognizing that our human identity is fluid and simultaneously holds may parts of us, and recognizing that like Humpty Dumpty, we can take a great fall and be glued back together again.Ultimately, the question asked is: how do you join yourself to another when you can’t even join together the disparate parts of yourself?

When Graham suddenly dies—and we know this from the book jacket and blurbs—Annie and her good friend (Graham’s first wife Frieda) and their two adult children (Frieda’s son is Lucas and Annie’s is Sarah) need to navigate that painful road to self-understanding and, for some more than others, forgiveness.Part of doing so means embracing what marriage and monogamy really mean. “Is it the wounds inflicted, back and forth, the inevitable disappointments, the unbridgeable distances?” Or is it a more consoling and transcendental concept that a person can be secure in knowing that their spouse chose them and only them…on their wedding day and every single day thereafter? Do monogamy and trust go hand-in-hand? Is it possible to truly love and NOT be monogamous?The shape of each character emerges and Sue Miller displays a spot-on ability to mine the emotions and the desires of each one. We—the readers—feel as if we know them and understand their insecurities, their wants and needs, their misguided choices, and the yearning for love and connection that makes their lives matter. Most importantly, we want each of them to be happy or at least, somewhat fulfilled.The author’s enormous sensitivity to her characters made her choice of dwelling on their physical appearance a little disconcerting. Frieda, for example, is repeatedly referred to as homely and/or plain. The descriptor was fine for the first time or two, but the repetition was unnecessary. After the focus shifts from Graham, the narrative slows down a bit (one character, a pianist and old friend of Annie’s, may not be entirely needed).These are quibbles. Let it be said that I deliciously turned pages, immersed in this psychologically astute book and the world Sue Miller so painstakingly created.

I rIn this broken, topsy-turvey world it’s no wonder that authors gravitate to the loss of innocence as a theme – particularly children turned feral. I recently finished The Luminous Republic and that book was still very much in my mind as I read A Children’s Bible.In almost disconcertingly spare and emotionless prose (another commonality with The Luminous Republic), Lydia Millet paints a world where adults and children are distinctly at odds. The parents, close college friends, decide to go on an “offendingly long reunion” with their offspring. The children—held in an “analog prison” without access to their devices and screens— bear witness to their alcohol-soaked ennui about things that matter. Relegated to the attic, the children eventually hit upon a leisure pursuit: hiding their parentage until someone guesses what child goes with what parent.At the center of the story is Eve (no irony in THAT name¡) who watches the world fall apart, with a Noah’s Ark flood, and a future that hints strongly of climate change, extinction, government inaction, and the inevitable “people with guns.” She assumes the that her parents did not—preparing her beloved younger brother for the consequences of a world that is imploding.In one of the master strokes of this novel, that brother, Jack, relies on a children’s bible to gain understanding, but only after providing a carefully thought-out interpretation. “…if God stands for nature, then Jesus stands for science. That’s why they call Jesus God’s son. It doesn’t mean actual son. God doesn’t have sperm.” Later he says, “Science comes from nature. It’s kind of a branch of it. Like Jesus is a branch of God. And if we believe science is true, then we can act. And we’ll be saved.” For Jack, the earth, the climate, and the animals are Heaven’s part of the code.No argument there from this reader. The way that Lydia Millet approaches the generational divide and the faith divide as apocalyptic chaos begins to gather steam is inventive and imaginative – just what I’ve come to expect from this very talented author. I personally found the comedic and fable-like tone to be distracting and I admired more than loved this book.

But we do know this: he had three children, including a son named Hamnet, who died when he was only eleven. Four years later, Hamnet's father wrote Hamlet (The names Hamnet and Hamlet were entirely interchangeable in Stratford records). It has long been considered one of Shakespeare's most glorious masterpieces.Maggie O'Farrell brilliantly mines these sketchy facts to write a brilliantly-conceived novel of a lusty marriage between two individuals marked by abusive backgrounds (Will and Agnes - the name Ann Hathaway was referred to in her father's will) whose bond is stretched to the limit by unthinkable grief. The book is definitely fiction constructed upon wisps of information; only the bare bones of the story are truth-based.In an eerie coincidence, the book is tethered to another terrifying time when bubonic plague decimated families and communities. Although the cause of Hamnet's death is unknown, in an act of sheer genius, Ms. O'Farrell imagines a flea that boards a ship in Alexandria and the journey of it and its descendants to the Shakespeare home. With interweaving threads, the novel visualizes the shelter that Will and Agnes find in each other after childhoods of unrelenting emotional and even physical abuse. It traces the transformation of a glovemaker's son to a celebrated playwright and the growth of a boy to a man. Sections jump forward to Hamnet, his twin sister Judith, and the unbreakable bond between them. And then, in wrenching detail, it reveals the toll that the loss of a child takes on an individual and a marriage. Lastly, it resurrects Hamnet through Shakespeare's mind in a play that may just be the catharsis Shakespeare needed to make any sense of a senseless death.I believe that this magnificent book will be top-listed for some of the most prestigious literary prizes this year. It is page-turning, imaginative, and manna for any of us who have long admired the bard.

Perhaps here: while reading Abigail, I barely came up for breath. It is that rare book that totally blots out the real world and substitutes another world that is so genuine and raw and mesmerizing that the twinning of reader and plot soon become complete. I would count it among the five best contemporary books I have ever read – and I have read a lot of books!First, the title: I assumed Abigail was the name of the book’s protagonist. Not so. Gina Vitay, a headstrong young teen who is the spoiled only child of a reticent and honorable General, is the core of the story. As the tides of battle shift against Hungary and the Axis powers in the mid-1940s, Gina is summarily informed that she will be exiled to a grim religious boarding school fortress in the middle of nowhere—and no amount of pleading will make a difference.As Gina adjusts to the authoritarian school, part of the intrigue is witnessing the school and the outside events from the perspective of a 14-year-old. The majority of readers will immediately understand the reasons behind the General’s decision (Gina is sure it is because her father wants to remarry and rid himself of her), and they will also recognize what drives the adults who are in charge of her care and quickly guess who can be most trusted. For Gina, the only one to trust is Abigail, a statue in the outside garden who, for decades, has been the recipient of many heartbroken schoolgirl’s laments and cries for guidance. Abigail actually fixes things for girls in trouble with real, handwritten answers. Obviously, the status is not a supernatural force but what cloistered person has adopted the persona of Abigail? Is it someone who treats Gina and the others with obsequious politeness or someone stern and overbearing? It is a mystery that I solved early on but whether a reader does or not matters little. What really matters is the journey to self-knowledge and to what values are most essential. Gina will inevitably reach a crucial juncture where her childhood and illusions will be shattered forever she will don the heavy cloak of premature adulthood and that scene will remain among the most memorable I have read. And she will recognize some universal truths: “…how much more special something was if you had had to struggle to achieve it, and how much stronger you were if you faced life as a group, like mountaineers whose very lives depended on an invisible rope linking them together…”The quality of the writing throughout the book is powerful and propulsive, never calling attention to itself, but through its careful choice of wording, providing a luminous look at a point in time…and in character. It takes an excellent translator to help make this happen and Len Rix was certainly up to the task. I never once felt I was reading a translation.

The integration of the biblical Esther of ancient Persia story with the stories of Vee—a senator’s wife in Watergate Washington—and Lily, a modern-day woman with a somewhat retro lifestyle is imaginatively and cleverly achieved.It helps to know the Purim story: Esther is a beautiful Jewess who has been chosen to marry the King of Persia after his first life, Vashti, is banished, and eventually saves her people from an horrific fate. Reduced to its elements, it’s about a pure and beautiful queen and a malleable king and his evil advisor Haman. Mysterious Vashti is delegated to the sidelines and serves more of a metaphorical function.Lily—who has chosen motherhood and homemaking---is preparing her young daughters for a play that will recreate the story of Esther. It takes time for the reader to understand how Vee, who is humiliated by a real sleazebag of a husband, fits in—but fit in she does in an unexpected way. All three women are initially powerless in their choices and gradually accept their own power to craft a life of greater authenticity or meaning.The book is unabashedly feminist writing and that’s where it both succeeds and fails for me. On one hand, it’s intelligently written with a very welcome revisionist take on the story of Esther (which, throughout the book, is the strongest of the three intertwining tales). And certainly, the focus on the parallelisms among women of vastly different time periods makes the solid point that patriarchal norms have long been established and even embraced.But as a woman who was parented by a mother and father who instilled in me that the sky was the limit and who reached adulthood in the shadow of Watergate, the narrow focus on the archetypes of women couldn’t help but chafe. Despite myself, I felt that the women were placeholder metaphors rather than fully fleshed out characters. While I admired the cleverness of Ms. Solomon’s vision and the beauty of her prose, I still yearned for a little more nuance....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"May 10, 2020","May 15, 2020","May 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52078691-the-book-of-v

That list is wide and long and includes Abraham Verghese, Chris Adrian, Vincent Lam and Perri Klass—to name just a few. But this author may be one of the first to delve into magic realism, a thorny genre to navigate, and he crafts a spellbinding tale.His premise: a highly skilled, bitter, older surgeon has been exiled to a rural and ill-equipped Indian clinic (we find out why much later). Into his clinic comes a family – a teacher, his very pregnant wife, and their young son. They have recently been killed and their evident injuries are egregious, and they have one request: if the surgeon repairs their bodies by dawn, an angel has promised them a restoration to life.The surgeon decides to take on the challenge to heal these unnamed beings—whose respiration and blood flow have all ceased—and the story unveils itself from there. While I will not reveal more of the plot, the theme is sin and resurrection. Sin lies, according to one of the characters, in how you look at it and choosing the just path—harming someone to preserve your own life—is a nebulous concept. But resurrection may be a remote possibility, not only for the family who has just been unfairly deprived of life, but also for the surgeon, who finds himself in his own sort of private pain and limbo. While there were times when I would have liked a little more embodiment of the feelings of these characters, I found the writing to be crisp, page-turning, and filled with meditations on what corruption, ethics and living really mean....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 07, 2020","May 10, 2020","May 07, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52905796-night-theater

He has this masterful way of mining emotions and depicting both beauty and despair and giving them voice.In his first, In the Beginning Was the Sea, he captures the destruction of a couple who abandon the high life to take up residence in an undeveloped coastal area. That book was followed by The Storm, which depicts an arrogant father and two resentful sons as a storm ravages the coast. In his latest Difficult Light, Gonzalez eschews the lush but dangerous natural settings and dives directly into a different kind of storm – a storm of the heart.The talented painter and writer David’s eldest son has decided to end his life after experiencing relentless and indescribable pain as the result of an accident. In the opening pages, we read this: “I was awakened at seven by the knot of grief in my belly at the death of my son Jacobo, which we’d scheduled for seven that night.” Jacobo is off stage in this book; we barely see David and Jacobo interacting. Rather this book is a narrative meditation on what gives life meaning: the intense devotion of family (David is blessed with a wonderful marriage to Sara), the searing pain of loss, the beauty of creation, whether it’s through painting or writing. The narrative covers both the time surrounding Jacobo’s death and the present – 19 years later – when David is in its late 70s and beginning to experience macular generation. Consistently, he recognizes that it is only through creation that you touch infinity (David muses, “…I miss the pang – like the pang of love – that you feel when you touch infinity captured an elusive light, a difficult light, with a bit of oil mixed with ground-up metals or stone.”) This is a beautiful book with a universal theme and once again confirms to me that Tomas Gonzalez is a wonderful writer....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Apr 29, 2020","Apr 30, 2020","Apr 29, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51509201-difficult-light

It spans 150 years—five generations of a Japanese family, starting in 2013 and ending in the imagined future of 2035.

Rather, it continues to affect the people involved and future generations.Sometimes spellbinding, other times obtuse, the stories can be uneven in their presentation.

Add to that Henri’s plain and bitter wife Brigette and an exotic and toxic neighbor Suki, and you have all the makings of a potboiler.And that is, perhaps, the problem. Marena Kemp, definitely a talented debut novelist, makes plot choices that, from time to time, left me questioning. It is hard to write this  without spoilers but I am going to try my best. Marguerite, we find out soon enough, has blamed herself mightily for her younger sister’s death as a result of meningitis. But the level of her self-blame suggests an almost masochistic approach to life and a susceptibility to Jerome’s tongue-lashings and emotional abuse. I get it: if Marguerite can minister to Jerome and give him a good death, she can redeem her past. But there were a number of redundancies that slowed down the narrative: the many scenes of a caustic Jerome, the obsequious Suki who is always crossing boundaries – literally and figuratively – the three resentful sons (to me, two of the sons were superfluous in plot development) and the somewhat predictable unfolding of the narrative.While I recognize that the time frame and milieu compelled certain characters – notably, Marguerite and Henri – to live out their lives in predestined ways, I could not quite understand the one solution that would have enabled each of the to reach a more fulfilled conclusion. The theme – when does life not become life but instead, punishment and when does one get to choose a property-lived life is certainly an intriguing one. But despite fine writing, I couldn’t help but feel that the author erred towards melodrama over nuance.

Expect to find the “staying home and baking cookies” fiasco in another context and the old tired trope of Hillary-as-lesbian or Hillary-as-frigid-woman as well as a revisionist “lock her up” tactic.part of the puzzle that Ms. Sittenfeld does not address is: how specific are all the attacks to Hillary herself? Ms. Sittenfeld does recognize that part of the problem is a rigidity in Hillary’s approach. There is a particularly strong scene where Hillary goes off script and speaks authentically and this reader particularly yearned for such an outcome in real life. Expect sex scenes – a lot of them – particularly in the early parts of this book. I found these scenes to be particularly anodyne and almost groan-worthy. Ms. Sittenfeld prefers to skate over the psychodynamics of their attraction and spend more time on the lusty feelings, sometimes resorting to clichés (“there’s a gaping hole within me”, for example). Moreover, there are times when the author seems to have difficulty balancing the fact-fiction equation, remaining true to the facts we know and reporting on Hillary’s rise as opposed to leaning towards a recreation of history.My feeling is that the second half of the book – when Curtis Sittenfeld is firmly in fictional territory – is stronger than the first half, when she is more tethered with facts. It helps to have a feminist perspective and a more favorable view of Hillary. It’s a fast, page-turning read that, despite shortfalls, is worth reading. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Apr 08, 2020","Apr 13, 2020","Apr 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50253429-rodham

When we first meet her, she is getting together a big celebration for her ancient aunt’s 90th birthday as memories flood back from her Montana childhood.The reader is tossed into the middle of the story with a number of characters – her historian mother Jane, her husband Ned, her kids Helen and Sam and various residents of the town including her kids’ babysitter Ariel who is presumed dead when her kayak overturns.

Perhaps that is why I gravitated to it from my TBR shelf. I did a little research before starting the book. Benedict Wells himself was sent to a boarding school; one parent was ill and one self-employed. He adopted his last name – Wells – from John Irving’s The Cider House because its narrator, Homer Wells, “was always at an orphanage” and to dissociate himself from his grandfather who was the head of the Hitler Youth. So obviously, this book is a labor of love for him.No surprise, then, that his protagonist, Jules, comes to an understanding that “I myself am the sole architect of my existence.” This is a tear-jerker: Jules and his older brother Marty and older sister Liz are sent to a boarding school upon the death of both parents in a car crash. All three adapt to their changed circumstances in different ways. For Jules, part of his adaptation is to develop a timeless crush on another 11-year-old named Alva. She becomes the lodestar of his life as he tries to overcome his loneliness, determine what his path in life should be, and focus on “his love affair with memories and path not lived.”The book, always beautifully written, vacillates between narrative tension, including one long scene that had me on the edge of my seat and an unhurried and chronological path where the reader experiences the forward movement of its characters. His sister Liz’s path, for example, became – for me – very predictable and sometimes repetitive. Still, the book has the real power to tap into emotion with its message that love, in some form, is always there and that eventually, if we try hard enough, we become acquainted with the person we were meant to be....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,Apr 2020,"Apr 04, 2020","Apr 01, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35456277-the-end-of-loneliness

If you are similarly in the dark, I urge you to go to YouTube and watch the short video of Marina and her former life partner, Ulay, during a sitting at her exhibition, The Artist is Present. Gaining that perspective will add a depth to your reading that – I believe – is essential.Some background: The Tasmanian author – Heather Rose – was deeply moved by Mariana Abramovic’s 1988 work, The Lovers, in which Martina and Ulay each walked more than a thousand miles from different ends of the Great Wall of China to meet in the middle and end their relationship. Twelve years later, in 2010, Abramovic achieved attention and fame as she sat perfectly still and silent at a table in New York’s MoMA for a total of 736 hours as one by one, attendees waited hours in line to sit opposite her.Martina Abramovic’s work – self-flagellating with knife slashes, facial slaps, passing out by sucking in all the carbon dioxide from her partner Ulay, razor blades, Russian roulette with guns and bullets — can be viewed as the ultimate of performance art by some and by senseless masochism by others. And indeed, the author captures the essence of this performer: “She is full and she is empty because that is the paradox, too She is swimming in sensation, thoughts, memories and awareness like everyone else, but while this happens, she looks into the eyes and harts of strangers and finds a point of calm. It is her métier to dance on the edge of madness, to vault over pain into the solace of disintegration.”But this novel, while inspired by Abramovic, is not ABOUT Abramovic. It is about the convergence of fictional characters who dance on the edge of madness, or at least, dance towards some understanding of life’s meaning. Arky Levin, a main character and a movie soundtrack composer, is banned by legal arrangements from his wife Lydia who is dying from a genetic neurological condition. The love persists on both sides Lydia has concluded that what’s best for Arky is to continue his art with his reluctant concurrence.Others – a pink-haired Chinese doctoral, a beautiful and arresting black art critic, a still mourning art history teacher – are all drawn to the performance as well. Each of them is spinning in time and space and Abramovic’s courage and daring allow them to gingerly find a modicum of redemption. Through an exploration of the power of art, the thin line between art and madness, the interaction of artist with audience, critics, and aficionados, Heather Rose writes a truly sui generis novel that, in places, took my breath away.

Three years after she is lost, her parents call on Naomi, a private investigator and “child finder”, to go out and find their daughter Madison. Naomi has a gift for these kinds of cases because many years ago, she, too, was a lost girl. After growing up in a loving foster home, she is still unable to account for how she got there.There is much to like about this novel. Rene Denfeld aptly shows how young children who suffer trauma and abuse resort to fairy tales to survive (a large part of this book is narrated by “the snow child”, Madison’s alter ego.) Madison’s resilience and her resourcefulness in surviving is beautifully depicted and her abductor’s back story lends credence to why he needs her with him; he is despicable but still not portrayed as a black-and-white monster.There are times when the author becomes too ambitious. A subplot – of a baby who is also missing – seems gratuitous, as if the author was seeking to widen her message and audience. Naomi’s own professional success in her late 20s isn’t nearly mined as much as it could be; her motivation is absolutely crystal-clear but her innate ability to translate that motivation into success seemed a tad bit underplayed. Is she intuitive or just methodical? The book’s answer appears to be the latter. Some of the conclusions are pat (“It is never too late to be found”, for example.)Despite that, the novel is a step above the usual private investigator novels because of its originality and scope. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33385438-the-child-finder

The theme was love and obsession; a sensible and highly intelligent woman named Ester Nilsson falls deeply in love with the artist Hugo Rask. She misinterprets and overblows any interest he shows in her, not able to recognize the signs that “he’s just not into her.” Her obsessive, masochistic love becomes difficult to witness as she falls down the rabbit hole into desperation.Fast forward. In Acts of Infidelity, Ester Nilsson, now a playwright, is several years older and the same situation presents itself. This time, Hugo Rask is replaced by an actor, Olof Sten, who is married. He makes it abundantly clear that he has no intention of leaving his wife but is having difficulty resisting the lure of a woman who totally adores him. Ester, for her part, views each capitulation as proof positive that Olaf truly does want to spend his life with her and is getting closer to asking for a divorce. And so it goes.While reading this, I wondered how I would feel about it if I hadn’t read Lena Andersson’s previous book. But I had and therefore found myself increasingly frustrated with Ester. I had questions: didn’t Ester learn anything in the ensuing years about the destructive nature of unrequited and obsessive love? Why did she choose to imprint on Olaf? There is no compelling reason, no meeting of the minds, that made me believe that Olaf should be the worthy recipient of all Ester’s attention and lust. He could have been anyone.So with that in mind, is this a book about obsession? What is it in Ester’s character that drove her to repeat the dynamics of a painful relationship with Hugo years ago? And, did the author intend for us to empathize with Ester—and how could we, not knowing what psychological forces were driving her to repeat such a disastrous mistake all over again?Lena Andersson writes well. In turns funny, lacerating, poignant, and insightful, her prose kept me reading on. But at the end of the day, I was not quite sure why this book was written.

One by one, three women fall into his honeyed trap: a single mother who is licking her wounds after her husband betrayed her, the immigrant caregiver of Gil's father, and a disillusioned researcher bogged down in marriage and motherhood. None are particularly fluent in the language of healthy love and each has insecurities and secrets that she hides.

Her life is a migration without a destination but eventually it brings her to Greenland. There she connects with a motley crew and a half-mad captain of the ship Saghani and wheedles herself aboard to follow the last journey of a flock of Arctic ferns.Just about all the rest of the avian population – in fact, 80% of the world’s wildlife – has become extinct as a result of human gluttony, greed, and selfishness. The “glorious winged beasts that roamed the sky world” have been violently and indiscriminately slaughtered because of human indifference. But Franny wants to chart their final migration and even though it puts her in danger, she is determined to see her way through.Gradually, we begin to glean some shadows of Franny’s life; for instance, she writes letters to her husband Niall who is far away. But most of all, we feel the pain that has grabbed hold of her and keeps her hostage despite the wandering nature that is in her DNA. The entire story doesn’t come out until the final pages but it doesn’t stop us from aching for her—and for the Arctic terns and indeed, for the senselessness that makes it so hard for us to share our planet.I read this book not long after reading Yoko Ogawa’s The Memory Police and Midge Raymond’s My Last Continent. Although vastly different from those two, the cautionary theme of the enormous loss we will experience if we don’t act responsibly towards the world are a true wake-up call.Migrations doesn’t preach nor does it allow its very important message to overshadow character development and plot.

And who better thAt a time when a tide of meanness is sweeping over the country, we need someone to stand up and remind us what it means to be human. And who better than Julia Alverez to do so?Her first adult novel in 15 years is here and it’s a winner. It will appeal to anyone who has had the fortune to experience the messy, wacky, frustrating, and wonderful joys of sisterhood…anyone who has stood at a painful crossroads trying to piece together the broken pieces of her life…and anyone who has ever been driven to ask herself, “who is the most important one?”The plot is straightforward: a recently retired professor named Antonia, whose husband suddenly dies, is thrust into competing situations. One is the demands of the sisterhood with its own eternal rules (“Never remain dry-eyed when a sister is crying” and “Don’t ever let on you can survive, or would want to, without them.”) The other is closer to home: a mid-teen, undocumented teenager scared and needy on her doorstep. It has the makings of a soap opera but in Julia Alverez’s capable hands, it is far from it. It is an authentic tale of every woman: striving to carve out the space and time to give to others without denying her own needs and importance. The author asks: What do we owe those closest to us? What do we owe a desperate stranger? What do we owe the dead…and most of all what do we owe ourselves?Juxtaposed on these dual plots is the sad realities of today: the hunting down of young immigrants who are just trying to survive and those who have the compassion to help them in their darkest hours. The book shines a spotlight on how challenging life is when we forget that we are all fellow human beings.This book – filled with Julia Alverez’s legendary storytelling – made me care for the characters and feel right along with them.

Yet for boys who don’t have 20 rupees among them to rent a quilt for eight hours and who shiver under unlit streetlights, Mental is their messiah. The theme can be gleaned through this opening: even stories may not save your life and if they do, the stories will not necessarily have happy fairy-tale endings.Deepa Annappara is interested in giving a voice to Indian children, particularly those who disappear for nefarious purposes. Her narrator, Jai, is just nine years old, a plucky would-be detective, dirt-poor but rich in the love of his family. When one by one, children begin disappearing from his basti (all the way at the end of the purple metro line), he and his friends — Pari and Faiz – take it on themselves to investigate who did it.The basti – neighborhood – gets no help from the on-the-take police force, who view the slum-dwellers as a nuisance and who extort them whenever possible. Nor is there sympathy from the hi-fi community of wealthy apartment owners, who see all of them as faceless and dispensable. So Jai and his friends rely on the little they know of detective T.V. shows to do it themselves. One of their class of subjects is soul-stealing djinns, those magical beings who are capable of evil.The novel builds power; at the beginning, it reads like a YA novel that I would title, “The Amazing Detectiving Adventure of Jai and his Friends.” But labeling it as YA would be deceptive. Jai lives within his imagination, his belief in his own power to impact his world, and his feelings of invincibility that only come from a child who is fortunate enough to have loving parents. Gradually – and then suddenly – Jai is faced with reality and the reader senses that change will be enduring for him.From time to time, the message that Ms. Annappara advances is not subtle and at other times, Jai seems older than his years. Still, these are minor quibbles. This is an original and finely-crafted tale of the power – and limits – of stories.

And I found myself asking: is this a clever twist? Or is it a deus ex machina moment when the talented author has taken control of the story after withholding something important from his readers? Each reader will determine that answer for herself, but for me, the answer was the latter. I felt that something I needed to know had not been forthcoming by the author's choice and that one of the characters I had come to know did not act in the way I expected that I felt was organic after becoming invested in that person's development.Now after getting that out in the open in what I hope is spoiler-free, I will still say that this is a well-plotted novel with realistic characters. There are two stories. The first is Kate's, the widow, whose husband fails to return from a scheduled symposium and whose life, it turns out, isn't what she thought it was. The other is Abby's, the wife: a woman who lives with her husband on a nearby island and who begins to suspect that he, too, has been harboring dark secrets. What, if any, connection do these two men have? Will these stories end up merging? Do any of us really know the person we think we are the closest to?By all means, read it and see how you react - once you begin, you will certainly want to finish.

But once I did, I was all in; in fact, I think this book is a masterwork and a solid contender for one of my best of year.And why? Because it has every element of what makes a book worth reading: an astonishingly informed grasp of the complex political and cultural life of Iran, a deep psychological insight into what transforms our idealism into something more sinister and the lies we tell ourselves to justify our changes, highly intelligent characters who think and feel deeply, and an overall arc that explores what it means to exist at arm's length from those things that give life its deepest meaning.Certainly, Dalia Sofer's newest book requires time, concentration and immersion. The anti-hero, Hamid Mozaffarian, is hardly likeable; he has betrayed those closest to him and has worked as an interrogator with the Iranian regime. The author does not take the easy way out by making this a redemption tale; rather, it is a journey of awareness, recognition, and ultimately, resigned acceptance that one is either a creator or destroyer in his lifetime. The nuances of that realization are breathtaking. Every person, the author writes, already harbors in himself his own personal boneyard.The dangers of self-deception are also mined and serve as a cautionary tale for today's fraught times. Hamid is told by someone close to him: ""...a man can make himself believe anything he wants. He may convince himself that he is wielding influence from inside, that in fact he is doing good, or whatever fairy tale he tells himself to fall asleep at night. But as long as he remains in that pothole, he is nothing more than a collaborator.""

A vicious train attack by terrorists has just taken place and right afterwards, she posts an ill-advised comment.With that propulsive opening, A Burning ignites a firestorm that asks searing questions: “Whose future is it? How far are we willing to go to take our place into a better life—be it political status, artistic fame, or simply a way out of crushing poverty? Would we sacrifice others for our own ambitions?”Narrated primarily by a trio of original characters—Jovan, the girl at the crux of the book…Lovely, a hijra (trans) who has acting aspirations and whom Jovan has tutored…and PR Sir, her former gym teacher who will do anything to gain pollical clout with a right-wing party.In telling her story, Megha Majumdar touches upon a smorgasbord of topics that inform many conversations today: the effect of income disparities, the results of nationalism gone awry, the miscarriage of justice, the ethical lapses of the press and the sinister side of social media, and the systemic corruption that feeds all of it.Wry, unsettling, and poignant, A Burning deserves the great advance buzz it is getting.

This is an auAfter reading Amy Bonnaffons’ short story collection – The Wrong Heaven – last year, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on her first novel. This is an author whose imagination knows no barriers, sort of like Karen Russell or Yoko Ogawa, but in her own unique way. My only qualm is how she would handle the hackneyed subject of a woman in love with a ghost. I shouldn’t have wasted a minute in worrying. This book is highly original, inventive, witty, perceptive, and (can’t resist) haunting. I guess you could say I really liked it.Here’s the premise: as a result of an “institutional” error, Thomas Barrett, who has died in a car crash, is sent back to earth for 90 days while his death is being processed. Of course, he must follow certain guidelines such as staying clear of past connections and not engaging in sexual activity. Otherwise, he will incur onerous “regrets.” Thomas does fine until he happens across a librarian named Rachel Starr – and the attraction between the two is other-worldly.Ms. Bonnaffons wisely does not dive too deeply into the “whys and hows” of death (Thomas begins to dissolve into insubstantiality and the two must creatively deal with these mysterious disappearances). The reason is that the book isn’t really about death; it’s about living fully in reality. At one point, Rachel states, “It’s like I can’t tell now who’s the ghost: him or me. I just sort of float through life but I’m totally apart from it, like there’s a glass between me and the world.”In any relationship, the author seems to suggest, are holes that open up – a yawning blackness, an unshareable knowledge – and each of us fears being swallowed up in it. The Regrets demands a certain immersion on the part of the reader, a willingness to suspend belief and enter, feet first, into the imagined world that is created here. Reading The Regrets is certainly time worth spent.

I’ve had the pleasure of reading all four of her books and in my opinion, this is her finest yet. And one of the reasons, I suspect, is that she focuses on how decisions at that time affect the dynamics between two loving sisters, the more flamboyant Rosa and her sister Esther, a new mother.Early on, the sisters attend a protest and throw hard green apples at the police, who are using force against the protestors. The spur-of-the-moment decision results in a police officer and his horse being irrecoverably injured. The sisters are arrested. And Esther has to make the most difficult decision of her life: does she testify against her sister to avoid prison (it was her sister’s prodding that caused the action) or does she commit totally to the cause, even though it means years apart from her baby daughter, whom she is still breastfeeding.Her decision will be a catalyst for the events that occur as the book proceeds. As time unfolds, the question that echoes throughout is, “Was it worth it?” What was the cost of effects their spontaneous actions had on them and their families, and the other persons whose lives had changed that day? How does one balance the cost against what they accomplished? Despite chasms between views, how do families love each other across the gaping hole?As a Boomer myself, who attended University of Michigan a few years after Ellen Meeropol, the book strongly evokes the decisions my generation was faced with. Do you allow an immoral war to continue and doesn’t that rise above family considerations? Or do you choose to make smaller differences and place family and friends above all else? It wasn’t an easy decision yet it was often made with a feeling of righteousness. As the author writes, “It would be wonderful to feel that certain again, about how to make things right in the world.” This book is the real deal. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 31, 2020","Feb 03, 2020","Jan 31, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49230619-her-sister-s-tattoo

Digging a little deeper, you understand something else: that often, the story of your life is easier to fall into than your own life.This is a mature work by a profound author, and more than once I stopped and wondered if I would have appreciated it if I were, say, 20 or 30 or even 40 years of age. The honest answer is, I’m not sure. But at this point, it resonated strongly.The narrative, told in first and in third person, is advanced by four key characters: Lil, who uses epistolary entries to  a long life that began in Massachusetts and ended in North Carolina. Her husband Frank, a retired professor, is similarly examining his life as he determines to revisit the home that figured prominently in his childhood. That home is owned by Shelley, a court reporter and a single mother and her son Harvey, a troubled boy with a repaired cleft palate who is consumed with visions of ghosts and mass murderers.At first, the connection among these four characters is nebulous. But slowly, we begin to realize that they are united by loss and tragedy and a search for meaning. Threaded through this search are intimations of death: past losses (Lil fears that her memory has gone but keeps saying “it’s not that it has gone but simply that I have run out of space.”) Frank is as obsessed with his father’s death in the Rennert, NC 1943 train wreck and as young Harvey is with his coterie of discontent ghosts. And Shelley, too, is harboring a secret that continues to cause her pain.The novel is a finely wrought deconstruction of lives that are lived partially in shadow with occasional artifacts that shine light on each person’s carefully protected psyche.

To the non-magician, the answer might be, “Not much.” But for those who believe in magic, a trick is a sort of swindle that makes the audience wonder how it was done while an illusion convinces them that they have truly but inexplicably experienced the impossible.Graham Swift is interested in exploring the sleight of hand in his slim but compelling new novel. He focuses on a threesome, a magician named Ronnie (stage name: The Great Pablo), his dazzling assistant and love interest Evie (stage name: Eve, the first woman) and Jack Robinson (stage name: Jack Robinson) who is the master of ceremonies. The real names of his characters shift as does the relationship that exists among them. The illusion of who they are on stage also adjusts and eventually leads to a reckoning with consequences.

Any technophobe (or anyone who has rolled his or her eyes at a relative or friend who is techno-intolerant) will chortle with recognition at this self-employed “Tech Hermit” who has authored a book titled, “First, You Plug It In.” In ways, he is not unlike Macon Leary of Accidental Tourist, the quirky author of the eponymous travel guides who slips into a meticulous routine that keeps him at arm’s distance from the outside world.But Micah has other quirks, too. He’s a creature of habit, adhering to a – dare we call it? – OCD type of schedule. He’s a cautious and responsible driver, constantly looking to the Travel Gods for a pat on the back when he stays under the speed limit even though no one is around or signals first even though he’s in the left-turn-only lane. He’s risk-averse to a fault and right now, that quality is threatening to torpedo the best relationship he’s ever been in with a teacher named Cass.In short, Micah is not only like other Anne Tyler characters who struggle with fears, concerns, and disconnections — he is also like us. A lesser writer would use her characters’ quirks to win an easy laugh from her readers, but Anne Tyler is a pro and she loves her characters, warts and all.

Into this location of crumbling palazzos and shaky morality enters antiquarian assistant Nick Blake, a handsome “aw shucks” type of guy and his debt-ridden boyfriend, Clay Guillory. They’ve cooked up a fantastical scheme: to sell the counterfeit silver antiques that Clay has just inherited from his now-deceased much older bohemian boyfriend to a wealthy and unsuspecting American. It all seems foolproof. But as the two begin to discover, separating a billionaire from his money may not be as easy as it appears.The proposed swindle provides the framework for the plot but what keeps the novel fresh is a close look at queer culture from different perspectives – Nick is white and unencumbered, Clay is black and living by a different set of rules. Then there’s Ari (Nick’s former boyfriend and benefactor) and Freddy (the flamboyant man Clay lived with and is suspected of murdering) and Daniella, Clay’s friend who now lives freely and unapologetically as a woman. Love, social class, race and sexuality all play out in Europe’s ultimate playground where tourists far outnumber residents.The intrigue and twists would have been enough to carry the book, but Christopher Bollen is given to stage-directing: his characters sneer and whimper and spit and growl and balk and mutter. The book would have been stronger had Mr. Bollen trusted his readers to intuit his characters’ reactions and state of mind. His encyclopedic knowledge of Venice and the art world – he was himself a Peggy Guggenheim art intern in Venice – can sometimes feel overplayed. Having noted these issues, the book still deserves kudos for its original and atmospheric development.

Ray Is a sparkling new world in which everything is provided – food, protection, shelter, good health, no financial worries – a utopia or a dystopia? Ray Lorgia does a magnificent job in revealing what it is that makes us human.The unnamed narrator has “married up” and their two adult sons are gone, fighting a vaguely-defined war. They share their home with a silent boy who appeared of nowhere and has garnered their great affection. At the book’s opening, the three of them are being evacuated from their home and re-established in “the transparent city.”Everything in this gleaming city is transparent; privacy does not exist. Its residents are granted everything they could ever need: their own transparent homes, a job, all the necessities to stay healthy and content. Everyone is happy and non-stressed. But in this first-person narrative, we are given hints about the man telling the story: he is extremely careful, forthcoming, family-oriented, and cautious—he waits for events to unfold. The incessant and intense happiness is crushing and so is the loss of the emotional life he once had. Without secrets, mysteries, desires and imperfections, life loses its meaning.Rather than an overreliance on sci-fi or adventure elements, this book’s key strength is its restraint. Ray Lorgia and his fantastic translator Carolina De Robertis (an excellent author in her own right and one of the reasons I chose this book), make the entire premise feel organic. Put another way, it is easy to stand in the narrator’s shoes and feel him struggling with his dual desires to recognize and praise the efficiency of the new order while urgently trying to not lose the essence of who he really is.

A loveless marriage. Favoritism and gender inequalities. Postpartum depression. Mental illness. Wacky religious beliefs. Kidnapping. A red-hot court case. How could any writer walk away from a story like this?Ms. Anstruther chose to embrace the story and the result is a fascinating look at Enid Campbell, her paternal grandmother, whose purpose in life was to provide a male heir for the aristocracy. Her first son, Fagus, was born with hydrocephalus and her daughter, Finetta, was pretty much a castaway at a time when males were revered. When she gives birth to Ian, the overwhelmed and mentally unstable mother abandons her children, leaving them to be cared for by her sister Joan (who is gay at a time when reputations are ruined by coming out.) It has the makings of a potboiler and the plot thickens as the story goes on.The book is told from two time points – the mid to late 1920s when all of this was unfolding and 1964, when Enid was in a nursing home. I found myself racing through the 1964 passages, which became somewhat repetitive, and focusing rabidly on the bulk of the novel – the past. Eleanor Anstruther reconstructed the story from letters, court papers, medical report and photographs, and, of course, her father Ian’s perspective. She strives to fairly give voice to the others in her family without demonizing – a good thing. In her quest for fairness, there were times when I wished she had freed herself a little more from the tethers of reality and give her creative muse even more expansion. Still, this is a book that is page-turning and brings readers face-to-face with a privileged world and its inhabitants.

Deacon King Kong is a literary masterpiece and James McBride is my new literary god. Set in the Causeway Housing Projects in south Brooklyn and named for old deacon nicknamed Sportscoat who loved his moonshine (nicknamed King Kong), this book is absolutely spellbinding.Like many of the best books, this one is focused on life, death, and redemption. The story starts simply enough: for no apparent reason, Sportscoat fires point blank at a 19-year-old drug dealer named Deems, who once held amazing promise as a baseball pitcher. By doing so, he tags himself as a walking dead man.McBride’s literary “camera” pans out from that scene, and we meet the many denizens of Cause Houses, from the drug lords and melancholy gangsters to the Black and Latino residents who witnessed the shooting, to the Italians who own the docks to the Irish cop who investigates it to the bumbling hit man. But do not expect stereotypes here. Each of the characters is complex and although they perform bad deeds, they are not bad people.These are characters who recognize and accept each other in all their imperfections. James McBride has a fine ear for urban cadences, which he replicates here, adding in the tones of Christian evangelism. Add in some humorous Dickensian overtones including the ghost of Hettie, Sportscoat’s wife, whom he communicates with regularly. Further add in the urban myths and rumors that fuel many downtrodden urban communities – a missing Christmas fund, a huge painting of a white Jesus who was repainted into a Black man, delicious “white man’s” cheese that arrives regularly and the migration of ants that comes just as regularly.Each character – each story – is unique. But the themes are universal. There is greed and avarice and despair, which leads to alcoholism and drug use. There is also a yearning for connection, an insular protection from outsiders, and a desire to reconcile with one’s better self in some instances.There may be naysayers who wonder why there isn’t more mention of Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights struggles that were playing out in the late 1960s, the time when this book was set. To them I’d say that the beauty of this book is the narrow focus of one housing project and the forgotten and often despairing characters whose world is limited to their own community. This book isn’t written to deliver pontific messages; rather it is written to answer the question, “what does it mean to be human.”It took me two years to get to this book. Don’t make the same mistake.

And wow oh wow, do they get things right.Consider this: Sexual favors in exchange for cleaning the cat vomit is a good and fair trade. (Gotta admit, I’ve tried that one!)

(I guess they DO live in my house.)The book aims for maximum inclusiveness (i.e., there are illustration of same-sex couples and people of color). The rules, after all, apply to all of us. I’m rating this highly because it’s an excellent gift idea – for example, Valentine’s Day or anniversary gift for real couples who have learned the art of laughing at themselves and each other (and who are still mighty glad that they are together).

Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of American and faithfully defend it?”Most answered “yes”; those who answered “no” were referred to as No-No Boys. Their reasons were complex; some had family living in Japan, others didn’t understand why they should give their lives to a country who had stripped them of all rights of citizenship (despite being born in America).And that preamble brings us to this novel, written in J957 by John Okada (the Seattle-born author himself fought for America in the war). At the opening of the book, his No-No Boy, a disgraced Ichiro Yamada, has spent two years in prison at a time when war fever was at a peak pitch. He is universally despised by Americans (including those of Japanese descent) and his family – a half-crazy mother who believes Japan has won the war, a passive father, and a younger brother who despises him – makes him feel like a stranger in a strange land. In one particularly strong passage, Ichiro says “It is not enough to be only half an American and know that it is an empty half. I am not your son and I am not Japanese and I am not American.”Who is Ichiro Yamada then, and where does he belong? That is the question at the crux of this novel. Riddled by shame, seething with anger, coping with mixed feelings about the only country he has known – its horrific treatment of those of Japanese descent combined with its its generosity of heart – Ichiro’s radicalized persona is a stand-in for second-generation Japanese men who were forced to confront this darkness.” Upon meeting one kind man, Ichiro ponders, “What words would transmit the bigness of his feelings to match the bigness of the heart of this American who in the manner of his living, was continually nursing and worrying the infant America into the greatness of its inheritance?”With his secondary characters—Ichiro’s brother, his draft resister pals, and those who took a different path (notably Kenji who is slowly dying of his wounds and Ralph, who reenlisted), John Okada provides a 360-degree look at the men of those times. As a literary book, it can be a bit rough around the edges; it’s not perfect. But it is still compelling and unique and courageous. Ruth Ozeki, herself a wonderful writer, pens a superb foreword that captures the book’s meaning for a whole new generation of writers of Japanese descent.

It’s so beautifully assured, so wrenching, so poignant, so masterfully written. Yet somehow, it is, and it grabbed at my heartstrings and broke my heart at the same time.Set in the 1970s in Odessa, Texas, the book opens with a gut punch: the violence against and rape of 14-year-old Gloria Ramirez and the fault lines that occur in the town as no-gooder Dale Strickland is charged. Elizabeth Wetmore dives deep into the internal lives of her characters: Mary Rose Whitehead, who opens the door to Gloria after the rape and who is one of the lone voices for justice, her reclusive neighbor Corrine Shepard who is having trouble processing the death of her husband, young Debra Ann (think of Scout Finch) who has imaginary friendships and one forbidden friendship that is very real, and others.Ms. Wetmore captures the land and the times perfectly: a hypocritical town where a person dare not utter the Lord’s name in vain (yet can do all sorts of unspeakable things in his name), a time where a woman applying for a teacher’s position must provide the consent of her husband, a justice system where a judge can make good-old-boy asides. But at the novel’s core is the poison of hatred and bigotry that move through students, their parents, churchgoers and neighbors, and men sitting at the bar and in the bleachers. As one of the characters states, one way or the other, this position will eventually kill you but you can do some real damage on your way out the door.Still, the reader cannot help but think that life is on the precipice of change in Odessa, and the characters – particularly Mary Rose, Gloria, and Debra Ann – are powerfully wrought.

Yet tougher still to be a writer enduring a lifetime on the path of truth.”If this be her criteria, then Que Mai succeeds beautifully. All too many Americans have read Vietnamese writers who help them try to gain an understanding of the sad and futile Vietnamese War and our indefensible part in it. This author goes much further, bringing readers close up to the truth of Vietnam: its famine and “land reform”, its divisions between north and south, its class struggles and constant reminders of death.Yet at its core, its story is about family: the Tran family, switching from present to past and focusing on a grandmother and her coming-of-age granddaughter. Borrowing her book title from Psalm 89, the overriding message is that many of our ancient tunes – our human tunes – can easily become lost to us. But the music with which the earth praises its creator is still audible to us if we simply listen for it.The book is a psalm not to the troubled history of Vietnam but to the power of endurance, the resilience of family and love. Embracing some of her family’s own stories, this talented writer (all the more talented when you consider that English is her second language), offers up a family we care about: Grandma Dieu Lan who is forced to make choices no mother must make in order for her family to survive, her six offspring who must find their way back to that place called home, and young Huong, who must understand her grandma’s story and that of her traumatized mother in order to find her own truth.I cared about these characters and I cared about this tormented country. But most of all, I rejoiced at this author’s message: “Somehow I was sure that if people were willing to read each other, and see the light of other cultures, there would be no war on earth.”One personal note: I am well aware that the power of early s – either positive or negative—can often make or break a book, even from amateur ers. With that in mind, I will rarely post a negative advance  on a debut book; rather, I will simply decline to post a . Thankfully, that wasn’t the case with The Mountains Sing. I gratefully acknowledge and thank the author, Nguyen Phan Que Mai and her publisher, Algonquin Books, for the opportunity to be an advance reader.

He sublets his great-aunt’s rent-controlled Stuy Town apartment. In class one day, while his workshopped story is taking a skewering, another student defends him: Billy, a product of rural Illinois. Billy is everything he’s not: a small-town boy without his own financial advantages, amazingly gifted as a writer, charismatic and comfortable in who he is. One thing leads to another and Billy ends up moving into the apartment as a roommate. And that’s where the dynamics get interesting.The narrator and Billy inhabit two different visions of America—one with a clear path because of family income and the other striving to gain a foothold. The narrator—and certainly the reader—know that he has an attraction towards Billy that continues to grow. The attraction goes beyond the physical; the narrator wants to possess him or be him. So we watch what promises to be a train wreck as their differing words collide, as intimacy issues are skirted and dropped and avoided, as resentments and tensions rise. As Billy works to make a name for himself, our nameless narrator becomes more threatened and lost. This is a masterful character study that focuses on disconnection and cultural division in the mid-1990s. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 10, 2019","Dec 12, 2019","Dec 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44453038-apartment

Years later, she is still haunted by pain from a shattering injury, yet the pain is not just physical. It’s emotional as well; she is also haunted by feelings she has retained for Eitan, her first and only true love. Eitan’s specialty is pain; he is a widely sought-after pain doctor in Jerusalem. When, after 30 years, Iris inadvertently reconnects with him while pursuing treatment, Eitan himself becomes the embodiment of her pain. And also of her most cherished desires. He is her second chance—her rescuer from a disconnected husband, her son who is about to get inducted into the Israeli army, and her daughter who is way off track. But is she capable of embracing that chance at the risk of hurting those who depend on her? As Zeruya Shalev mines the connection between love and loss and between an ideal life and a real life, the novel gains power.This is such a good novel—filled with emotional insights about learning to love one’s life for what it is, not long for what it isn’t—that I wanted to gloss over some of its disappointments.

What the evangelists deem to be courage and martyrdom can be easily interpreted as hubris and colonialism. So it’s a credit to Joan Thomas that she is careful about taking a point of view. Her fictional book is based on fact: an evangelistic mission to the rainforest Ecuador to save the souls of a “savage” tribe called the Waorani. It is called Operation Auca and suffice to say that it doesn’t go well.The focus is on the wives of these martyrs—their backgrounds and feelings—which range from “true believers’ who steadfastly believe that they understand exactly what God intends for them to those who are in Ecuador largely because of their love for their husbands. They struggle with grief, doubt, and their own place in God’s universe. And they wrestle conflict with their belief that God always has a plan, wondering why the plan included brutal murder.In ways, the evangelists are as foreign to those who did not grow up with this fiery zeal as the Waorani are to the missionaries. At one point, Ms. Thomas writes, “Culture is a delicate porcelain. You can smash it just like that. Or…your culture is written so deep in hour bones you can never hope to resist it.” The disparity between Christian evangelist culture and the culture of those who value autonomy and insularity is headed for a collision course long before the missionaries arrive. They believe they are doing God’s work, yet the Waorani don’t want to be “owned” – not by God, not by man. The inability to understand the Waorani in any which way – including their linguistics – highlights the tragedy of Operation Auca.The book is beautifully written—often riveting, sometimes wrenching, other times head-shaking. I can understand why it won Canada’s top prize. It’s a must-read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Nov 26, 2019","Dec 03, 2019","Nov 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43218019-five-wives

Certainly, t’s not easy to invite comparisons to the grand passion between Cathy and Heathcliff – probably, one of the first “bad boys” that teenage girls ever encounter.But it would be a mistake, I think, to draw the parallels too closely. While both Wuthering Heights and Heathcliff Redux make much of the insular world the women (Cathy and this unnamed narrator) live in, the gothic overtones of the former book are replaced by the more lean and dispassionate tones of the latter.It's all intriguing: the juxtaposition of an affair between an unhappily married woman (Emma Bovary, anyone?) and a handsome and morally-challenged Cliff (deliberately evoking the moors?), along with snippets from Wuthering Heights and Emily Bronte’s life. But ultimately, the novella’s goals become murky: is Lily Tuck attempting to provide commentary on the classic Bronte novel? What comparisons can be derived from a modern day woman’s attraction to a “bad boy” versus a protected teen (Cathy’s) attraction? It’s fun to read but is strangely unsatisfying.The other very short four stories—a girl carrying home a dead swan, another obsessed with some mysterious emails, for example— appealed only to a degree.

Is there a God and if so, where is he during the worst of times—and if not, how do you make sense of those times? How does the past impact the decisions we make in the present?To say that Samuel is an unlikeable character is putting it mildly. He is a virulent anti-government racist whose views have been defined by tragedies: a mine collapse that claimed the life of his father, domestic violence that killed his mother and crippled his sister, and now eminent domain, which allows the government to seize his house for a “greater good.” Early on, Samuel bombs a Montana district courthouse and now a young girl – the daughter of the preacher’s—life hangs in balance.The focus of the book is on his sister Jo, a complicated young woman who is paralyzed from the waist down but very self-sufficient. She is a talented painter and a horse-rider, and she owes her recovery to Samuel, who tenderly watched over her. She hates her brother’s deed but love her brother, damaged though he is. What complicates the scenario is a growing friendship with Asa Truth, the preacher who is experiencing any parent’s worst nightmare, and her desire to ease his pain. She is not her brother, but has she become her brother’s keeper?In this latest novel, S.M. Hulse revs up her game by delving deeper into some of the themes she set up in her wonderful debut novel, Black River. Those themes include the elusiveness of understanding God’s ways, the exploration of justice and redemption and the complexity of human relationships in a Montana setting.

The The terrorist attack by two Islamist brothers on Charlie Hebo’s Paris office—the consequence of a satirical cartoon—galvanized the world in 2015. The result of the attack, carried out by assault ripples and other deadly weapons, left 12 people dead and injured 11 others—one of whom was the author, Philippe Lancon. His life was brutally interrupted after a year-long hospitalization and numerous surgeries. And the event became a rallying call for freedom of speech.If you are anticipating a book that focuses on ideology or a journey from anger to acceptance, you will not find it here in this book. Philippe Lancon is a journalist and early on, he advocates noticing the “smallest details of what you experience, the tiniest of tiny things, as if you were going to die in the following minute or change planets—the next one being no more hospitable than the one you’ve left.”Written dispassionately and without the anger you’d expect, the author speaks of his perceptions: “A journalist can be wounded or killed while on assignment, but he can’t be a victim. A journalist can be a target.” Casting off the victim label, Lancon recreates his life within the hospital rooms and in the fertile resources of his own mind. The focus is his own healing, resilience, and physical and emotional survival.The meditative and exacting prose of the prose will appeal to analytical readers who will relish the precision of Lancon’s journey and the reflection of an intellectual writer whose life is informed by literary reflection. For those more tethered to emotional experiences, this book will likely be strongly admired, but not necessarily loved.

But Bloomland by John Englehardt breaks through. It opens during final week at Ozarka, a fictional Arkansas university, when a student walks into the library with a modified SK5 assault rifle. The consequence is familiar—many are left dead—but the telling of this story is most assuredly not.Englehardt invites his readers to inhabit the minds of his three key characters—Rose, a student whose life was marked with tragedy when her grandmother/caregiver was killed in a massive tornado...Eddie, a professor who experienced death when his mother was killed in a particularly heinous auto accident…and Eli, the disconnected shooter whose idea of finding meaning is to rob his victims of their own free will.Early on, Englehardt gives a hint about his title and what he wants to accomplish when he writes about the school: “Coming here was supposed to give you ideals to help navigate the seas of adulthood…You imagined it as some bloomland of romance and psychological growth. Instead, it has given you nights alone in a cinderblock dorm room.”All around the university, the hypocritical religious signs stand out: “We stand with you. Prepare for judgement day. Jesus saves.” But these pious signs contrast with messages of hate: “Diversity is another word for white genocide.” And after the shooting: “100% death penalty and encarseration (sic) isn’t enough.” It’s a hypocritical world where proclamations of religion stand in direct opposition to the social dysfunction and disconnection of the real world. Once Eli commits his dark deed, the narrator (who is speaking for Eli) writes, “”You were overlooked, disenfranchised, promised one thing and given another. The only thing that should be discussed is how strong your impulse became to release this pain back into the world.”Now, that may seem as if the author is siding with the victim, but that is not the case. The horrific fallout is also portrayed, using the “you” perspective. Englehardt’s aim is for us to gain an understanding of Eli (and indeed, all his characters), not necessarily to like them or to think their actions are justifiable. He leaves behind questions to ponder: how do we fight the sense of disconnection at a time when professors “go home, pour whiskey into a tallboy, and grade papers until...marginal comments turn into surly acronyms and interrobangs?” How do we give our solitary lives greater meaning? How do we examine the decay of those who are dying on the inside? How do we get over retreating to a sliver of life that we can’t even call our own? This book will make you feel—and think.

And the deaths are both literal and figurative. The old way is dying as the community expands uneasily to include other ethnicities and lifestyles—Chinese, Indian, Italian, Polish, black, gay, and so forth. For most, moving here was an upward journey. But instead of a sense of achievement, many of the residents are faced with disillusionment and that sense that something’s missing. Boundaries are firmly in place—social class boundaries, racial/gender boundaries, and the boundaries that separate childhood from adolescence and adolescence from adulthood.In one of her stories, Carriannne Leung writes, “Every day presented choices to be made, who to love, who to be. Every day was a collective staring down into a deep hole of one’s own making and imagining.” Some cannot navigate that deep hole; those are the suicides. But others forge on, a little wiser, a little sadder, and in the best of cases, a little more hopeful.The characters here really sparkle—June and her best friend Josie who experience different paths to their first kiss; Darren, the son of a Jamaican mother who comes face-to-face with racism; Marilyn, a one-time spinster with a big heart who can’t help herself from stealing; Nav, an Indian boy who is struggling with his gay identity. None of these come off as stereotypes; rather, these are fleshed-out depictions of people who are authentic and aching.I would particularly recommend for those who love the Elizabeth Strout Olive Kitteridge books.

Blood dried and crusted all over me, and my wrapper in shreds.”So begins Girl, the story of our narrator, Maryam, who was abducted and raped by Boko Haram. Edna O’Brien’s goal isn’t to educate us about the ignoble history and deeds of this terrorist group or its effect on Nigerian life. There are other books that serve that purpose. It is her aim to present one girl—who could be any girl who is violated, deprived of her voice and her future, and forced to endure unimaginable physical and mental pain and suffering.What Ms. O’Brien excels at is placing us right into the thick of things, forcing us to enter the dense jungle of trees taking us into their vile embrace, smell the fear and the human waste, see hear the accelerating hearts and the footsteps, and see the horror of hell as conceived by man.And then she does something magical: make us twin with the stunned and traumatized Maryam as she reverts to sheer animalistic survival, trying to see her way to the light. There is a certain mixed-up and frenetic quality to this book as Maryam switches from reality to a dreamlike stance, from past to present. Throughout her ordeal, which includes a harrowing account of a woman stoned alive and a gang rape, we—the readers—are forced to bear witness helplessly.A particular sadness is the continual victimization of Maryam, not only by the jihadists but by the judgments and cruelty in her village, where she is regarded as a Bush Wife. Yet despite all of her travails, Edna O’Brien refuses to allow Maryam to yield to total despair, although she comes dangerously close. The book points to moments of “unalloyed hope and happiness” no matter how spare they might be. The atrocities go on but we still prevail in a world that has lost its moorings. And at the end of the day, that is what Ms. O’Brien is really writing about.

How well you relate to this concept will determine how satisfied you ultimately are with Ottessa Moshfegh’s latest book.Consider this: you are walking through the woods with your dog Charlie and you come across a note that says, “Her name was Magda. Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn’t me. Here is her dead body.” But there IS no body and no evidence that a body ever rested there.Many might think of it as a practical joke. But our first-person narrator, Vesta Gul, becomes increasingly obsessed, first fleshing out characters and spinning a story of what likely happened and then blurring the line between her real and imagined realities. Before long, Vesta Gul is almost entirely immersed in her imagined reality and her need to bring justice to Magda. Her mind free-associates to her deceased and belittling husband, her own dashed dreams, and the gap and confusion between “having a future at all and having the future one wants.”It’s a compelling concept but for this reader, there was something static in its presentation. Insights and perceptions are interrupted by long passages of ancillary back-up description that stalled the forward propulsion. As Vesta Gul’s mind becomes increasingly unreliable – as we try to determine whether the end explanation will be menacing or innocent – I found myself yearning for a more substantial reason to care.

In this propulsive plot-driven narrative, there are many cinematic scenes and I could easily visualize how the story could be transported to the big screen. After all, the premise is compelling: a young woman named Maya is a juror on a sensationalistic trial: a beautiful teenage heiress has been reportedly murdered by her black high school teacher, with whom she may have had an affair. Everyone thinks he indeed is the murderer. Except for Maya. Fast forward and Maya-now a defense attorney-- finds herself accused of a murder herself during a jury reunion years later. Tons of questions arise: what is the true background of her fellow jurors? What really happened? Was the verdict they delivered many years back a fair one?So, we've got an intriguing premise. We've got a red-hot story of racial and class inequalities and potential murder. We're got a plot that reveals a number of surprises. What could be wrong?Just this: the plot truly is better equipped for the screen than a novel. The questions Graham Moore raises are certainly fascinating, but the deep dive into what it really means to be a sequestered juror for months and how it transforms you isn't quite what I hoped it would be. This year, I read Jill Ciment's The Body in Question, also about sequestered jurors, which is far superior in achieving that goal.I felt that some of the plot twists were implausible. Would an accused murderer out on bail (Maya), who is also a lawyer, take such an active role in contacting her fellow jurors? Would some of them speak to her so openly and readily? Did the several twists at the end seem believable and plausible; i.e., would they really happen in real life?

And there’s HER mother, Grace, who “won the lottery” by marrying a wealthy farm owner and who struggles for quite a while with infertility. And that’s just for starters.This harmony of women’s voices—a cross-section of black British women—deals with everything from mother-daughter relationships, incest-of-sorts, power struggles, yearning for love, assimilation with white partners, and far more. As the novel progresses, the women become interrelated and interconnected in unexpected ways. And always, Bernardine Evaristo’s luscious prose – actually, a hybrid between prose and poetry – serves as the foundation for the story.The result is downright exhilarating. In a fair world, Girl, Woman, Other should have been the sole recipient of this year’s Booker Prize. It is, quite simply, why we read.

The answer is “yes” when it’s written by Adeine Dieudonne, a Belgian author who won most of the major French literary prizes. And deservedly so.The novel begins this way: “Our house had four bedrooms. There was mine, my little brother Sam’s room, that of my parents, and the one with the carcasses.” The first-person unnamed narrator and her little brother learn early on that life is not benign nor is it fair or predictable. Early on, they experience a random event where their sense of tranquility is shattered right before their eyes. The narrator quickly learns that they are only two options to a trauma: to shape the narrative moving forward or to simply give up and have the narrative shaped for you.The event toughens her to face the horror at home. Her father is a sadistic abuser, a big game hunter, a powerful predator who takes no prisoners. Her mother, described as an “amoeba”, is so beaten down that she has just given up. At stake is the young brother, who gives signs of incorporating the traits of both his father and his mother and who hasn’t smiled for a long time.Make no mistake, when this author titles her book “Real Life”, this is as real as it gets. Some scenes made me draw back in horror and others were so poignant they brought tears to my eyes. Although the publisher calls it a “sharp and funny coming-of-age tale”, that is hardly an accurate account. There is nothing funny about abuse or its aftermath. The writing evokes that of David Vann, another writer who is able to weave poetry out of brutality. If you are overly sensitive to topics such as this, you may want to give it a pass. But for readers who can cope with the topic of physical and moral domestic violence that is conquered by the resilience and sheer internal strength of a girl determined to change the definition of “real life”, this book is for you. One critical  aptly stated that this book is about “when the innocence of fairy tales meets the terror of a Stephen King thriller” and that is exactly right.

Rather than play by the unstated but understood rules, he allowed his student visa to expire, placing him in no-man’s land. Since leaving the school, he has successfully stayed beneath the radar, working as a housecleaner, getting expensive golden hair highlights to blend in, and keeping clear of the law. That is, until one of his Indian-born clients is murdered and he is pretty sure of who did it.The murderer—her violent lover, nicknamed the Doctor— knows that Danny is on to him but he’s also pretty sure he has Danny in check: after all, he can make one phone call and have Danny deported. Danny is caught in a bind: if he tells the law what he knows about the murderer, he basically tells that law what he knows about himself.In essence, what Mr. Adiga has created in this book is a “one day in the life of a migrant” tale, complete with Danny’s paranoia, moral dilemma, and aborted interactions with the police, and constant stressful cellphone communication with the Doctor. Mr. Adiga very much succeeds in creating the absurd and dehumanizing state in which illegal immigrants are forced to live: unable to engage fully in Australian life, constantly watching their backs, trying to keep as low a profile as possible even when the consequence is letting a murderer go scot-free. As I discovered from his earlier books, particularly White Tiger and Last Man in the Tower, Aravind Adiga is a mesmerizing writer. Certainly the ambiance he creates with its fragmented thoughts and action represent an author who is confident in his craft.

And we know the consequences of this funeral cWe know a few things right from the first page: at the end of the book, there is going to be a funeral. And we know the consequences of this funeral continues to reverberate; this “good neighborhood” is “still maintaining its tenuous peace, a loose balance between old and new, us and them.”So what we have here is an old-fashioned tragedy, and if we’re left with any doubt, the “voice” of the book puts them to rest. Like an ancient Greek chorus, the neighborhood speaks in first person plural; throughout the book, we get perspective from the amorphous “we.” The reader has seen this technique done before – for example, in Brit Bennett’s The Mothers—and when it’s used judiciously, it makes for powerful reading.Therese Anne Fowler uses this technique well. The tragedy-to-be is set into motion when a self-promoting and charismatic HVAC owner named Brad movies into a large newly-constructed house in a North Carolina suburb with his wife, their daughter, and her teenager, Juniper. A beautiful and modest teen, Juniper has been very sheltered and has taken a purity vow to have Brad guard the “precious gift” of her virginity until marriage. Their neighbors, Valerie Alston-Holt, a black professor of ecology and her biracial teenage son Xavier live next door. Xavier is getting ready to embrace a limitless future: he is a gifted classical guitarist with a college scholarship awaiting him and he is handsome, grounded, and sensitive. But then the teens embark on a Romeo-Juliet romance and in a heartbeat, everything changes.There are times when Ms. Fowler over reaches. She tackles not only racial injustice and social class distinctions but also the ecological devastation of overbuilding. As a reader, I felt the potential consequences of Valerie’s passion in seeking justice for the destruction of her majestic oak tree should have been clear to her. She had known slimy people like Brad before and knew what they were capable of when pushed against the wall.Yet despite some moments of “the wizard behind the curtain” – i.e., understanding that the author is standing just off-stage and directing the reader to feel a certain way – the book is still compellingly readable. The unequal administration of justice based on race feels heartbreakingly effective. I felt as if I were watching a train wreck, wanting to look away yet compulsively turning pages.

The answers aren't quickly forthcoming in this elegant and spare book. What we do know is that Sophie and Otto Bentwood, a 40-ish childless couple living in a gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood, have reached a fractious point in their lives. At the opening of the book, Sophie feeds a half-starved alley cat who is pawing at their window and to her shock and dismay, the cat bites her. As infection settles in, one question permeates the novel: will Sophie seek medical help? Has she already contracted rabies? If there's any doubt that symbolism exists, that doubt is allayed by Sophie's utterance: ""God if I am rabid I am equal to what is outside."" The benevolence of the outside is cloaked in something more sinister. Otto has just undergone an unharmonious split with his best friend and law partner, who is not taking the fissure too well. The man, Charlie, seeks her out for some sort of shady closure and she spontaneously makes him the keeper of a potentially explosive secret.Other things happen. A black man (referred to as a Negro in the parlance of the day) begs to use their telephone-but is it just an elaborate scam? Old friends appear and disappear-why is Sophie destroying or compromising these friendships? At one point, Sophie and Otto flee to their country home, only to find it hideously vandalized-but why and by whom? A baby cries across the way as his father shelters his crotch in his hand. There is certainly dread and menace in these pages, as both the outside world and her inner thoughts threaten to derail Sophie. The cat, like Sophie, is eventually caught in a trap, fights for a few vital moments, and then surrenders, going silent. The sinuous and mesmerizing prose creates the scenes, asks the questions, and then leaves the reader to connect whatever dots he or she finds in the rabid world of these characters.

Why am I here? And how shall I live?This is a book that strikes at the very core of identity and it unfolds like a suspense novel. It begins when Dani submits her DNA to Ancestry.com and receives astonishing news: her father may not really be her father and all the history she owned may not be her real history. “What makes a person a person?” she wonders. “What combination of memory, history, imagination, experience, subjectivity, genetic substance, and that ineffable thing called the soul makes us who we are? IS who we are the same as who we believe ourselves to be?”Dani believed herself to be the only child (barring a half-sister from her father’s first marriage) of Irene and Paul Shapiro, observant Jews whose religion was a deep and abiding part of their identity. She is the wife of Michael, the mother of Jacob, as well as a famed novelist and memoirist. But suddenly, nothing is as it seems.She is the conception of her mother and an unknown sperm donor who – as she discovers – looks like her and has mannerisms like her. As she reaches out to this courtly and decent man, who now is close to 80 and has had a long, happy marriage and family, questions arise. Does the sperm donor really have any responsibility to the adult child he never knew existed? What, if anything, does he owe her? And how should she feel, straddling two worlds with a now deceased observant Jewish father she loved and respected and a still-living Catholic father who is kind but never raised her? Dani Shapiro’s struggle to embrace a multi-faceted identity is poignant and powerful, and she courageously does not shirk from the feelings her search engenders.

This narrative of an abusive relationship between a boarding-school teacher and his innocent 15-year-old student is mind-blowing and filled with emotional minefields. It is hard to believe that it is a debut novel.Jacob Strane, at 42, isn’t particularly charismatic or attractive. He is bulky with a stomach that strains against his belt and wears tweed jackets and unfashionable eyeglasses. Vanessa Wye, at 15, is hardly a nymph. She is a size 10 and average in looks. And that’s the first point: abusive relationships can happen to anyone.But Vanessa is particularly susceptible. She is sensitive and introspective, a young poet in the making, who feels abandoned by a lasting altercation with her one good friend at her Maine boarding school. Craving admiration, romanticizing what first love “feels” like, and a vulnerable outlier, she is the perfect prey for the calculating Strane. He showers her with rhetoric about hos special she is and how she is “just like him”, drawing her into his web. By asking her permission each time he touches her, he turns her into a complicit partner – something he does not hesitate to throw back at her: “You’re in charge here, Vanessa. You decide what we do.”Alternating between Vanessa’s schoolgirl years and her years as a young woman who has not fulfilled her potential, Kate Elizabeth Russell’s goal is to display the lasting tendrils of turning a young and clueless girl into an obstacle of sexual desire. The older Vanessa reflects, “I reach out – trying to haunt, to drag him back in time, asking him to tell me again what happened. Make me understand it once and for all. Because I’m still stuck here. I can’t move on.”Indeed she can’t. When, while in college, the class discusses Nabokov’s Pale Fire which includes the lines “Come and be worshipped, come and be caressed,/My dark Vanessa”, Vanessa says: “The novel is a poem and footnotes, and the footnotes tell their own story, but the character writing those footnotes is unreliable so the whole thing is unreliable. It’s a novel that resists meaning and demands that the reader relinquish control…” Perhaps that reflection, above all else, sums up the plight of the victim of early abuse. How can she ever discover true meaning or become a reliable narrator of her own life?

The sadism, abuse and corruption that his idealistic protagonist, Elwood Curtis, and Elwood’s cynical friend Turner, must undergo contrasts with the messages of love and empowerment that Elwood has embodied from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As Elwood slowly realizes that survival and idealism sometimes are counterforces, the reader is saddened and angered that a worthy boy is being sacrificed to the hatred and heinousness that live in others.That message cannot be repeated enough and if I were just rating for the message, Nickel Boys would be an obvious five-star novel. But my ranking is based on more than that.When compared to other talented black writers who are engaging us in compelling conversations on race and the wounds of the past, several leap to mind: Jesmyn Ward, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Mat Johnson, Yaa Gyasi, A. Igoni Barrett—the list goes on and on. Their outrage, steeled by their creative muse, frees their stories and allows them to soar.Colson Whitehead’s book is expertly written in more of a journalistic tone with some predictable leading of the reader. The result: while the reader feels moral outrage, there is not the twinning of reader and character that leads to a form of transcendence. A twist that is added seems more manipulative than organic. Certainly, read the book: it will open your eyes to how the immoral excesses of a racist reform school system shaped the destinies of those who attended and continues to be a blot on our moral consciousness.

It is, in effect, a coming-of-age story, but the person coming-of-age is not a teenager but a woman of 31 who is biding her time waitressing while she figures things out.I believe the author, through one particular moment with her character, signals what she wishes to achieve: “Why would you pull kids out of the story? You want to push them further in, so they can feel everything the author tried so hard to achieve for them.” Indeed, Lily King has the literary chops to do that—making the reader feel for her character.Two subplots vie for attention. The first: who will Casey choose (or will she choose?) as a love interest: an established, handsome, older novelist who is a widower with two adorable young sons or a younger striver who, like Casey, is just trying to figure things out? And, is Casey herself a contender with a debut novel that she’s been nurturing along?As a reader who loves ambiguity, both answers were evident to me early on. Most of Casey’s writing tribulations are seen “off stage” and her abundant talent was relayed to me, but not “felt” by me. The triangle romantic plot and Casey’s choice were predictable.Don’t get me wrong: this is a book that goes down easy, and had me turning pages. For many readers, the plot will absolutely resonate.

Because this book will entice and haunt you.Comparisons will, I’m sure, be made to the case of Natalee Holloway, the pretty American girl who disappeared while vacationing in the Caribbean. Similarly, Alison, a privileged Princeton college student, disappears during her family’s last night at the tony Indigo Bay resort while on a getaway to the island Saint X with her parents and young sister Claire. But Alison is not the focus of this novel. The story mostly belongs to the grown-up Claire, whom we glimpse as an oddball, an obsessive girl who repetitively traces words with her fingers. Now grown up and living under the shadow of what happened to her sister, it is up to her to unravel: was Alison insufferable in a perfectly ordinary way or was something darker at play? Was her behavior typical or troubling? Who exactly WAS she, anyway?A fateful encounter with Clive – one of the two Indigo Bay employees who was questioned and released– in the Midwood section of Brooklyn (a section I grew up in and I can attest to the authenticity of the writing), Claire’s obsessiveness takes a different turn. Relentlessly, she trails him, hoping to gain a clue as to what happened during one of Clive's unguarded moments. The book does a phenomenal job of displaying two lives that were inexorably touched by one person.The book, while primarily narrated by Claire, also tells the story of Clive and his fellow employee Edwin, Alison and Claire’s parents, and Sara, the mother of Clive’s son. Viewing the island from two sides – that of wealthy vacationers and of the have-not islanders—is not a new idea but it is beautifully rendered by Alexis Schaitkin who mines the emotions and inner lives of her characters to great effect. Above all else, the book pays homage to the stories we tell ourselves – the stories we narrate to create meaning when the world doesn’t provide ready answers…the stories we take as truth when the truth, in fact, is often hidden and definitely nuanced.

The Chassidics, we learn, often stop having sex in their 40s and a grandmother (soon to be great-grandmother) who is pregnant? Well, it’s just unseemly. Worse, it can reflect very poorly on the family, particularly when it’s time to arrange a marital match. Conformity is valued above all.Goldie Goldbloom spells out what ostracizing might feel like (using another incident): “When the time came to enroll her chidren for the new school year no places would be available in all of Williamsburg. Anywhere. Yidel’s calligraphy would no longer be most popular…A stone would come through their front window. A beard could be forcibly cut off in the back of a moving van…” The author mixes what most might call small-mindedness with some enviable joys of the ultra-Orthodox. On one hand, books and school learning are frowned upon as a way of turning innocent children’s heads from faith. A woman’s life is totally defined by her family. Just about everything is ritualized. Yet on the other hand, there is a family closeness—children, grandchildren, and in-laws constantly wander in and out of Surie and Yidel’s home to honor the Sabbath or celebrate a holiday and no elderly person is ever left to fend for herself or himself in a nursing home. Rather the elderly are loved and treasured. The community takes care of its own.Goldie Goldbloom is at her best when the focus is on Surie—her inability to let her husband —with whom she has had a loving 40+ year marriage—know of the impending birth, even into the third trimester; her challenges with a medical community that is tone deaf to her world view and her needs; her desire to self-actualize through learning. But in developing her plot line, Goldman becomes a bit too ambitious. A subplot involves her son Lipa, who died of AIDS in San Francisco, alone and rebuffed. Although this plot teaches us more about what it’s like to be “different” in this community, there is not enough back story to make the reader invested in Surie’s pain years after his death. Another plot line about Surie’s counseling work in the Williamburg health clinic similarly educates the reader at some remove.Still, this is a fascinating book, highly readable, with an utterly fresh and unique character struggling with long-held beliefs at the center of it. It is a book well worth reading....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Sep 19, 2019","Sep 22, 2019","Sep 19, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43565375-on-division

Would the world really be Imagine this premise—as articulated by Andrew Krivak—What would it be like if there were only two people left in the world? Would the world really be a place ravaged by war and covered in darkness and destruction, like so many works of fiction now imagine it? Or would nature have reclaimed everything but what the last two carry with them, sole reminders of the past?Andrew Krivak’s spare novel imagines the latter scenario. We don’t know and never learn why all of Earth’s inhabitants disappeared; we only know that an unnamed father and his daughter remain. This is a contemplative novel, where nature owns the plot, and where the two who remain are intricately woven into the tapestry of nature. When the girl finds herself alone, it is a bear, a puma, and an eagle who will tend to her survival.There is a poignancy and a beauty in this fablelike novel that will appeal on two levels; first, to parents whose role is to guide their children forward, which I believe is Mr. Krivak’s intended audience. But also, it delivers powerful messages to those who are looking through the rearview of the mirror at their lives. One of the key themes—that no one or nothing is lost or has disappeared forever and that the universe goes on within and without you—is particularly touching to someone like me, who lost my mother last year. Deceptively simple but hauntingly constructed, The Bear, like most other fables, is partially symbolic: waiting out the long cold winter of one’s soul and emerging again, stronger and ready to survive. In an era when nature is handled so cavalierly by those who should be charged with its stewardship, there is also a sinking feeling of loss along with the inevitability that in the end, nature will be there after we’re gone. Those who prefer action plots would be advised to look elsewhere for their next read. But those who enjoy a cautionary tale that is meditative and lyrical will surely enjoy The Bear.

Narrated by a young teenage girl whose life is turned upside down when she is returned to her birth family by the people she believes to be her parents, this book crackles with intensity and poignancy right from the start.The girl tries to piece the puzzle together about why her parents gave her up, concluding that her mother was fatally ill (after all, before she left, her mother was confined to bed and vomiting). Without any factual information, she adjusts to the large, poor family that are her flesh-and-blood. Her new siblings are rendered beautifully: her younger sister, Adriana, who shares her bed and worships her fiercely; her oldest brother, Vincenzo, a rebel with whom she has an unholy teenager attraction; her youngest brother, Giuseppe, a sweet baby who may not be quite right. Through brief comments from the grown-up narrator, we know she turned out fine, and these comments give the book the feeling of a memoir—so much so that I researched to see if this unnamed narrator was Donatella Di Pietrantorio (it wasn’t).Ann Goldstein (Elena Ferrante’s translator) does a superb job in translating, particularly in the narrator’s use of the word “mother.” The author writes, “At times I lost that confused idea of normality, too, and today I really don’t know what place a mother its. It’s absent from my life the way good health, shelter, certainty can be absent It’s an enduring emptiness, which I know but can’t get past.” Caught between two mothers, the narrator will occasionally refer to “my mother…the mother…the mama”, and this labeling provides breadcrumbs as to what the narrator is feeling towards these two mothers at any given time.The harrowing ending merges these two worlds and finally provides answers, although the answers are unexpected.

Is it worth reading? Does if offer up parallels to the sorry state of what is going on today?The answers are: No. Yes. And sort of.No, it is not as brilliant as Handmaid’s Tale, which will certainly be viewed as a classic in future generations. The Republic of Gilead, predicting an alarming future based on the theocracy of Gilead and the use of “immoral” females to produce babies for upper echelon barren couples was shocking and disturbing when it was first published. The recent Hulu series captures visually the horror that accompanied the creation of Gilead.Yes, it is worth reading. This is, after all, Margaret Atwood, who is genetically incapable of writing a bad book. However, in this book, unlike her former novel, she errs toward the cinematic. I can already envision how many of the action and adventure scenes will play out on the small screen. There is a lot of foreshadowing, and any alert reader will be able to guess who the spy in Gilead is and how the plot will play out in the end. Three story threads are pursued: there are two women who pay witness, a Gilead citizen who is about to be married to the fearful Commander Judd, and a Canadian girl who will loom large as the story progresses. The third narrative, addressed directly to the reader, is from Aunt Lydia, who fills in her background (how did she become Aunt Lydia?) and catches the reader up on what has progressed since we’ve last made her acquaintance. Two of these narratives work: the Gilead witness and Aunt Lydia’s. The third does not. Without providing major spoilers, I will say that it is unlikely for a sheltered 16 year old girl who has undergone tremendous trauma to suddenly be placed in a position where the entire trajectory of history may be riding upon her. There are many reasons for my skepticism, which many astute readers will certainly understand upon reading the book. Now for the “sorta of”. Anyone who has followed politics—here and abroad—will obviously be dismayed how blithely too many people accept the erosion of women’s rights. From the vicious attacks on freedom to choose (and even freedom to have easy access to birth control and family planning) to the demotion of women to second-class citizens, needing to cover their hair and bodies with black robes and ask permission to even leave the house, some male-headed governments have become a disgrace. To view how this scenario plays out in its extreme, The Testaments gives – well, testimony from women who are affected by these heinous man-made laws, couched in religious rhetoric.But, do not expect the book to be an anti-administration book that inserts itself into the current day politics in America. Put another way, the book is not anti-Trump as much as it is “anti” what his administration, and many others, represent.Read it. I suspect you’ll be absorbed as I was. The 400+ pages whiz by. But don’t expect a literary book of Handmaid’s Tale caliber. This is more of a commercial book, designed to pull in both literary and mass readers. The entertainment factor may very well equal the message factor. When you modify your expectations, it’s a worthwhile read. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,33,2,"Sep 14, 2019Sep 10, 2019","Sep 14, 2019Sep 14, 2019","Sep 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42975172-the-testaments

I had a few hours wait in an airport and I had uncharacteristically left my book behind. There in the airport bookstore was a book with a romance-novel cover and blurbs by People and Glamour magazines—not exactly calling out to literary readers. But then I remembered that a friend had told me she couldn’t put it down.I bought it.And wow, am I glad I did. This book kept me turning pages all through my airport wait and on the plane and when I got home. I was captivated. Told from the perspective of a well-read NYC bookstore manager named Joe Goldberg, the “you” in the title is Beck, a sensual young woman who is quite likely a malignant narcissist. Joe falls head over heels in an obsessive way.Soon Beck is at the center of his world. He steals her cell phone, hacks into her social media to read her Tweets and Facebook posts, stalks her physically—without her knowing it. He gets to know the people in her world, including her la-de-da boyfriend-of-sorts, Benji, with his affectations and his drug problems, and Peach Salinger (yep, distantly related to old J.D.), as well as her much-relied-on therapist, Dr. Nicky. All the time, Beck believes he is just another pushover, a besotten man whom she can control to do what she wants. How does this all play out? That’s for the reader to find out. With a lot of allusions to literary and mass appeal books, the novel is, in turns, suspenseful, funny (yes, Joe has an excellent sense of humor), and scary—a true psychological mind-fuck.There are two kinds of 5-star books out there for me.

Their youngest, Bea (referred mockingly by her father as St Beatrice) somehow escaped from this snake pit and lives frugally with her husband Dan, a handsome mixed-race, impoverished man who has dreams of following his artistic muse.

When Bea and Dan decide to take a little time off, and end up visiting Bea’s brother Alex—a recovering drug addict—at a French hotel bought for him by their father, all hell begins to break loose.The snakes are within and outside the hotel: writhing around in the upper attic and outside with the arrival of the Adamsons.

Consider when new mother Rae tells Yvette, another woman in her mom’s group, that every night since she’s gotten home from the hospital, she’s been nursing the devil. Without batting a false eyelash, Yvette responds: “That fucking thing It’s been coming south of Powell?”Or consider Bog Girl: A Romance, when young Cillian becomes romantically linked to a bog girl. When friends of his mother try to soothe her with the “we’ve all been there once”, her answer is priceless: “Cillian is fifteen.

People aren’t who they appear to be. The good guys – even Mickey – are not always as good as they appear to be and the bad guys? Sometimes, it’s hard to tell who they really are. Is a bad guy, for example, a drug addict who appears like clockwork to shoot up with clean needles or is it a cop who provides a false future to a young girl or is it a trusted partner who seems too good to be true? Many of these characters weave in and out of Mickey’s life as she tries to find her sister who may, indeed, have a good reason not to be found.There are some wonderful rifts on class distinctions: Mickey’s birthday party for her young son at McDonald’s with his friends from his older, more upscale neighborhood is wonderfully fleshed out. So is the complicated past and present relationship between the sisters.While the ending is a little too predictable, the book as a whole is a heartbreaking look into “people loving and beloved, one after another, in a line, in a river, no fount and no outlet, a long bright river of departed souls.” There were quite a few twists I didn’t see coming.

Each book of his that I’ve read – The Curfew, Silence Once Begun, A Cure for Suicide, How to Set a Fire and Why – has been inventive, imaginative, and often, transformative. So it is small wonder that I wanted to be an early reader for this, his latest.Certainly these dark and unsettling times have informed this dystopian novel, in which the world is divided into two groups: quads and pats. The pats are the privileged country natives and the quads are the refugees, who are branded and have their dominant thumb removed. Pats must carry gas masks and canisters at all times, to kill the quads if they feel threatened—without fear of retribution.A sense of menace pervades each section of the novel. In the first, two young pats end up with their teacher at a zoo in which all the animals (save one) are dead. The focus then switches to quad festival called Infanta, where an anointed child is given god-like powers to judge those who approach her float with a guilty or an innocent verdict before mayhem ensues.Ball then switches again to a more allegorical setting, in the next section, the divers’ game, a risky place where children struggle to overcome their destiny. Jesse Ball writes, “It’s hard to believe, but the two ponds connect. I’m telling you they connect—under the ground. So we call the tunnel between them the divers’ game.

Only someone who is intimately aware of the nuances of Afghanistan  A Door in the Earth may very well be the book that Amy Waldman was born to write. Only someone who is intimately aware of the nuances of Afghanistan and its misunderstood societal landscape and complicated truths could ever have put together a book like this.Ironically, the impetus for this book is—a book. Parveen Shamsa, an American of Afghan descent, is galvanized to action after reading a bestseller from humanitarian activist Gideon Crane called Mother Afghanistan. Surely the author had Greg Mortenson’s Three Cups of Tea: One Man’s Mission to Promote Peace in mind. Like that book—filled with chicanery and fabrications—Mother Afghanistan is an inspirational memoir about a young mother who died needlessly in childbirth in a poverty-stricken rural village. Although the book results in the building of a hospital, it also serves as a monument to the author and his ego. It takes the misdirected and idealistic college graduate Parveen time to recognize what the reader is able to instinctively parse. The gleaming hospital lacks appropriate personnel and a second generator and is, in effect, a modern building and not a care center. But it does capture America’s imagination and before too long, the U.S. Army shows up and wants to pave a road. Problem is, in an area where no one has cars and where a road could lead to envy from nearby villages, a road is not what’s needed. What the village really needs is he with their aging irrigation systems, or a school bu8iding for their children, who are educated in the mosque.This novel tackles many subjects: the subjugation of women and its tragic consequences, the fantasies of American goodwill, the invention of fairytale-like stories and symbols to justify continual American intervention, the necessity for lies in a place where truth can sometimes lead to death. We, the readers, see life in Afghanistan from varying perspectives that include the village commander and khan, the dai (midwife), the host family, the solitary OB/GYN who can only visit weekly, the U.S. military and of course, Parveen herself.From time to time, I sensed a bit of authorial intrusion—the feeling that the author had stepped in to drum home a point. Normally this would cause me to distract a star but in this case, the book is just so incredibly good and so important that to me, it is a definite 5-star. I closed the last page feeling far more informed about the intricate challenges that lie ahead for this misunderstood part of the world.I also loved Amy Waldman’s previous book, The Submission, so I was delighted to receive an advance copy of this new one from @LittleBrown in exchange for an honest . #ADoorInTheEarth #AmyWaldman...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jul 29, 2019","Aug 06, 2019","Jul 29, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41716928-a-door-in-the-earth

But only a hint. Yoko Ogawa had long proven her chops as a hauntingly imaginative writer, a true original, and The Memory Police only increases my admiration of her.The book takes place on an island. Little by little, things begin to vanish, one by one—""transparent things, fragrant things…fluttery ones, bright ones…wonderful things you can’t possibly imagine.” But things don’t simply vanish. The actual memory of what they meant also disappears, except for in the minds of a few outliers.Meanwhile, the stakes keep rising. Things that strike at the very heart of what makes a person a person begin to go away. Indeed, one’s very soul begins to wither. And as the inhabitants silently adapt to each disappearing, life becomes more and more empty as The Memory Police enforce the latest disappearance by thoroughly erasing anything and anyone related to what has just gone away.Outside, there is decay as well. As calendars disappear, for example, the snow falls endlessly and spring never seems to come. An earthquake occurs. There are hints of an impending tsunami. The unnamed first person narrator wonders if the island itself will cease to be.As in her previous novels — I’ve read The Housekeeper and the Professor, The Diving Pool, and Revenge — Yoko Ogawa plunges her readers into a surreal but all-too-real environment with a calmness and control that belie her subject matter. For me, there were inevitable tendrils to our current times, watching once taken-for-granted foundation such as truth, decency, humility, and humanity vanish as we bovinely adapt.

In the last book I read by her, Sigrid Nunez mines her narrator’s growing affection for a giant Great Dane. In Mitz, which was actually written (and now reissued) a few decade earlier, it is a little marmoset who tugs at the heartstrings.I read this book for three key reasons. The first: the author is Sigrid Nunez who writes with understanding and grace. The second: the aforementioned marmoset happens to belong to Virginia and Leonard Woolf, surely one of the most prolific and ingenious literary couples. And third, I am a self-abashed animal lover, as long as the tale isn’t cloying or manipulative.Life follows art; Virginia Woolf herself penned her book Flush, a biography of her spaniel. (And indeed, two successive spaniels are featured here as well). The sickly little marmoset, a temporary loan from their friends the Rothschilds, ends up taking permanence resident in the Woolf’s abode. There, she pays witness to their writing routines and cozies up to Leonard (jealously claiming him when he is openly affectionate to Virginia). There is a fine scene when she enables the couple to make a getaway in Bonn at the time of Hitler’s ascendance and later when the winds of war threaten London.Much is alluded to and not delved into: Virginia Woolf’s depression (she will eventually become a suicide), the physical ailments of Leonard the tragedy of Virginia’s nephew’s early death, an always, the war in the shadows. But this isn’t meant to be a biography of the Woolfs or an excavation into the causes of internal and external wars. It’s about a biography of a tiny pet monkey. Viewed from that prism, it succeeds quite well.

At this sad juncture in American history where desperate people who are fleeing for their lives are portrayed as a homogeneous brown mass clamoring for benefits they haven’t earned, Jeanine Cummins breathes life and humanity into her characters.At the center of the book is Lydia, an educated and thoughtful woman who owns a bookstore in Acapulco, married to a muckraking journalist. When (in the first few pages), her family is butchered in a massacre by a fear-inspiring Mexican cartel, Lydia and her eight-year-old son, Luca, must flee to “el norte” – or succumb to an unimaginable fate.This author vividly narrates a dangerous path forward where any stranger may, in fact, be an assassin and where every decision might be an instrument of death. Lydia and Luca’s harrowing journey across a lethal freight train nicknamed “La Bestia” and a dangerous border crossing that had my heart in my throat is reason enough to read this book.But the plot itself is not the thrust of Jeanine Cummins’ story. She goes in search of deeper territory: how do we survive the unfathomable? How do we retain any spark of humanity when the world keeps revealing itself as predatory and evil? By no means is the book relentlessly dark; there is a solidarity among the migrants and kind people to give them emotional and spiritual strength. Some of them, Ms. Cummins writes,”share their stories carefully, selectively, finding a faithful ear and then changing their words like prayers Other migrants are like blown-open grenades, telling their anguish compulsively to everyone they meet, dispensing their pain like shrapnel..” As the land to the norte – OUR land – increasingly excludes moral and humanitarian concerns and greedily hoards its resources, avenues are cut off to cartel victims who courageously do what they must to stay alive.

In this novel, Christian KiSherman famously said, “War is hell”, but the real hell is how it dehumanizes us and forces us to be less than who we are. In this novel, Christian Kiefer takes arguably two of the four most hideous parts of America’s past – the Japanese internment and Vietnam (the other two being slavery and the current caging of immigrant children) and weaves a tale of the ghosts that haunt us.Ray Takahashi is a young American of Japanese descent whose family is forced into an internment camp even while he fights for the American forces. He leaves behind a young sweetheart – his forbidden love. Over a generation later, John Frazier, a burnt-out Vietnam Vet and novelist, finds himself inadvertently immersed in Ray’s story – what happened and why – precisely at a time when he is trying to tackle his own ghosts. Adding to the mix are the two matriarchs – Ray’s mother and John’s elderly aunt – who may be the key to closure.The book focuses on themes that unfortunately resonate through the years: privilege and prejudice, the thin line between love and hatred, the small gap between American exceptionalism and imperialism, the reality of life vs. the burning need to pursue phantoms and loose threads. The writing – as in Christian Kiefer’s past book, The Animals – is lush and moving.From time to time, I couldn't help but feel that some of the plot revelations were just a tad too convenient and the resolutions a bit too pat (particularly the ending).

There are seemingly infinite variations but most of us know what it means: surrendering to processes such as falling backwards and hoping to be caught or sharing intimate remembrances in a group and hoping to be accepted.We all understand the meaning of trust exercises. Or do we?In Susan Choi’s brilliant novel, we meet a group of students who are attending a gifted performing arts school, majoring in theatre. Two of the students are the focal point — David and Sarah, who become entranced with each other. Under the tutelage of their unconventional but charismatic acting teacher, their emotions are mined to help perfect their acting abilities. The lens of the story widens to highlight other key characters but it is still Sarah’s story to tell.And then, in Part II, everything changes and Trust Exercise takes on a whole new meaning. Suffice to say that the new trust exercise is between the author and the reader. And it is up to each one of us to determine whether we want to go where this author—Susan Choi—is taking us. It dives right into the meaning of “what is true and what is false” and how much we can trust another person’s narrative.There are many negative s written about this book and I must confess that they affected me enough to have held off reading it.

David Mamet’s play Oleanna—in the year 1992 – focused on a female student who spoils a tenured university professor from attaining tenure. Now, in the era of #MeToo, James Lasbun takes on the topic of possibly false accusation when a famed English television journalist is accused of a rape from 40 years ago.James Lasdun may be a perfect author for this topic. His former book, Give Me Everything You Have, is a true story of how his own career was very nearly ruined after his former protégé becomes obsessed with him and accuses him (among other things) of a shadowy rape.The plot, in a nutshell, is this: an unnamed narrator reports on his friend, Marco, who is about to be accused of a sexual assault in the memoir of a former colleague named Julia, now down on her luck. Marco remembers the encounter as consensual and indeed, has some “proof” that he is remembering correctly. The narrator, who wishes to write about it, is bounced between the two conflicting versions.The title itself comes from a poem by Mallarme, made into a ballet with Nijinsky. A faun, who wakes from a dream, is not certain whether the remembered encounter is, indeed a dream, or whether it’s something that actually happened. There is a push-pull between male desire and innocence.And, to add to the intrigue, all of this takes place at a time when a reality-star beleaguered pussy-grabbing candidate is somehow capturing the imagination of the American public. The shaky questions of, “What is an assault? Is there one real version of the truth? How far do we go to discredit another person?” is all at play here.The reader is, indirectly, asked to weigh in.

Perhaps that is why so many writers gravitate to the theme of sisterhood, including Julia Alvarez, who captures the exasperation, life-sustaining bonds that last a lifetime.Alix Ohlin introduces two sisters – Lark and Robin – who are products of an indifferent Canadian mother and two separate fathers. Lark embodies the key qualities of her namesake: agreeable, conscientious and proactive. Her younger sister Robin is flightier and possesses a strong musical gift—she is a talented pianist.As true dual citizens—their fathers are both U.S. citizens—Lark and Robin find their way to Boston and then to New York City and beyond as they continue to come together and drift apart. Lark gravitates to a documentary film career and for a time, teams with a highly respected yet elusive older filmmaker. Robin takes another route, embracing and then discarding her natural-born talent and making inexplicable lifestyle choices.Yet the tenuous but powerful bond that holds them together means that they show up at each other’s door during the most challenging of times. And during those times, the sisters instinctively know how to give each other what they want and need the most.There is much to enjoy about this deeply felt book, which never failed to keep my interest. At the same time, it has its flaws. Like many other books that focus on the “artiste”, the film-making sections tended to be too detailed and pedantic; Ms. Ohlin is best when she focuses on the characters instead of the process. Similarly, the book, which encompasses only 270 pages, takes on too many years and too many lifestyle evolutions, sometimes reminding me of a “that…and then THAT…and later THAT” format that many sagas fall victim to. I didn’t quite understand one of Lark’s most heartfelt yearnings; it didn’t quite seem organic.

It’s one of those books that I imagine publishers dream about – filled with true-to-life intrigue, touching upon little-known history, and presenting real-life and fictional characters that readers really care about.Like most people, I’ve seen the movie Dr. Zhivago multiple times and it has never failed to captivate me (interestingly, I minored in Russian literature but never read the book). Although I was aware that the CIA has psych-ops units designed to change hearts and minds, I had no idea that this beloved classic was jokingly referred to as a “literary weapon of mass destruction.” Nor was I aware of the back story of its publication.This book alternates between the East and the West. In the East – the Soviet Union – we meet famed author Boris Pasternak, his lover and muse Olga (who was the inspiration for Lara), and his compulsion to write a masterpiece that would capture the truth about the revolution and stand the test of time. In the West, we meet the “girls” of the CIA typing pool, the secret-keepers, and the “swallows” – those who ascend to actual secretive work. The two focal points of this sorority-of-sorts are Irena and her mentor, Sally, who are unconventional and free-spirited yet tied down by the milieu which they must inhabit.Typically, when a novel shifts from one story to the other, one of the two threads fades by comparison. But here, both stories are strong. There are fascinating insights into the CIA machinations of the ‘50s and the way women were treated. And there are also great revelations about Boris Pasternak’s life and his struggle to follow his literary muse even when it is in conflict with what his beloved land deems “correct.” It’s a book I can confidently recommend to just about anyone – those who love NYT “Top Ten” books, literary readers, and readers who veer toward well-researched historical books.

A bitter little man disparagingly nicknamed Schlecty (better known to the world as Hitler) has declared a ban on modernism in the Reich. His former art school mates, denounced as degenerates, have been bankrolled by Leonora Calaway (think: Peggy Guggenheim) and fled to the jungles of Costalegre. And bearing witness is Leonora’s neglected 14-year-old daughter Lara, whose insights and observations drive the story.Temporarily unschooled and unmoored and unloved by her mother, Lara catalogs the indigenous plants, knowing that she and her mother’s entourage of surrealists, Dadaists, and outcasts are all displaced species. When Jack Klinger, a rebel who may be the one artist her mother doesn’t control arrives, an infatuated Lara regards him as a sense of solidness amidst the mayhem.This is a lovely book, filled with longing and yearning, of a girl on the cusp of adulthood who straddles the barriers between privilege and want. All of the themes of coming-of-age are here: loneliness and alienation, desire and want, internal growth and the power of imagination. Most of the characters are inspired by real-life counterparts—Guggenheim and her real-life daughter Pegeen, artists such as Andre Breton, and more.

When reading her previous books – Room, for example, or The Wonder – I did not come up for air. So my first reaction on her latest book was a bit of disappointment. “A retired New York professor’s life is thrown into chaos when he takes a young grand-nephew to France in hopes of uncovering his own mother’s secrets from World War II.” Really? Hadn’t I read the old man/young boy (“child is father to the man”) story many times already – Domenico Starnone’s Ties, to name just one? And World War II – isn’t that inevitably going to mean another book about Nazi collaborators?Well, I needn’t have worried. This is, after all, Emma Donoghue. And even though it’s not quite as ambitious as her previous work, it’s a fascinating, page-turning, turn-the-formula-on-its-head sort of read.Why is it so good? For one thing, Noah, the chemistry professor on the cusp of his 80th birthday and Michael, the 11-year-old boy whose father is dead and whose mother is incarcerated, are about as authentic as it gets. All the jargon…all the innocence combined with “pretend” disinterest and jadedness…all the wheedling and foul mouth bravado…it’s all here in Michael, who can, in turn, be defiant, endearing, and downright exhausting. Noah’s attempts to bridge the communication gap and try to earn a bit of the boy’s respects are also touching. But Emma Donoghue never resorts to manipulative sentimentality or tired tropes. Noah and Michael can step off the pages.Also, a third important character in the book is the French city of Nice. The author spent a few years there with her wife and children and her familiarity with Nice shows. The Carnival, the museums, the food (Michael’s reactions to unfamiliar French food is hilariously real), the back history – all of it adds another dimension to his already intriguing tale.I haven’t said much about the plot because that’s for readers to discover for themselves. Suffice to say that it hinges on some mystifying photos that Noah’s vanished mother took during the war years. His logical powers of deduction clash and eventually merge with Michael’s more imaginative mind as answers begin to reveal themselves. All in all, a very satisfying book. 4.5 stars.

After reading her previous book, Quicksand, I knew I was in the hands of a masterful author who would not rely on a typical Nordic noir formula of bloody murders, pyrotechnic courtroom scenes, or neatly wrapped endings.Instead, Ms. Persoon Giolitto tackles the questions worth exploring: how does a medical researcher, dubbed Professor Death, get a fair shake from a Swedish justice system that pridefully believes its prosecutors are always right and its verdicts are never wrong? Does a defendant who presents as cold, quirky, detached and with a past that would lead a reasonable person to expect guilt still deserve an expectation of innocence? Is nuance possible in a highly sensationalized case like this?The core of the plot is this: Stig Ahlin, a 30-something man who is already under suspicion for child abuse, is the prime suspect in the murder of an almost 16-year-old model student, based on strong circumstantial evidence. When we first meet him, he has been incarcerated for over 13 years but now, lawyer Sophia Weber has been asked to look into what may very well be manipulated evidence. As Sophia pursues this quest, she, too, is labeled, judged and demonized, even as she continues to unearth critical flaws.Like in real life, some answers on Stig Ahlin’s guilt or innocence begin to appear. But other answers remain elusive. At the end of the day, Ms. Persoon Giolito asks us to consider whether there is such a thing as beyond all reasonable doubt in complex situations.

Their mother has left them to their own wiles and in her place, a younger wicked stepmother and her own two daughters have moved in with their father. It is only a matter of time until they are exiled. And although they follow different paths, it is only when they come together that they are complete.I had a little trouble tapping into the male voice of Danny at first (for several pages, I thought the first-person narrator was female), but gradually, I accepted his voice because I was caught up in the narrative. Ann Patchett is a natural-born storyteller and here, like in her last book, Commonwealth, she ambitiously traces a family through a couple of generations.Both books center around an action (the exile in Dutch House, an illicit kiss in Commonwealth), and both deal with “blended families” that in reality do not blend. At the time Commonwealth was published, Ann Patchett called it her “autobiographical first novel” and I suspect that some of Dutch House is mined from those same murky areas of childhood – the complications of extended families, the theft of certain memories of childhood, the borders between realities and how we remember.It’s difficult to  the way I want to without spoilers, so I’ll just say this: I also saw parallels to religious parables. In a sense, the Dutch House is Eden – that wonderful paradise of childhood of which teens and young adults are eventually cast out. There is a central character who sets herself up to be a saint with an aberrant desire to be “of help”, and Ann Patchett nails it when she says that saints are generally despised by those who really know them. And, there is a quest for redemption.Although I have quibbles – the male voice, the somewhat rushed ending (along with certain aspects of that ending), I do think this is one of Ann Patchett’s better books. It’s not quite as good as Bel Canto (which, to my mind, is her best) nor is it as unrealistic as State of Wonder (which many readers enjoyed and I did not).

Approaching his significant 50th birthday, an adult orphan and divorcee, this pellet stove blogger is feeling unmoored and abandoned. That is, until his quirky, previously unknown aunt shows up at the door and manipulates him into a trip to Sweden.Before her arrival, Calvin is content to write industry blogs like this: “My mother was a minister, and she believed that God put us on this earth to console and comfort each other. The pellet stove industry, of course, also believes in consolation and comfort!” The blogs continue to get more earnestly funny and that alone is worth the price of admission.But Brock Clarke also weaves in the Calvinistic doctrine beautifully. John Calvin, of course, believed mightily in predestination and foreshadowing, so it’s no great surprise to the reader that the book is filled with hints of what’s to come. Aunt Beatrice is the antithesis of John Calvin with her own rules for living, which our Calvin interprets as, “Thou shall never travel by car or truck unless they’re stolen. Thou shall lie, but only if thou lies well…” and so on. For me, the book is at its finest when aunt and nephew are together on their absurd journey of discovery. Those scenes and the ensuing dialogue just sparkle.More zany characters are added along the way—Interpol agents, religious fanatics, practiced thieves, ex-wives and husbands, and so on. From time to time it begins to feel over-the-top but it’s all in great fun and the writing is top-notch. Calvin is bound to be lost until he finds himself and that’s the message: life’s too short to not know who we really are. And who we are is who we really want to be.

It’s a insightful and absorbing fable by a wordmagician who throws lots of balls in the air. When he catches all of them neatly in the end, the reader can only say, “Ahhhh…”The book begins with a publishing house consultant who chances on a cleric, Father Cornelius, during a conference in Switzerland. He is then privy to a strange tale: the cleric was sent to a town called Dichtersruhe where virtually every resident harbors literary ambitions. Not long after, a flamboyant Lucerne publisher – who might be the devil himself – arrives with the promise of fame and fortune for the village’s best manuscript. The award – the Goethe prize – is slated to launch one of the village people’s careers. As an overlay, Father Cornelius is spotting a number of rabid foxes, which portends upcoming madness. Are the devil and the foxes in cahoots?This is a spare book and I’m loathe to provide spoilers. But I will address broad themes: how the townspeople falter and turn on each other when a stranger proffers the mirage of success, how the narcissism and vanity that go hand-in-hand with literary competitions turns a peaceful village into a devil’s nest, how the stories we tell can be used for good or evil.Then another layer is added, causing the reader to ask: is Father Cornelius an unreliable narrator?

But the novel’s true journey is straight to the human heart and what survives when people disappear without our full awareness or our permission.Our first-person narrator, Gavin, is a child when he contracts meningitis in school, right before the Challenger space shuttle is set to take off. When he awakes, he finds out that the shuttle has exploded and that his youngest sister Ruby has died, probably because he brought the virus into the house. Her death shatters the already vulnerable landscape of his Taiwanese parents who have relocated to the starkly beautiful but unforgiving state of Alaska.Chia-Chia Lin writes many scenes that are haunting: Gavin and his mother coming across an impossible-to-conceive setting of a beached beluga whale. (“It looked too big to die, too big to vanish during a sudden, silent creak of the world. And what I thought, had they done with Ruby’s body?”) There are flying squirrels that take over the attic and eventually die en masse outdoors. And there’s the younger brother, Natty, who insists that his parents have disappeared, too, and have morphed into other people and the older sister, Pei-Pei, a teenager who, outside the home, is known as Paige.There are many subtle questions here about the American Dream gone awry: a mom foraging for food on the road, the children’s embarrassment and dread of outsiders knowing they have little furniture or food, and even the realization that not all of us can afford police or hospital support in times of extreme need. Nothing is under one’s control – even the landscape outside, which can quickly shift from peaceful to threatening in the flash of an eye.It’s a bleak book but then again, life isn’t always a fairy tale, particularly for those who are acting out their own tragedies in a land that is not quite yet home. 4.5 stars, rounded up....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 06, 2019","Jun 09, 2019","Jun 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40121973-the-unpassing

I picked it up mid-afternoon and by nightfall, the house could have fallen down on me and I would not have even noticed. That’s how good this book is.The book centers around a sensationalistic trial in Central Florida – think something like Casey Anderson. The defendant: a wealthy teenage girl who may be on the spectrum who is accused of a heinous murder. Jurors are chosen and sequestered, and two of them are a 52-year-old photographer, married to a much older, once celebrated man in failing health, and a single 42-year-old anatomy professor. We know them only as C-2 and F-17.During the mind-numbing days that follow, as the jurors are cut off from the world and housed in an Econo Lodge without cell service, TV, or other distractions, the plot thickens. Much to my chagrin, the back cover includes ample spoilers, including the verdict. I’m surprised the publicist allowed these spoilers and urge readers to just dive in (as I did after I was forewarned).The focus on the book is not the trial, for the most part; it’s the two jurors and the profound choices that must be made both in and out of the courtroom. It’s about the restlessness of grief and the complications and twists of life.

Many, though, are not unlike our narrator, Emily – on the cusp of entering her middle years, still grieving a miscarriage, unable to determine “what she wants to be when she grows up”, and trying to make sense of both her past and her future.When Emily and her husband arrive to take over an inherited and abandoned Massachusetts summer camp, they find that there is one unexpected addition: a captivating young gay woman named Stella. As Emily strives to find her authentic self, she becomes Stella’s Pygmalion, reinventing herself in the younger woman’s image and simultaneously experimenting with other roles – as her best friend, mother, and even would-be lover. The premise – the attempt to reframe one’s life and the difference between giving oneself some agency and actually having control – is a fine one, and the scenes between Emily and Stella cackle, with enough self-destruction thrown in for me to shake my head and wonder, “What is she thinking?” The clothing metaphor (Emily is applying for a job as a clothing retail marketer and there are scenes of her donning others’ shirts, for example) works well with the identity theme.Less successful is the camper girl back story, which, in this case, lifted me from the narrative and – to my mind – didn’t add enough to the overall drama.

We get insights into a girl/woman who straddles two worlds – two climates, two languages, two cultures, two roads to take. For those who admire new forms and new ways of using linguistic form to capture the fractured hybridity of a one person’s life, this is your book.

But when the author is Carolina de Robertis – the author of the outstanding book Perla – and the women represent any one of us who yearn for a feeling of safety, home and family, the book cries out to be read.For anyone who loves books that ask the question, “What does it take to be human?”, my answer is: read Cantoras. It’s a beautiful book, exquisitely written, and passionately felt. And it tackles what it means to live, survive, and belong to each other and to a land that’s far older than the soldiers and the generals who try to redefine it and soil it. As a military dictatorship firms its hold on Uruguay from 1973 to 1985, targeting anyone who is not “normal” for punishment, five women refuse to have their authentic flame extinguished. They adopt the term “cantoras” – translated as singers – and away from the blinding city lights of Montevideo, they discover how to laugh, flirt, dream, share secrets, and most of all, to sing. As one character says to another, “Well, thank goodness you make her sing What’s a life without music?” Mostly young and mainly single when they meet, they blossom and grow together and learn new ways to interweave with each other. Even at time when they don’t believe in the fundamental goodness of human souls, they believe in “the shimmering power they generated collectively by being awake and together in this room.”Beyond all else, the book is an ode to the enduring power of loving strongly and without boundaries.

I can’t think of another writer today who has so adroitly captured our deteriorating east coast small town communities and the has-beens, ne’er-do-wells, and wannabes who inhabit them. Works such as The Risk Pool, Nobody’s Fool and Empire Falls, for example, position him as the preeminent chronicler of the down-on-their-luck manufacturing towns of America.Chances Are…is a quintessentially Russo sort of book. It’s not quite as good as the three I mention above, but it is quite good nonetheless. The novel centers around three college chums who have taken different paths and now meet in Martha’s Vineyard in the midst of their 66th year, and one “ghost.” They all were in love with an elusive and carefree woman named Jacy, who spent a summer with them more than four decades ago and then disappeared, never to be heard from again.The book asks: what ever happened to her? Did she meet with foul play or is she hiding just out of sight? But it would not be fair to call this a mystery; rather, the novel’s theme is how “the things we keep secret tend to be right at the center of who we are.” Or, put another way, do we ever really know a person we believe we’re close to?It’s also a book about “chances” – the immutable fate that may be fixed right from the start, the opportunities we did not take, the way we look at life from the wrong end of the telescope as we age. When do we give up on taking a chance? Do we ever give up?The Jacy scenes come across as a bit cinematic and plotted, which is why I’m withholding the fifth star.

While immersed in this melancholic book, I surrendered to the sights and sounds of the Spanish port of Algeciras and the exotic landscape of Andalucia. The rest of the world ceased to exist.There are definitely nods to Beckett’s Waiting for Godot: two characters who wait for the arrival of someone named Godot who never arrives, while engaging in a variety of discussions. In Kevin Barry’s book, two old-before-their-time shady drug-smugglers – Maurice Hearne and Charlie Redmond – wait at the ferry terminal for a young woman named Dilly, introduced as Maurice’s daughter.As ferries arrive and leave again, the two men journey through their memories to earlier times that were punctuated with obsessive love, dangerous endeavors, betrayals, violence, and break-downs. They talk of ageing and dying, “what they have crossed and those they have helped, of their first loves of lost loves, of their enemies and friends. Their memories transport them to old days in Cork and in Barcelona, and in London, and in Malaga, and the ghosted city of Cadiz.Gradually, the shattered shards of their past lives coalesce and a portrait emerges of who these men are to each other, what has brought them to this point of time, and the importance of Dilly to each of them.This is an unquestionable 5-star book. It is not for everyone; those who prefer linear plots where a lot happens might want to look elsewhere.

Time and circumstance have changed Olive – and me – and have made usMeeting up with Olive Kitteridge again after 11 years ago is an unexpected treat. Time and circumstance have changed Olive – and me – and have made us both older, wiser, and more in touch with what is meaningful and what is unimportant.When I first became acquainted with Olive in the first book, I recall a lot of back and forth discussions on whether she was “likeable.” That never mattered to me. What mattered is that she was believable – so authentic that it almost felt as if I DID know her.In this sequel, Olive is instantly recognizable. She is older now, married to Jack Kennison, and her son Christopher is living away from her in New York, now the father/stepfather of four children of his own. Her marriage to Jack has a different timbre than her marriage to Henry; after all, they have come to each other with a past and a history. Now, Olive understands in ways she didn’t before what a gem Henry was and some of her spitefulness to others has morphed into a desire for amends.Just like before, the chapters are composed of interwoven stories. In some, Olive plays a dominant role; in others, a peripheral role; and in still others, no role at all. There are scenes that are so indelibly written that it will be hard for me to forget them. For instance, there is Olive’s rapprochement with her grieving daughter-in-law whom she has never understood, and the realization that she herself had been raising a motherless child now a long, long way from home. There are glimpses into the aloneness that each of us carry – an ancient man who gets pleasure from watching his young cleaning woman fondle herself, a guileless and grieving daughter who strives for a moment of connection with her estate attorney, a victim of abuse who reaches out to a schoolboy who felt like an outsider, a former student of Olive who is now a poet laureate and writes a spiteful poem as a result of her unhappiness.In the vortex of this stands Olive, who is as befuddled as anyone else in making it through this life. The fact is, she writes, “I do not have a clue who I have been. Truthfully, I do not understand a thing.” None of us know – I certainly don’t – but somehow, we all muddle through and every now and then, like Olive, we get some small and shiny reward.

Belle Boggs could have gone for easy laughs here, relying on the roll-your-eyes picture of would-be writers who focus on Mormon vampire romances and pious, Pollyanna-ish collections of poetry about cancer-stricken kids. Wisely, she chooses a higher ground. One of the key adult students, Janine Gray, writes poems about Terri Schiavo but there’s an earnestness, a kindness, within her that makes her rise far above mere caricature. Similarly, Davonte Gold, an R&R star who is attempting a major comeback with a “come to Jesus” autobiography and he, too, cannot be summarily dismissed.Rather than focus her attentions on these true-to-life aspiring writers, Belle Boggs’ target is rely the for-profit God’s World God’s Word educational conglomerate, tied to a craven politician who has hitched his wagon to the “personhood” anti-abortion star. Gradually, it falls on Marianne to resist the agenda of this conglomerate (which even offers Christian online sonogram education), which is to tear down public community education in favor of theological rigidness.Marianne encounters a multitude of obstacles that are strewn in her path – from romantic to artistic to weather-related – that force her to deal with the consequences of her initial choice.

Her influences -Let's take a look at the good things first: Sara Collins makes the audacious choice to combine a slavery story with a gothic overlay. Her influences - Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights - are never far from the surface as she focuses on Frannie, aka the Mulatta Murderess, who starts her life as a slave on a Jamaican plantation perversely called ""Paradise"" and ends up in the London home of the Benhams. Quickly, she forms an attachment to the opium-eater Mrs. Benham and when both husband and wife meet their demise, she becomes the natural suspect.Sara Collins has the gothic setting -the atmosphere of mystery and horror with a pseudomedieval element-- down pat. For any reader who has been enthralled by Edgar Allan Poe, the Bronte sisters, and even some of the Dickensian novels, there will be much admiration for the author's fluid writing style. The terror of slavery and the horrible injustices of the treatment of slaves in the Caribbean and in Britain are aptly characterized. Just about every chapter ends with a portentous cliff-hanger.And yet. While I admired what Sara Collins was accomplishing, I was unable to truly immerse myself in her compelling story. I have tried to figure out why, and one reason, I think, is that the grotesqueness of what man did to fellow man during slavery is so heinous that it doesn't need an overlay.  For another, many current books - and this one is no exception - tend to focus on the ""exceptional"" slave, who is typically literate, articulate, and a lover of novels rather than the sufferers who were denied these pleasures. I couldn't help but think that in real life, the straightforward speech and agency of Frannie would have quickly been met with lashings and death. Her ability to hold her own - the very thing that made her the character she is - seemed inconsistent with the milieu of those times.My reading experience is, of course, subjective. I believe that this book will uncover a wide readership this spring.

Rather, it’s almost like a fictional essay or a structured meditation. A reader’s enjoyment of the book will depend upon how he or she feels about this kind of genre.In many places, it is brilliant. Holding the story together is an unnamed first person narrator who has undergone her mother’s death and is contemplating having a first and then a second baby. Her story is interspersed with three vignettes from the medical world: Wilhelm Rontgen who invented the x-ray, Freud and his daughter Anna, and finally, John Hunter, an 18th century surgeon and anatomist of pregnant bodies.These three interwoven stories weren’t chosen by accident. Jessie Greengrass’ own sights are fixed on “the sense of yearning outwards into darkness, the prayer for understanding that is nothing but a silent thought in a vast and vaulted space.” All three of the men she chooses brought light out of darkness – literally or figuratively. The fact that the narrator is striving to dig in the dark folds of the mind and finding it to be precarious, uncertain and impossible to compete weaves the book together.What the author does so well is to combine the sense of detachment with intimately-felt insights into the roles of being a daughter, mother, and human being. Shimmering, perfectly-wrought long paragraphs, many of which take up an entire page and more combined with a fractional style demand complete attention. I can see why it’s not for everyone; in full disclosure, I picked it up twice and put it down before connecting with it this time.

And they would tell me a story, a secret, something so pithy, so profound, that it is worth the wait.”Travelers is about the stories and secrets that African refugees and asylum seekers carry, the colorful past that helps answer the question, “Where am I? Who am I? How did I get here?” It’s about how we remain human when a loss of identity and sense of dislocation begin closing in, and what we cling to to find the resilience to move ahead. With successive chapters that introduce interweaving characters, it is a tour de force.Right at the center of the vortex is a Nigerian doctor whose marriage to his American wife is flailing. While in Berlin, he meets a number of Africans who have fled their home. Through their connections, we hear the poignant stories: a one-time doctor who now works as a bouncer and who shows up every Sunday at Checkpoint Charlie where he hopes to reunite with his lost wife. A shopkeeper who fled an al-Shabaab commander who was determined to marry his 10-year-old daughter. A young woman who visits her husband’s Swiss ex-wife who stood trial for his murder.

The premise is galvanizing: a thirty-something woman takes a position as a creative writing professor in the rural English countryside on the heels of a violent assault. She is assigned six students, including the immensely talented and mercurial Nicholas Baker, whose work – he claims – is always based on “truth.” Yet the “truth” begins to get darker and darker particularly after the first-person narrator begins to recognize herself as a main player in his bookThe theme is riveting: the fear of “being caught up in someone else’s story; of being written by someone else; the fear of having no say in who I was at all.” Without being cloying or overpowering, essential questions are raised here: how can a woman claim her authentic voice, especially after assault, when she feels compelled to say “yes” instead of “no” at the workplace, when she forced to upset her work/life balance, when her very life becomes fodder for a volatile student’s sick writings? Jo Baker does a masterful job of capturing her narrator’s state of mind as well as the often-ridiculous politics of a university setting (for example, student writers must issue “trigger warnings” in case something they write upsets someone else.)I was well on my way to a glowing five-star rating. But about two-thirds through the book, the author deviates from her premise in favor of a more cinematic ending. Suddenly the narrator makes a few choices that are inconsistent with the character we’ve come to know. Her sympathies with Nicholas belie her own carefully-crafted sense of self-protection, particularly since she is also caring for her three-year-old son. Ultimately, we get action scenes that would play well in the movies but discredit the nuanced psychological suspense we’ve come to expect and also veer wildly from the book’s theme.

For the unnamed narrator (we get two big hints of the narrator’s name much later on), it means constantly being subjected to commentary such as: “How long have y’all lived here Do you even speak English? Bless your heart, you must miss your people. You stick out like a raisin in a big bowl of oatmeal.”When Mother (our narrator) is lying on the concrete floor bleeding out after a raid on her home (we know this from page one), everything that has brought her to this point flashes through her mind. The indignities that she and her three daughters have been forced to undergo in school. The harassment and intrusive comments from everyone from door-to-door salesmen to the dry cleaner aide and grocery check-out people. The comments on her color, her weight, her marital status.Ms. Laskar seamlessly weaves other parts of the story – seemingly unrelated but actually quite on-the-mark – in alternating chapters, some of which are no more than a sentence or two. There are scenes, for example, with her German Shepherd rescue dog, Greta, who despite past abuse, never loses her spirit or her capability for love. There are asides about Barbie dolls – many girls on the threshold of adulthood actually decapitate or microwave these dolls with their dream-home expectations. There are references to “my hero” – her on-the-road husband, which start off lovingly and become more and more mocking. And as all this builds, Mother can no longer do what she asks her daughters to do: keep a neutral face with a benevolent smile and absorb all of it to not place herself at risk.This is a wonderful book that builds in momentum as it goes along.

But it could just as easily take place in a working-class area in London, Paris, Munich – or here in Texas or any number of other states. In fact, the crisis at the center of it – allowing a boat load of refugees into Australia – was so familiar that many times, I forgot the novel was not set in the U.S.Antonio Martone, an Italian immigrant to Sydney, is at the center of the book. He and his friend Nico were hired to construct McMansions, but lately, the already inferior quality has taken a big hit. When an accident ensues, leaving Antonio with no choice but to retire, he begins to get increasingly obsessed with the nationalists in his neighborhood. His wife Rose and his two aimless children Clare and Francis are powerless to prevent Antonio’s downward spiral.Here is Clare’s summary of her father: “I just think, he’s old and he’s angry that he’s not in control anymore. He’s always had a thing about migrants these days not working as hard not trying to fit in as much as he did…That’s it, maybe, he can’t handle change.” The problem goes beyond that, of course Antonio realizes that “life doesn’t really bring you into the future, it just throws you further and further into the past.” His own feeling of powerlessness and superfluity is the spark of his anger that eventually propels Antonio to the headlines.The themes of belonging, national identity and transition, exploited by the media and the politicians, mines the cognitive dissonance and clear insanity of immigrants turning against more recent immigrants. At times, the message becomes too overt (as it is in the quote I used above). At a time when we have become inured to terrified asylum seekers being jailed, children being placed in cages, and exaggerated tales of “caravans” panicking our own countrymen, the current debate has shifted from “who is a citizen” to “who is human.” Yet the raw impulses triggered by fear and tribalism always lurk beneath the surface....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 19, 2019","Apr 22, 2019","Apr 19, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35067213-no-more-boats

Now! And that not oAnyone who is already old, caring for someone old, or intending to grow old in the near or distant future needs to read this book. Now! And that not only includes readers; it also includes policy-makers.Elderhood is not a “how-to” book that treads over the same old tired ground. Rather, it’s a book that tackles why aging must be understood and redefined and why the medical establishment’s usual goals of saving lives and curing disease is misplaced and ill-advised in many older patients.I’m going to pause a moment in this  to say that I was the point person for my own once vibrant elderly mother, who died at age 93 after a 10-year downward spiral. I saw first-hand how healthcare, well-meaning though it was, often acted counterintuitively. Dr. Aronson makes many excellent points including these:*All top-ranked health systems on the planet rely on primary care to keep people healthy. In the U.S., ranked 37th among nations by the World Health Organization, we have trouble recruiting physicians to primary care since those doctors are paid on average over $100,000 less than specialists. As a result, we focus on high-tech solutions rather than commonsense ones.*Pharmaceutical trials focus mostly on middle-aged, not elderly, targets. As a result, the side effects in the elderly are often minimized or glossed over entirely. Moreover, many older patients (my mom was one of them) are prescribed multiple drugs that interact with each other and cause more harm than good.*It is easier for the elderly to get a cochlear implant than a hearing aid or laser treatments instead of eyeglasses. Yet a simple “fix” can do wonders by providing the elderly with a healthier, fully-engaged life.*Being “old” should not be classified as 65+. In reality, people in the Third Age of life (the young-old) have vast differences in health, activities and consumer roles. They are very distinct from the “old-old” who are truly infirm and dependent.*Successful aging is possible for those who do not perceive meaning in aging itself, but instead, perceive meaning in being themselves in old age. Adaptability and self-acceptance are key.I could go on and on – just about every page has insights on how we, as a society, can reimagine life and why it’s crucial to do so, since someone who is 65 years old and relatively healthy will very likely live to 90. This well-written, easily accessible book should be mandatory for anyone entering medical school or politics, and certainly for every person who is affected by aging (i.e., all of us)....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Apr 17, 2019","Apr 19, 2019","Apr 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40607229-elderhood

Burdened by exhaustion, spooked by anxieties, feeling unworthy of the task, she is rife for exploration by so many contemporary authors.I am not making light of it. It IS challenging and transformational to juggle toddlers, career and one’s own sanity. It’s the stuff of mythology. And indeed, Victor LaValle, another writer, did a fine job of that in The Changeling. The theme of centered around the fears that have been with us since ancient times when we fall short of being the strong protective parent – and can’t enjoy the illusion of order anymore.Helen Phillips works around this theme, too, but the theme here fails to coalesce. Molly is a paleobotanist with two very young children and a husband who is on a business trip on the other side of the world. She’s beyond exhausted and beginning to blur the line between hallucinations and reality. She’s rapidly having fugue-like incidents where she’s confronting a bad force (there’s a Molly-Moll split personality dynamic going on). And she’s experiencing increasing distance from the known facts of her own life.Some of the book feels like an advertisement for La Leche International (yes, breastfeeding is good, but is it that important to the narrative to keep coming back to it?) And I couldn’t help but wonder: both husband and wife have high-powered jobs so surely, as Molly is unraveling, couldn’t they bring in day-to-day help beyond their babysitter? There should be no question that Helen Phillips is a good writer. But LaValle pulled the theme together far more imaginatively.

You have to really like these characters to spend time in their lives and inside their heads for days at a time. It may not be the most fun you’ve ever had, but it has to be darn close.So let’s start here: I liked the Sorenson family. I liked its messiness, quirkiness, heartaches and triumphs. And I didn’t regret one single hour that I was immersed in their world.Marilyn and David are the fortunate couple who quickly intuit that they’re right for each other and present a portraiture of stability and passion throughout the years. Their four daughters must continually strive to replicate that kind of love in their own lives and each of them has her own challenges to overcome. The oldest, Wendy, leaps out from the pages with her oversized personality and wry comments. Her “Irish twin” Violet is far more traditional and yoked to pursuing perfection in all she does. Then there’s Liza, a psychologist married to a depressed and tattoo sleeved software developer, and the youngest, Grace, who finds herself being left out of the sisterhood due to her “last child” standing. The relationship among the four sisters pulses with authenticity. Claire Lombardo writes, “The only portrait you could ever get really of one sister from another, tinged inevitably with jealousy and double standards and affection as deep and intractable as marrow.” When Jonah, the love child of one of the sisters is suddenly thrust into their lives, some of the fault lines are widened. All the tumultuous elements that come part and parcel of being a family are here – the secrets, the illnesses, the childrearing, the unexpected happenings that knock down carefully planned lives.I did have a few quibbles. The characters sometimes talk in staccato to a fault. (Example: “Hey honey, is Ryan_Has he…” or But they really—You’d be surprised how they grow on you.”) It’s authentic, yes, but also overdone. There were some parts that were a stretch (why would daughter Liza choose a chronically depressed partner who gave her little emotionally?) But these are, indeed, quibbles.

They barely have a clear understanding of themselves let alone each other. While on a sometimes awkward honeymoon at Cape May, they end up meeting Clara – a rich and free-spirited friend of Effie’s older cousin — as well as her bodybuilder lover Max and his rootless half-sister Alma.As the couple falls into the spell of this trio, living the alcohol-soaked life where moral boundaries and indeed, trust itself, seem to conveniently disappear, their fledging marriage, barely a week old, begins to unravel at the seams. How that happens is for the reader to discover.Chip Creek is walking a fine line throughout the book on examining the very nature of desire and eroticism. From time to time, the book inches over that line into eroticism; it is more satisfying when the focus is on desire, as evidenced by sexual awakenings. Chip Creek beautifully depicts two careless, still unformed people who do not have the emotional resources to withstand the steamy lure of a glittery and vulgar scene they become a part of An early scene —a naked walk around the neighborhood — wonderfully sets up the aura of invisibility that Effie and Henry carry with them.The book, to me, was page-turning and yes, seductive.

The wealthy are drawn with a broad brush and risk becoming one-dimensional and the constant descriptions of what they're wearing and how they look become redundant.

Suffice to say that two NYPD cops – Francis Gleeson and Brian Stanhope – end up living next door to each other, raising their families in a quiet town close to NYC. Eventually, the families become linked by love, struggles, and tragic life events. How this occurs is for the reader to discover.What’s more important are the themes. The book is about how one thing leads to another which leads to another and eventually, how the last fallen domino skids far from the neatly toppled row. It’s about how we cannot escape the damage done to us in our past, but instead, can confront it to build a semblance of a future. But most of all, it’s about the power of love and redemption: how we can lose our footing, lose our path, and in some cases, even lose our mind, but still be worthy of forgiveness.It’s also about what it means to be a success: not what we accumulate or what we accomplish but how many people love us and believe in us when it really matters. The genuineness of these damaged and striving characters is so real that I found that soon after starting the book, my emotions were intertwined with theirs. I don’t know who Mary Beth Keane is or where she came from, but I do know she has her finger on the pulse of the human heart.

I suspected it might be another one of those feel-good, politically-correct books. But I loved Mira Jacob’s first novel, The Sleepwalker’s Guide to Dancing, and on a whim, I decided to take a chance.And – wow! This is the real deal, raw, wrenching, funny, fearless, and honest. Mira Jacob is an American of Indian descent, married to a Jewish man, and their young son, referred to here as Z, is an inquisitive boy who inherited her dark skin and her poignant need to understand the “lifetime caught between beautiful dream of a diverse nation and the complicated reality of one.”Using her own illustrations to tell her story, Mira Jacobs walks us through pivotal moments in her back history. She recalls winning an essay contest, sponsored by the DAR, as a child. However, Mira wasn’t quite the “American” the DAR envisioned in granting her the prize. She highlights the “tragedy of my skin color” on visits back to India, where the fairer someone is, the more value they seem to have. She writes humorously about a Boston radio producer who wishes to interview her after her book is published but insists on pigeonholing her characters into some “Asian Indians” that his audience can fully understand.But to me, the most wrenching part was the schism that occurs when her mother-in-law (who Mira loved enough to instantly call “mom”), decides to vote for Donald Trump at the same time that she and her young son are petrified of the racist undertones of his campaign. She asks her husband, “How can they see what this guy is about and support him! He’s stoking religious hatred! Racial hatred! How do they think this is going to affect our lives?” When her husband assures her that they love her, she answers, “You think they’d feel the same about me if I voted for an anti-Semite?” He answers, “They don’t see it that way.” She answers, “But it is that way.If you are an apologist for Donald Trump, you’d best skip this book. But if you believe, as the author does, that our growth potential is tied into being “the kind of person who ass questions about who you are why things are the way they are, and what we could do to make them better,” then this is the book for you....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,not set,"Mar 24, 2019","Mar 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36700347-good-talk

Add to that the other reader siren calls: a setting seen through new eyes, a young child you want to root for, a romance, an uplifting message, a romance, and even the gates of Auschwitz.Robert Hillman has pressed all the buttons and normally, that would make me wary. But despite myself, I fell under the spell of this book. It’s set in the late 1960s in rural Australia, where two lonely people meet. One is Tom Hope (a symbolic name if there ever was one), who is broken-hearted after his unfaithful wife absconds with the boy he’s come to feel for as his own son. The other is a Holocaust survivor, Hannah, who is many years older than him, a little mad, yet impassioned about life. Tom and Hannah are an unlikely pair and there might be questions about the strong attraction. I took it on faith: both are broken people living in a sparsely populated area and have suffered loss. Under Robert Hillman’s crafting, Hannah comes uniquely and vitally alive – the dialog, the fears, the passions all feel true to life. And so does Tom.In the “what if I were the writer” department, there are a couple of things I might have done differently; for instance, Hannah’s back story might have ended at a pivotal place a bit earlier. But all in all, this is a page-turning book with a strong and hopeful message: when we let love into our lives it can do wonders and heal our broken hearts. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Mar 16, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36632342-the-bookshop-of-the-broken-hearted

By the end of the book, I felt I had been sprinkled with prairie dust.There are three main characters and entire chapters are devoted to each: younger sister Elise who is imaginative, flighty and dreamy, with a mind that is frighteningly lush and fragile. Lorena, the older sister, is more precise, pragmatic and pedantic, with her feet grounded firmly in reality. Into their lives steps the schoolteacher Gus, just a few years older than they are, who vacillates between the poles that the sisters represent. Michael Parker has a graceful writing style all his own, punctuated with sheer lyricism and a wry humor that causes the reader not to guffaw but to chuckle. Interspersed with the third-person narratives are snippets of articles directly lifted from newspapers of western Oklahoma and west Texas between 1900 and 1920. An entire section is composed of posted letters between Elise and Lorena, and those are so beautifully written that they took my breath away.This is a book that reveals how there is always part of us lost in the business of everyday living, and there is always more to lose. But at the end of the day, it is a “true cry” – that which is authentic – that breaks through and survives.

Whip smart, congenitally wary, and unable to tolerate deception, Marie is a character unlike others that readers like me have met before.After not “playing the game” properly at the CIA, she is given a proposition while on probation: go to the African country of Burkina Faso and use all her wiles to win over its handsome and charismatic leader, Thomas Sankara (a man who really existed and was regarded as an African Che Guevara). Sankara has passionate ideals yet his policies are beginning to sway towards authoritarianism. And that is all I’m going to say here about the plot.There is much to love about this book. First, it straddles genres – it’s indeed a spy thriller but also a romance story and a glimpse into messy family dynamics. Written as a confessional to her young twin sons, it’s also a guidepost into what a “good American” should really mean.

It’s just that one day in May, a man snatched me up, and he annihilated me.”The Little Girl in the Ice Floe is harrowing reading. Adelaide Bon, an innocent child from an upper-class family, is sexually assaulted when she is only nine years old. She is one of the “lucky” ones; her parents are supportive and she has the means to access group and individual therapy sessions. Still, as her life progresses, Adelaide suffers from sometimes crippling panic attacks, rages, hyper-sexuality alternating with frigidity, bulimia, and more. She experiences herself as “lost and frozen, standing in the middle of a vast white expanse, waiting. She calls this place my little girl on the ice floe.”Most of the book is eloquently and poetically written in third-person, typical of a narrator who is disassociated because of trauma. Periodically, the narrative careens into first-person, as the present-day Adelaide breaks through. And, as the book jacket reveals, 23 years after her assault, Adelaide finally comes face-to-face with the monster who upended her life.Adelaide writes, “Having been subjected to sexual violence in childhood remains the determining factor in one’s health even fifty years later, and can shorten life expectancy by up to twenty years. How is it possible that, even in our uninformed society, this information is so little known?”How indeed? I will say this: during the first part of this book, part of me – the part that believes in personal empowerment and the powerful ability of the mind to push forward despite physical and emotional trauma – was a tad bit annoyed with Adelaide Bon. I found it implausible that an incident from childhood, when she was “fingered” by a pedophile, resulted in her whole life falling apart.But as I read on, my entire opinion changed. As her memories of that day become better formed, the horror of what she went through rachets up and becomes chilling. This author meticulously presents evidence about how a child’s brain is unable to absorb the enormity of a rape, freezing that moment in a PTSD repetition cycle. The testimonies of other little girls who were also raped by this monster – and must confront a legal system that is woefully uninformed – is mind-blowing. I understand now, in ways I never did before, how violence inflicted on children’s bodies can lead to the fog of forgetting along with lifelong traumatic memory.

But gradually, the horror of war permeates the pages and they become positively heart-wrenching and haunting. An oversized and lonely blue whale falls in love with a Japanese submarine. A keeper of an elephant strives to save it from a directive that all zoo animals be killed, nearly starving himself in the process. A young kamikaze pilot brings a cockroach on his last mission in his Red Dragon plane and feels compassion for it. An old she-wolf tries to save a little girl with the measles who was left behind to die. Here is a passage from the eponymous story, The Cake Tree in the Ruins: On 15th August the war the grown-ups had started finally ended. The whole of Japan had been burnt to the ground and everyone was hungry, but amidst the ruins stood just one cake tree. It was always surrounded by children gorging themselves on its delicious leaves and branches, but the grown-ups passed right by without even noting it was there.” Simple. Mesmerizing. Powerful.This sparse book has a few themes: love and kindness which continue to thrive in the worst of situations…the incredible power of imagination…the separate peace that characters make with themselves in the worst of circumstances.

The plot centers around a fire deliberately set at the hyperbaric oxygenation treatment center (HBOT) owned by Korean immigrants and attended by mothers and their children who have been diagnosed with autism. A trial ensues, based on overwhelming circumstantial evidence. And that’s just the bare bones.Comparisons will, of course, be made between Angie Kim and the better-known Celeste Ng (Little Fires Everywhere). The comparisons will be wrong. Angie Kim is – in my mind – the better writer with plausible characters who leap off the page. She’s the real deal.With her background as a trial lawyer and as a mother of a child who needed HBOT treatment, she knows her subject matter and it shows. The trial scenes cackle with intricacy and suspense. The HBOT treatment scenes display a knowledge that is described in reader-accessible terms. But perhaps most impressive, Angie Kim mines the emotional landscape of mothers who have been driven to exhaustion and despair in constant care for a child with special needs. She displays them, not as saints, but as complex characters who are good people with understandable not-so-good thoughts.In addition to all this, readers will be treated to insights about the Korean paternalistic culture – how it feels to come to America with dreams and end up feeling impotent in one’s power to achieve them with dignity and respect. It touches on other topics as well: the personal nightmare of infertility, the questionable pros and cons of non-mainstream therapies, the extent a parent will go for his or her child. Underlying all of this are the secrets people keep, secrets that torpedo marriages and personal relationships and lead to misunderstandings. It’s a lot for a debut author to achieve.

The son of Black and South Asian migrants from Trinidad, David Chariandy marries a woman of European ancestry and his daughter reaches her preteen years in a French-immersion school. She belongs, not to one “group” or another; rather, she belongs to herself. But she still must understand systemic racism and ethnic/gender labeling to move comfortably on.It’s an affirmational story, but far and away the best reason to read this slim book is the love and acceptance that David Chariandy communicates to his daughter. His pride in her and concern for her shine forth on every page and the universality of parent love ties him in with every caring parent, regardless of ethnicity. I closed the pages thinking how very fortunate this young teenager is to have such a father.

It’s as bleak as it gets, a Dickensian world on steroids: Sweden in the late 18th century where bodies of water are filled with stench and bodies, where rats roam freely, hypocrisy (as ever) reigns and the populace struggles to survive. When you consider that one link to the story is a hideously deformed, limb-deprived victim who eats his own excrement, you have a hint about the kind of “torture porn” you’re getting into.There are many books I’ve loved to hate. This is a book I’ve hated to love. Since “love” is a strong word, I will modify to say that there is much to recommend this book and to justify its 5-star rating.For one thing, it’s masterfully written, totally belying the fact that this is the author’s debut book. It could serve as a primer on how to write atmospheric book, with just about every sentence reinforcing the conditions of Sweden in the time following King Gustav. The characters are drawn sharply – an alcoholic watchman whose arm was severed in a senseless war teaming with a young detective whose time is limited as a result of advanced consumption. Their narrative envelopes the two interior parts, which focus on an adventurous young man whose fortunes turn suddenly and a young orphaned fruit-seller who is falsely accused of whoring.Because of the confident, muscular prose, it’s easy to trust this author as he shifts from one part to another with stories that at first seem unrelated. As it all comes together, the suspense builds and the book becomes impossible to put down. Its theme, from Plautus during the Punic Wars: “Like a wolf is man to other men.” The question, consistently asked throughout the book is this: “Are we wolves to one another, always on the lookout for the least sign of weakness before we choose the moment of attack?”While I will not get into plot points – that is for the reader to discover – I will say that the answer plays out in many ways, through many characters. As a person who struggles to find the good in humanity, I will not say that this book is soul-nourishing.

WThe magic and cruelty of childhood can be a potent combination in the hands of a masterful author.I am not saying that Gerard Reve is not masterful. What I am saying is that for whatever reason, the execution of this formula did not work for me. What I expected was to be immersed in novellas of psychological suspense. The first novella was described as a subtle game of fascination and persecution between a sadistic boy and a weak outsider. The second focused on the rapidly escalating and intense persecution of a Jewish Amsterdam family after the Nazi takeover, as seen through the eyes of a young boy.The subdued prose is largely understated and muted. Although Gerard Reve creates suspense through strong images (some of the action is within the spaces of things not said as opposed to things acted out), I did not feel immersed in the narrative. I wanted more of an emotional connection – certainly not a manipulative one or one in which all the I’s are dotted and the t’s are crossed – but more of a reason to become immersed.Sometimes, I describe novellas as “warm” or “cool”.

Most of his work focuses on – or alludes to – the death of his father by suicide, but none more so than his latest novel.Jim Vann is likely suffering from the effects of deep bipolar disorder when we meet him in the final weeks of his life. He has two children, one of whom is David (yes, THAT David), he owes a fortune to the IRS and he has shattered the relationships he’s held with past wives. Life, to Jim, is only time to pass with nothing to look forward to. In desperation, he travels from Alaska to California to reunite with his younger brother Gary, who is charged with keeping him alive during a very tenuous time.This is not an easy book to read. For those who know someone with bipolar disorder, the dialog and situations will ring hauntingly true. There is a claustrophobic – even voyeuristic – quality about this work as we settle into Jim’s head and by extension, the author’s head. The feeling of desperation and despair are so incredibly strong that it takes some degree of mental health to allow oneself to immerse into these pages.The title of the book comes from one of Jim’s flights of fantasy: a 300-pound halibut taken to the moon and released to let it flop, to see how high it will flop. “They didn’t mean for it to survive,” Jim says. “It was supposed to have one beautiful flight, is all. That’s all any of us are meant to have. None of us survive.” I cannot imagine the emotional cost to David Vann to write this book, which is inspired – perhaps, even documented – from his father’s life. Certainly it captures a snapshot not only of a man, but of an entire family, who is forever damaged as they witness their loved one’s inevitable path to self-destruction....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40642327-halibut-on-the-moon

How could an author create a psychological thriller in such a carefully structured and literary way? His latest book, The Current, proves that his debut book was no fluke. If possible, it’s even better than his first book. Once I began it, I didn’t want to come up for air.The plot, in a nutshell: college roommates Caroline and Audrey take a road trip to visit Audrey’s father, a sheriff with terminal cancer. A car accident at the book’s beginning leaves the girls submerged in an icy current, fighting for their lives. Audrey must reconcile what happened to them (was it an accident?), since the circumstances are quite similar to another accident that occurred years ago.There is so much to recommend the book that I barely know where to start. The dialog is pitch perfect and the characters leap off the pages. Tim Johnston is not interested as much in “whodunit” as he is in uncovering what loss means to those affected by it and how their lives play out. Take this prose, inspiring the book’s title: “…You are just in the current and the current is forever and you are not alone, you are never alone in the current and the current itself is…is what?” Is love.”It is love, the author suggests, that is the one thing with the power to save us. Whether that love is between a damaged Audrey and her dying father, a destroyed man whose daughter was similarly killed years ago and cares for Audrey, or even an aging dog who brought together a family in despair with a son who was wrongfully suspected, love will see us to the other side.

I don’t recall, though, reading a novel that showcases what involuntary conscription did to Germany’s own soldiers. To Die in Spring fills that gap.Two teenage German dairy farm apprentices, Walter and Friedrich, are on the precipice of claiming their lives when they are forced to join the losing Waffen SS effort – right at the time when Russia is advancing. In doing so, they are plunged into a hellish world of continual bombardments, the dying and amputated, and shell-shocked commanders. As the war efforts give up their last gasp, the innocent, pink-cheeked boys are lost in a Dante’s inferno landscape – Walter as part of the supply chain unit and cynical and caustic Fiete (as he is known) as more fodder for the frontline.There are searing and unforgettable scenes: the bodies of emaciated German deserters labeled “coward” hanging from trees, starving livestock, a tortured blind woman and her hunchback husband who were deemed to be complicit and so forth. Perhaps no scene is quite as haunting as the reunification of the two young friends at one critical juncture in the novel – every word vibrates with meaning and the scene is so galvanizing that it literally took my breath away.

Or is it fiction? Or (as I suspect) is it memoirs enhanced by fictional elements?There are intertwining references that thread together this collection. Pinochet. The character-as-writer. The ever-present computer. Failure of communication. In his story “Memories of a Personal Computer”, Mr. Zambra gives a hint as to what he’s up to. He says this about a new lover, Claudia, who poignantly learns who he truly is by reading his e-mail: “Claudia read the different versions of that unsent message, and she noticed how a definitive phrase in one draft became ambiguous in the next, how he changed adjectives, cut and pasted phrases.” It’s a metaphor for life.Perhaps my favorite in the collection, Family Life, shows the narrator creating an alternative fictional backstory for a neighbor. Instead of house-sitting for his cousin, he now owns the house and his wife has absconded with his daughter. It is a masterful look at how we can reinvent ourselves by altering the details of our life.Another favorite, Camilio, focuses on the narrator meeting his father’s godson, whose own father was exiled from Pinochet. Years later, the narrator meets Camilo’s father and gets some hints into the back story. Mr. Zambria writes, “I think that the story can’t’ end like that..>But that’s how it ends.”The writing is fluid and quietly powerful, and each story serves to reinforce the others.

As readers, we know early on there will be a shipwreck that will have dire consequences for them. But the story unfolds gradually, with chapters that take us way back into Deb's life and then quickly moves forward to days before the shipwreck. Like a jigsaw puzzle, we begin to figure out who Deb really is and understand the significance of her love affair with Keller.In the meantime, we learn a lot about the last continent-Antarctica. Midge Raymond has certainly done her homework and her insights feel authentic and fascinating. We learn the paradox of tourism to this mysterious continent: how tourism both preserves and harms the continent and the penguins and how each act we perform inadvertently hastens their extinction-whether it's eating a fish dinner onboard or losing a wedding ring in the Antarctic ocean. Keller says, ""The tourists were obsessed with firsts. Scott, Amundsen, all of them -it was about doing it first. Now everyone is obsessed with lasts. Checking off their last continent. Seeing it before it's all gone. Seems they'll be bragging about who photographed the last living Adelie.""Ultimately, this book is like the movie Titanic with teeth. It's a poignant love story about two damaged people who must balance their separate lives with a passion for the continent. It's about how to responsibly take our role within the ecosystem. And it's also about how each life matters - from our own human lives to the lives of others in the animal and bird kingdom.

Was he a thirsty seeker of knowledge, a scientist who believed it was one’s ultimate duty to discover what is unknown? Was he a betrayer of friends, his wife, his country, the man who unleashed the mighty power of the ultimate weapon of destruction?Louisa Hall suggests this: that “only in those moments between the slides of the kaleidoscope, those moments of a life that never crystallize into practiced anecdote or reliable knowledge” do we begin to feel “people pass through or, or over us and around us.” She invents seven characters who give testimonials about their own fledgling acquaintances with Oppenheimer – from an Army intelligence officer who tails Oppenheimer during his tryst with his lover Jean to a married Princeton secretary in the throes of an eating disorder to a betrayed journalist who is assigned to interview the scientist in his last dying days. But in circuitously talking about Oppenheimer, they inevitably end up telling their own tale, and the tale is a universal one: it is a tale of insecurity, secrets, the seeking of meaning. Each – including Oppenheimer – is pursued like Henry James’ mythical beast in the jungle, the as-yet-unknowable hunter. Robert Oppenheimer, Louisa Hall suggests, is part of us. We are all inadvertent liars and poor witnesses to history; for example, within the book, there are several versions of Oppenheimer’s affair with Jean Tatlock and similarly, many versions of what Oppenheimer’s inner life must have been like. But more dauntingly, we are all complicit with a program that killed 129,000 people when, according to most historians, the war had already been won – choosing later to accuse him of betrayal instead of a more horrific crime.The novel almost begs you, the reader, to examine your own beliefs about this flawed genius: did he create a weapon that ended World War II early or did he unleash Pandora’s box onto a once-innocent world? I have come to believe the latter, but each of us must decide on our own. This multi-layered and creatively-rendered novel provides fleeting glimpses – not deep dives – into Oppenheimer but its main goal is to use Oppenheimer as a mirror who reflects back to all of us....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Jan 02, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36461462-trinity

All the milestone are there - the war years that separate and test the marriage, the ensuing house and children, the chasing of the dream, the inevitable arguments and health issues.But Kathy Page is seeking - and capturing - a deeper truth here.

And Evelyn is genetically incapable of being happy, with her obsessional organizational skills, her control tendencies, and her out-of-proportion responses to things that don't go her way.Harry's desire to placate Evelyn and assure her of his love test him and separate him from his desire to ""stay open to the possibility of an ecstatic life."" The marriage - the life - is anyone's definition of material and career success, yet poignantly, it is a sad tale of a patient man who gives his all to placate his perfectionist spouse.

Was he a thirsty seeker of knowledge, a scientist who believed it was one’s ultimate duty to discover what is unknown? Was he a betrayer of friends, his wife, his country, the man who unleashed the mighty power of the ultimate weapon of destruction?Louisa Hall suggests this: that “only in those moments between the slides of the kaleidoscope, those moments of a life that never crystallize into practiced anecdote or reliable knowledge” do we begin to feel “people pass through or, or over us and around us.” She invents seven characters who give testimonials about their own fledgling acquaintances with Oppenheimer – from an Army intelligence officer who tails Oppenheimer during his tryst with his lover Jean to a married Princeton secretary in the throes of an eating disorder to a betrayed journalist who is assigned to interview the scientist in his last dying days. But in circuitously talking about Oppenheimer, they inevitably end up telling their own tale, and the tale is a universal one: it is a tale of insecurity, secrets, the seeking of meaning. Each – including Oppenheimer – is pursued like Henry James’ mythical beast in the jungle, the as-yet-unknowable hunter. Robert Oppenheimer, Louisa Hall suggests, is part of us. We are all inadvertent liars and poor witnesses to history; for example, within the book, there are several versions of Oppenheimer’s affair with Jean Tatlock and similarly, many versions of what Oppenheimer’s inner life must have been like. But more dauntingly, we are all complicit with a program that killed 129,000 people when, according to most historians, the war had already been won – choosing later to accuse him of betrayal instead of a more horrific crime.The novel almost begs you, the reader, to examine your own beliefs about this flawed genius: did he create a weapon that ended World War II early or did he unleash Pandora’s box onto a once-innocent world? I have come to believe the latter, but each of us must decide on our own. This multi-layered and creatively-rendered novel provides fleeting glimpses – not deep dives – into Oppenheimer but its main goal is to use Oppenheimer as a mirror who reflects back to all of us. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 31, 2018","Jan 02, 2019","Dec 31, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38388579-trinity

The Farm’s target is actually capitalism gone amok. Golden Oaks, aka The Farm, is the brainchild of Mae Yu, a Harvard business grad, who launched it to provide mostly nonwhite immigrants with a path to move up the economic ladder. All they need to do is bear a baby (in a luxurious setting with everything provided for them) for the upper 1%. If they succeed, they receive a big bonus, which will take away many of their money worries.The key character, Jane, is a Filipina with a young baby of her own, and a yearning to give her child a better life. She and her roommate at The Farm, Reagan (one of the few white “Hosts”), are there for different reasons and we watch as their stories play out. There is much to love about The Farm. For one thing, after a slightly rocky beginning, the story becomes page-turning. I kept wanting to come back to it to find out “what happens next.” It’s also chilling, because it is not a far stretch to believe an enterprise like this could succeed when positioned as a “win-win.” And, it offers a fascinating look into the Filipina service culture. As someone who had a much-appreciated Filipina companion for my aged mother, the instructions verbally given to Jane by her older, more cynical cousin was a real eye-opener. The theme – the extent mothers go for their children – resonates throughout the book.It is not without flaws. The character of Mae Yu is a little one-dimensional and the epilog is non-organic to what we come to believe about her. A few of the characters could easily fall into that category too until we stop and think that it is the theme that is the driver here, not any one protagonist. For all that it has to say about wealth inequality, women’s agency over their bodies, and our lack of empathy for those who have less than we do, the book is very prescient.

But one night, she mysteriously and temporarily disappears while exploring a strange shoal. In Night Swimmers, the narrator – two decades older, now a writer with two daughters – tries to get beneath the surface about what occurred that night and beneath the surface of who Mrs. Abel really was.Sometimes we, as readers, are influenced by the book we read directly before the one we are reading now. In my case, that book was The Friend by Sigrid Nunez. Both books were kind of autobiographical with the creation of a sort of fictionalized self. Both introduce reflections from writers and philosophers (here, Rilke and Chekov and Charles Burchfield), interior musings, and a “conversation with many texts, artefacts, images and songs.” Yet in The Friend, Sigrid Nunez opens herself up, taking the emotional risks that merge the reader to her unnamed narrator; here, Peter Rock chooses distancing techniques, with his prose on a loftier and more meditative plane.Whether his creative risk-taking works or not is subjective. Some readers will find this book to be lyrical and haunting; others may believe it is murky and too slippery. There was, for me, a self-conscious quality to The Night Swimmers, as if Peter Rock were trying a little too hard to integrate his themes and connect to “The exhilaration of being in on something truly mysterious and beyond me.” My problem was that journey did not propel me into exhilaration nor did I feel as if I really understood the currents that were driving Peter Rock’s life.

The basics of the plot without spoilers: Daphne Maritch “inherits” her deceased mom’s yearbook, which is filled with notes about the 1968 class. After she decides to toss it out, it falls into the hands of a nosy, trash-diving neighbor Geneva who is determined to research the class, reveal Daphne’s mother’s juicy secrets, and turn it into a docu-drama film project. In the meantime, Daphne tries to protect her widowed father, a recent New York transplant, from the fall-out, and navigate a “friends with benefits” relationship with the handsome and young TV actor who lives across the hall.Among the problems I had was the character of Geneva, who I often wanted to slap! Although Ms. Lipman often pairs repressed and loveable heroines with flamboyant “others”, Geneva’s nosiness and lack of empathy made her someone that most people would stay a mile away from. Daphne, on the other hand, embraces her and even when she realizes her trust is misplaced, she still flies around her like a moth to a frame (for example, accompanying her to the 1968 class reunion, which can’t end well.)There are some preposterous turns of events, particularly as the book winds down.

Is it the story of the narrator Anton, who is in danger of being overshadowed by his charismatic and damaged by his late-night talk show host father, Buddy Winters? Or is it a homage to his neighbor and friend, John Lennon (yes, THAT John Lennon) who also lives at the Dakota?Tom Barbash wants the book to do both, but ultimately, I’m not sure it did. The excellence of the book comes from capturing a slice of time – 1970s New York on the upper west side – and there are scores of titillating tidbits about the many celebrities that frequented Buddy’s talk show and, of course, tidbits about John Lennon. As far as the former, I didn’t think the father-son story was developed with as many nuances as I had hoped for. Mr. Barbash wimps out a bit in delving deeply into his characters’ psyches. We see them interact together but I never viscerally sensed the emotional pain that threaded the relationship.John Lennon comes across as curiously flat. At a time when he was going through primal scream and all the fallout of his marriage to Yoko, I didn't quite buy his role as a compassionate and wizened “older brother” to Anton. There is a long subplot about John taking up sailing (with Anton and Captain Hank Halsted, his real life “sailing captain.” Again, the many psychological struggles that Lennon was coping with during that turbulent time are not delineated or explored in any depth.Granted, this is a fun book to read. Everyone from Teddy and Joan Kennedy to Johnny Carson make their appearance and it was fascinating to read about the iconic Dakota building.

And the deaths are both literal and figurative. The old way is dying as the community expands uneasily to include other ethnicities and lifestyles—Chinese, Indian, Italian, Polish, black, gay, and so forth. For most, moving here was an upward journey. But instead of a sense of achievement, many of the residents are faced with disillusionment and that sense that something’s missing. Boundaries are firmly in place—social class boundaries, racial/gender boundaries, and the boundaries that separate childhood from adolescence and adolescence from adulthood.In one of her stories, Carriannne Leung writes, “Every day presented choices to be made, who to love, who to be. Every day was a collective staring down into a deep hole of one’s own making and imagining.” Some cannot navigate that deep hole; those are the suicides. But others forge on, a little wiser, a little sadder, and in the best of cases, a little more hopeful.The characters here really sparkle—June and her best friend Josie who experience different paths to their first kiss; Darren, the son of a Jamaican mother who comes face-to-face with racism; Marilyn, a one-time spinster with a big heart who can’t help herself from stealing; Nav, an Indian boy who is struggling with his gay identity. None of these come off as stereotypes; rather, these are fleshed-out depictions of people who are authentic and aching.I would particularly recommend for those who love the Elizabeth Strout Olive Kitteridge books. In an afterword, Ms. Leung writes “…while this book refers to suicide, I hope it’s also a testament to the resilience we share when faced with the often-difficult work of living.” It is, Ms. Leung—it most certainly is....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Dec 14, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40180109-that-time-i-loved-you

I’m betting that Rachel Kushner never went to prison, but you sure wouldn’t know it from this book. It’s authentic, unflinching, and powerful. It feels like an inside view of a world that none of us hope to ever get close to.Romy Hall is the key character – a 29-year-old single woman and mother who has bought herself a lifetime ticket to Stanville Women’s Correction Facility for killing a man who has been stalking her. As a former lap dancer in the Mars Room (from which the book gets its title), her life has not been easy. Now she does what she can to get by.Her cellmates are pieces of work – Betty LaFrance, a narcissistic leg model without an ounce of conscience, Laura Lipp, who killed her own baby to get back at her man, and Conan, a trans woman who could have a target on her back. We also hear from Romy’s stalker, Doc, a sociopathic cop, and Gordan Hauser, who teaches a prison literature class. When he purchases some books for Romy – who reveals that she is a reader – she reflects: “I planned on keeping them…they were a link to the outside world. But a woman in my unit offered me shampoo and conditioner in exchange for all three…Being able to properly wash and condition my hair made me feel happy at least for an evening, in a way I had not experienced since before I was arrested…”That is the reality of Stanville and it’s not romanticized. There are transfers in the middle of the night, heinous episodes of women giving birth and immediately losing custody, frazzled public defenders, crowded bunks, jockeying for positioning. At its core, this is a story of the damned—women who never had a chance to begin with, who were often raped, beaten, betrayed, and pontificated to (“Your situation is due one-hundred percent to choices made and actions you took.”) It’s about the underbelly of America—those who were destined to enter the pipeline of prison from the day they were born.

It’s about the oft solitary act of grieving when your grief cannot be placed on a continuum (you are not the wife or the daughter yet you are still profoundly affected). It’s also about the writer’s life, the abundance of would-be self-absorbed student writers, the fluidity of love. That love is re-defined and expanded when the narrator finds herself with her deceased friend’s dog Apollo, a Great Dane (channeling Rilke, the narrator considers, “What are we, Apollo and I, if not two solitudes that protect and border and greet each other?”There are nuggets here from other writers and philosophers: Kundera, Wittgenstein, Kleist, J.M. Coetzee, J.R. Ackerley and others, interwoven seamlessly. There are, one suspects, personal interjections (the author dated Susan Sontag’s son when she was herself an aspiring writer). There is, throughout, an eschewing of the fictional form as the narration winds slowly and with detours through the never-linear grief process.It’s all written so beautifully that it belies the obvious craft that this novel non-novel had to navigate.

Billy Dunne is an artist with issues, sure, but he’s also a person who survives despite his instincts. “My instincts said to run toward the chaos.

It sets up unrealistic readers’ expectations through its labeling a “feminist dystopian bookThe Water Cure, admittedly, won’t be a book for everyone. It sets up unrealistic readers’ expectations through its labeling a “feminist dystopian book”, although arguable, it is neither.This eerie book is not The Handmaid’s Tale—forget that comparison. So what IS it then? It’s a lot of things – survivalist tale, sinister fable, exploration of inner dynamics and also an integration of two essential Shakespearian plays—King Lear and The Tempest with a little bit of Lord of the Flies thrown in for good measure.What if we circumvent the moral lessons and showcase what happens when a “brave new world” is something to be regarded in fear, not awe? The book crystallizes around three sisters—cold Grace, Lia (who is thirsty for love) and Sky, who is, perhaps the purest. Intricately connected to each other and to Mother and King, their parents, the sisters are encouraged to live in a consistent state of fear and mistrust. Men, in particular, are ominous creatures to be avoided at all costs. So when three men and a boy are washed up on their shore, the sisters, one of whom is thirsty for the simple act of being touched, are ill-equipped to understand them or navigate the feelings surrounding desire.Since most of the book is narrated by Lia (with the other two sisters adding their voices), it is hard to decipher whether the book is truly dystopian or survivalist. The sisters’ eccentric parents force them to undergo painful rituals that include violent purification games—akin to waterboarding—and the torture of mice, frogs, and each other. They are, for all intents and purposes, “three branches of the same tree, three girls intertwined.” Curiosity and individuality is suppressed and attachment to people or things are sublimated. At one point, one of the sisters reflects,” I have always believed our home to be an island. A healing place, untouched, something skipped over and forgotten”Of course, it is nothing of the sort. Their mother spoons out cruelty and kindness in the same action but most of all, she leaves her daughters feeling both strong and very vulnerable. They do not develop healthy thinking and feeling mechanisms. And all of this plays out when the men “invade” their island.

Tim Murphy’s Christodora is an excellent example of a haunting novel that captures AIDS devastation and enduring legacy. But Tim Murphy is a white, male New Yorker who reported on HIV/AIDS for 20 years. I wondered: what would Rebecca Makkai, who is a straight Chicagoan and was very young at the height of the epidemic have to add to the wealth of literature already out there? As it turns out, quite a bit. I was astounded at the power of this novel and at the emotions I felt towards her characters. The story is told from two time frames: the height of the epidemic in Chicago mid-1980s and 30 years later in Paris. In the first narrative, Yale, a Northwestern University museum fundraising director, is dealing with massive losses of friends to AIDS at the same time he is on the precipice of acquiring an art collection that will propel the reputation of his respected but small museum. In successive chapters, we meet Fiona, the sister of Yale’s friend Nico who dies early in the book, who has never overcome the AIDS holocaust and is trying to locate her estranged daughter.By focusing on AIDS in the heartland, Rebecca Makkai accomplishes something unique in AIDS literature: takes the focus away from the east and the west coast and showcases how AIDS ravages the smaller gay community in my hometown. For a Chicagoan, the book is particularly revelatory; the long-gone Chicago places of 1985 and 1986 are meticulously resurrected, demonstrating a passion on the author’s part to “get things right.”The characters – well, the characters could just walk off the pages and the insights are sublime. One of the characters says, “I think that’s the saddest thing in the world, the failure of love. Not hatred, but the failure of love.” By concentrating on the love and connection between characters rather than solely on the tragedy, the horror of the epidemic becomes even more real. When one character whom I had grown to love is found to have the AIDS virus, I shed real tears, feeling the impact of the loss. It takes a really great author to accomplish that in a reader.Whenever an author attempts to tell dual stories, he or she runs the risk of one overshadowing the other. Indeed, the 1980s narrative is the more compelling. Even so, Rebecca Makkai integrates her themes. In twinning the acquisition of the art collection from an elderly artist’s muse, this is said: “The war made us older than our parents. And when you’re older than your parents, what are you going to do? Who’s going to show you how to live?” Using the metaphor of AIDS as a war, it, too, decimated an entire generation and forced them to live on their own terms. The circle closes in on the Paris excerpts, when we view how the legacy of AIDS has never really left us, despite advances.I loved this book, which is, ultimately, about the struggle to love and connect amidst the chaos of the height of the AIDS era and in modern times. At a time when many authors are being accused of appropriation, this book should lay to rest that issue; ultimately, it is the voice and the story that matter....more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,"Nov 15, 2018","Nov 22, 2018","Nov 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36739329-the-great-believers

Like so many, shWe don’t know much about Aden Grace Sawyer, the 18-year-old Californian who is passionate about connecting with fundamentalist Islam. Like so many, she is a blank state looking in all the wrong places for meaning.We do know this—she is the daughter of a mother who is an alcoholic and a philandering Islam scholar father who is an Islam scholar and is seeking a connection to—something. As a result, not unlike Isaac Bashevis Singer’s Yentl the Yeshiva Boy, she disguises herself as a boy and flies to Pakistan with a would-be boyfriend to immerse herself in the study of Islam. It is the suffering and the sacrificial glory that attracts her the most. Early on, a mullah sees right through her: “The faith I follow is one that raises humility above all other virtues…And there is no humility in the righteous self-love of the mujahid. There is no modesty in it no denial of desire, no compassion, no restraint. But of course, such virtues hold no attraction for the young. Especially those for whom war is but a fairy story. To such young men inaction is the greatest of sins.”We know—or believe we know—where this story is headed: the zeal of the “true believer”, the uncompromising view of the world, the military training, followed by either the abnegation of self or mounting disillusionment. In the hands of a lesser writer, this could all become overly predictable particularly with its gender-swapping plot. But John Wray is a fine writer and does not fall into the usual pitfalls.Mr. Wray has obviously done quite a lot of research into the theology as well as the allures of this complex religion and scenes and dialogue unfold organically. His desire to provide an authentic reckoning sometimes gets in the way of forward momentum. Without a clearer understanding of Aden’s motivations and back story, it is difficult to fully understand her immersion into this fundamentalist sect. As she increasingly becomes involved in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border fighting, we lose remaining threads of the character’s interiority.

Not just good but heart-pounding, stomach-dropping, page-turning good. I would expect nothing less from Peter Heller, who enthralled me with The Dog Stars and The Painters. This time, he tackles the Canadian wilderness – a challenging canoe trip on the Maskwa River meticulously planned by best friends Jack and Wynn. Both are adventurous, easy-going, very self-sufficient, and literate. But as the trip progresses, we also learn the differences. Jack is rugged, pragmatic, and intuitive, with a heartbreaking back-story. Wynn, the “gentle giant”, is more emotionally driven, preferring to believe the best of the world and the people who inhabit it.And then their friendship and their core concepts of life are tested as a result of an out-of-control wildfire, a potential murderer, and an unexpected canoe passenger. Relying on each other and on their personal instincts, they must struggle to survive.As in the past, nature plays its own role and it often overshadows the characters – in a good way. Peter Heller is a natural in describing nature and placing his readers right in the action. For instance, he writes about Jack, “The implacability and violence of nature always awed him. That it could be entirely heedless and yet so beautiful. That awed him. But also its intricate intelligence. Its balancing. Its quiet compensations. It was like some unnamed justice permeated everything.”Through his words, you can almost feel the wind, dense with sparks and flying debris, taste the plump blueberries, hear the burning wood flailing, sense the fog closing in. It is this ability to channel the majesty of nature that separates The River from other wilderness survival narratives. It owes a bit of debt to Deliverance and wisely, there are references to that James Dickey work. Just as I did with Dog Stars – one of my very favorite contemporary books – I closed The River feeling awed and humbled and heartbroken and hopeful. That’s a lot for a writer to achieve in a reader.

The hit-and-run death of Moroccan diner owner Driss Guerraoui, creating seismic waves that introduce us to a cast of characters with his single daughter, Nora, a struggling composer at the center of it.All the main characters are American outsiders – the Moroccan Guerraoi family (Driss, his wife Maryam, Nora, and her sister Salma), a traumatized Iraqi veteran Jeremy who offers Nora intimacy, Anderson and his son A.J. who own the next-door bowling alley and haven’t been able to take hold of the American Dream, a black detective Erica Coleman who has not escaped racist slurs, and so on.

Certainly, Laila Lalami is a very good writer and her theme couldn’t be more appropriate.And yet. Part of it is that the chorus of nine alternating voices, which take turns in narrating the book, become indistinguishable. There is a deadened or toneless quality to the narration as one after the other of the narrators “takes the stage”, each sounding very much like the one before.Moreover, the potency of this powerful theme – for me – never reaches full boil. I’ve come across these characters before: the “lost” daughter who chooses to deviate from traditional familial expectations, the veteran who can’t leave the traumas of wartime behind, the police detective with her own family issues who must prove herself, and so forth. I could pretty much predict the path their journey would take.

The premise has instant promise: the middle of a trio of brothers, Cameron Bright, has died under an unforgiving Aussie desert sun, not far from a functioning car stacked with supplies. His two brothers, Nathan and Bub, feel compelled to piece together what went wrong. They don’t believe for a minute that Cameron, seasoned in the art of survival, is dead by accident.Little by little, the story is revealed, as we gain greater insights into the three brothers, the people who are important to them, their hopes and fears, and the fraught dynamics among them. Gradually, the characters become so real they could leap off the pages. The remote Australian outback becomes alive as its own “character” and the scorching heat, near-isolation and strict set of social rules is palpable; the book positively radiates atmosphere.Jane Harper, like a master surgeon, pulls away at the layers and defenses that shield each of these characters along with ancillary ones. Unflinchingly, their limitations and anguish are exposed. It is this – the deep psychological insights is what kept me absorbed and rapidly turning pages.I will add this: I was not a big fan of The Dry and tend to avoid detective procedural novels.

Their two daughters, Edith and Mae, are suddenly forced to live with Dennis after Marianne’s act of desperation. As readers, we are privy to the alternating views of the headstrong Edith, who only wishes to return to her mentally ill mother, and her dreamy younger sister Mae, who bears an uncanny resemblance to her mother and is drawn to her father. Between these narratives are the voices from ancillary characters, who provide perspective, fill in the blanks for the reader, and serve as a Greek chorus.It is easy to provide spoilers, which I do not wish to do. I will say this: Mae’s trajectory is piercingly original and totally riveting. I found myself racing through interceding pages to get back to Mae’s narrative, which contains a power that is skin to Kathryn Harrison’s excellent book Exposure. I did not feel quite as connected to Edie’s part. One of the reasons is a personal quirk: when an author introduces a stuttering character, it is best to simply present that the character is a stutterer instead of consistently using prose like, “He says, no she wasn’t b-b-b-beautiful”, which provides undue attention to a secondary character. Edie’s tale was needed to contrast to Mae’s but it paled in power next to it.The chorus of voices also was not very differentiated. I get it: it is “background noise” for the orations of the two main characters. But I think of Tomas Gonzelez’s book The Storm, which used a similar conceit to much stronger effect.These criticisms may imply that I did not like the book and that would not be truthful.

It’s page-turning and immersing.Brodie experiences both an internal and external journey after falling under the spell of a Russian soprano, Lika Bloom, who happens to already be in a relationship with “the Irish Liszt”, a prodigious piano player named John Kilbarron who is managed by his sinister brother Malachi. His passion for her will take him from Scotland to Paris to St. Petersburg and to the Andaman islands.Throughout, there are hints of Chekhov – one of his most famous short stories “The Lady with the Little Dog”, the name Lika (in Googling that name, I discovered that Chekhov was also passionate about a singer named Chekhov), the Russian overtones. I suspect there are even more references that I overlooked, having read some of Chekhov years ago.The title, Love is Blind, offers yet more layers. Brodie is, indeed, near-blind—he can’t see well at all without both the lenses in his Franklin spectacles. It’s a metaphor, of course, that the reader must take care not to trust Brodie’s “vision” of events. Add to that the fact that Brodie suffers from tuberculosis and is under the hand of the ticking clock and the tension is riveted up even higher.Each of William Boyd’s fans—and I am one of them—will have his or her own favorites. I have loved Any Human Heart and the more recent Waiting for Sunrise.

Michael and Caitlin, two lovers in their late 40s, escape their tedious marriages to revel in each other on a monthly basis. Michael, a fastidious salesman, experienced tragedy early in his marriage; Caitlin, a writer, subsists with a seemingly good husband who may have had his dalliances. These regular trysts are what keeps them going.The author is a master wordsmith and in dissecting the several hours that Michael and Caitlin share on a cold January afternoon, we get a clear sense of their interactions—their aging bodies, their “survival fueled on denial and made bearable by meeting once a month to pleasure in lighting one another’s fuses, that four week integer tried and tested to perfection in their game of lust gap enough to hone the appetite to aching, to hold excitement at a dizzying height.”The descriptions of the repeated physical connections—at first luminous—begin to feel repetitive and I suspect deliberately so. The acceptance of the aging process (Michael now carries an excess of weight and his stomach pummels her during lovemaking) is objectively displayed. These are two people who know each other’s imperfections and provide a safe haven. But like any affair, theirs is now at a crossroads, due to external factors on each of their sides. A question looms through this book: what do they have a right to choose?As decisions loom, time is slowed down and each detail becomes intensely described, which is one of the beauties of Billy O’Callaghan’s writing. Although the author refuses to judge his characters, the reader may see differently. “Love…is the story we make up to justify all the rotten things we do,” Caitlin says. Is that, indeed, the definition of love? Or is it the inertia and lack of courage that keeps them tied to dying marriages?

It’s that bitClosing the last page of Theory of Bastards is almost like arriving back home after being immersed in another culture for days or weeks. It’s that bittersweet. I hardly know how to do justice to it.Imagine taking Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel, combining it with We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler and Falling to Earth by Kate Southwood, and then blending it into its own unique and riveting narrative that explores the inner lives of its characters. That only scratches at the surface of what Theory of Bastards is all about.It’s about Frankie Burke, an evolutionary psychologist in her 30s who has lived with the debilitating effects of stage four endometriosis, which have stunted her relationships with others and caused her to understand pain at its most intimate levels. Upon arriving at The Foundation—a zoo-like research institute—Frankie is coupled with Stotts, a laconic, capable, and very married military veteran who is studying primates’ tool usage. He is asked to assist Frankie on her research into the bonobos, testing her theory that women cheat on men because those offspring that are the result of extramarital affairs end up with evolutionary advantages.It’s about the blurring of the difference between humans and other higher forms of animal life. The bonobos are peaceful species, headed by an alpha female and armed with the intelligence of an average four-year-old. Each of the bonobos is differentiated and ultimately, they come alive as much as Frankie and Stotts do.It’s about the dangers of overreliance on technology. Theory of Bastards has a seamless dystopian under-story. Each person is implanted with an advanced form of the web, called The Quark, which can be accessed through a forehead device called Bindi. It is not a stretch to figure out that the technological future and the rich and unknown past will end up clashing.But mostly, it’s about how love thrives across and within the animal kingdom, which includes human animals. Audrey Schulman writes, “Civilization is based upon a charade, such careful theater. Each of us buttoning up our costumes, hiding our fur, living in carefully sculpted sets, while we pretend we’ve never pooped or had coitus.

In Sally Rooney’s sophomore book, two of these normal wannabes come from small town Carricklea—Marianne, a clever, quixotic, not very cool loner and Connell, the working-class popular kid whose mother cleans house for Marianne’s mother.The novel is a character study of the two, a dissection of the very meaning of love, an observation of how quickly things change and how difficult it is for things to come together. The reader can see that Marianne and Connell are good for each other but they keep getting in their own way with absurd quarrels and even more absurd other partners. Consider this line about Connell: “He and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronization that it surprises them both.” The novel is filled with little gems like that, each succinctly revealing a little more about these (it appears) star-crossed lovers.As in her sublime Conversations with Friends, Sally Rooney does not shy away from the truth of her characters or whitewash her scenes. Marianne willingly lets – even encourages – Connell to explore her body, only to sense his shame in letting his school chums know that they are “an item.” Marianne excels at Trinity College in Dublin where Connell is the quaint working-class scholarship case And there continues to be a danse a deux – coming together, pulling apart, almost making it, crashing away, and on and on it goes.

From her childhood in Iran when she and her boyfriend—later husband—were budding revolutionaries to later on as refugees to Sweden, Nahid has experienced more than her share of loss. Now in mid-life and diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer, Nahid looks back unsparingly at the times that have formed the person she is in gut-wrenching detail.Through her memories, a real person emerges, shorn of the sentimentality that usually surrounds a woman whose life is being cut short. We learn that she is and has been a demanding and often abrasive mother to her daughter, Aram, whom she loves fiercely and yet emotionally abuses. We discover that she can betray if necessary, and that she can survive even when she’s counted out. There are some fine scenes that center on motherhood – her own and her mother’s – as well as what it means to actually find peace.Those who judge their characters by “likeability” might have a hard time with the complexity of Nahid. She is, in turns, enraged, cruel, pity-filled, strong, weak, and honest. The prose itself moves forward with machine-like precision.

Putting myself in the head of a disgruntled millennial who blames the Baby Boomers for the poor job market took some getting used to. But once I bought into the concept, I thought the book was brilliant.It’s narrated from three perspectives—Mark Brumfeld, whose life isn’t turning out the way he thought it would, his love interest Cassie, a bluegrass bassist who discovers a hidden talent for editing native content in social media, and Mark’s mother Julia, a one-time (dare we say?) hippie who is now a suburban wife and mother. Mark—aka Isaac Abramson aka Boomer1—moves into his mom’s basement and creates a series of videos advocating the forceful retirement of boomers, ending with: “Resist much, obey little. Propaganda by the deed. Boom boom.”There is true hilarity here in the targeting of boomer icons (Oprah, anyone?) But Daniel Torday does not let his narrative dissolve into slapstick. Despite the absurd plot, these are believable characters who could easily be perceived as existing in the real world. The emotions and milieu of the today—seeking a scapegoat for one’s own failings, getting lost in the Internet culture, having one foot firmly planted in what is expected of us and the other wavering into unexplored ground of what we really want to do—all this is mined here. Millennial cynicism and ennui clashes with boomer self-righteousness. And it’s all great fun. Except when it isn’t. There is a yearning in these put-upon characters and, if there is not generational domestic terrorism, there is at least generational envy and resentment. The book has a lot to say and it says it well. Don’t expect a fast read but do expect an enlightening one.

There are Entering into a Tomas Gonzalez novel requires surrendering all five of your senses to the mounting tensions of a masterfully-executed plot. There are hints here—I suspect, deliberate—of King Lear and of The Old Man and the Sea and perhaps even Odysseus. Yet this slim novel, expertly translated by Andrea Rosenberg, claims its own territory.Set in a Colombian seaside village—the poorer man’s version of Cartagena—a hotel proprietor filled with hubris and arrogance browbeats his twin adult sons to go sea fishing despite the probable emergence of a storm. The twins are dual sides of each other; Mario is destructive and handy, and Javier is more bookish and pragmatic. Both hate their father with a passion and do possess an allegiance to their mother, Nora, who suffers from hallucinations and insanity.Narrated in third person and also in first person through a Greek chorus of tourists who remain on shore, we—the readers—see how the storm builds, both externally and internally, as the hours move inexorably forward. The raging and deluded king-like father is no match for the forces that gather to tear him down, in the person of his sons and in the gathering force of the storm. As in his former book, In The Beginning Was the Sea, the key theme—that those who live in a world of hubris and try to thwart nature are destined to fall—is mined here.

Are we elevated from the rest of the animal species by our conscience and our ability to feel compassion? Or are we the most selfish and dangerous predators that ever lived, destined to eventually become extinct? This intelligently-written, page-turning novel provides no easy answers but it does provide much food for thought. Four siblings—Darlene, Tucker, Jane and little Cora become orphans at the start of the book, when a Category 5 tornado wipes out everything they have, turning them into the Saddest Family in Mercy, Oklahoma. Only Tucker believes that the tornado has provided him with the gift of insight. We quickly learn that Tucker becomes an extreme animal activist, liberating animals from deplorable conditions and becoming their avenger. On the lam, he convinces his nine-year-old sister Cora—who has missed him desperately— to join him in his quixotic quest. And here is where the plot truly takes hold.The plot twists of this novel are organic and heartbreaking and I do not wish to spoil them for other readers. I will, instead, concentrate on the themes, which elevate this novel to one of my top books of the year. Abby Geni performs the amazing feat of having us sympathize with Tucker’s goals—to treat other animal species with respect and dignity—while cringing from his methods and his lack of understanding that animals must be true to their own nature. Trapped between the human and the animal world, Tucker does not truly understand either, and puts both worlds at risk.What are the Wildlands? Tucker describes it this way: “The old ecosystem was gone. Humans had destroyed it. The Wildlands were something new. ‘Unfit for cultivation.’ That means no people, no civilization. Wild and Tame and Domesticated and Feral—any living thing without a place on the food chain—all the outliers found their way there. All the lost and lonely animals went to the Wildlands.”What does it mean to be “a creature out of place and out of sync?” How does any outlier—human or animal—adapt to life with all its uncertainties and all its marvels?

In exploring three generations of women, the question that arises is this: is it possible to break free from one’s family and cast off its legacy of unhappy women?For Grace, who literally renames herself from her given name of Patti (Grace is her middle name), living on one’s own terms is worth a try. Her grandmother, Evelyn, married a stodgy professor on the law school faculty during war time—not the most harmonious alignment. That marriage led to two children, including her only daughter, Laura, who subsequently falls into a misaligned marriage of her own and also begets two children, Grace and Michael.Grace is underemployed in a local health food store; her brother Michael, a wannabe musician and drug addict. As Grace struggles to keep her family afloat, will she end up losing herself? Will she, indeed, find the grace to fit into her family structure without being pulled into the destructive orbit of her oppressive family?In sharing the stories of these women —separately and together—A Cloud in the Shape of a Girl really shares the story of what it is like to be a woman, the things we yearn for, the things we cast ourselves against, the ways we undermine ourselves by our sense of duty to husbands, brothers, and society in general.

I was hooked by page one and read this book straight through in two sittings.It starts with a college student who, mysteriously, falls into a deep REM-type sleep; she can’t be roused. The disorder spreads to the dorm floor…then the college…and soon, the entire town of Santa Lora. But what is this exotic illness? How do you try to live “ordinary” lives in extraordinary times?In her aftermath, Karen Thompson Walker says, “Dreams can be tricky in fiction…Dreams have a kind of randomness that can be unsatisfying…”, so she makes the wise choice to not dwell much on what the dreams are and uses it as a tool to explore the unknowable. Are dreams a conduit connecting the past and the future? Are they a way to work out issues that remain hidden?The Dreamers is elevated above typical dystopian or horror fiction in many important ways. First, Karen Thompson Walker creates characters we believe in and are invested in, in different stages of life. Through them, we enter this fantastical state. As importantly, she does not shy away from using the premise of her book to explore fascinating questions: how do we live truly ethically in the midst of a dream that for family members, seems like a nightmare? What happens when a rigid code of ethics bumps against pesky emotions? How can we identify ways to make life feel newly miraculous even when it suddenly seems fragile and even senseless?

You guys are the best!I’ve read most of Barbara Kingsolver’s books and the one thing I learned a while back is that you don’t go into her books without expecting a strong point of view. In an accompanying letter, Ms. Kingsolver writes, “What I know for sure is that stories will get us through times of no leadership, better than leaders will get us through times with no stories.” So, if you are a big supporter of Trump’s legitimizing of personal greed as the principal religion of our country or if you believe that Charles Darwin is the devil himself, this is NOT a book you want to pick up. Just sayin’.To my mind, this is Ms. Kingsolver’s best work since Poisonwood Bible, and that’s saying a lot. In alternating chapters, Barbara Kingsolver addresses a present-day situation—Willa Knox, her professor husband Iano with his non-tenured one-year assignment, her cantankerous conservative Greek father-in-law, her free-spirited daughter Tig and her son Zeke and his infant baby—are living on the edge.Their house is dilapidated and falling down. That’s a metaphor, folks. In researching the house’s past, Willa discovers a fascinating story of former inhabitant and science teacher Thatcher Greenwood, who was treated with disdain because of his wish to teach his students Darwin’s theory of evolution. This fictional character befriends a real-life biologist named Mary Treat, and the merging of fact and fiction is excellently rendered.What does it mean to be unsheltered? The answer: “To stand in the clear day of light.” Being unsheltered is having the courage to see what’s really going on right in front of your eyes without religious homilies and without illusions or the trappings of excess materialism. It is the parable of Mr. Occam’s Razor – recognizing that the most evident explanation is very likely the simplest one.Had Ms. Kingsolver developed this into a screed, I would have been less enchanted. But the conversations between characters seem organic. Each of us know the impassioned millennial who tell us that “all the rules are changed and it’s hard to watch people keep carrying on just the same…” All of us know the irascible father-in-law clinging to hateful biases or the parents who just want life to be a little better for their children.

And if that sounds complicated – well, it isn’t. It all works together beautifully and the book seems eminently credible, even when it’s pushing the limits of fantasy.So here are the “bones” of the story: a millennial named Candace Chen has fallen into a monotonous job, coordinating the production of Bibles with China-based sources. After work, she and her boyfriend Jonathan watch movies in his shoddy apartment. Into this numbing routine comes the Shen Fever, a fungal infection that threatens – and then nearly succeeds – in wiping out the entire population of New York and indeed, much of the globe.Candace hooks up with a foraging group of survivors, headed by a controlling leader named Bob. They make do by foraging for goods in abandoned houses (or houses with fevered inhabitants) and in chain stores. But Candace is holding back a secret.Ling Ma is a natural story-teller. The book sparkles with intriguing set-ups and an original premise that doesn’t put all its eggs in the dystopian basket. There is a palpable sense of suspense, a deep feeling of nostalgia, and an undercurrent of over-the-top capitalism hilarity. I have discovered that the author has written what she knows: like Candace, she is a first-generation immigrant who once worked in Bible production and later at Playboy headquarters.

Alison dangles the carrot and Marty bites—without really planning to, he tumbles into exchanging what he perceives as harmless information and then directly the world of espionage. But when Marty is called upon to help capture the Irish Republican Army mastermind, who just happens to be his first cousin and childhood pal, the stakes begin to escalate.There are many twists and turns in this book and so I’ll provide no more about plot. Suffice to say that the book’s underpinnings are not truly locked in the espionage genre—it is the psychological insights that drive it. Many themes become apparent: how do our childhoods shape the people we become? What creates true value in life one’s life? Where do our allegiances really lie—with those we love now, with those who have formed us, or with the potential of what we can become? What happens when conscience and patriotism end up colliding?Those who enjoy linear books—I am not one of them—should know that this book shifts back and forth in time, enlightening us about pivotal moments that have influenced Marty into being the man he is today. This, for me, was a compelling read—all the more compelling when I found out later that Peter Cunningham’s own father acted as s spy on potential IRA plots years ago....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 08, 2018","Aug 11, 2018","Aug 08, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35694088-acts-of-allegiance

But oh, there is a lot of power packed within those pages.At the end of WW II, our nameless Dutch narrator is trudging along some nameless territory, searching for booby traps when he happens across an abandoned house. He muses, “I realized that this would be the first time in a very long while that I had d a real house, a genuine home. I had slept in prisons, in barracks, on straw in classrooms, once under a truck, in haystacks, in good wagons.” The house seems quaint and odd after his senseless existence, but he quickly removes his uniform, dons the clothes of the owners, and makes himself at home. And then a German colonel arrives, mistaking him for the home’s owner and politely asking to billet his soldiers there. I’ll take the plot no further but I will say this: the book elevates the absurdism that follows to an apex of horror and destruction, contrasting the refuge of the home with the craziness of murderous men coping with the senselessness and soul-killing reality of war. Do not expect a redemptive war tale; this little book is stark and its vision is dark. It delivers a powerful punch to the plexus in its embracing of meaningless cruelty. Not a word is wasted. An afterword by Cees Nooteboom refers to the book as a “sadistic universe that offers no room for escape.” The power of this book makes me curious to learn more about Willem Frederik Hermans and his works....more",Notes are private!,0,12,2,not setnot set,not setnot set,"Aug 08, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40725560-an-untouched-house

Yet, it all works.Briefly, a look at the plot: a 12-year-old slave named George Washington Black (nicknamed Wash) , by a streak of fortune, falls under the protection of the cruel owner’s brother, Christopher (Titch) Wilde, who is far more enlightened with a scientific bend. After a nail-biting plot twist, the two end up in the heart of the frozen Arctic and eventually, Wash’s travels take him to places near and far. There are surprises along the way and characters that we thought we had seen the last of who pop up in unexpected places. To say much more, I think, would constitute a spoiler (and there are spoilers galore on this book out there.) If the book has a theme and a motto, it would be the words of Titch to Wash, who early on reveals himself to be a meticulous artist: “Be faithful to what you see, and not what you are supposed to see.” The quintessential question becomes: who is Wash, anyway? Someone to be exploited? Someone to be saved? Or perhaps someone who is in a constant journey of self-discovery, recognizing, ultimately, that “life had never belonged to any of us…we had been estranged from the potential of our own bodies, from the revelation of everything our bodies and minds could accomplish.” Therein lies the tragedy—and the majesty—of Esi Edugyan’s book....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jul 29, 2018","Aug 03, 2018","Jul 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38140077-washington-black

The answer, of “Where do you get your ideas?” What writer hasn’t been tortured by being forced to confront and answer this question at book readings? The answer, of course, is that no one knows where they come from and perhaps nobody should know. In his latest novel, the supremely talented John Boyne DOES answer this question through a most unsavory character, Maurice Swift, who might have said this: “I get my ideas from plagiarizing and killing the source if it will help me climb the ladder of my ambition.”Maurice is a virtual Adonis, fluid in his sexuality, yet interested in literary conquests, not physical ones. He launches his career in spectacular fashion, stealing the story of his mentor and benefactor. His narcissistic ego demands constant satiating and his hunger for recognition drives him to negate anyone who may be a threat.John Boyne is being playful here and it is in this playfulness that I almost lost my way. It’s easy, at first, to believe that the book is about the analysis of a narcissist (think: Talented Mr. Ripley) who will stop at nothing to succeed. After a while, I could guess what Maurice’s next move would be. But actually, the book is meant to be a spoof on the literary world and one man’s desire to pursue fame and glory at all costs. There are delightful literary allusions—for example, Maurice’s interactions with Gore Vidal are worth the entire price of admission.Eventually, I fell under the spell of A Ladder To The Sky and to the devilish talent of John Boyne. It’s a fun read and also a satirical tale of how overriding ambition precedes a fall. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Aug 15, 2018","Aug 21, 2018","Jul 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40400269-a-ladder-to-the-sky

Virgil Wander – a middle-aged man who is the proprietor of the Empress Theater – is a microcosm of his small and failing Greenstone, Minnesota town, “cruising at medium altitude, aspiring vaguely to decency…moderate in all things including romantic forays.”And so it might have gone if two things hadn’t happened: Virgil’s heartbroken Pontiac breaches a safety barrier, tumbling into Lake Superior with him inside it. AND a kite-flying stranger named Rune shows up in town in search of his mythical baseball hero son who vanished mysteriously in an airplane.As the book opens, Virgil is recovering from a traumatic brain injury with its resultant loss of words (particularly adjectives) and mild hallucinations but he is recovering. As his passion for life begins to reignite, so does that of his disenchanted hometown.Enchantment abounds: Rune and his quixotic quest to understand his lost son and bond with the grandson he never knew he had…a down-and-out 10-year-old named Galen who tries to extract revenge on a near-mythical fish…a scandalous hometown son, Adam Leer, with a trail of rumors preceding him, who may or may not be everything people suspect he is…and a loser named Jerry who may be past redemption. These are just some of the characters who surround Virgil (who, like his Roman namesake, is a chronicler who knew the “tears in things.”)I found the book enchanting, with just the right message for today’s times: that a little bit of magic is never quite out of sight and that all of us (well, maybe most of us) struggle and experience redemption.

All of the stories are well-crafted and fun, and a couple of them are extraordinary. The eponymous first story, The Wrong Heaven, is a totally irreverent rift of Jesus and Mary lawn statues from Papa’s Plastics who chatter and reproach and become increasingly bullying. Obviously, the story isn’t for everyone but I laughed out loud.The second, entitled Horse, can be summed up in these sentences: “We have different goals. Serena wants to become a mother. I want to become a horse.” The narrator enters a scientific study to actually metamorphize a horse, which “requires bravery. Our hope is that the Centaurides living among us will be viewed not as freaks or as failures but as emblems of courage: female animals who gathered up all the uncertainties of their existence into one single, massive risk.”There are other great stories too – Doris and Katie, a surprisingly poignant look into the relationship between two old friends who may soon be forced to part. Or Alternate, a young woman chosen as an alternate to dine with Obama during the campaign, who is coping with her own definition of what “change” is all about. Or A Room to Live in”, where a female sculptor carves two young children from imported Tahitian balsa wood—and must hide from her husband that they have come alive.There is a lot here that deals with the theme of creation – how we create and recreate ourselves, how we create others, and how sometimes, we serve as our own gods.

I belonged to it.”Gael Faye, born to a French father and Rwandan mother, surely lived with this story, which is about how the banal face of everyday existence, as delineated by a senseless war, lays waste to what is left of childhood.In senseless genocides, the “players” always change and in this case, it’s between two ethnic groups – the Hutus who are “short with wide noses” and the Tutsi who are tall and skinny with long noses.” For young Gaby—and for his father, who explains the difference to him—it all boils down to that. Both Tutsis and Hutus have the same country speak the same language worship the same deity, and yet the Hutus are intent on annihilating the Tutsis.In accessible language that often soars to poetry, Gael Faye first lets up Burundi through the eyes of a boy who has not yet reached his teenage years – stealing mangos from an unsuspecting neighbor, coming of age in a lush country with warm tropical nights, riding his BMX bike and dining on crocodile meat.But storm clouds are gathering and one of the greatest horrors of recent years is about to unfold. What should have been a rather typical coming-of-age narrative takes on whole new meaning as Gaby is robbed of his childhood and his innocence.

The subject matter is fascinating: two real-life young women, Suzanne Halberde and Lucie Schwob, refuse to be tied down to gender identification and expectations.

I have little doubt that Mr. Thomson researched Claude and Marcel and the time period mightily, but I couldn’t help but wish that he had listened more to his muse and liberated them from the cold facts that comprise their background.

Yet, love is something we rarely engage with intellectually. We all experience falling in love but take little or no interest in how it works.”Frank Tallis, a British clinical psychologist, takes upon himself the onerous task of discovering how love works when madness and/or desire take over. Dr. Tallis looks at this topic from all angles – from inappropriate attachment to love addiction, from obsessive jealousy to pedophilia and narcissus. Some of the tales are haunting: the woman with de Clerambault’s syndrome who becomes totally obsessed with her dentist, becoming a factor in his fleeing to Dubai…the beautiful interior designer whose extreme and unwarranted jealousy drives her loved one to distraction…the successful man in mid-career who squanders his fortune on over 3,000 prostitutes …the dowdy widow whose relationship with her loved one was based on an all-encompassing desire for physical intimacy.The stories turn us into voyeurs-of-sorts, peeking over the psychologist’s shoulder. Dr. Tallis tempers that feeling by divulging information from the history of the art and science of psychology – from Sigmund Freud’s famous case history off Anna O to the background of demonic possession to various DSIM diagnoses and how they came to be. He obviously has his mass audience in mind—do not expect more than a cursory look at the theories of psychology. At times, Dr. Tallis strays from his chosen focus: we learn, for example, anecdotes from his own life and are privy to tales that seem less about love addiction and more about dysfunction in general. The parts, in this case, are more intriguing than the whole. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 09, 2018","Jul 10, 2018","Jul 09, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/37955663-the-incurable-romantic-and-other-tales-of-madness-and-desire

Those who love Anne Tyler—and I do—will rejoice in all the familiar nuances of her oeuvre: eccentric yet familiar characters, baffling children, happened-upon marriages, the Baltimore setting and the dichotomy between confinement and freedom, security and self-worth.In Clock Dance—another quixotic novel about self-discovery in later years—Anne Tyler introduces Willa, whose defining moment range from her erratic mother’s bolting from the house, her marriage proposal at a young age, and much later in life, a surprise phone call regarding her son’s discarded and temporarily hospitalized girlfriend and the nine-year-old daughter that the neighbor assumes is her granddaughter.What follows is a familiar ecosystem of zany friends and neighbors as Willa begins to slowly recognize some self-truths. The biggest challenge she faces is how to embrace the possibilities of her life that has been too often defined for her. What would Willa’s own clock dance look like? “…hers would feature a woman racing across the stage from left to right, all the while madly whirling so that the audience saw only a spinning blur of color before she vanished into the wings, pouf!

Really good war literature (and I’m thinking of Kevin Powers’ The Yellow Birds, for example) are about the psychic scarring of those who participate in wars and what it does to one’s moral core.The Winter Soldier is that kind of book—plot-driven, for the most part, but also insightful in its focus on what happens to those who pay witness to the war as medics and nurses. Well-to-do Viennese-born medical student, Lucius Krzelewski, is sent to the field hospital in Lemnowice in eastern Europe at the start of World War I. Woefully unprepared for what he finds, he is assisted in his ministrations by a feisty nun named Margarete, who schools him in the real-world amputations and typhoid cases he encounters. Any observant reader will know that a love affair will soon ensue.Lucius is particularly intrigued by those who suffer psychically (PTSD has not been defined quite yet, but he knows the mind is playing tricks on some soldiers). After a slow boil, the plot heats u immensely when they are compelled to treat a damaged soldier with shell shock. The soldier is very much a character but also a symbol (Lucius eventually muses, ‘Now, with each day that passes, I feel more and more like some of my soldiers, who seemed forever stuck in their eternal winter.”)Every step of the way, Daniel Mason immerses the reader in the ravages of war: the lack of supplies, the botched-up operations and chain of commands, the barely-functioning operating rooms, the lice (I dare you not to itch at some of the descriptions), the woefully inadequate medicines of over a century ago. Within this tableau, he introduces readers to universal questions: how does one move on from internal battles once the external battles cease? What does it take to atone and forgive oneself?

But is Melmoth real? Or is she us?In The Essex Serpent, surely one of my favorite contemporary books of all time, Sarah Perry explored the chasm between faith and rationality, focusing on whether faith is a form of antique superstition. That book was enchanting and ultimately uplifting; this one decidedly is not. Although the theme is similar, Ms. Perry plunges the reader into a world of despair, from an Ottomon bureaucrat who eschews his moral obligation in World War I to a jealous child who betrays his friends in World War II to—in a prescient move—the demonization of the refugee. The reader cannot help but sense the tendrils of Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Daphne du Maurier or Henry James in the grim atmospheric settings and the intensified feeling of foreboding. The bulwark of the book is the meek Helen Franklin, an English translator residing in modern day Prague, who is the recipient of a disturbing document and who ultimately begins to believe she is in Melmoth’s crosshairs. We know she has somehow sinned but we don’t know how.And so the book functions as an outstanding addition to Gothic literature that chafes against realism. Yet it also – and for me, more rewardingly – is a sort of morality tale. As one character states: “There is no Melmoth, there is nobody watching, there is only us. And if there is only us, we must do what Melmoth would do: we must be seen – bear witness to what must not be forgotten.” It makes each of us peer into our soul and ask ourselves: am I a fraud or imposter? Do I have the courage to bear witness? Or will I take Melmoth’s hand when she says, “Won’t you take my hand? I’m so lonely!”...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jun 25, 2018","Jun 28, 2018","Jun 25, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/36628420-melmoth

The characters in Red, White, Blue only have an elusive grasp on it. And by the end of the book, you may as well.Red, White, Blue is an extraordinary book—a spy book that eschews the typical plot-driven, adventure-fueled formula and focuses on a CIA operative—namely, Noel, who died in a skiing accident in Switzerland, the day before his daughter Anna’s wedding—with fresh eyes. What kind of operative, the book asks, is drawn to the absence of trust in the presence of danger?Narrated in alternating chapters—Anna in the third-person and a first-person narration of the nameless CIA agent and author of a package of videos and recordings sent to Anna—we learn that during the time of his death, Noel was at the center of an interrogation for unofficially exfiltrating a woman named Veritas, a Chinese double agent who was his own asset. Anna, who is now married to a music producer, wishes to get to the truth.The truth, however, is elusive. The strength of this book is that it exposes the often bizarre and esoteric culture of intelligence work. Take this line, for example: “The Farm is about buying into the idea that not one, but all of those nesting dolls are you. The ability to inhabit all of them without doubt is essential to survival.” The insights are so precise and authentic that it is hard to believe that Lea Carpenter was not a CIA operative herself, attesting to her strength as a writer.This is not a book that will tie up all the details and hand them over to the reader in a neat red bow. Its purpose is not to set up a situation and then solve it; rather, its purpose is to explore the fuzzy morality of secretive work and how, eventually, the duplicity affects one’s own sense of identity and the sense of identity of those he holds closest. When I closed the pages, I began to question the characters I had just spent a few days with: were other characters who were portrayed as outsiders secretly CIA? Did everything unfold precisely as it was portrayed?

From a distance, the fruits look luscious and ripe and juicy. But for those who actually try them, the taste is old, dried up, bitter, and in desperate need of a little sugar.Bitter orange may be a metaphor for Frances’ life. Approaching 40, Frances has spent most of her adult life nursing her mother and is finally freed. When offered a chance to research the architecture of Lyntons, a dilapidated English country house, she jumps at the opportunity. Yet quickly, she becomes obsessed with the couple who live in the rooms below her attic room—the quixotic and troubled Cara and the enticing Peter. As the three of them become hedonistically interwined, it becomes increasingly evident that secrets will be revealed and that the ending will not bode well. We just don't know how it will all play out.The Lyntons mansion is as much a character as Frances, Cara and Peter with lush and atmospheric descriptions of the house and the grounds. Through the exactitude of Claire Fuller’s prose, it’s almost impossible not to visualize the setting, smell the scent of oranges, and taste the lavish dinners that Cara bakes.Although we’ve seen this set-up before—a triangle of characters with one or more unreliable narrators, an inexperienced and repressed woman liberated by her sensuous companions and surroundings—the book still is compelling.

Are Jon and Timmy meant to be perceived as relatable characters? Or are they the ultimate narcissists?The couple marry after betraying their former partners. Jon’s former wife curses the union, hoping that he will one day experience the same pain that she is going through. And indeed, his wife Timmy (nicknamed by Jon after Timmy Gresshopper who is eternally earnest and optimistic even when he had no idea where he was), becomes enticed by another man, Gunnar.The two have a curious idea of marriage—setting each other free and being able to share and give vent to all desires. Her experiences with Gunnar are meant to be lived through the intimacy she shares with Jon, tying the two even tighter into a danse a deux. As a result, Jon is complicit in Timmy’s burgeoning affair, urging her to share details even while experiencing impending fear and loss.My problem with this book is this: I began to suspect that the character of Jon encompassed some of Geir Gulliksen’s life and reality. Further, the 20-year marriage of Jon and Timmy is often showcased through the amazing physical intimacy they shared, but I didn’t get the sense of true emotional intimacy (which is, of course, one of the pillars of a strong marriage). The reliance on their eroticism in bed came at the expense of a strong and fully-formed love, which is always built on a foundation of trust.Mr. Gulliksen takes risks—he explores the story from his own viewpoint and tries to imagine it from his wife’s and also from Gunnar’s—which leads to an unsettling and even absorbing story. Still, I needed to believe that the marriage was truly unique other than the product of two narcissists to really buy into the “deep emotional truths” being conveyed....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 12, 2018","Jun 15, 2018","Jun 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36860750-the-story-of-a-marriage

Instead, they fall prey to a stranger named Larry who claims to be a friend of their fathers. What happened during those harrowing two days of captivity?Fast forward two decades. Hope is falling through the rabbit hole. Her long-time girlfriend has moved out and moved on, her playwriting career is stalled, and she hasn’t heard from Eden in years. And now their kidnapper is up for parole.The book focuses on the loneliness of and how much our past ends up defining us—not just the victims but also their respective parents and the people in their lives. There is no real salvation and no ability to untether oneself from the past. (At one point, Hope hears this: “If you’re free, why do you want to tie yourself up again?”) When Andrea Kleine—who wrote the absorbing novel Calf—drills down to the emotions of the characters, the novel soars. Particularly fascinating is Hope’s ruminations on whether she’d be the same person if nothing like that had ever happened to her. Her need for Eden is literal and metaphorical. Only with Eden is she remotely capable of choosing what she wants to be—anyone. Or no one at all.The novel’s insights, particularly in the second half of the book, are striking. But in the first half, when I should have been immersed, I felt distanced. I wanted the novel to focus more on the main players—Hope and Eden, their narcissistic father and too-remote mothers.

Brother, more than anything, is a book about memory. Our narrator, Michael, recalls his brother Francis saying, “Memory’s got nothing to do with the old and grey and faraway gone. Memory’s the muscle string of now. A kid reaching brave in the skull hum of power.” And, he goes on, if you can’t memory right, you lose.Still, remembering comes with its costs. In the poor Toronto neighborhood, peopled by worn-down immigrant families, life is balanced between getting by and staying alive and between maintaining dignity and staying on the right side of the ever-present police. We know that Francis dies and the way he dies feels almost inevitable.The entire reverie—which moves back and forth in time—is sparked by the return of Michael’s childhood friend Aisha, a bright young girl who became a writer and is now home grieving her own loss.

Into this poisonous atmosphere leaps Barry Cohen, a hedge fund manager of a This Side of Capital (lifted from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s This Side of Paradise.) By all outward appearances, Barry lives the American dream: a beautiful immigrant wife, an adorable 3-year-old son, billions of assets under management and more. But scratch the surface and it’s all a mirage: his wife fancies someone else, his son is severely autistic, and the SEC is breathing down his back.So Barry takes off on a Greyhound bus journey to discover the “real America.” He believes he is having authentic experiences but in fact, the “real America” is severely divided, hopelessly lost and struggling to survive. And, much as Barry wants it to, it is not a mirror to his past or future.Alternating between satire and poignancy, Gary Shteyngart never makes the mistakes of throwing his characters under the proverbial bus. The yearning and emptiness redeem Barry and his wife Seema to some extent.

Families and friends were devastated and children were left orphans. In the meantime, the city of Atlanta was in the midst of the Camelot era, yet dealing with the inequities of social, economic and racial disparities.I expected a novel that concentrated on the emotional growth process that touched both the citizens and its city as the horror of the tragedy sunk in. Instead, the novel quickly deteriorated into a sort of made-for-TV soap opera with characters that never really blossomed into life.Piedmont Dobbs, for example—a young black man on the precipice of a changing racial history—could easily embody just about any black man of that era, and was—in my opinion—shallowly delineated. Robert, who leaves his pregnant wife Lily because of the death of his girlfriend in the crash, and Lily, who suffers the loss of her parents, her inheritance, and her spouse in one fell swoop are characters better suited to TV than novels.

The forest becomes almost mythical: an “old man slave running through the Great Woods, not toward freedom: toward the immense testimony of his bones.”It is hard not to read another level into this story: the monsters that lurk out there, ready to pounce, as we stumble and fall through our oft undefined journey.

Only the details are different.” In When I ed Kevin Powers’ elegiac first novel—The Yellow Birds—I began with this line: “All pain is the same. Only the details are different.” In this, his second novel, Kevin Powers does not stray far from that theme; indeed, this new book explores the brutal legacy of violence that spans from the antebellum era to the 1980s. The focus is on the devaluing of human life through the hideous notion that one human could be “master” to another.There are two key plot lines at play: the first centers around the Beauvais Plantation, outside of Richmond, Virginia. There, two enslaved individuals—Nurse and Rawls—struggle to keep the embers of love alive with the fates turned against them. The master of Beauvais, Antony Levallois, holds the key to their fates, as he does the fate of Emily, the daughter of a neighboring plantation owner who he does not love but wishes to possess. Interspersed with that line is the story of George Seldom, an orphan, who, in the 1950s, questions who he really is and where he comes from. It is no surprise that these two storylines merge. I could not help but compare the two books, both written by an immensely talented author. There is, in The Yellow Birds, a strong sense of authenticity, mainly because Kevin Powers is writing from deep knowledge: he served in the U.S. Army in Mosul and Tal Afar, Iraq. In A Shout in the Ruins, Mr. Powers seems to be relying less on experience and more on research and the resonance is not nearly as deep. There are extraneous characters, such as Lottie Moore, a waitress connected to George Seldom; her role in the novel seemed dubious. Other ancillary characters take space away from the ones we, as readers, hope to invest ourselves in.The portrayal of the world as indifferent and often nightmarish is the main canvas that Kevin Powers is working with; the characters’ stories are broad strokes that complete the picture. Here, for example, is one rumination: “Rawls did not know what people deserved, but he knew they did not get it. Instead they seemed to get what they did not deserve, as if the world had been built that way, like a machine that could produce only one outcome.” There is plenty of pain to go around and those who want relentlessly positive (or Pollyanna-ish) stories will not find it here. What they will find is fine prose from an author who knows how to command a story.

The first narrator is Lulu Parsons, one of five children whose mother Bette suddenly goes missing along with a neighbor named Alice McFee in a rural Canadian town. The second is Doris, Tenpenny, a mute woman who consequently sees and hears more than people give her credit for. For much of the book, the perspective bounces from Lulu’s first-person and Doris’ third-person point of view. It’s a beautifully told tale that surrenders its surprises along the way but cannot be pigeon-holed into a typical “what happened to the women who disappeared” tale. Rather, it is an exposition on how we dig out of our messes and make our way to a place we call home, even when the road is filled with obstacles.The characters leap from the page and are never predictable or simplified. From Lulu’s older brother Geordie who is mentally challenged to Aloysius McFee, the manipulative and perhaps even sociopathic husband of the other missing woman, with whom Lulu has a complex relationship with, the revelations are as thorny and nuanced as life itself. From the stresses of motherhood to the bonds that connect us and separate us, this book creates its own believable world.

His duty is to “get our team leader, Fabrice, across the twenty-one stages of this tour in as little time as possible.” Sol views his job as a type of performance theatre – applying deducation, logic and attention, enacting a struggle, “from which conclusions about character and the tendencies of our age can be drawn.” He is married to Liz, a geneticist, who, just like Sol, has small, specific goals and a resolve “to apprehend infinity not be a cowering submission at all that lies beyond us, but through meticulous reexamination of single things.”As the suspenseful drama of the book unfolds, the costs and rewards of this singular focus will play out in unexpected ways. There is an existential question behind all of this: what is the purpose of our ascent? What is it that we are really striving for? What happens when those things begin to lose their meaning as they clash against a ruthless reality?I’m not a huge fan of sports based books (Netherland and The Art of Fielding come to mind), but this book worked, because the cycling is, in ways, a metaphor for how we keep moving forward, continually spinning our wheels in the pursuit of…something. The mundaneness of this prestigious race – the need to shave off millimeters of weight, the near-hermetic practices, and yes, the doping—are expertly woven in. My only quibble is that Liz was not as dimensional as I wished she had been. I felt as if I knew her only by what she did for a living and never fully understood her motivations.

One of the most extraordinary images is her visit each day to a Turkish newsagent to purchase ice lollies, (lime, strawberry, even the dreaded orange), which give her mother pleasure, and her devastation when the shop runs out of every flavor but bubblegum, which her mother cannot consume.

Documentary filmmaker Dene Oxendene, one of a dozen characters whom we meet in this book, gives his take about the Gertrude Stein quote about Oakland (“There is no there there.”) Dene’s words: “This there there. He hadn’t read Gertrude Stein beyond the quote. But for Native people in this country, all over the Americas, it’s been developed over, buried ancestral land, glass and concrete and wire and steel, unreturnable covered memory. There is no there there.”Reminiscent in ways of the movie Crash, these characters—who eventually come together in the Big Oakland Powwow—crash into each other intermittently, leaving behind sadness and often scars. There’s Jacquie Red Feather, one of the characters we get to know the most, an alcoholic who is facing the tatters of her past and on her way to her future—finally meeting her three grandsons. Her daughter Blue, whom she never met (and who has given up those boys) is fleeing an abusive marriage. The oldest of the sons, Orvil, is pulling spider legs out of his own leg wound and wrestling about what it means to be Indian. And then there are the others —Danny who creates plastic guns on a 3D printer, Edwin who loses himself in overeating, Thomas who is half-white and floundering in his life.Tommy Orange’s purpose is clear; he wants us to know that the term “Native” cannot be easily defined and, in fact, encompasses many kinds of people who share the burden of alienation, isolation and cruel history. They come to the annual Big Oakland Powow for different reasons: “The messy, dangling strands of our lives got pulled into a braid—tied to the back of everything we’ve been doing all along to get us here…we’ve been coming for years, generations, lifetimes, layered in prayer and hand-woven regalia, beaded and sewn together, feathered, braided, blessed, and cursed.”This is a major contribution to Urban Indian literature; I’ve never read anything quite like it.

As a result, they spend their teenage years surrounded by Dickensian characters: a man they refer to as The Moth, a greyhound racer and bon vivant called the Darter, and others who flitter in and out of their lives. It is only in part two, a decade or more later, that a little bit of light is shed.The book, as one might expect from Mr. Ondaatje, is elegantly and lyrically crafted. It’s a pure pleasure to read prose this assured. An ambiance is set that keeps the reader on edge and off balance. Michael Ondaatje takes the all-too-common coming-of-age trope and turns it on its ear, as if he’s a magician pulling mesmerizing scenes out of his hat.But. Something changed for me in the second half of this novel. I am typically a big fan of novels that are non-linear and that switch from one point of view to another. But in this case, I found the switch to be distancing. I believe the author’s theme can be encapsulated in this line: “We never know more than the surface of any relationship after a certain stage, just as those layers of chalk, built from the efforts of infinitesimal creatures, work in almost limitless time.” If my interpretation is correct, then Michael Ondaatje delivers on what he sets out to do.Yet still, I couldn’t help but feel dissatisfied, as I do sometimes when I meet a self-professed “private person” who keeps me at arm’s length.

And the larger-than-life Lavinia, the daughter of immensely wealthy parents who wants to seize life and live it to the fullest, even if it places her on the precipice of danger.As readers, we know in the first few pages that Lavinia will die. Tara Isabella Burton talks directly to us, letting us know that Lavinia will not survive very long. It’s a clever gamut because it would be easy to concentrate on Lavinia as the more intriguing of the two but now, our concentration is focused on Louise. Louise allows herself to fall into Lavinia’s orbit, meeting up with people named Gavin and Athena and Father Romylos and the Egyptologist and the girl who appeared on the show Survivor. But Lavinia demands all her love and attention and Louise—who cannot keep up financially—falls more and more into debt.How this all plays out will not be revealed in this , but trust me, you won’t want to stop reading once you begin and you’ll find out soon enough.

Or The Death of Billy Joel, when a man organizes a golf trip to Florida for his fortieth birthday, straddling a ""shriveling world"" with a new shot at life. Or Ponchos, which takes on an awkward visit to a fertility clinic and the aloneness of a husband and wife during the juncture. Or ""The Sinking of Houston"", where a father becomes obsessed with the stealing of his son's cell phone, only to be diverted by an ancient neighbor's Bay of Pigs story.The stories carry through them a hint of mortality and focus squarely on everyday life: what we owe our friends, our spouses, ourselves and what it means to feel (or fail) at redemption.

Therese Bohman creates a self-seeking protagonist in Karolina, a professor of art history at the University of Stockholm, whose passion for art is matched with the ennui of her personal life.At the twilight of her youth, perched to enter middle age, Karolina idles away her time roaming the city and reminiscing about former relationships gone sour. She has separated from a boring relationship that ate up eleven years of her time and now she makes unwise choices: connecting physically with a man who votes for the far right, her influential arts editor, a man from her teen years. Although art is a stable in her life, she can’t help but think that her devotion to research and study has alienated her from a more meaningful connection with a partner.The narrative starts off slowly and the numerous references to art builds credibility for Karolina’s personality, while, at times, distancing the reader who is unfamiliar with the Scandinavian art world. There is, of course, the joy of discovery of researching the art that’s described but – at least for me – it was hard to break the spell of the narrative to do so.The crux of the novel occurs when Karolina’s self-assured Ph.D. student, Anton, arrives in her office after a year abroad to reveal that he has uncovered an overlooked female Swedish artist who may hold the key to German Expressionist art. She finds herself attracted to him and his potential claim to fame. The way this plotline progresses is suspenseful and delicious.

What does it all mean?I found the answers in Ranier Maria Rilke’s letters on loss, grief and transformation, which is surprisingly accessible and unsurprisingly well-crafted. Rilkie believes that between the two notes of birth and death we pass through “the dark interval” – a separation that, if we allow it to, contributes to life as a beautiful song.Death, in Rilkie’s view, is not something to avoid or fear but contributes to an intensely lived life. He writes, “Death does not exceed our strength” and urges the recipients of his letters to not withdraw in bitter loneliness from life but to remain in life, using the pain to forge another path back. While he does not sugarcoat the raw pain that comes from loss, he urges his his readers to use pain to actively transform life. Moving forward, in Rilke’s view, is to move with and through the pain rather than overcoming it. Religious tenets that strongly suggest that our loved one is “beyond” makes the deceased less approachable and real; rather, Rilke believes we are never closer to the loved one than when we carry him or her inside us, in our hearts. He writes, “Nature…has all the power to heal as long as one does not eavesdrop or interrupt it.”The lengthy prologue by academic Ulrich Baer is a reason in itself to read this book, as he captures the essence of what Ranier Maria Rilke is saying. While this book may not appeal to staunch religious advocates, it is a much-needed read for anyone trying to find meaning and comfort in the unknowable....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,not set,not set,"Mar 20, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36959638-the-dark-interval

She teams up with the local sheriff, Irving Wylie, surely one of the more delightful sheriffs of literature, with a dry wit, a kind heart, a pragmatic mind, and a keen insight into the politics of justice.There is much in this novel to enjoy. The banter between Sigrid and Irving is spot-on and there are laugh out loud moments as the two cultures clash. Derek B. Miller also provides some real food for thought about our gun culture and institutionalized racism without crossing the line and becoming pedantic. Take this, for example: “…it’s deeper than race. It’s deeper than politics It’s a culturally organizing system. It’s how we achieve Americanness. It’s how we do Americanness. It’s a kind of performance.” Miller – and by extension, his characters – believe that the American passion for individualism stand in the way of community achievement.I was a little wary that all this would be too heavy-handed but Derek B. Miller strikes just the right tone with a smart novel that engages and entertains as well as gently teaches. There are a few times he overreaches and the ending is a bit too cinematic and tied-together for my tastes. Still, this comparison of Norwegian and American mores and values and his damaged but good-spirited characters really won me over.

I’ve read many of his books – The Curfew, The Lesson, Silence Once Begun, A Cure for Suicide, How to Set a Fire &I am an unabashed fan of Jesse Ball. I’ve read many of his books – The Curfew, The Lesson, Silence Once Begun, A Cure for Suicide, How to Set a Fire & Why – and have often marveled at his metafictional, fablelike, and sometimes provocative works.But this time it’s personal – for the author and perhaps for this reader, too. Jesse Ball dedicates the book to his deceased brother, Abram Ball, who had Down Syndrome, and in the prologue, writes about the struggle to create this book and how he solved it: “I would make a book that was hollow. I would place him in the middle of it, and write around him for the most part. He would be there in his effect.” Like Jesse Ball, I have a loved one – a young nephew – with Down Syndrome and I was curious to see how he would develop this concept.This is how: an ill widower, a doctor, takes on the role of census taker and sets off with his Down Syndrome son to take the census, from point A to point Z. Each census taker must forego his or her rights of protection. Consider the census as “a large instrument made up of living cells—and each cell is a census taker.” Yet half way through the book, the unnamed narrator develops a new method of the census – not gathering certain information but instead, deciding what information to look for. The journey into less urban, more unplanned areas is a metaphor for the father’s own journey into the edges of where life and death convene.To that end, Census becomes a tapestry of representation – who will stand up and be counted. Indeed, father and son are discovering the heart and soul of America – the kindness, the anger, the humanity, the fear, the gentleness, the ignorance, and the brutality. Each person who participates in this census must allow the census taker to leave a tattooed mark. And indeed, the mark may well be a reminder of how they reacted to life and treated a boy who was not viewed by them as part of the norm.The conceit is not quite as accessible than Mr. Ball’s previous works and if truth be known, there were times when I wondered what Mr. Ball was trying to tell me…and found myself admiring the book more than loving it. But the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and by the end of the book, I believed I knew. He was writing about the inevitability of saying goodbye and of being part of a world that demands we deal with the good and the bad....more",Notes are private!,0,28,2,"Mar 27, 2018not set","Mar 29, 2018not set","Mar 14, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35068746-census

Do Not Say We Have Nothing is one of those books – magisterial in scope, courageous in theme, dynamic in its execution.The story focuses on immensely talented musicians who became pawns and victims in China’s Cultural Revolution. The framework of it is based on fact: He Luting, the director of conservatory of music, was personally targeted by The Gang of Four, and yet refused to buckle under the call for self-criticisms, betrayals, and pernicious lies.But this is not He Luting’s story – only in small part. The story revolves around a young girl Marie, who lives with her mother (her father has disappeared) in Canada. A teenager, Ai-ming, who has fled China following the Tiananmen protests shows up at their door; their fathers are somehow intimately connected. The story that evolves covers decades of tumultuous history and introduces the reader to an extraordinary cast of characters who cannot subjugate their love of music for the revolution’s demand for conformity.That, in essence, is the story. But what elevates this book is not the plot, but the themes. One of the main teenage characters, forced to choose between the revolutionary goals and her music, wonders about another character: “…how he could acquiesce on the surface and not be compromised inside. You could not play revolutionary music, truly revolutionary music, if you were a coward in your heart. You could not play if your hands, your wrists, your arms were not free.”The same character says, “The only life that matters is in your mind. The only truth is the one that lives invisibly, that waits even after you close the book. Silence, too, is a kind of music.” Music may be “nothing”, according to Chairman Mao, yet it belongs to each one, individually.In addition to a providing piercing insights into China’s Cultural Revolution, Ms. Thien examines the themes that really matter: who are we lose our identity, our essence, our love of all that is beautiful? What happens when people can’t live where they want, love who they want, do the work they want, and pursue the passions they want? What happens to us when we throw away everything that’s dear to us?

Some of her work totally resonates with me; some (such as Eligible or American Life) were misses. But one thing remains consistent: Curtis Sittenfeld is a natural-born storyteller and she makes me want to keep reading.In You Think It, I’ll Say It, the overriding theme is how our perceptions change with the gifts of time and distance. Over and over, we’re treated to characters who are brought face-to-face with their nemesis from an earlier and more vulnerable time.In “Bad Latch”, for example, a new mom runs into the annoying fellow participant in her prenatal yoga class, who constantly spouted self-congratulatory and know-it-all statements. Life throws a wrench into things and when the narrator sees her again, she’s far more “real.” Or “The Prairie Wife”, when another harried mother comes across her childhood girl crush, who is now the darling of social media, and finds that both their lives have taken unexpected detours. Or “A Regular Couple” – a woman on her honeymoon runs into a school friend who inadvertently (or perhaps deliberately) humiliated her long ago. Each of these characters have their chance at redemption – and even gratification – as they emerge more grounded after the fleeting and unexpected time spent with someone who has weighed on their mind. It is, I think, most people’s fantasy – to meet someone from the distant past in one’s own more secure and mature iteration.The best of the stories, in my opinion, are the most nuanced: “The World Has Many Butterflies”, for example, leverages the humiliation felt by a discontented wife who shares snarky observations about others in their affluent set with a man who is really just using her for amusement. And “Volunteers Are Shining Stars” is a fine portrait of a damaged girl/woman who is using her volunteer opportunity to reinforce her own biases. All in all, this is a highly readable collection that is marred only by the lack of risk taken by the author in some of the stories....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 05, 2018","Mar 09, 2018","Mar 05, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35961720-you-think-it-i-ll-say-it

But relegating The Only Story to a love story between a boy barely out of his teens and a woman firmly ensconced in middle age would be serving this novel short.In truth, the book is about memory and how our stories become paradoxically, more nuanced and yet more distance as we age. Julian Barnes writes, “But nowadays, the raucousness of the first person within him was stilled. It was as if he viewed, and lived, his life in the third person. Which allowed him to assess sit more accurately, he believed.” (Or did it?)It is the structure of the novel that was so intriguing to me. It is divided into three sections. The first is narrated by Paul, an egotistical young man who comes home from university in the sixties with a chip on his shoulder about the privileged life he has lead in his London suburb and a desire to turn his whole life into drama and upheaval. He meets his match on the tennis court of a tony tennis club with Susan Macleod, a 48-year-old woman who becomes his partner, both on and off the court. Their love is scandalizing and that is precisely how they seem to like it.The second section utilizes the “you” tense as the reality of the situation sets in. You – the reader – can feel Paul distancing himself, twinning himself with the reader rather than taking ownership for the downward trajectory of life. And the third section distances even further, as he employs the third-person tense, analyzing what happened and telling his tale without emotion, almost as if it occurred to someone else whose name happened to be Paul.If truth be known, questions came up for me at first. Why was a young man so besotted with a woman who was older than his mother? What was Susan’s motivation? Why did Paul continue to stay with her for over a decade, when truths began to emerge? But as I finished the book, I kept coming back to an oft-repeated line of Julian Barnes: “Love is both true and false.” This novel was less about one particular love than the nature of love itself and how, in its many forms, it continues to astound and puzzle us. When, on the first page, Julian Barnes writes, “If this is your only story, then it’s the one you have most often told and retold, even if—as in the case here—mainly to yourself. The question then is: do all these retellings bring you closer to the truth of what happened, or move you further away?”, he is asking a universal question. The only story, in other words, is the story we create, not the story that happened....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Mar 02, 2018","Mar 05, 2018","Mar 02, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35570812-the-only-story

Page-turning good. Stay up ‘til midnight good.

Men, holding matches up to your gasoline eyes. Flames, flames, all around you, licking at your just-born breasts, your just-bled body…Scattering you, because you are a girl, and because you are ash.”Powerful stuff. There were many passages and plot twists that brought tears to my eyes. The one problem with the book is when it overreaches. Given the craven and controlled world these girls find themselves in, it is very unlikely that either would have survived and been aided at crucial junctures. In short, some of the plot advances defied credibility.However, the book was so compelling that I cast those doubts aside and fell under its spell.

In Domenico Starnone’s Trick, a famous illustrator named Daniele Mallarico, whose artistic gifts are deserting him, is chosen to illustrate a lush Italian edition The Jolly Corner—and returns to his childhood home in Naples to do so.There is a lot of “meat” in this novel, whose theme is similar to that of the Henry James’ story. Daniele Mallarico is coerced into spending the four days with his four-year-old grandson Mario in his former Naples home while Mario’s feuding parents attend a conference. The interchange between grandfather and grandson are delightful, as the child literally becomes father to the man.Mario is a precocious child who can do all kinds of things—setting the table, turning on the stove, using the TV remote and so on. Daniele, on the other hand, is incorporating a different kind of learning: the meaning of mortality and ephemeral fame and perhaps an exploration of what constitutes an authentic life.Shut in an apartment populated by ghosts and eventually shut out, literally and even figuratively, by his grandson, Daniele must face the implications of his life choices. The book is a marvel: fun-loving and poignant, meditative and existential, reflective and powerful, all the while contrasting a life that’s about to burst forth with possibilities versus a life that is defined more by past ghosts than future accomplishments. As a reader, I believe I missed out by not reading The Jolly Corner first, to catch all the allusions. That being said, the book can be devoured and enjoyed without knowing the first thing about Henry James.

And the reader is left to guess how deluded Michael really is. Is there more than meets the “eagle’s eye”?

So I was primed to read and enjoy Clarissa Goenawan’s debut novel, particularly upon reading that it had a Murakami-style aesthetic.The premise is intriguing: a young man named Ren Ishida, who worshipped and emulated his inscrutable older sister Keiko, is crushed when he finds out that she was the victim of a particularly brutal stabbing attack. He journeys to the small town of Akakawa, where she had taken up residence and ends up stepping into her life: living, as she did, in the home of a well-known politician and assuming her place as an English teacher in the local high school But somehow, this novel – written in unadorned prose -- never really coalesced for me. For one thing, the voice initially sounded more feminine than masculine and there were times that I had to remind myself that this was a male narrator who was talking. For another, it was too often speckled with clichéd prose and even some plot lines that lifted me away from the novelistic magic. (An example: “I was the one who pursued her…I will carry this burden for the rest of my life. Or: “It’s good to be young. Anything is possible. As you get older, you forget how to dream.”) Clarissa Goenawan has obvious talent, which is on display as she successfully creates a brooding ambiance that matches the internal state of her haunted and regretful narrator, combined with dream sequences and flashbacks to Ren and Keiko’s past.

Add to thiThis book was on my radar for many reasons, not the least of which is that George Saunders, one of my literary heroes, mentored Mr. Mackin. Add to this that a couple of these stories appeared in the very discerning New Yorker and that Will Mackin has the authority and chops (he spent years as a member of an elite Navy SEAL team) and it’s easy to see why any literary reader would be intrigued.My personal favorite in this collection is Great Circle Route Westward Through Perpetual Night, opening with the memorial of Mir, the troop’s much-loved bomb-sniffing dog. As Mir is eulogized by his fellow warriors, there is this line: “Regardless, we agreed on one key point: what had driven Mir to launch himself at the triggerman, and kill him so viciously, had been love, pure and simple.” In a world where love and violence are a hair’s breath away, the story is executed brilliantly.Another story, Kattekoppen – whose name derives from a vile-smelling Dutch candy in the form of brown cat heads with bewildered faces – is also a powerful story, Levi, a howitzer liaison and expectant father, regularly gets these candies from his mother, who doesn’t realize he has long outgrown their taste. The candy is ultimately used inventively to dispel a malodorous slime; nothing is sweet in Logar, Afghanistan. Other stories that resonated were The Lost Troop – an Afghani interpreter’s quixotic side-trip to locate his former teacher—and Crossing the River with No Name, a haunting tale about a man who has already used up his miracles.But here’s the problem – and I freely admit it’s my problem, not Mr. Mackin’s. War is a fraternity all its own, with its own language and its own unique absurdity. When a book focuses on developed characters – Kevin Powers’ Yellow Birds comes to mind – I’m “all in.” But when the focus is increasingly on war with all its proprietary acronyms, nicknames and lawlessness, I feel as if I’m on the outside looking in. It’s like being dropped in an entirely different and confounding culture. Those who are primed for muscular and vivid wartime narratives, complete with surreal details of warriors’ deployment, will easily rate this 5-stars. Since I am not that kind of reader, it would be unfair for me to provide a rating....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jan 23, 2018","Jan 26, 2018","Jan 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35458140-bring-out-the-dog

Rather, he would be an accidental and self-absorbed bumbler on the world stage, never hoping or even expecting to ascend to the presidency. And therein lies the tragedy.Donald Trump ran for one reason and for one reason only: to build his brand and to position himself as the most famous person on earth (the antithesis of Crooked Hillary). No one, least of all Trump, (with the exception of Steve Bannon), expected a victory. Hence, no one prepared. If you’re wondering – as I have – why easy targets like Flynn and Manafort were around, the answer is simple: Trump never vetted anyone because he never expected that he’d need to.In the void left by a disinterested commander in chief, three forces combat to win the soul of the presidency: Steve Bannon who is a proponent of anarchy – tearing down everything and then rebuilding…Rance Preibus, the voice of traditional Republicans…and Javanka, otherwise known as Jared and Ivanka, who, given their druthers, would push their relative into becoming a Rockefeller Democrat. In the push-pull that follows, an atmosphere of extreme distrust follows as each of these factions leaks on the other two. Yet the one who is most effective in getting to Trump is Ivanka, who learned the formula at an early age: do not befuddle him with data and PowerPoint presentations, use emotive visuals whenever possible, and flatter his wisdom. The Syria bombing following the internal chemical attack? Ivanka showed her father photos of the victims, which spurred him to act, in ways that the others could not make him do.Trump is a weasly fellow, disloyal to everyone in his life (including Javanka), possessing just the shell of a marriage, likely having an affair with one of his underlings, unable to focus, and totally uninterested in anything that doesn’t directly affect himself and his brand. He is the self-professed billionaire who can’t read a balance sheet, the champion of Christianity who has broken just about every commandment, the fair-weather friend, and the most unlikely occupant the White House has ever seen.I closed this book amazed that in the past year, our government has functioned at all under his “leadership.” And I continue to be dismayed that America has lost its way, preferring charismatic celebrities to perhaps boring but eminently qualified candidates who actually have given deep thought to our myriad of problems.Don’t choose this book expecting to find a Doris Goodwin or Jon Meacham meticulous analysis of Trump and his misadventures, or even any answers to whether he colluded with Russia or not.

The premise, cited as a *true story, is intriguing: when a young paraplegic Afghanistan veteran experiences a full recovery, what does it mean? Is it a true miracle or a medical breakthrough? More importantly, what if the veteran is harboring secrets and is not defined as “worthy”? Can or should he still be a symbol for divine mercy if he is perceived by misguided fundamentalists as a sinner?This book very aptly mines the hypocrisy of those who claim to follow the Church, fast to define inexplicable events as “miracles” and equally fast to dissemble that definition if a person doesn’t live up to man-made definitions of what a “saint” should be. It takes the reader on a journey from the war zones of the Middle East to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to a local convenience store where the “miracle” occurred. And it integrates science, medicine, the online community, TV film producers, local neighbors and more.So why do I find this book hard to rate? I found the enormous amount of detail to weigh down the forward propulsion, and often found myself scanning full pages because of what I considered superfluous background. As a literary fiction reader, I found the fact-laden long-form journalistic approach to lack magic. Still, once I got past the ponderous opening pages, I did settle in and actually began to admire what Jonathan Miles was doing as well as his pitch-perfect dialog, thoughtful plot twists, and above all, important themes. The magic did begin to emerge.The ultimate theme is, “How does someone reclaim his authentic life from the glare of others' expectations?” It leaves the reader with much to ponder....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,not set,"Jan 19, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33517093-anatomy-of-a-miracle

You can’t expect more from a book than that.In Gun Love, Ms. Clement moves from drug culture to the pervasiveness of guns that are everywhere, keeping us all on the precipice between life and death. Whether it’s the casual buying and selling of these death weapons, the shooting of baby alligators for sport, or the violence that stalks us, it’s hard to break away from the allure of firearms.Yet surprisingly, it is the “love” not the “gun” part of the book’s title that, I suspect, will remain with me. Jennifer Clement creates a unique protagonist in young Pearl, a 10-year-old albino (or near-albino) whose entire life has been spent living in a ’94 Mercury with her mother Margot. Margot escaped the trappings of wealth – and the abusiveness of her father – when she secretly gave birth to Pearl and has avoided detection ever since.The description of their living arrangements, parked feet from a trailer park in a small down-and-out Florida town, comes alive as Pearl matter-of-factly considers her living arrangements. Take this for example: “When you live in a car there’s no surface for a vase of flowers. My mother would cut the stems short and arrange the flowers in an empty tin of powdered milk that she filled with water Then she placed the bouquet outside on the roof as if the roof were a mantelpiece.”The trailer park and the denizens feel real and Pearl’s life is authentically portrayed. Anyone who has read her prior book already know her style fastidious attention to details, fully realized characters, inventive and often enchanting analogies, underscored by a strong message. Sometimes this message is overplayed but it is still a just message. From the first two lines, “My mother was a cup of sugar. You could borrow her anytime”, it’s evident that Jennifer Clement knows her craft. ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Jan 15, 2018","Jan 18, 2018","Jan 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35661769-gun-love

But it is so gut-wrenching powerful and so effective as it exposes the life of a young girl who straddles two worlds that I was won over by it.Ten-year-old Ana – a tomboy and the big sister to a sickly baby sister – experiences the Balkans concept at first in the simplest of ways.

We see Ana, who outwardly seems unscarred, struggling with the false persona she adopts as a college student living with adoptive parents in the U.S. Then we move backwards again in time to fill in the missing gap – what happened to Ana in the years between childhood and college. Only once Ana is able to assimilate what she lost and who she once was is she able to move forward to the possibility of healing.A story of how humans endure, an indictment against the devastation of war, a study into what happens when a child is forced to grow up before her time – leading to an internal war – this is a dark but integral book.

But like writers before her, Jamie Quatro strives to align an understanding and devotion to God with a so-called sinful extramarital affair. For this non-believer, it did not work.Maggie is married to Thomas, an imperfect man and father of her two children, who strives and often succeeds in being a good husband. Somewhere along the line, she begins a platonic relationship with James, a formalist poet, who writes about “the apocalyptic suffering created by a market economy.” If that weren’t insufferable enough, both of them seem to view what is portrayed as an intimate and sensual affair through the lends of classic Catholicism.The problem is that the theological overlay competes with the hot passion we, as readers, are supposed to experience through Maggie’s need to have unmet desires met. It is evident that these two are platonic soulmates but true lovers? It didn’t quite come across. And, for those of us who are non-believers, the emphasis on the intellectual denied the big question at the heart of religion: Did Christ in fact, exist in the way it was reported by acolytes 400 years after his death?It becomes increasingly obvious that Maggie is playing mind games to deceive herself and perhaps the reader, about her real needs. Granted, she is in desperate need of religious dialogue. While her exchanges with James are intriguing to read, they seemed head games as opposed to ultimate physical/emotional love—a forced conflation of theology with passion.But oh, the last part. when Maggie is able to state in a clear-eyed manner, “I admit to using my religious beliefs to manipulate, resisting temptation as a means of feeding my own desire.” Or this: “You will say I am condoning sin. Constructing an intellectual scaffolding to justify what should be renounced.”As the intellectual scaffolding begins to be dismantled, we see this novel’s true potential: the tale of a yearning woman, married to a good man, who meets her intellectual soulmate and who, like Icarus, flies too close to the flames.

And within these two novellas (and a 30-page coda tAsymmetry is defined as the lack of equality or equivalence between parts or aspects of something. And within these two novellas (and a 30-page coda that very subtly reveals how the two novellas are tied together), there is much asymmetry that can be pointed to, both in life and in fiction.The first novella introduces us to Alice, a young editor who goes down her own private rabbit hole when she begins a relationship with Ezra Blazer, a famous literary writer who is nearly 50 years her senior. It is hard not to think of J.D. Salinger and Joyce Maynard, but in this case, the duo does not act overly furtive; in fact, symbiotically, both Alice and Ezra appear to be feeding off the relationship, taking from it when they need. Their story, written in third person, incorporates numerous literary and song excerpts (which are identified in the Afterword) and quite a lot of arcane references to baseball, particularly the Yankees-Red Sox game.Suddenly, about half-way through, another writing style takes over: this time, we get a first-person narrative from Amar, a young Iraqi-American, who is detained at Heathrow as he makes his way from Los Angeles to Kurdistan in 2008, to visit his brother Sami, a physician. The references here highlight the Iraqi war and the fall of Baghdad. When Amar says, “Sometimes you just want someone else to take over for a while, to rein in freedom that has become a little too free…Sometimes we jump into the hole, sometimes we allow ourselves to be pulled in, and sometimes, not entirely inadvertently, we trip,” there are echoes of Alice too.The coda is a musician’s delight, filled with numerous classical music references. It is written in its own style, as an interview conducted with Ezra, now the winner of the Nobel.The asymmetry is everywhere: in the fictional styles and voices, in the tenuous boundary between life and fiction (particularly, living life according to one’s own plan versus trying to impose order and form on the amorphous stuff of life through fiction. It is also an exploration of asymmetrical dichotomies that encompass age, wealth, ambition, legal status, and point of view. Asymmetry is bold, original and thought-provoking and I am torn between 4 and 5 stars. Truth be known, I felt that the multiple references – whether literary quotations, baseball, or music – seemed a touch like author indulgence.

I wouldn’t know; I’ve been fortunate not to have ever had a close-up-and-personal experience.Maggie O’Farrell has—and her unconventional memoir is chilling and real. “It was not so much that I didn’t value my existence but more that I had an insatiable desire to push myself to embrace all that it had to offer,” she writes. We see her in all her manifestations: as a young eight-year-old child in the throes of encephalitis, leaving her to contend with a neurological disorder that has, in ways, defined her life. As a rebellious young woman who senses she is in danger from a hiker who has followed her to a remote path. As a traveler whose own enthusiasm for life sometimes takes her too far. As a mother who undergoes a perilous childbirth and who dies a little inside in her struggles to keep her children safe. Whether it’s a voluntary lark with a circus knife-thrower or a machete-wielding thief, Ms. O’Farrell has had what some may call an “interesting” life.Each chapter is named for a part of a body – neck, lungs, circulatory system, abdomen and so on. We are, Ms. O’Farrell suggests, the sum of our organs, any one of which could take us down. But even though we’re vulnerable, life is still rich and full.It isn’t until the last chapter that the sum of these experiences—resulting in a remarkable level of resilience and strength—shows forth. This chapter is the only one not named for an organ; it’s titled “Daughter”, with the suggestion that one’s child is as vital to life as any organ might ever be. The power of this chapter reminds me of Lorrie Moor’s People Like That Are The Only People Here.

But in this case, the cleverness actually works. The premise is nothing short of quantum mechanics, or the existence of numerous worlds. In these worlds, it is not unusual for fictional characters and real characters to exist simultaneously or for either of them to have many roads to choose and many identities to try on.Because, make no mistake, the theme of this book is the choices open to us – the road less travelled – and the certainty that with every choice we take, a myriad of possibilities will be eliminated. The joy of this book is the juxtaposition of what is true and what could be true in an alternative universe, where Sherlock Holmes and Poe’s Le Chevalier C.

Horrific tragedies like the horrors of Caribbean slavery in the 1700s cannot and should not be minimized. And yet, Jane Harris pulls off this feat, so that at no time is the reader not invested in the human cost of this endeavor.The storyline – inspired by reality – is this: a group of French surgeon-monks, situated in Martinique, plot to recover their “property” that they “lost” after being expelled from nearby Grenada. Grenada is now under the management of the British, who are even more brutal “masters” than the French – and Jane Harris does not shy away from describing their atrocities.It’s all about obtaining forced labor for their sugar plantations – hence, the title, Sugar Money. Chosen to execute this plot is Emile, a mulatto man in his late 20s, who is asked to convince the slaves to follow him to a waiting ship as their masters indulge in Christmas revelries. It is a fool’s journey and he is also forced to take along his kid brother, Lucien, our narrator, who is barely entering his teens. Refusal is not an option.The concept works because Lucien is still somewhat of an innocent, worshipful of his brother, desirous of proving his budding manhood, not totally understanding that the world is stacked so heavily against the disenfranchised. In his mind, his brother can do anything he sets his mind to do. The narration, written in a idiosyncratic English with Creole accents, is beautifully rendered; for true, Jane Harris is a ventriloquist.There will, I suspect, be outcries of appropriation: can a white woman be the voice of a young slave-boy? I believe that there should be no boundaries on creative expression. (William Styron, a non-Jew, wrote one of the most affecting novels of Holocaust literature with Sophie’s Choice). Judged entirely on its own merits, this daring novel of a little-known historical rebellion works.

Alternating chapters focus on each of the characters and the horrific tragedies that have brought them to this point in time.My problems with the book were two-fold. First, the zany story of how these three characters – two of them very timid – deal with their current situation strains credibility and reminded me of a situation comedy. When juxtaposed with the horrific tales of bias against immigrants, political injustice, gang warfare, the disappeared, the plight of powerlessness and more, these chapters just struck a wrong chord…as if two discordant notes were being struck simultaneously.There are scenes that are indelibly and realistically rendered – such as the coyotes who are used to bring desperate people to the so-called safety of the U.S. Yet each of the tragedies are so relentlessly dark – paralleling each other – that the result seemed more like an “adapted for screen” version. Without spoilers, I will add that in one of the scenarios, my sympathy waned for a character, and it was hard to believe the transformation after years of emotional frigidity.Isabel Allende is an engaging and skilled wordsmith, and I turned pages quickly.

I didn’t think Ms. Ward could soar to the heights she achieved in her debut, but she has. This is an incredible novel, packed with power, ferocity, and majesty. Often, I found myself reading phrases over and over again because of the sheer beauty of the prose.Interestingly, I sensed thematic similarities in this and my other favorite book of 2017 — Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders. Both integrate the presence of ghosts that are able to haunt us and heal us and who demand attention. But although there is a touch of magical realism in this book, it is grounded in a brutal reality.The focus is a broken family — Leonie, a failed black mother, her white-trash husband Michael whose cousin killed her brother Given and who is about to be released from jail himself, JoJo, her sensitive and paternal thirteen year old son, and the toddler, Michaela, who adores her older brother.There is pain here, lots of pain. Leonie’s father Pop was incarcerated in a brutal prison and there is an unfinished story here that still keeps his soul prisoner. Leonie and Michael need each other with a drug-fueled unhealthy desperation that obliterates their ability to care for their vulnerable kids. JoJo and Kayla cope with ravenous hunger – not only for food but for love – and horrific nausea. The torments of imprisonment, racism, black trauma, and innate hatred are weaved throughout the narrative.How can these ugly elements possess sheer beauty? I wondered that when I read Salvage the Bones and I wondered again here.

Esther, who has fled from New York and the sadness of losing her teenage son, arrives in London to minister to her dying mother. At the end of her life, her mother recalls her own trauma and perceived betrayal from days past, when she fled Central Europe right before the arrival of the Nazis.Another story plays out next door: an Iranian neuroscientist Javad, who has lived and worked in London for years, is concerned about his teenage son Amir, an undergraduate who studies Middle Eastern history and politics.Esther and Javad need each other and it’s no surprise they gravitate together. Each is living his or her own form of exile with “moorings that have been cut free” – in Esther casethrough his necessary exile from his homeland.

Javad, who is intrigued by the phenomenon of neurological symptoms that lack brain pathology, is working with a patient who may be held sway by a dissociative fugue.

Ms. Singer suggests that during these times, we may all be living in a sort of fugue state.There is some real lyrical power in the writing style and the addition of the neurological theme is intriguing.

It has taken years — decades — for this country to come to terms with how this unauthorized war destroyed the promising lives of young men who fought in it. And still, we persist in the folly of sacrificing our youth.Laura Harrington, in poetic and lyrical prose, strives to bridge that understanding. Billy Flynn/and his younger sister Nell have a deep bond and a passion for the natural world. His artistic rendering of birds is executed with precision and mastery. One day, like the birds, he hopes to fly.And fly he does, as a pilot in the Vietnam War, but his helicopter is shot down and the burn injuries he suffers are severe. He wants his life back again —his bonding with the birds and his dream of becoming a pilot—and he is unwilling to accept that the likelihood of recognizing these dreams is close to nil. We witness Billy’s despair: “He is so tired. Tired of doctors, of drinking, tired of trying to talk or not talk, to tell stories, to lie, to know when to shut up. He misses sleep like it’s a country he can’t go to anymore.” He can’t reach in and he can’t reach out. Billy is isolated, and only his best friends gets it: “I know about the guilt phase, the pissed-off phase, the why-me phrase, the pills and girls and alcohol phase…You just have to hang on.”Contrasted against Billy is the disappearance of Billy’s first love, Megan, who may or may not have been abducted. The loss of Megan and destruction of Megan unmoor the tight-knit community, who can’t control or find answers to what is going on. Only Nell, who is poised to leave for college, may have the capacity to escape as the natural order of things goes topsy-turvey.This is a haunting book about the legacy of war and the thin line between the natural and unnatural.

Well, I can absolutely see it becoming a cinematic hit. It’s atmospheric and arresting, with cliffhanger chapter endings, lots of nail-biting suspense and an easy flow to the writing. What A.J. Finn brings to the table that others don’t is that she is immersed in the art of the suspense film.

This is a vast simplification, of course, but it helped me to understand my mixed feelings about White Houses.The book is based on fact: the intriguing relationship between Eleanor Roosevelt and her oft-companion, Lorena Hickok, the AP reporter who was assigned to cover her. Based on more than three thousand letters between the two women, the book fleshes out the very probable story of their love affair.Lorena Hickok, known as “Hick”, had a fascinating story in her own right — a survivor of childhood abuse who became a lead reporter on the Lindbergh child kidnapping and later, the First Friend to the First Lady. Amy Bloom has done ample research and the revelations she makes are compelling: the role, for example, of Missy LeHand, Eleanor’s troubled relationship with her daughter Anna and her spoiled sons, the nuances of living with a charismatic man who draws people to him while often sucking all the air from the room.But while the theme was the desire to create an authentic life in an inauthentic world, the book is largely plot-driven. I was never entirely certain why Eleanor was drawn to Hick above all others. I wanted to know more about the complex emotions that surely must have accompanied being in a fishbowl at a time when a same-gender love affair was misunderstood and often condemned by a vast majority of Americans. In short, I wanted to get beneath the story to fully understand the complexities of a love affair between two fascinating and very complex women.Since I couldn’t quite accomplish that, there were times that I had the uncomfortable feeling of peering into the lives of two women who were fiercely committed to keeping their lives private. The actual love scenes between Eleanor and Hick, while tastefully done, made me feel as if I had pulled off the covers from their protected world – the only oasis Eleanor Roosevelt must have experienced from a very public life.

Anyone who has ever been in a corporate environment will instantly recognize the truths that serve as the foundation for this plot. Many of us have either worked at a company like Ellery Consumer Research Group or have known friends who have.So, if the characters seem just a tad bit stereotypical, it’s for good reason. Rosa Guerrero is the widowed and childless HR Chief who is fiercely loyal to her staff, who serve as substitute family to her. She oversees a gaggle of employees: Rob Hirsch, her burnt-out protégée in danger of being laid off, Lucy Bender who seeks both a promotion and a man who is worthy of her, Kenny Verville with his MBA from Wharton, and Leo Smalls, her overweight and sometimes overwrought surrogate son.All these characters wrestle with the economic turbulence that threatens their job security and the insecurities of their marriages or lack of meaningful relationships.

Perhaps here: it is not yet 2018 and this book has already earned a secure place on my Best of 2018 list. It is a searing indictment of racism, and injustice, a glowing tribute to the part of us that struggles to remain human in the worst of circumstances, and a riveting testimony to the power of the writer.I’ve seen this book compared to Philipp Meyer’s The Son and the works of Cormac McCarthy, but to me, the most apt comparison is to Richard Flanagan’s The Narrow Road to the Deep North. Like Flanagan’s book, this one is savagely beautiful and tells a tale of how one young man comes of age, only to discover all he has lost. I loved Narrow Road so coming from me, this is high praise indeed.Only Killers and Thieves takes place in the nineteenth-century Australia. where two brothers in their mid teens, Billy and Tommy, arrive home to discover a tragedy of senseless proportions. Not knowing where to turn, they rely the only person they know who they believe can help them — John Sullivan, a ruthless and wealthy landowner, who is determined to help them get the revenge they seek. Together with Inspector Noone and his Native Queensland Police, their aim is nothing short of the genocide of the native Kurrong tribe. And these men without a conscience will do everything in their power to use the young brothers’ personal tragedy to their own despicable ends. Paul Howarth – I can’t believe he is a debut writer – refuses to sugarcoat his story, and some of the scenes are so brutal and heartbreaking that I actually needed to pause and catch my breath. The exploration of how Tommy, the more sensitive of the two brothers, undergoes his journey into his personal heart of darkness is wrenching and real.The key theme – the development of Tommy’s moral core and conscience – is stunningly rendered and harkens back to the old question: what makes us human? How do we sustain a sense of empathy and righteousness when our society enfolds us into an umbrella of collective guilt? As Paul Howarth writes, “The only question is the individual’s willingness to act. The rest is veneer, formality, perception…words.”This is an astoundingly good book and I’m so grateful to have the opportunity to be an early reader.

But we stand shoulder to shoulder with the detective. From the very start, we have the same aim – and it’s actually a simple one. We want to know what really happened…”So says Susan Ryeland, the narrator of Magpie Murders. And now is the time for my own confession: I’m not particularly drawn to murder mysteries. Too many are formulaic, relying on the tried-and-true formula of a dead body on page one and a damaged but astute detective who navigates his or her way to the truth. Been there, read that.So why oh why did I end up positively loving this book? The simple answer is that it is unlike any mystery book I’ve read. It’s one mystery novel tucked inside another. We readers peek over Susan’s shoulder as we read Alan Conway’s latest manuscript and we are there by her side as she strives to solve a real-life mystery. The manuscript – supposedly written by the curmudgeon Alan Conway – pays homage to Agatha Christie in all sorts of ways. All the plot points are there: the country house setting, a complex murder with multiple quirky suspects including the town vicar, a bombastic lord of the manor, a prying busybody, and the aging detective who survived a concentration camp and is now facing mortality once again.I won’t get into plot points or how Anthony Horowitz weaves his magic in this meta-fiction mystery. What I will say is that this book is enough to captivate literary readers while totally satisfying fans of classic mysteries, including hidden anagrams, musings on why mysteries have held us in such sway, and how the best mystery writers practice their craft.

And, of course, we also know the symbolism of the fire: burn the prevailing constrictions and self-absorption to the ground.The core conflict of the story is between Mrs. Richardson, a rules follower who has embodies the life we’re all told to strive for: college, marriage, kids, and becoming a pillar of society. She is contrasted with Mia, a devil-may-care visual artist and single mom who rents a house from the Richardsons with her studious teenager, Pearl. Eventually, lines are drawn when a co-worker of Mia’s is forced to abandon her infant Chinese daughter, and friends of the Richardsons, who are white, privileged, and desperate for their own child, take her in and raise her as their own.As a character-driven reader, I felt that this tightly plotted novel, while enjoyable, strained at credibility and sacrificed character development for plot. There is no way for me to write this  without spoilers, so if you haven’t yet read it, STOP RIGHT HERE – SPOILER ALERT.First, we are led to believe that a wealthy man stalks a young Mia and propositions her to bear the child that he and his barren wife have long wanted. The reason is that Mia looks amazingly like his wife Okay—huh? Here is a couple who can easily afford a surrogate and instead, turn to an unknown girl who the husband happens to run across and who has not been thoroughly vetted by them. And children are rarely mirror-images of their parents.Does Mia run for the hills? Absolutely not. She needs money for school and she rather quickly agrees to move forward with this. There is very little introspection; they are “nice people” so “why not?” Then, she changes her mind because of a family death – again, quickly and without introspection.Mrs. Richardson, who is a sometime-journalist, decides to suddenly revive her passion for investigative reporting and investigates Mia’s past because she believes Mia is responsible for the emotional turmoil that her friends her in. She tracks down Mia’s parents, and after years of silence, they suddenly feel compelled to share the story with this journalist-stranger. Oh, and in one particularly egregious passage, the would-be adopted mother of the Chinese baby (this subplot shows how history repeats itself) is so clueless that on the stand, when asked how she would teach the baby about her culture, searches her brain and says, “Well, we go to Chinese restaurants.” This is so dumbed-down as to be unbelievable.And then there’s the Richardson kids. Every stereotype in the world is employed here: the good-looking jock brother, the pretty teen and her black boyfriend (“No one sees race here”) who get “into trouble”, the rebellious younger daughter – and, of curse, the blatant clash between rule followers and free spirits, the haves and the have nots.Last year, I read a book entitled Lucky Boy by Shanthi Sekaran.

In the process, he lays himself bare and reveals the forlornness and yearning of his character. “Hey God where is you you ain’t nowhere”, he writes poignantly.Another story is focused on an aging and damaged writer, whose own life – and that of two close friends – are all spiraling toward death. “The world keeps turning. It’s plain to you that at the time I write this I’m not dead. But maybe by the time you read this””, he tell shis audience.There’s a story titled Doppelganger, Poltergeist about a writing professor’s star student who is convinced that Elvis Presley’s stillborn twin never died and actually took his place after Elvis’ stint in the army. And then there’s the eponymous “The Largesse of the Sea Maiden”, composed of moments both big and small from the life of an ad man. All these damaged characters are at the edge, seeking meaning or at least, cohesion in their lives. Denis Johnson was an astounding writer and he leaves behind a last gift.

Some of them are truly appropriation – white guys acting like they know everything about the black experience. Others are cloyingly politically correct, or saccharine in their plot development.So it was an absolute surprise—and delight—to read Sam Graham-Felsen’s original take on race and privilege. The author actually grew up in Boston and was one of the few white kids at a mostly black inner-city school and he eventually became Obama’s top blogger. Much of this story is his own personal experience—and it shows.First of all, I LOVE the voice. Just about every generation creates its own slang and its own language – keeping the adult world at bay – and Sam Graham-Felsen totally gets it. He has the cadence down to a tee. There’s a rhythm to it and an insider cadence that just plain works.The story is also nuanced; there are no heroes or villains and no attempt to whitewash the thorny racial confrontations. Dave Greenfield, a 12-year-old Jewish boy, is sent to Martin Luther King Jr. school because his hippie parents believe strongly in public education. There he befriends Marlon, who lives in pubic housing and is carrying a heavy emotional load.The two of them connect over a love of the Celtics and their friendship, while guarded, is important to each of them. And then things start to happen. Sam Graham-Felsen explores important themes without trivializing or resorting to easy answers: how does an inter-racial friendship survive in an era of systematic racism? How can a person thrive in a society that defines and boxes in people due to the darkness of their pigmentation? Can any friendship offer a safe place when there are so many forces that threaten to tear it apart?Dave and Marlon must confront their own demons about race, religion, societal standing, and belonging right at a time when they are on the cusp of adolescence. This book feels authentic and the author never cops out in his unrelenting look at racial realities. It also captures Boston in the 1990s, and the struggles of growing up. Quite a feat!

Hermione Hoby can write and she’s not afraid to take risks with her characters. Although she is not a native New Yorker, she channels the New York vibe and her style is edgy, witty in places, and often compulsively page-turning. At the core of her novel is a triangle: young Kate, a London transplant, who is spending the summer in her mother’s friend’s apartment trying to figure out who she wants to be when she grows up. Quickly, she meets Inez, a spellbinding girl with an unusual hobby: answering Craigslist ads and fulfilling the fantasies of men who want to be humiliated. She also hooks up with a “one-hit wonder” middle-aged author named Bill who is weighed down by his glory days…and just happens to be Inez’s father.For me, the biggest problem was that Kate is the main character, but next to the bigger-than-life Inez and Bill, Kate comes across as a cypher. I couldn’t quite understand what either one of them saw in her. Was she a Pygmalion character that each of them wanted to mold and recreate? Was she a mirror in which their foibles were projected? If either of these scenarios were developed, the book would have been more powerful, but I was left feeling that I needed to take this on faith: Inez and Bill were both mesmerized by Kate (more than the other way around). I wanted a little more psychological insight into these characters and a little more reason to invest emotionally in them.

My fear was that Home Fire would be another over-simplified book, painting its Muslim characters as either wild-eyed terrorists or pitiful victims. I needn’t have worried. This is a nuanced book that is good – so good, in fact, that Ms. Shamsie had me in thrall right ‘til the extraordinarily powerful last lines. The book is based loosely on Sophocles’ Antigone, and even in stating that, I’m probably relaying too much. The crux of the plot is an unexpected romance between Aneeka, the twin sister of Parvaiz, who has been seduced into leaving London to work for the so-called media arm of ISIS, and Eamonn, the secular son of the British home secretary who has turned his back on his Muslim faith. Aneeka and Parvaiz were orphaned early on and raised by an older sister who is now studying in America. The bond between the twins is unbreakable.It is far too easy to create spoilers for this book so let me just say this: the themes of duty to country vs. duty to self, natural (or religious) law vs. man-made law and ambition vs. humanity is interwoven with a mesmerizing story of star-crossed lovers in the crossfires of a particularly intense time.

On the first floor, a retired army officer, clearly suffering from PTSD, relates a tale to an unseen army friend, about his young daughter who is left in the care of a possibly dementia-afflicted neighbor. When his little girl, Ofri, goes temporarily missing, he becomes convinced that the old man has taken liberties with her. In attempting to get to the truth, he takes things too far, destroying his marriage and peace of mind. It's a compelling story of a man held hostage to his own internal demons.One floor up, Ayelet writes to her childhood friend in America. Feeling more and more estranged from her husband, she is drawn into a web of intrigue when his neer-do-well brother, Eviatar shows up. Inappropriate things happen…or did they? Is Ayelet going mad, like her mother before her?In the final story, perhaps the richest of the three, a retired judge named Devora leaves phone messages for her husband—now deceased—on their old answering machine. She cannot shake the patina of sadness that is a result of an estrangement from their only son. And then she meets a charismatic man of her age, Avner, who may not be exactly who he first appears to be.These three interconnected novellas sparkle, with wonderful, page-turning prose. But what are the three floors, anyway?

But Georgia Blain sieves out all the cinematic drama, leaving behind nuggets of what’s true and what’s real: the strange, ordered chaos of life, the “lifetime of tales that have not been told, each one shiny and unsullied, ready to be unwrapped and marveled at”, and the dynamics of relationships that are constantly shifting and coming into focus.This is an adult book, casting aside the twists and turns and centering on presenting the characters to the reader and then exposing them, little by little. Flashbacks to an incident that led to the sisters’ estrangement three years ago helps fill in the gaps and provides tools for insights into the characters’ actions. From time to time, we meet Ester’s patients, who counterbalance her own self-imposed restraint.As the book draws to its close, the ending is non-manipulative and downright moving.

He suffers from the yoke of low expectations: no one believes in him and he barely believes in himself. And then the quixotic Vera comes along.Vera places Sonny on “a restless carousel, excitement, dread, excitement.” Although she is, in many ways, a cipher – unknowing and unknowable – she is also Sonny’s fantasy woman and, in ways, his kindred spirit. Neither feels a sense of belonging and each feels unmoored in the gritty world. While Sonny’s demons are right out in the open, Vera’s are held tightly; as readers, we don’t know until the end what drives her.The book is written in the second person tense, a hard feat to pull off, and a tense that is often used to “twin” the reader with the character. Although there were times that I questioned whether Karl Geary was pulling it off, I felt – for the most part – that he did. The reader is forced into inhabiting Sonny’s life and mind, and seeing the unfolding of the affair through his as-yet-unjaded eyes. As a result, his own vacillating emotions, Vera’s unapproachability, and Sharon – his street-smart yet still tender friend – all come fully alive. In ways, this is a book about unfulfilled potential; readers can almost envision how these trapped characters will squander their chances as life disappoints them, time and time again. The book transported me to 1980s working-class Dublin and, to my mind, was totally convincing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Sep 04, 2017","Sep 07, 2017","Sep 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30341480-montpelier-parade

But at the end of the day, I believe it is a love story—an unconventional love story, perhaps, but at its heart, a love story nonetheless.Horace Hopper is a half-Palute ranch hand, a young man who may be irreparably broken after being abandoned by his parents and ultimately, left in the care of Mr. and Mrs. Reese, who own a ranch. There is a true love between Horace and Mr. Reese, who loves him like a son and believes in giving him the freedom to find his own way.When Horace declares that he wants to be a world-renowned lightweight boxer, Mr. Reese lets him go, knowing that the road ahead will be hard and convinced that he will eventually make his way back to the ranching life. What Mr. Reese doesn’t reckon on is Horace’s infinite capacity for self-punishment and his extreme yearning to “be somebody” and prove himself.Mr. Reese is 72 years old with a bad back and a love for ranching. Horace wants to reach back to him but can’t let himself be perceived as a failure. Don’t Skip Out On Me lays bare this dynamic between surrogate father and son, and draws a powerful picture of a wounded boy running on empty, caught within the seedy world of boxing yet unable to let go of his unrealistic dream. Within this spare, muscular prose, there is poignancy and there is heartbreak.

It is, of course, compared to Handmaid’s Tale, as any book that smacks just a little of feminist dystopia will be for years to come. If truth be known, it does, indeed, owe a debt to Atwood, but it strikes out in its own direction.In Louise Erdrich’s vision, “Our bodies have always remembered who they were. And now they have decided to return. We’re climbing back down the swimming-pool ladder into the primordial soup.” Put another way, for no discernible reason, some reverse evolution mechanism is taking place. Fertility is down and babies who are produced are throw-backs. Some long-extinct species are spotted.All this is combined with the story of Cedar, the adopted daughter of Minneapolis liberals and the birth daughter of Ojibwe parents, who finds herself pregnant in the midst of this crisis.Had Ms. Erdrich left the premise with this meaty material, the book would have been superb. Indeed, her writing alone is worth the reading. But inexplicably, too many other elements are introduced, creating a disjointed whole. Rather than focus on the fascinating core story of reverse evolution, Ms. Erdrich shifts to pregnancy as an issue of state security with a long, well-written story of Cedar’s attempt to evade capture, connect to her Ojibwe birth family, and become one of the outliers to save her fetus.There were a few other false starts, too: the back story of the baby’s father introduces and then seems to quickly discard a fantastical element. But perhaps most daunting, the original concept, after initial development, is not paid off.

I was mesmerized by his first novel, Blood-Drenched Beard, and couldn’t wait to read The Shape of Bones. I was not disappointed. The story centers on a young married man who is preparing to climb the virgin mountain, Cerro Benete—one of the final mountains to be conquered—with his boastful best friend. We know the narrator only as Hermano—translated to “brother”—and as he drives to meet that friend, we catch glimpses of his childhood in Esplanada, where he was part of a gang of boys. Every other chapter is structured as a flashback.Through these flashbacks, we learn that Hermono has considered his life to be “an endless rehearsal for a heroic moment that never arrived. A permanent limbo between innocence and heroism, inhabited by ghostly projections of himself, distorted by what he wished he had been or wanted to become.” Increasingly, he punishes his body, embracing more and more strident risks, learning to inure himself from the physical pain. But is that punishment a metaphor for inuring his mind and his essence as well?As the risks and the punishment escalate, Hermano struggles with one particularly haunting moment when his striving for heroism and masculinity deserted him. Can he achieve redemption?

It’s easy to miss the precision dance that Sally Rooney is performing here.But then is this book about the poor choices of youth or about one particularly fractured character who is destined to keep making those choices into adulthood? The book centers on two girls in their early 20s – our narrator Frances and Bobbi, her best friend and one-time lover. Together, they make the acquaintance of a couple a decade older: the composed and successful Melissa and her handsome husband Nick, an emotionally fragile actor whose career seems to be stalled despite an abundance of talent. Inevitably, Frances and Nick hook up, wrecking more damage on their own world and on the worlds of everyone around them.The “conversations” alluded to in the title are eloquently expressed but never get to the heart of things. Frances, who is unable to admit her love for Nick—even to herself—says, “We can sleep together if you want, but you should know I’m only doing it ironically.” Or later: “I just don’t have feelings concerning whether you fxxk your wife or not. It’s not an emotive topic for me.” Of course it is, and the constant self-harm Frances imposes on herself—picking furiously at her nails, biting her inner cheek, cutting herself—reveals the extent that her repression is harming her.As Frances whirls in place, the product of an alcoholic father, an enabler mother, and her own making, the core of Frances reveals itself: she feels like a damaged person who deserves nothing, believing that those she loves are exalted and somehow special. “Suffering wouldn’t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn’t make me special,” she reflects at one point. To reveal oneself is dangerous in a world that often conspires against you. This is one of the most interesting psychological profiles I’ve read in a long time with an ending that made me gasp....more",Notes are private!,0,1417,1,"Aug 20, 2017","Aug 23, 2017","Aug 20, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32187419-conversations-with-friends

For that reason alone, the book will soar toward the top of my personal Best of 2017 list.But the themes and content are also masterly and at the end of the day, this book is about a morally redemptive journey – a delivery, of sorts, from guilt and shame to selflessness, grace and self-forgiveness.Melody Shee is pregnant and untethered, carrying the child of a 17-year-old Traveller boy whom she had been teaching. Her marriage has dissolved into a pattern of rage and emotional savagery. And Melody is still consumed with guilt about her betrayal of her fragile best friend.All We Shall Know is structured into chapters coinciding with the advancement of Melody’s pregnancy – from the end of her first trimester to post-partum. During that time, she will meet a younger, outspoken Traveller woman named Mary Crothery who unwittingly “teaches the teacher” and helps her atone for her past mistakes.As Melody’s life falls into harmony, she will understand what she must do to forgive herself and live an authentic life.

The title page names Raymond Brunet as the writer, with Graeme Macrae Burnet as the translator. Of course, we know that’s not true. Does the author view himself as merely a translator of the facts? And are the facts…actually the facts?Soon enough, we enter the world of the protagonist, the Ultimate Outsider, Manfred Baumann. Manfred’s life is—in a word—unremarkable. He considers himself nothing more than an observer, always struggling to fit in. He lunches regularly at the Restaurant de la Cloche, ordering the same meal nearly every day, going through the same rituals with other diners, heading from there to his bank job where he performs the same duties, and then going home to the same drab place, only to repeat the same rituals the next day. The only thing that breaks his routine is some disturbing news: Adele, his regular waitress whom he sometimes fantasizes about, is missing. No one knows if she has just disappeared or has fallen upon dire circumstances. We do know, though, that Manfred was one of the last people who saw her.Manfred is pitted against Inspector Gorski, and the two of them, unknowingly, share something very important in common. That “something” has the power to implode Manfred’s world and to redeem Gorski’s.. As Manfred’s inherent paranoia and obsessions heighten, Gorki’s own obsessiveness to correct an old wrong increases. In ways, Manfred and Gorski are mirror images of the other: both suffering the pangs of alienation. (In Gorski’s case, he is constantly put down by his wife, who resents his lower-class style and demeanor and lets him know it at every single turn).This book is bound to be compared – a bit unfavorably – to Graeme Macrae Burnet’s masterly later work, His Bloody Project. I preferred to judge each book on its own merits. The Disappearance of Adele Bedeau is a fine psychological mystery with well-developed characters and a post-modern afterword that will make you sit up and think.

Hopefully not, because this is a surprisingly accessible book.

What has become of his son?The theme of the book comes down to this: How do we protect our children, when no matter what we do, the world finds its way in. It is about the fears that have been with us since ancient times when we fall short of being the strong protective parent—the father of light and truth.Archetypal stories are integrated with the one that Mr. LaValle is crafting here. As an antiquarian book dealer, he happens across a first edition of To Kill A Mockingbird (“It’s just a tory about a good father, right? Nobody could live up to it, not in real life…”), and later re-hears the story of Rapunzel (“The old man and woman have a child. But they do nothing to protect it.”) There are also nods to Maurice Sendak’s picture book, Outisde Over There, a story of a baby stolen by goblins.Gradually, the world he lives in becomes transformed—a land of bewitched forests and spooky legends. LaValle writes, “To believe in only the practical, the rational, rhe realistic was a kind of glamour as well. But he couldn’t enjoy the illusion of order anymore. Monsters aren’t real until you meet them.”The monsters today might not be fire-breathing dragons; instead, they can be the fervent need to document every minute on social media, that causes you to leave “a trail of breadcrumbs any wolf would follow; then act shocked when the wolf is outside your door”. As the story develops, allegory blends with the true evils of the modern world, and the book can be read on two levels. The novel’s one fault is that it veers into cinematic unreality, striving a little too hard to untether the reader from her comfort zone. Still, there is real humanity in these pages.

From the Manson murders to the Jonestown tragedy, we’ve seen the magnetic pull of the cult on those with porous boundaries, yet still, the topic is fascinating. Perhaps that’s why novelists – from Margaret Atwood to Claire Vaye Watkins – gravitate to the subject. Rebecca Wait goes back to this well in The Followers—vividly and convincingly spinning a cautionary tale of single mother named Stephanie, working in a dispiriting job, who falls into the spell of a messianic man with dashing green eyes. It is the mundaneness of the situation that fuels its power: Nathaniel woos her with attention, flattery, and sympathy, slowly spinning the web around her. By the time she casts her lot with him, the situation feels all too believable. Unwillingly snared into this web is her daughter Julia, a clear-eyed 12 year old, who isn’t fooled by Nathaniel’s charms and the zombie-like following of his cult, the Ark. As the inevitable plot plays out (we know from the start that Stephanie winds up behind bars and we surmise that she took place in a killing of some kind), the environment sets the stage. Think Wuthering Heights. Here in the isolated moors, jagged rocks stand out and the wind and the rain make it even more foreboding. There’s an air of tension that remains: will Stephanie completely succumb, despite her first-hand knowledge that Nathaniel is not the personal savior he appeared to be? Will Julia be worn down by the endless proselytizing of the cult members?The prose in this novel is spare yet muscular, page-turning yet measured.

Cooke’s debut novel, I Know My Name, is a surprisingly effective and page-turning psychological thriller that delves into the human psyche. There are twinned stories here: Locklan is a Type A businessman who two young children at home—a toddler named Max and a 12-week old baby Cressida—who discovers that his wife is missing. His story is interwoven with his wife’s harrowing tale; we learn quickly that she is abandoned on a fictitious Greek island with no memory of how she got there or who she is.Isolated and lost, both figuratively and literally, all Eloise knows is that she was rescued from a battered boat by a small group of inhabitants who have temporarily taken refuge on this uninhabited island. Quickly, she figures out whom she can trust and whom she can’t. But how did she get there to begin with? Half a world away, her husband and the authorities ponder that question and no one seems to have a clue…least of all the missing woman herself.Some astute readers will guess where this is all going. Certainly, C.J. Cooke drops a couple of clues. My mind, however, took me in another direction and I was in it for the entire ride. This book strikes right to the core of identity, self-discovery, and the challenges of a modern marriage.

Put another way, even the smallest step changes lives immeasurably.And so it is in this satisfying new novel by Joan Silber. Reyna is involved with a petty thief named Boyd, who is doing time at Rikers Island. He leaves the stint mostly unrepentant and soon enough, Reyna is drawn into his cigarette smuggling scheme. As the mother of a toddler, she backs away, setting in motion a chain of events that affects her life and the lives of those she knows—and doesn’t know.Each chapter focuses on a different interrelated character and each is sublimely written.

There’s Bruno, a young German adventurer, who travels to Turkey with his two friends to pilfer Turkish antiquities…and others. The beauty of Joan Silber’s writing is that I never felt uprooted in moving from one story to the next.

After all, it’s cerebral, intelligently written, thought provoking, and brilliantly complex.But I am simply a reader who likes to capture my reading experience and share my thoughts with others. And for me, this book was a thing to be admired rather than loved.There are two parallel stories. One is the story of Jules Epstein, who goes missing in Israel after going through a sort of metamorphosis where he sheds much of his wealth. In the second thread, a novelist—who just happens to be named Nicole—also heads to Israel, where she, too—metaphorically and physically—disappears, at least temporarily. While there, her interest is peaked by some unsettling news about Franz Kafka, who—no coincidence—famously wrote The Metamorphosis. The Metamorphosis is, of course, about transformation and both Epstein and Nicole are in the process of becoming transformed. This is, at its core, a novel about the idea of self-invention as one sheds one’s society-imposed skin. It also has some fascinating thoughts on the endurance and need of literature, in particular, Jewish literature. Lastly, it’s hard to ignore the uncanny resemblances between the character Nicole and the author herself; the ruminations on a crumbling marriage (in her case, to Jonathan Safran-Foer).So why did I merely admire and not love the book? Perhaps because, for me, it was too cerebral at the expense of emotional. Too often, I felt as if I were reading a contemplative essay – on the outside looking in rather than enveloped by the story. For those who are most attracted to elegant novels that make you think and challenge your perceptions on true identities, by all means, give this a try.

Some use their art to transcend the Holocaust and prove that in the arc of history, art will always trump evil; among these works are White Hotel, Mischling, and Zone of Interest. The vast majority of works, however, exploit it to provide readers with a sense of moral outrage combined with a satisfying sense of redemption (“I could never do THAT.”)At a time when, incredibly, anti-Semitism is again on the rise, these novels are necessary so that the lessons of history won’t fade into the background. I “enjoyed” Rachel Seiffert’s novel, if “enjoyed” is the right word. She’s a good writer. But did she add anything to the many shelves of Holocaust-themed books? That’s the question I asked myself.Her book takes place in the Ukraine in 1941, as German troops march in to murder the Jews. As the Jews quake with terror, not knowing their fate, two young boys escape: Yankel and his little brother. This story is integrated with two others: the story of Yasia, a marsh girl in her late teens who was on the cusp of marriage before her fiancée cast his lot with the Reds, and German engineer Otto Pohl who is masterminding a road and whose conscience refuses to let him simply do his job.In cinematic fashion, the stories are developed, and the characters earn our empathy; in short, we root for them. Parts of the story are, of course, preordained. But there is also a formulaic sense—we know these stories will integrate and if we’re honest with ourselves, we have a feeling of where each character will end up in the end.For me, this is a hard book to rate. It’s a good book, plot-driven, fast-moving, and capable of creating all the emotions it sets out to do.

There, she is forced to learn “the truth of the dirty world (showing) her that her own impulse was to meet its filthy citizens not with a consoling cloth, but with a curse, a punch in the face.”She makes her decision knowing she is flawed too, and with a greater sense of self.Is it better to elect chaos busyness, bustling…rambunctious kids, overflowing ashtrays, cloudy classes? Or is the serenity of religion, the focus on purity and sacrifice and eternal rules the more appealing way? As a non-believer, there were times while reading the book that I chafed—the pressure on an idealistic and naïve young girl to become a noviate and give up the comfort of married life, for example, or the equating of lovemaking with sin.

Reaching out into his distant past, he chooses a childhood neighbor named Avishai Lazar – a district court justice and a grieving widower --to provide feedback about what he sees.The power of this novel is that the reader—like the audience—is placed in the position of witness, unable to turn away yet increasingly unsettled about the lengths to which Dov is inflicting pain upon himself. This is a confident author, unafraid to take risks with his character, and these risks reap ample rewards. As the audience clamors for easy laughs, and as more and more make their way to the exit (Dov actually tallies the disgruntled guests on a stage chalkboard), the stakes keep raising for the audience members who remain. Dov, a one-time scrawny kid who learned to use humor as a shield against his abusive father and neighborhood bullies—is a man who is in genuine pain and is seeking a type of self-forgiveness.As an added reward, David Grossman knows the complex rhythm of stand-up comedy—reading the audience, giving it what it wants, and yet consistently forcing the audience from its collective comfort zone. There is an urgency to this story and the reader begins to feel complicit—wanting to reach out and provide comfort while, at the same time, furtively looking behind for a way out. I thought this book was mesmerizing and extraordinarily powerful. It certainly deserves the Man Booker prize it earned and it will certainly be in my Top Ten this year.

Fortunately my husband had an amicable and transparent divorce, but I distinctly remember past relationships and the obsessions I’ve felt with the past “Mrs. So-and-So.”With Sisters, Lily Tuck aptly and skillfully captures this obsession. Her unnamed narrator spends ample time fantasizing about the first wife—what she was like, her habits and passions and how the twof them measure up o up. Not unlike Daphne Du Maurier’s unnamed second wife in Rebecca, the fantasy takes on a life of its own.The beauty of the book is in Lily Tuck’s use of pronouns: “she” refers to the ex and is always italicized, the two children they shared are typically referred to as “his daughter” or “his son” (and, in rare cases, “her daughter/son”, but never “their”.) Of course, the relationship between our narrator and her husband stems from a betrayal, and so, as this short novel (a novella, really) careens towards its conclusion, we recognize that the author has a trick or two up her sleeve.

Here we meet Mark Firth – a contractor from the Berkshires – who is in NY planning to give a disposition against a shady character who swindled his family out of their savings.Mark is contrasted against Philip Hadi, a mega-wealthy hedge fund manager who brings his family to the Berkshires permanently after an unsubstantiated rumor of another 9/11-type New York attack. Mark and those who gravitate in his orbit (his wife, his brother and sister, his workman) become haunted by “unlived lives, by the various corpses of possibility.”When Hadi – for sentimental and self-serving reasons – decides to take over as the town’s selectman, the scene is set. Does Hadi represent economic salvation or a descent into dependence? Does the pursuit of one’s own interest multiply into the common good or is it just about the rich getting more powerful? Is the “little guy” being systematically erased or is it still possible for him or her to grab on to the fading threads of the American dream? And do those who are blessed with wealth feel purified by that wealth, and if so, can their motives really be pure…or are they organically suspect?All these questions and more are explored in The Locals.

As the tormented narrator wrestles with the weight of parental expectations and career aspirations, Eric – who was lovingly supported and cheered on by his own caring parents – finds the path forward much easier.For anyone who has encountered a fork in the road and asks, “What do I really want”, this disarming book will resonate.

It has been a while since I’ve devoured a novel this magnificent. In Essex Serpent, Sarah Perry hasn’t just crafted a novel. She’s created a world.It’s a world ruled by reason and order, a touch of faith, and fantastical beings that have no explanation. Set in Essex – not coincidentally, a location where a mythical winged serpent scared locals out of their wits in 1669 and where infamous witch trials were held – the novel jumps forward to the end of the nineteenth century. It is there that a young widow named Cora, mercifully freed from the chains of a restrictive and abusive marriage, travels with her autistic son and companion Martha. And it is there that she meets Will who is her equal in intelligence and who views the world in a separate way.The town is believed by its denizens to have been visited by the return of the Essex Serpent. But what is the Essex Serpent, anyway? One might define it as the collective id, a giant metaphor for individual and community guilt. Or, if that’s a bit high-falutin’, then how about an evolutionary throw-back, the Fata Morgana trick of mind and light, a children’s fable, or an actual curse that’s been placed on the village. Or, perhaps it is a form of solace or even salvation. In short, the Essex Table is a sort of Rorschach test: it can be whatever the beholder believes it is. Or, to put it in the words of Will: “I begin to see how it might have appeared to us all in its various guises, and that far from there being one truth alone, there may be several truths, none of which it would be possible to prove or disprove.”The beauty of this book is it so skillfully echoes so many genres and does so seamlessly. There are hints of Dickens’ works such as Bleak House combined with a notorious monster story (Bram Stoker, anyone?) For American readers, some scenes will evoke Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. And for all, certainly, Jane Austen’s Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will not be too far from mind. But it is the themes that drive the book, or more precisely, the dichotomy of themes: reason vs. faith, science vs. superstition, fear vs. empowerment, the privileged class vs. its rural counterpart. To quote Will again, “We are all shortsighted.” The truth – even the truth of Will and Cora’s gradual closeness – is multi-faceted. And it’s this thought that Sarah Perry reveals, again and again.I rarely mention jacket design, but this design by Peter Dyer deserves a call-out. It is exquisite, as is the book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Six stars.

John Irving’s works are characterized by two key themes: the absent parent who looms large in his/her offspring’s life, and the role of predetermination merged with coincidence. Both these themes are in ample display here.The book opens with a bang: a teenage girl is humiliated, emotionally abused, and cast out of the church when her pregnancy is revealed. That girl is Cyril Avery’s unknown birth mother, who appears intermittently in his life. Adopted by a wealthy and eccentric Dublin couple who insist that his stay in a “tenancy” and that he is “not really an Avery”, Cyril is adrift both at home and in the broader Irish theocracy.Attracted to a charismatic and girl-chasing friend Julian Woodbead, Cyril – who is gay – learns early on to lead a shadow life, suppressing desires and trying to figure out where he belongs.Yet this novel – bawdy and comedic in parts, poignant and searing in others – is not just a depiction of Cyril’s struggles, but also the struggles of Ireland. As Cyril evolves from self-loathing, denial and crippling shame, so does his country, which rejects the scandalous, hypocritical and abusive church structure in favor of a more accepting and equalitarian stance.The book isn’t perfect: one of Cyril’s two great love interests is too idealized, the requisite AIDs section doesn’t quite have the force of, say, Tim Murphy’s excellent novel Christadora, and the first two-thirds of the book have a more vibrant energy, likely fueled by the author’s own anger at the shameful treatment of those who are gay. Yet at no point does the quality of the book really flag. I was totally engrossed in this redemptive book and in awe of how John Boyne merged a sense of comedic bravado with heartfelt fury at how the church attempted to destroy the lives of those who stepped outside the lines of its orthodoxy.Two things in closing: this is not a “gay book”. It is a human book and a redemptive one at that, which is must reading for anyone who is traveling the journey to self-acceptance. And, while coincidence plays a heavy role, those who appreciate Irving will recognize how predetermination can impact our individual stories. I closed the book sorry to be parting company with Cyril Avery, whom I had grown to like and respect enormously. 4.5 stars, rounded up....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Jun 07, 2017","Jun 14, 2017","Jun 07, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30839467-the-heart-s-invisible-furies

Absolutely. The prose is lyrical and fresh. Is it based on a strong premise? Yes again. Megan Hunter marries two increasingly popular themes: climate change apocalypse (in this case, London is flooding) and new parenthood (the first-person narrator’s water breaks at the same time that London is plunged into bedlam.None of the characters have names; they are referred to by alphabetical letters such as R or O.

Indeed, the scenes are strongest that focus on baby Z and how having a baby literally upends one’s world. There is a sweet authenticity in witnessing Z’s growth and his milestones.The problem is that the rest of the book is written in a form of shorthand. We don’t know enough about the life-imperiling environmental crisis and the perils that emerge. Unlike, say, the excellent Station Eleven, the dystopian background feels like mere filler.At the end of the day, I viewed this as more of an outline, or an “impressions of a scene” piece, wishing wholeheartedly that Megan Hunter had added more.

That much is true: Andrew and I are cousins (although Andrew might argue that all humankind is composed of cousins, even if it’s thirty times removed). What is also true is that even if we weren’t, I would still 5-star this book because it’s thought-provoking, intelligently written, fascinating in parts, and also carries an important message: we are squandering our future by turning our collective backs on the knowledge of science.Andrew’s premise is this: intuitive theories impede not just how much we think but how we live—the choices we make, the advice we take, the goals we pursue. The problem with relying on intuition, instead of research-based evidence, is two-fold: first, intuitive theories are usually wrong. And second, they can actually cause harm, as is evidenced by a distrust of pasteurization or vaccination because they’re not “pure” or not taking action on climate change because “it doesn’t feel warmer.”The book is divided into two parts: intuitive theories of the physical world and intuitive theories of the biological world. Here is where I need to interject that I have an atrophied left brain, and have never had a firm understanding of “all things logical”, including the sciences and math. Fortunately, the exposition is very accessible without feeling dumbed down. Take matter, for example. The subhead is: What is the world made of? How do those component interact? Or take gravity: What makes something heavy? What makes something move?While the first half of the book was more of an expository nature, the second half really ignited my imagination because it touches on questions like: what makes us alive? Why do we grow older? Why are there so many life forms and how do they change over time? I had to question my assumptions of why one thing (say, a plant) is alive and another (say, the sun) is not and how we evolve and grow. Most importantly, in this era of religion-led anti-evolution fervor, I recognized what’s really at stake: nothing less than understanding and accepting the trajectory of life/death and recognizing why living things are so exquisitely adapted to their environments.By recognizing the nuances, we can accept that aging, for example, is one continuous change rather than a series of discrete changes rather than one continuous change and that inheritance is the reproductive transmission of genetic information, not just a consequence of nurture. Yes, scientific knowledge complicates our understanding of the world rather than dumb it down or force us to believe a magical force will keep us safe in times of trouble. But with so much at stake – from stem cell research to life-saving antibiotics, form nuclear energy to climate change—how can we afford to continue to live blindly?

It’s a fable-of-sorts of two young girls – Julia and Cassie – who were once “besties” in Roylton, Massachusetts, and who diverge on different paths as they enter an uncertain adolescence, driven by vastly different expectations.It is those expectations that shape the destiny of these two girls: “You only see what you expect to see. Your brain lets the rest go.” Cassie, early on, is consigned to the ranks of the disappeared—“all those girls and women snatched by loners or neighbors, battered by fathers, dismembered by jilted lovers, raptured from the bike path or the shopping mall or the late-night bus stop to an invisible and unimagined and nonexistent hereafter…”So yes, we, as readers, suspect early on that Cassie will end up being one of “those girls” while her friend Julia will thrive. As in many fables, there’s a leering stepfather who may (or may not) be up to no good, plenty of unsubstantiated rumors, and a constant yearning on Cassie’s part for a father she never knewJulia and Cassie are emblemic, and therefore, the book is really less about these girls and more about what it means to be a girl – growing up learning to be afraid, choosing to don a “poisoned cloak” that can kill rather than liberate, recognizing that at the end of the day, we may be powerless to save ourselves let alone each other. It’s also about our yearning for a story with an arc – motives, climax, resolution—and what happens when a so-called victim doesn’t fall into that tidy trajectory and strains against her own story.I am not the kind of reader who needs or relies on a story arc, but still, I wanted something more. I’ve restlessly tried to explore what was missing for me, and I think it’s the push-pull between the fable and more grounded elements of the story. The coming-of-age story – two girls who grow apart and embrace their individual destinies – is not unique; what is unique is how Ms. Messud works to universalize the story and provide it with resonating truths.

Naomi Codrington puts that theory to the test in this sinister thriller by Lawrence Osborne. Naomi is visiting her father and wicked stepmother on the Greek Island of Hydra after being fired from her job at a British law firm. Amoral, narcissistic, resentful and ice cold – the female equivalent of Patricia Highsmith’s Mr. Ripley – Naomi happens across two malleable people: Samantha, a beautiful, emotionally undeveloped America, and eventually, Faoud, a young Syrian migrant who appears to have escaped at great risk from the chaos.Naomi diabolically engineers a plot, seemingly to equalize the disparity between the wealthy American and Brit and the impoverished Syrian. But it goes horribly awry and many people are affected. To go further into the plot would deprive readers of the joy of discovery. So I’ll just say this: Beautiful Animals is not a typical “hang on to the seat of your pants” thriller; rather, it is a fascinating psychological study of Naomi and her influence on those around her. Naomi’s ability to “step quietly from one life into another” is an insightful look about how a sociopathic mind works and how regret is not a useful emotion for those without empathy.Do not go into this book thinking it is a typical story arc – a deed is done, the bad ones are punished, the good triumph.

Hannah’s husband – Bo’s father – was inadvertently killed in a hunting accident by a neighbor, Paul Younger. Bo’s brother, Sam, is MIA in Vietnam; he left behind a pregnant fiancée named Ruth, who just happens to be Paul Younger’s daughter. In ways, the book can be read as a thinly-veiled parable. In the bible, Ruth – a Moabite -- married into a Hebrew family. A model of loving-kindness, Ruth accompanies her mother-in-law to a foreign land, playing a key role in Naomi’s rehabilitation. There she meets Boaz in the field. After overcoming the obstacle of having a relative with a stronger claim (the Mosaic requirements in Deuteronomy), Boaz takes Ruth as his wife.In The Signal Flame, Ruth may seem like a secondary character to Bo, but she the pivotal one, whose purpose it to heal the sadness, anger, and emptiness of mother and son. She and she alone will, through fortuitous and heart rendering circumstances, will be in the position to lead them to a sense of peace. Beginning during the Easter season and ending on Christmas, the novel is meant to convey a sense of rebirth and hope.This is a quiet novel that eschews the bells and whistles in favor of insightful looks into the human condition and the ordinary moments of daily life. As such, it calls to mind books by Marilynne Robinson. It demands the reader’s absorption and concentration. It is the second book of the trilogy that began with The Sojourn, and the ending had me positively clamoring to read the final installation. ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"May 17, 2017","May 23, 2017","May 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430743-the-signal-flame

She’s already gone through more than any child should bear: life with an unreliable (her word), drug-addicted single mother, a few failed foster placements, and now the opportunity to live with “forever parents” in a Blue House.All of this sounds like the making of a predictable and maudlin book, but in the hands of Benjamin Ludwig, it’s not. Perhaps the reason is that in the aftermath, Mr. Ludwig shares that he and his wife adopted an autistic teen—so he knows whereof he speaks. And perhaps the reason is because Ginny Moon, the character, is so darn believable.She’s literal-minded, sure, and she’s also obsessive: consistently asking to be reunited with the “baby doll” she was forced to leave behind when she was taken from her abusive birth mother. Her frantic fears for the safety of the baby doll hold the key to the entire story, and as the truth unfolds, it’s impossible to not fall in love with this very flawed, very human, and often confused young teen. The voice sounds authentic.What I loved about this story is that Benjamin Ludwig never cops out with one-dimensional portrayals. The adoptive parents, Maura and Brian, are humans, not martyrs, and they don’t always do or say the right thing and yes, they get frustrated and downright angry with the situation. The birth mother, too, is portrayed in more than black and white—truly loving her daughter but not having the first clue about what healthy love really means and failing miserably in protecting and nurturing.I went into this novel a skeptic, expecting a kind of “chick lit” read about a teen who surmounts her challenges and emerges victorious. But there’s also a deeply human element about what happens when one person becomes the biggest obstacle to receiving the love and safety she so desperately wants. I cheered for—and cared about—Ginny and her push-pull struggle to fit into a stable life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"May 07, 2017","May 10, 2017","May 07, 2017",,Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/34078013-ginny-moon

Most of the characters are middle-aged and many are dealing with the indignities of aging: a first set of bifocals, for example. Peppered in are strong observations of – among other things – gender inequality, the problems inherent with out-of-control capitalism, the pressure to identify a successful albeit unfulfilling career.Helen Simpson’s prose is easy to read, which belies, of course, the fact that all effortless prose takes a good deal of effort to make it that realistic. And whether a reader loves or merely likes this book will, in large part, depend on what he or she seeks in a short story.For me, I wanted a little less in-your-face “here’s how to think” narrative. Take, for example, Erewhon, where Ms. Simpson takes the so-called natural order and turns it on its ear, with the woman firmly ensconced in the man role, working too hard and not understanding her put-upon spouse. Yes, it was fun to read and yes, it revealed how the unequal set-up is not a good thing, but I wanted more subtlety. Kentish Town is about a book club meeting – focusing on Dickens – and again, the sense of subtlety is missing: “We’ve allowed a pack of shameless greed-merchants and a few brainiacs with maths PhDs to rig the entire system over the last twenty years so that nobody can understand it.”The last and longest story – Berlin – in which a middle-aged couple travels to see Wagner’s entire “Ring” cycle, a catalyst to tearing down the emotional distance they’ve built up, was, for me, the most satisfying.

As metaphor, Jess Winters – a transplanted girl who ends up with her mother in a small Arizona town – disappears early on during one of her nightly walks. Those who are looking for whodunits will be disappointed because that’s not what this novel is about. What it IS about is how Jess becomes, becomes the shared story of the town, spotlighting their own “losses, secrets, guilt, failure, embedded in one shining, curly-haired girl.”Jess, symbolically, becomes part of the land, swallowed up by it, becoming owned by it. The story centers less on Jess than those surrounding her – her mother, Maud…her best-friend, Dani Newell…and Dani’s father, Adam, who believes he is in love with her. Other characters circle the wagons as well, and we gain insights into them and discover how one young girl becomes part of the puzzle of their lives.This is a good book – well-written, evocative, and successful in what it wants to accomplish – detailing the pocket of loneliness inside of each of the townspeople and showing how, by revisiting the story of Jess, they find a sense of possibility in their own lives. There are places where the book does not live up to its expectations – a central unconsummated love affair, for example, did not work for me for reasons that would necessitate spoilers.

It’s well written and caustic, dealing with Big Issues such as social and religious strivings and the meaning of being Jewish. As someone of Jewish descent, I should have liked it more than I did; often, I found myself wondering how those who didn’t grow up with the Jewish experience would relate. The title – Moving Kings – refers to David King, an American Jew who inherited his father’s furniture-moving business and whose life is – well, rather a mess, with an ill-advised affair with his office manager (leading to a divorce), a messed up daughter fresh out of rehab, and a need to somehow impress the rich Republican WASPS. Soon we meet the second main character, Yoav, King’s young Israeli cousin, who has just completed his compulsory service in the U.S. army and, for lack of anything else to do, ends up crossing the ocean and working for David. The third part of this troika is a Vietnam veteran named Avery Luter, who is about to get evicted from his foreclosed home by the King movers.The book has a lot to say: the loose ties of family, the transference of those family bonds to the army or to business, the quest to find something to prove, the battlefields that exist within us and outside of us. It’s about the difficulty of living a true Jewish life when there’s nothing tangible to fight for. On a political level, it’s about repossessing what is not ours to take and the continual struggle to let ourselves be seen.But most of all, it’s about moving, literally and figuratively: moving from army service to civilian life, moving from childhood to maturity, moving through those ever-present states of internal and external combat, striving to move forward when the world is turning backwards.

This intelligently written, character-driven novel stands on its own merits, using Mr. Sendak as a departure point and then building a wholly original character in Mort Lear, who is cared for by his trusted assistant Tomasina (Tommy) Daulair – whose brother Dani just happens to be the prototype for his own character, Ivo.When Mort dies – and we know he has died from the first few pages – Tommy is named his literary executor and is left with a lot of memories and a palpable feeling that she may not have known the man to whom she has dedicated much of her life. When the well-known British actor and heartthrob Nick Greene shows up at her door – wanting to find out more about Mort Lear because he wants to inhabit him in a soon-to-be movie – both realize that knowing more about Mort may be key to knowing more about themselves.Julia Glass is a fine writer and as a result, she does not rely on suspenseful plot twists and bells and whistles to elucidate the journeys of her characters. It might have been easy for her to fall into clichés with Mort’s younger gay lover who is dying from AIDS, or the spurned Book Museum director who believed her museum would eventually inherit Mort Lear’s archives. Instead, each character is fleshed out and becomes his or her own person.The questions this book raises are: do we really ever know another human being? Do we ever truly know ourselves? Are each of us acting a role in life? Does it matter that mysteries remain in the end? Should we ever expect to become “whole” by trying to solve those mysteries? The novel, I believe, could benefit from a bit of editing here and there, but still maintained my attention all the way through.At one point, Mort says in an interview, “A story is just like a road. It’s got to take you somewhere. Somewhere fun, somewhere new! The trip would be dull indeed without some unexpectedly sharp corners.” Here, in a House Among the Trees, Julia Glass is not particularly taking her readers somewhere new.

But in a The Confusion of Languages is described as a “shattering portrait of a collision between two women,” and in its most elemental sense, it is. But in a deeper sense, the book is about what the whole striving human race has in common – desire, always reaching and needing more.Cassie Hugo and her husband Dan – veterans of the U.S. Embassy in Jordan – welcome a new American couple, Margaret and Crick Brickshaw. The women, despite their superficial common ties, are really polar opposites. Cassie has grown bitter and distrustful, unable to conceive a child, convinced that there’s danger in even the most fundamental gestures of friendship with the Jordanians. Margaret, the mother of a young boy, is naïve, unfiltered, and open-hearted, eager to connect with people and believing the best intentions in every interaction. And then Margaret suddenly goes missing.There is much to recommend the book. For one thing, it’s truly addictive. Siobhan Fallon knows how to tell a story and ratchet up the tension, and once I began, there was totally involved. In addition, this author writes from a position of authority. As a military wife (she is the author of You Know When the Men Are Gone, which I loved), she has actually lived in Jordan and her insights into the culture ring with authenticity. There are powerful insights here, and a drilling down to how each of us is constantly craving more.There are a few niggling things, though. Once Margaret disappears, Cassie finds Margaret’s diary, using it to gain an understanding of the hidden life of her friend. The conceit of the diary is almost always hard for an author to pull off, because few diarists who are not professional writers write coherent and linear accounts, complete with quotation marks to indicate dialogues they’ve had. The diary didn’t work – for me.In addition, there were nuanced situations that were given short shrift. Margaret is, at her core, a caregiver (first for her Mother, who suffered from lupus and then – switch one vowel! – to Mather, the toddler son she raises almost single-handedly. The smorgasbord of emotions that derives from caregiving is hinted at, but never reaches the complexity of real life. The two troubled marriages, too, reach resolutions that belie the years of discord.Having said that, I will still urge my friends to read this book.

No. You don’t get off that easy. This is a story about people as real as you are, and as real as I once was before I became a bodiless thing floating up here in the sky.”Intrigued? How could you not be? This book is simply magnificent, a testimony to where the creative mind can take us and an affirmation of why I read. The characters are fresh and original, from the self-named Ma Taffy who was blinded by rats but still sees plenty, to the sniveling and self-important schoolteacher, Mr. Saint-Josephs, who takes it upon himself one day to cut off the dreadlocks of a little boy named Kaia – a name that literally means “home.”Why does the act of cutting off dreadlocks matter…and how does it lead to something that Jamaicans call the “autoclaps”…and what we know as “calamity”? Kei Miller, in prose that soars and captivates, seamlessly weaves in the history of the Rastafarian heritage, particularly that of a charismatic preacher named Alexander Bedward with the ability to levitate. The flying preacherman, as he was called, becomes not just a metaphor but a symbol. As Kei Miller writes, “You may as well stop to consider a more urgent question; not whether you believe in this story or not, but whether this story is about the kinds of people you have never taken the time to believe in.”To really understand one’s sense of self, Mr. Miller suggests, you need to have something to believe in. And uncovering what that “something” is challenging when the people are subjugated, disrespected, and unempowered. Otherwise, the only way to “fly away to Zion” is by dying, and indeed, our narrator (whose identity is only unveiled at the end), has had to suffer that fate.

In fact, it would seem like a recipe for disaster.And yet. And yet. Sara Baume pulls it off, creating a masterwork that focuses on the very essence of life and weaves the reader into the world of her 25 year old artist narrator, Frankie. At the same time, she enlightens the reader on some of recent history’s most intriguing and seminal works of art (which are conveniently listed in the epilogue) and presents a convincing and knowledgeable study of the depressed mind. Quite a feat!The very structure of the book is sui generis. Each chapter begins with the name of an animal or bird (robin, rabbit, rat, fox, etc.); each dead animal has been stumbled across by Frankie, who photographs them. The photographs (which were not included in the advanced reader’s copy I read) is hinted to reveal the disintegration of Frankie’s mind and the senseless violence of an unfathomable world.Frankie herself, like the animals she photographs for her art, is a creature of nature, living alone in the rural and vacant home of her deceased grandmother in Ireland. Refreshingly, she maintains strong ties with her family, particularly her mother, but she is untethered. She is barely there, determined to take up as little space as possible. Themes from Sara Baume’s magnificent debut book, Spill Simmer Falter Wither resonate here too. Frankie is more connected and self-aware than Ray, the outcast from that book, but her skills of observation, love of the landscape, and ability to channel life through her resourceful mind, are all here.

The structure of the book unfolds like Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, with one story placed inside the other. The result is a searing look at the devaluation of women as they age, the shaky boundaries between fantasy and reality, and the very nature of love itself (electing, not selecting). Narrated through taped interviews with her therapist and then expanded into the disciplinary hearing of that therapist, and relayed by the writer herself (who happens to be named Camille Laurens), the structure calls to mind His Bloody Project, a book I enjoyed immensely, as well as J.M. Coetzee’s Summertime (which has a character named Coetzee). As the novel deepens, readers get a sense of what the true Camille Laurens is really after: how our minds inform the fictions we create about ourselves, and how we create new realities (which may or may not be real).In today’s times of social media – combined with metafiction – it is terrifyingly easy to substitute desire for love, recreate our own lives with any trajectory we choose, and even become our own fiction if we so desire.

Both are coping with the aftereffects of coming of age under the guidance of bad mothers, both are self-involved and often self-destructive, both have picked horrific men in the past, and now, both are obsessed with Seth. They have something else in common as well: a distorted view of reality and the need to manipulate their realities.

As an artist, S is also fascinated by the photograph. But does the photo – the one in Kit’s photo collection – truly reflect her now, or at that point of time? Who are we, really, when we are determined to hide our true essence? Can we simply morph into someone else at will? And do our feeble attempts at verbal communication reveal or hide who we really are or is it better to be like Seth – non-verbal and authentic?This would be a 5-star book except when the patina of reality is held up to the lenses, the premises begin to fade away. I had to stop and ask myself questions at each juncture: would Lady, really entrust her young toddler to someone who was so erratic and obviously had a problem with alcohol…all without references?

The cover artfully captures the theme: a man attempting to move forward who is crippled by his shoe ties and within seconds of taking a fall.Those who have read Elena Ferrante’s extraordinary books – Days of Abandonment and The Lost Child, two of my favorite books ever – will sense some similarities, which does not take away from the power of the book. The scenes are emotionally raw, filled with insight and pathos, wrenching in its autopsy of the marriage between Aldo and Vanda.There are ties here, yes – constraining ties of marriage and children, ties of societal expectations, and ties that eventually trip up his two children who have been emotionally harmed – and there is fury, from the very first page, as Vanda confronts (in epistolary form) the damage done by Aldo, who has left her for a younger woman. And there are boxes, too – both figurative and metaphorical – starting with an artistic cube that Aldo collected and transcending outward into the boxes we each put ourselves in as we strive for something more but settle for an inauthentic life.The marital house that Vanda and Aldo live in is also a character in its own right. Without spoilers, the house is key to the order and disorder of their lives, mirroring the falsity and coming apart of this couple.A wonderful forward by Jhumpa Lahiri, the translator, provides a number of insights and helped me to admire the book even more. I decided to read it after finishing this slim novel, and I would encourage others to do so as well. By waiting, I was able to formulate my own thoughts. I think I would have been too influenced had I read it initially (although Ms. Lahiri scrupulously avoids spoilers, preferring to focus on themes).This brilliant book deserves all the praise I think it will get. It’s a great study on how a book should be written.Footnote: Right after writing this , I discovered that Dominico Starnone is the husband of Anita Raja – the literary translator who was “outed” as Elena Ferrante. ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Mar 21, 2017","Mar 22, 2017","Mar 21, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31243077-ties

And of course, it’s not.The theme that binds all eight of these mini-works together is identity – identity that evolves and shifts as a result of changing landscapes and conflicts of self. Let’s start with Dreaming of Ghana, by far the longest in page count. Aakash – a young man who is a profound disappointment to his parents – begins to have strange dreams about Ghana, suspecting that “his dream was a lie, like the circus elephants.” That is, until a young, very dark woman appears, the personification of his dreams and a means of writing a new reality. The way the story plays out – the changes that the meeting evokes in Aakash and his roguish well-to-do friend – held my attention to the final gasp-worthy sentence.The eponymous story Mad Country is my second favorite. In this one, a Type A Naalese businesswoman named Anamika inadvertently is held in detention by police afterattempting to discover the belongings of her neer-do-well son. At first put-out by being inadvertently labeled a political prisoner and forced to mingle with the riff-raff of society, Anamika values and identity undergo an astounding transformation.Other stories also are compelling: Beggar Boy, for example, where a privileged young man named Ramesh develops an obsession with the poor, even donning filthy old clothes and taking on their identity. And America the Great Equalizer – the only story set in the United States – where a promising Nepali graduate student learns the reality of being a black man in America.

Haruki Murakami believes you already know: ”You are a pastel-colored Persian carpet, and loneliness is a Bordeaux wine stain that won’t come out.”The state of being Men Without Women is dark, melancholy, unsettling and even existential. These story gems all examine that unnatural state, with revelatory, beautifully-crafted narratives that seep into the mind and hold it captive.Take, for example, the first story, Drive My Car. A theatrical actor—a widower—named Kafuku is forced to hire a mostly silent and unattractive chauffer, whose very stalwartness makes her a receptacle for Kafuku’s revelations about the unfaithfulness of his departed wife. This pitch-perfect story belongs in future anthologies.In many cases—as in the one above—women need not be attractive or even charismatic to be valued. In An Independent Organ, Dr. Tokai, a confirmed bachelor and plastic surgeon, finally falls victim to unrequited love. Brilliantly, poignantly, Haruki Murakami describes his unraveling as he wrestles with the quintessential existential question: “Who in the world am I?”In Kino, the eponymous title character a bar owner, is emotionally shut down after his wife’s betrayal. Then a stray cat makes the bar her erstwhile home, followed soon after by a mysterious customer named Kamita—“god’s field.” But who is Kamita, really, and what lesson is he about to impart?And then there’s Scherezade, focused on an isolated man named Habara, whose one respite is bi-weekly visits by a woman whose job it is to get him groceries and other sundries, and eventually shares his bed. Like the mythical Scherezade, she dazzles him with stories about breaking into homes and leaving something of herself behind, ensnaring Habara into a web of connection.I believe Haruki Murakami is a brilliant writer but before this, I have only read his novels, never his short stories.

The premise it spins on is developed in the first 25 pages: Schwind is commissioned as a painter for Gundlach, the subject being his much younger wife. The wife leaves Gundlach for Schwind. Gundlach defaces the painting. Our narrator is hired by Schwind to negotiate a deal whereby Schwind would restore the masterpiece at his cost. While performing his duty, our predictable, rather dull narrator makes unpredictable choices when he falls in love with Irena.It’s a tightly constructed premise and filled me with hope that the novel would unfold organically. But quickly, I ran into an obstacle: Irena, the nude, pale and blond subject of the painting, is not (pardon the pun) fleshed out enough to make me believe that she is so irresistible to these men, particularly to the narrator. Irena, a focus of the novel, believes she was forced into friendly packaging – the trophy, the muse, the damsel in distress. These roles, she says, make women predictable and interchangeable. And so she strikes out. My problem, as a woman, is that I don’t buy into the premise. We, as women, do have choice about the roles we embody and how we define them. Irena, as a fictional character can, of course, exert her own beliefs, but those beliefs would tend to distance the put-upon narrator, not draw him closer to her.The theme that emerges is clichéd: we each need to embrace our authentic selves and take necessary risks, turning our back on the financial rewards of the corporate, cultural and legal worlds that entrap us. Bernhard Schlink is capable of better. For instance, he shines when he explores the narrator’s imaginings with Irena about what might have been, creating an alternative history.

Does it matter that one of you is alive and one is dead? And which is which?In this brilliant new novel, Hari Kunzru explores these questions. The narrator, Seth, is a dweeby young man who is obsessed with recording sounds during his walks in New York City. One day he happens across an old chess player who is singing a haunting blues song that he can't get out of his mind. He brings the song to Carter, his bestie who comes from an obscenely rich family and has his own obsession with old blues 78s from the 1930s. Together, they ""authenticize"" the song, making it sound like it's the real deal from the birth of the blues, and ""put it out there"", driving collectors mad.In fact, they even name the blues singer: Charlie Shaw.But did Charlie Shaw ever really exist? And if so, why is his ghost so unsettled and what unfinished business does he have? The novel veers from a paen to the blues to the mystery and ghost genres, as time becomes fluid and everything that's happening already happened. As the novel becomes more hallucinatory, the theme of cultural appropriation becomes clearer. One question says, ""The anmes were traded by collectors, but no one seemed to know a thing about them. They were like ghosts at the edges of American consciousness...Things were hidden. Things got lost. Musicians got lost.""In an important way, the novel is about boundaries: the fluid boundary of time, the boundaries between musician and listener, the so-called living and the so-called dead, white and black, and the Side A and Side B of life (Side A is for the talented; Side B is just a joke for those who understand nothing).

As the story unfolds, it becomes more and more evident that evils and blessings are two sides of a coin, and often, one organically flows from the other.Elena Alvarez, our narrator, is in her early twenties: a college graduate with no job, living in Leadville, Colorado with her grandmother, and babysitting for free for two young children whose mother died in an accident, overwhelming their father. Worse she is single and pregnant and unable to determine where her life is heading. Early on, we also know one more thing about Elena: when she was a child, she was inadvertently the catalyst for a terrible tragedy that unfolded in her community, and she has never forgiven herself.This novel takes on one of the strongest of themes: self-forgiveness and redemption. As Elena connects with the children, who badly need healing, and discovers more about her Tuah (grandmother’s) own source of pain, she recognizes that are we all a part of the human experience: lost children, suffering children, children hoped for and adored, children unwanted and unloved and abandoned. Sooner or alter, good will come of whatever we do if we want it to, because “every kind of thing in the world, everything touches something, that touches something, that touches something else. Everything connects.”This may sound sort of Pollyanna-ish, but the fact is, Margo Catts is a strong writer with a compelling voice. Although the theme is a mite too tied up in a bow – and although I did not totally understand why Elena chose to continue her pregnancy, given facts that were presented -- I believed in the these characters and I rooted for them.

It’s a book about being single...I have no interest in reading this book. I am already single.”The value of a book, often, is reflected in the reader’s own experiences and biases. I was single way into my adult years, surprising my family and friends (and particularly, myself) when I finally decided to couple with an emotionally healthy man who truly “got” me. After living the single life – the unavailable and sometimes, outright damaging men, the feeling of being “odd woman out” at coupled events, the (I admit it!) self-absorption, the search for how to become my most authentic and fulfilled self – I, like Andrea, do not take well to reading books that focus on a single character’s experiences.And so I resisted the allure of the book. Andrea’s messed-up childhood with her pot-smoking activist mother and prematurely deceased junkie father, her lack of career goals, her link-ups with groan-worthy guys were far worse than anything I went through (fortunately, I had great parents and a satisfying career) but it still provoked a certain wariness (and weariness) in me. Been there, done that, nothing original.But somewhere along the line, I got hooked and I think it was in realizing that the book’s tendrils dig deeper to encompass this question: how do we – any of us – architect our own lives? Andrea’s is “a juicy, sloppy mess of ingredients and feelings and emotions too much salt and spice, too much anxiety, always a little dribbling down the front of my shirt. But have you tasted it? Have you tasted it? It’s delicious.” Love those lines! As Andrea introduces us to other women in her life – her well-meaning mother who messes up badly, her best friend Indigo whose life isn’t anywhere as perfect as it first seems, her sister-in-law whose fate is to cope with a terminally ill child, and more, the fundamental truth we all share is our need to connect.For anyone, particularly any woman, who has asked herself the question, “Who am I, really?”, this book will resonate....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Feb 14, 2017","Feb 16, 2017","Feb 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30971707-all-grown-up

All are victims of it, and all are guilty of it. And though we understand who these characters are and what their lives are like, we have no idea of how they will behave.The nucleus, in these stories, is Lucy Barton, who readers met in Ms. Strout’s last book, My Name Is Lucy Barton. It is not necessary to have read that book although it helps. Lucy, a former resident of Amgash, Illinois, spent her childhood surviving abusive family dynamics and extreme poverty, eventually moving to New York and becoming a renowned author. She may no longer live in Amgash but to the locals, her absence looms large. Elizabeth Strout delves into the hearts and souls of those who remain: for example, one of the Pretty Nicely girls, Patty Nicely, now a widow, who, after a verbal tongue-lashing by the daughter of Vicky (Lucy’s sister), rises above and by one kind act, open a path toward salvation. In another, Dottie, who is connected circuitously to Lucy, is now the owner of a bed and breakfast, and host to a wealthier couple who use her for sport. Her rumination sums up the theme of this book: “She came to understand that people had to decide, really, how they were going to live.” Another character, Abel Blaine, a childhood friend of Lucy’s, has done alright for himself and broken the cycle of poverty, finally understands what it means to be a good man. And Charlie, a Vietnam vet who has witnessed some of the worst of humanity, slowly builds up trust and is nearly undone by a lie. Psychologically astute, brimming with humanity, these small-town lives are big with possibilities. Some will struggle, some will emerge with their heart and sense of self intact, and some will try but fail. Definitely recommended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,43,2,"Feb 10, 2017Feb 10, 2017","Feb 13, 2017not set","Feb 10, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32080126-anything-is-possible

In Dog Stars, a postapocalyptic tale, he literally blew me away with his elegiac spin that elevated this to one of my favorite contemporary books. Again in The Painter, he takes the framework of a contemporary Western and provides a satisfying and nuanced look at an artist and fly fisherman capable of revenge and redemption.This time, he tackles the private eye genre with the most unlikely of PIs: a 67-year-old fashionista from a privileged background named Celine. A heavy smoker, now suffering from emphysema, Celine is haunted by two pivotal past losses, which drive her to help track down long-missing persons. She becomes intrigued when Gabriela, a young woman from her alma mater, asks for her help in finding her father, a world-famous photographer named Paul Lamont. Years ago, the photographer was presumed dead from a grizzly mauling, but the body wasn’t found and the pieces of the story don’t add up.Celine and her husband and PI partner Pete head out to Yellowstone to investigate a trail gone cold but really, the novel is just as much an exploration of Celine’s inner landscape than the mountains in which Paul Lamont’s secret is hidden. As in the past, Peter Heller renders gorgeous word-pictures of the glory of nature and integrates themes of loss and redemption. For the reader, the book is about the journey, not the destination.Those literary readers who enjoy a new twist on the detective genre will particularly enjoy this book. One curiosity: the author persists in describing Celine and her husband as elderly and a step from the grave (various bit players refer to her as “old woman”) – so much so that I had to look back to make sure she wasn’t nearing 80. In addition, Celine is not a character that is prone to introspection, and those who gravitate to such characters may be a tad put-off. Still, Peter Heller remains a writer to reckon with. There are hints that we have not seen the last of Celine and that the author intends to revisit her in a future book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Feb 05, 2017","Feb 10, 2017","Feb 05, 2017",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/30687236-celine

There are only two types of stories that comprise the collection: those that are excellent and those that are outstanding. Every single one was so haunting and memorable that it’s hard to decide which ones to highlight.The Five Wounds may arguably be the one that stands out the most. A neer-do-well named Padilla is chosen to reenact Christ’s passion, carrying a heavy wooden cross through dusty New Mexican streets and experiencing Jesus’ pain in a quest for personal redemption. When his young pregnant daughter, Angel, shows up and clamors to be taken into the morada, Padilla must contemplate whether to risk his redemption and violate the community code, sacrificing his “Jesus moment.” I cannot imagine this story not appearing in “best of the best” compilations.Other stories are equally searing and fresh. In Canute Commands the Tides, for example, a wealthy East Coast white woman moves to New Mexico and hires a Latina housekeeper who has a troubled adult son. Their symbiotic relationship soon rears its ugly head: “they were motionless, as minutely wrought as figures in a medieval miniature. His face was buried in her lap, and she bent over him, so close, their heads were nearly touching, the two of them as destructive and unstoppable as any force of nature.” Wow!In the eponymous story, Night of the Fiestas, a young girl named Frances who was “pretending to be someone else” and who is “twitchy with impatience”, takes her father’s bus to the Fiestas in Santa Fe, where she hopes that something will happen. Something does happen, giving Frances a glimpse into the way the world really works.I can go on and on about this remarkable debut, where readers will meet an unmarried pregnant woman who comforts a priest in the office of the Catholic church, a young girl who meets her exotic cousin Nemecia who may have had something to do with her parents’ untimely death, a man who finds his unrepentant father and a pregnant boa constrictor entrenched in a guest house and more.

Henry Aster, our narrator, relays the tale of his father, also named Henry, who returned to his small Appalachian town with his pregnant wife and eventually purchases a gothic haunted house, where horrendous murders took place.The house is a red herring and that trail goes nowhere. It appears to serve as the metaphorical embodiment of the senior Henry’s haunted mind, as he struggles to write a novel and fit in with often small-minded neighbors. One of the most searing parts of the book is the community’s book burning of a Faulkner book, as Henry impotently tries to stop them. The sense of time and place is truly exquisite.Had the book pursued this angle – Henry, who is inexplicably drawn to the Barrowfields and his son Henry who also struggles with “you can’t go home again” – this book would have been an unqualified winner. Yet Henry Jr. leaves his family, and the reason is kept from the reader until the very end. The second half of the book focuses on Henry Jr’s pursuit of an impossibly beautiful (sigh!) college girl named Story, who is very damaged by her past. In this section, melodrama rules. There are secrets, which can rather easily be ascertained by the alert reader before the narrator reveals them. I felt as if the first half and the second half didn’t naturally coalesce and the way too familiar story of Henry Jr’s connection with the exquisite blond and luscious Story didn’t engage me anywhere as much as Henry’s complicated family relationship. In my opinion, the themes advanced in the beginning (“In truth, neither time nor hell exist, but time will steal your soul in a way that hell never could”) should have been delved into and broadened and the Story story should have been minimized.But hey, that’s just my opinion. It’s obvious that Phillip Lewis has talent to burn and I’ll be curious how his career as a writer develops. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,Feb 2017,"Feb 05, 2017","Feb 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31159249-the-barrowfields

This spare and elegant novel lays bare the innermost thoughts of its narrator, the recent widow Ellinor, a 70 year old, as she confides in her husband Georg’s first wife and her best friend, who is also deceased.Slowly, deliberately and lyrically, Ellinor reveals milestones of her life: her courtship by her more outward-going first husband, the charmed friendship that developed between them and another couple, the undisclosed memories of her childhood that shaped who she is, and the power of self-acceptance and forgiveness. At times poignant, at times provocative, at times melancholy, reading this book is akin to being trusted with the precious backstory of an unknowable woman of great value.As far as plot points, it is best for the reader to go through the art of discovery without prior expectations.

Boyle: “A short story is like a toothache and you must drill it and fill it. A novel is more like bridgework.” Joshua Ferris is a master bridgework artisan. Since discovering Then We Came To The End more than a decade ago, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed To Rise Again at A Decent Hour, and even the less critically-acclaimed The Unnamed.His short story collection, however, doesn’t quite rise to the height of his novels. Yes, there are moments of spectacular insight; in the eponymous first story, there is much beneath the surface when so-called close friends do not show up at another couple’s dinner party. It begs to be read a second time, when it becomes evident that the hosting couple is going through the motions and that the cracks have already appeared in their marriage.Subsequent stories – such as Fragments and The Breeze, and even Valetudinarian, a slightly longer story, are fun to read, but somehow, but the author’s reliance on farcical dialogue and situations belied the gravitas that could have moved the reader more deeply if better developed. Joshua Ferris has always crafted his works with a dark sense of humor, but that humor worked more effectively on a broader canvas.

This is my real life. This is me.”At thirteen years old, nothing really important is supposed to happen to you. Your “real life” hasn’t even started yet. But the unformed Meredith shortly thereafter finds herself at the Deli Barn, where she – and Lisa Bellow, one of the most popular and mean girls in class --- find themselves unwilling participants of an armed robbery.Lisa is taken. Meredith is left behind. And the question that pervades this book and haunts her mother is, “How were you supposed to help the girl not taken? There were no groups for that.”This novel excels in its exploration of PTSD, as Meredith tries to claim her real life but, partially because of her survivor’s guilt, only succeeds in stepping into a false life, the one Lisa Bellow had been living. The blurring of the two girls’ lives, and the blurry of what Meredith knows and what she imagines, is mesmerizing. As Lisa falls off the edge of the news, Meredith struggles to keep her alive, even if she forces her story and her life to merge with Lisa’s.In the immediate background of Meredith struggles is her brother Evan, whose eye was destroyed during a fluke accident during a baseball game. Evan strives to beat the odds and play baseball despite vision impairment that allows him to only see some movements, shapes and lights.

The writing was so mesmerizing, the situation so poignant and the characters so authentic that I found myself staying up past my self-appointed bedtime to read “just another page.”There are two key characters here: Kavya, daughter of Indian immigrants, who has always taken control of her own life…until she is unable to conceive a child. She and her techie husband Rishi struggle with the emotional ravages of infertility. The interwoven story focuses on Soli, an illegal Mexican immigrant, who, after risking her life, ends up at her cousin’s doorstep in Berkeley, unexpectedly pregnant and determined to keep her baby son.  The author doesn’t keep us in suspense very long. Soli is arrested and her son, born on American soil, is taken over by the state of California, where he ends up in the custody of foster parents Kavya and Rishi. Neither are villains; both women are good-hearted and striving to define what it means to be a mother. My sympathies kept shifting from one to the other, knowing that each woman was emotionally invested in the little boy.I finished this powerful book at a particularly fortuitous time, when a hard-hearted demagogue heads our country and is targeting law-abiding immigrants who simply want a chance to survive and raise their own children in peace. Soli’s journey as an illegal immigrant and her horrendous treatment by government officials and in the detention center brought tears to my eyes and it is based on a true story.

TheAlthough The Gringo Champion is written in the first person, we don’t learn the narrator’s name – Liborio – until about half way through the book. There’s a reason for this: as an illegal immigrant striving to survive, Liborio straddles the border between Mexico and the U.S., one of many whose names and identities have become amorphous.Abandoned and unloved as a child, forced to endure incredible hardships to live each day, Liborio is redeemed by the strength of his own will to survive, his intense love for a “fantasy” woman named Aureen who seems beyond his grasp, and his job in a bookstore. What makes this book ascend beyond others that focus on the power of hope and resilience (heroes can be born anywhere on Earth and under any circumstances) is its mesmerizing and totally unique language. It’s raw, intense, palpitating and real. (I thought more than once of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao). The author has a message for those squeamish souls who dislike the use of “bad words” in novels: “…all those muddled respectable words, those goddamn little ladies with sickly-sweet frills…I prefer whores, words that say everything in one fell shitkicker.” It is astounding to Liborio – as well it should be – that people cringe because of words but turn their backs on truly obscene deeds.The Gringo Champion is not prettied up but it is intensely powerful and superbly on target. The flashbacks – written in italics – of Liborio’s story of migration will touch all but the hardest hearts. Non-manipulative and often unpredictable, The Gringo Champion was written by a nineteen-year-old, with sensibilities and insights are mature and fully-developed. Ms. Xilonen’s creative use of language had to be an incredible challenge to translate, and my hat’s off to translator Andrea Rosenberg, who rose to the occasion superbly.

From then on she waited for the day when she might say those words out loud for real.” Those first three words are mentioned repeatedly in Inheritance From Mother” and they suggest the opening of Camus’ The Stranger. The question is: is the connection deliberate?The answer is almost certainly “yes.” Camus believed that individual lives and human existence have no rational meaning or order; rather, individuals attempt to find that order where none exists. Indeed, that is the case here. Mitsuki, the daughter of an imperious and demanding mother named Noriko, is forced to cater to her as she ages. The author writes, “Japanese women lived longer every year, lingering like specters…anyone caring for an aging parent could plainly see that growing old was an assault not just on body and mind but on all five senses. Was that all that awaited one at life’s end?”The “inheritance” of the title is both pragmatic and emotional. Mitsuki’s husband is cheating on her with a younger woman and she is gradually realizing that there may never have been any love between them. Mitsuki needs her mother’s inheritance. Yet, in a sense, her entire life has been an unwelcome inheritance; Noriko creates a feeling of unworthiness in Mitsuki, particularly when comparing her to her more attractive and talented older sister Natsuki. There are a lot of themes here, perhaps too many, as the novel unfolds and then circles back, begrudgingly surrendering details from the past, teasing out the significance of incidents from the present. Divided into two halves, the first half focuses on the resentful and dutiful daughter waiting in limbo, performing her responsibilities. As the adult daughter of a 90+ year old mother, the “long goodbye” – complete with medical personnel who are determined to deprive Noriko of the dignity of a “good death” – is astoundingly accurate, even uncomfortably so. The second half – Mitsuki embraces the true meaning of her inheritance – is sometimes too carefully plotted but provides relief from the grimness.There’s so much “meat” here – the symbiosis of mother and daughter, the harness of cultural and social class, the mores of Japanese life, and the legacy of literature (The Stranger, Madame Bovary and a lesser-known book (for Americans) entitled The Golden Demon are all evoked. Inheritance From Mother is, ultimately, an extraordinarily impressive book that could benefit from a second reading to truly get all its tendrils.

Maja’s best friend and Sebastian die in the shooting and there’s little doubt that Maja did it.But does that make her guilty?Quicksand, dubbed a literary thriller, is more “literary” than “thriller”. Those who love suspenseful “whodunnits and why did they do it” should likely look elsewhere. That being said, for those who enjoy page-turning and perceptive literary books could do a lot worse than to read Quicksand.The chapters alternate between Maja’s current life, languishing in jail and participating in a highly publicized trial, and the events that led up to the tragic event. One thing becomes clear: Maja’s parents and best friend are thrilled with her relationship with the very wealthy Sebastian, and as a result, turn a blind eye to her struggles with his dark side. It becomes increasingly obvious that at barely eighteen, she does not have the emotional resources to cope and is inadvertently left high and dry by those who can support her.Malin Persson Giolito goes beyond Maja’s story to depict a Swedish society that – contrary to popular perceptions – is surprisingly similar to ours, with class distinctions, worship of the most affluent, disdain for immigrants, failure of parenting. Eventually, readers will need to draw their own conclusions: who is truly guilty of this crime? Is it the perpetrator herself or is it the society that failed her? Is Maja the creature that the tabloids created or is the situation far more nuanced?This may not be a “thriller” in the classic sense of the word, but it is provocative, insightful, and definitely page-turning....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Jan 06, 2017","Jan 12, 2017","Jan 06, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/31324051-quicksand

When my sister tried to explain that the dogWhen my niece was just a few years old, her family dog died in his sleep as a result of advanced old age. When my sister tried to explain that the dog was gone, my niece looked at her, baffled, and said, “But where’s the blood?”It was inconceivable to her that something as monumental as death could be so seemingly ordinary. I’m starting my  this way because I have read many s that criticize The Book of Aron for the reportorial and too often flat voice of the narrator. But for me, that is precisely what gives the book its power.Aron, whom we meet when he is barely nine years old, is a natural-born troublemaker (The very first line reads: My mother and father named me Aron, but my father said they should have named me What Have You Done…”) In his young lifetime, he has been witness to horrendous things: Jews being uprooted from their homes and forced to endure more and more intolerable circumstances – living in the ghetto, not being able to attend schools or ride trolleys, living with the ever-present lice and typhus, humiliated and beaten up by Nazi officers, and dealing with gnawing hunger and lack of food. This isn’t REAL living; real living requires us to experience all our emotions. Denying our feelings is part of our ability to survive (think of a soldier in battle) and developing an impenetrable armor is the only way to get by. And that’s precisely what Aron does. His voice is the voice of a survivor, someone who is determined to forge on. Aron’s understated “here’s what happened” narration belies the unspeakable horrors that are going on around him. I found my heart beating a little faster and my brain reeling a little more with each successive page. Eventually, as we learn right from the book jacket, Aron ends up in the care of a real-life hero, Dr. Janusz Korczak, who ran a well-known orphanage in the Warsaw ghetto. While Aron’s life – centering around pillaging, stealing, and betrayal if necessary – has been all about himself (and sometimes, his family), Dr. Korczak’s life has been about sublimating his own needs (“I exist not to be loved but to act.”)And herein lies the theme of The Book of Aron. When forced to endure the most unimaginable situations, we can react in two ways: go inward and do whatever it takes to save ourselves or go outward and save others and our very concept of humanity. How will Aron make a difference after witnessing Dr. Korczak in action? Jim Shepard provides hints of what might occur after the last page of his book, but we can only surmise. 4.5 strong stars....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jan 03, 2017","Jan 04, 2017","Jan 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22889835-the-book-of-aron

Specifically, the book is set mainly during the War in Spain, where Franco launched a coup against the democratically elected Republic. His brand of fascism was heavily supported by the church. Thus, Mar Gordon explores (among other themes) the chasm between intelligence and imagination on one side, and idolatry on the other.This may be a good time to state that those who are piously religious or feel uncomfortable with hearing devastating truths about the not always pure role of religion in the world should probably skip this one. In this book, Marian – who comes from an aristocratic Catholic family – marries her brother’s lover and travels with him to Spain during the height of the war, spurning her family’s heartless religious “values.” As she gradually becomes a victim of circumstances, her sense of adventure dissolves into a feeling of powerlessness, and the author does not shy away from visceral descriptions of the horror that church-sponsored fascism wrought. Ms. Gordon makes the somewhat formulaic choice of interweaving her narrative with present day scenes. In those scenes, Marian – who is in her 90s – lives in Rhode Island with Amelia, her granddaughter, and is finally revealing missing pieces of her life to her. As in other novels who rely on this structure, the present day scenes pale in comparison to the “meat” of the book. I never felt completely invested in Amelia and kept chomping at the bit to get back to Marian’s story.As a result, I can’t say this is the best of Mary Gordon’s works.

None of us are an open book and for the most part, our stories gain definition when juxtaposed with the stories of those who have had significant impacts on our life. So it is here. The four white-collar stories are not all that different from the blue-collar tales that Russo is famous for; the only thing different is that these characters are more well-off.The best, in my opinion, is the longest: Voice. Here, a man named Nathan is in Venice with his estranged brother, Julian. Nathan is undergoing a midlife crisis and Russo hints at the reason why: something to do with one of his very talented students, who was emotionally fragile and possibly diagnosable with mental disease. Being together with Julian, who has always had a short fuse around Nathan, on a group arts tour, makes him feel even more off-balance. Nathan learns a lesson about reaching out (“Reaching out? Wasn’t that what you were supposed to do for any human in need?”) and self-forgiveness. For me, this story evoked memories of another novella: Francine Prose’s Descents Into Hell. And, it had me turning pages.The story Intervention was my next favorite, and dealt with a Maine Realtor who has just received a cancer diagnosis. He is in the process of selling a hoarder’s home and he, too hoards – memories. With his brother as a foil, he thinks of his father, who was faced with the same diagnosis many years back, and recognizes this: “…people cling to their folly as if it were their most prized possession, defending it, sometimes with violence, against the possibility of wisdom.”Awakenings also occur in Horseman, focusing on a professor who confronts her student, a plagiarist, all the while recalling her own ability to claim her own scholarly voice. Finally, in Milton and Marcus, an aging novelist literally understands what it means to rewrite an old story script when he goes head-to-head with a legendary star who wants to option his work for a screenplay.

But Kamel Daoud does so masterfully, bellying the fact that this is his debut novel. And even though I haven’t read The Outsider since college days, the images came flooding back to me, from the very first sentence (“Mama’s still alive today”, as opposed to The Outsider’s “Mama died today.”)Not unlike Mohsin Hamid’s The Fundamentalist (or Samuel Coleridge’s Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner), a young man happens across our narrator Harun, who holds him spellbound. According to Harun, the Arab of the famous sotry has a name – Musa, translated as Moses. Musa could be interchangeable with thousands of other nameless Arabs but for one important detail: his brother is a story-teller. We don’t know – how could we? – whether the story he’s weaving is true but we do know that the power of the story makes all the difference.And what do we really know about The Outsider? We know this: “The Arab is killed because the murderer thinks he wants to avenge the prostitute, or maybe because he has the insolence to take a siesta…All the rest is nothing but embellishments, the products of your writer’s genius.” The nameless Arab of the Camus tale lost everything by venturing into the French side: his life, his short history, even his name. He is a metaphor for so many other stories of gratituous deaths.Had Kamil Daoud left the story here it would be an achievement. But then he does something remarkable: he casts Harun as the outsider, murdering an unknown French man. There are differences: first and most importantly, he gives the Frenchman a name. Yet by weaving the same story from a different perspective, he does honor to both his own tale and that of Camus.While Camus wrote about the negation of life, Daoud ventures into a new territory: celebrating its occasional moments of majesty.

This time, the adversary is not a mindless outside force; it’s a mindful and internal one.Right from the start , Margaret reflects, “I’ve been circling myself all these years, trying and failing to be brave, trying to riddle out the truth of it and portion out the blame in all the places it should be.” Margaret was the plainer of two sisters and surprised herself with her “catch”: a handsome and imperious dentist named Garfield with a wrestler’s build and black pomaded hair who sucked up all the air in the room.Those looking for bells and whistles will not find them here. The story unfolds like a photo slowly taking shape within in a darkroom, yielding up its secrets and taking on a shape. From vignettes, we see the challenging interactions between Margaret and Garfield’s domineering mother, the births of her daughters, the claiming of the older daughter by Garfield and his mother, the rifts that develop over time and take on a life of its own.Most of all, we learn that none of us who make choices – which encompasses all of humankind – are truly blameless. Thinking of her husband, a man who was both feared and revered, she says, “I had chosen him, aft4er all, so you could say that the fault all lay with me.” Throughout these pages, I believed thoroughly in the authenticity of Margaret Maguire and in her courageously honest voice.

And believe me, they fit the bill. There is not one cheery story in the dozen and when read together, the effect is very unsettling. Within these pages, there is a constant parade of Argentinean malcontents: child serial murders, empty-eyed addicts, one-armed teens, despondent women, feral children, sick babies. That is, perhaps, the biggest fault of this collection -- a relentless look at the very worst of humanity – which, at least for this reader, offset the assurance of the prose.As in any collection, favorites emerge. Since I lean towards psychological horror (as opposed to, say, ghost stories, black magic or superstition), I was drawn to The Neighbor’s Courtyard. Here, a burnt-out and depressed social worker strongly believes she sees a wild chained-up boy in her new building courtyard. Her husband is disgusted with what he perceives as her mental illness and the ending is absolutely cringe-worthy. Has she lost her mind or is what occurs true? “You don’t feel pain in dreams,” the author writes. Then there is An Invocation of a Big-Eared Runt. A tour leader – who is resentful of his wife’s transfer of attention to their new baby son – takes tourists on a Buenos Aires murder tour, where the focal story is about a psychotic child murderer. Will these gruesome murders serve as his own inspiration?Obsession is frequently leveraged through these stories. The first, A Dirty Kid, may be one of the finest: a graphic designer, who lives in a seedy part of town, believes a young boy who has been brutally tortured is the same unkempt and dirty child she took in before he returned to his homeless drug addict of a mother. The title story, about mass immolation of women – not dissimilar to the witch hunts, except this time, it’s done voluntarily – comes down to the last line, which will send chills down your spine.

But it’s the end of another year, our planet is in peril with a new selfish and misguided administration, and the book made me pause and reflect…which is precisely what a book is meant to do.Within the pages of this book, this author introduces original, quirky, and often well-meaning characters who imperfectly but fervently deal with some of today’s most important issues -- climate change and biodiversity loss, memory care, and mental health, for example – as well as being authentic and connected in a complex world. The poster boy of this book is Jeremy, who is obsessed with dead plants and the intertwining of vines that wrap around him and burrow into his skin. This intertwining is a metaphor for the human condition – the way we sometimes cling to each other in our need for affirmation and connection.Readers of her debut book, House Arrest, will recognize some of these characters: Emily’s cousin Anna and her ex-husband Sam, who share in caring for their young daughter Zoe, who has spina bifada…Tian, the cult leader who was sent to jail for the death of two toddlers in the Frozen Babies Case and his twin sons, Jeremy and Tim. As in that book, Ellen Meeropol explores how the moral complexities of politics and medicine play out in the real world. And while there is a reader’s delight in exploring what happened to past characters, who have now moved on, it is a new character that spoke to me the strongest: Sam’s mother Flo. An aging feminist activist, Flo is life force in her granddaughter Zoe’s life, a pillar of her sisterhood group and the very definition of a strong woman. Diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, Flo is losing her memory but not her spirit and is striving to keep that spirit strong and not be forced to endure pharmacological intervention. As a woman who has forcefully advocated for my own mother (who has Lewy Body Dementia) to avoid unnecessary drug intervention that saps her very essence, I will add that Ellen Meeropol doesn’t hit a false note in this depiction.All of this sounds very “heavy”. In fact, the initial publicist blurb almost made me shy away. But make no mistake, this is not a so-called issue-based book as much as it is a book about how the issues that affect us today transform us as people. It is also, surprisingly, a hopeful book.

Virginia Reeves uses her considerable story-telling skills to craft a powerful tale set in rural Alabama in the 1920s, providing great insight into the separate prison/punishment cultures that existed for white vs. black during that era. Yet despite truly haunting scenes and stunningly written dialogue, she tries a little too hard to drum home her redemption message at the end.Roscoe T. Martin is a person living an inauthentic life. An electrician by trade, he is forced to move to his father-in-law’s farm following his death. He despises farm work and feels increasingly distant from his wife, Marie, and their young son. But then he hits upon a scheme to steal electricity and increase the productivity of the farm, and he talks Wilson, a long-time farmhand, into aiding and abetting. We know from the very first sentence that things go wrong and the men end up in prison – Roscoe at the “modern” Kilby prison and Wilson as a leased-out laborer to the dreaded mining companies.The focus, for much of the book, is Roscoe, who must come to grips with various work – from dairy hand to “dog boy” – and who must discover his place in the penal hierarchy. At the same time, he must deal with the costs of moral failures and shattered hopes.For much of the novel, I was definitely in the high 4 star range. But there are some issues that held me back. The first is the relationship between Roscoe and Marie. Both are wonderfully portrayed, but it was so obvious that they were mismatched that it’s hard for me to accept that Roscoe believed she would be waiting for him at the end (whether she is or not is for the reader to discover). Wilson and his family are portrayed as nearly saint-like and there are plot twists that also caused me to be skeptical – after all, this is still Jim Crow Alabama. All in all, a strong debut that portends good things for this writer. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 13, 2016","Dec 19, 2016","Dec 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25814223-work-like-any-other

She always delivers with novels that are warm and perceptive, a tad bit kooky, and often whimsical. Best of all, she makes it all seem easy, although I know that writing is anything BUT effortless.Her latest book is a great pick-me-upper for a cold, gray winter day. Faith Frankel, her 30-something protagonist, is…well, kind of at odds with life. Her fiancée Stuart, a loser if there ever was one, has taken off on a new-age walking journey. Her father has just reinvented himself as a forger of Chagall artwork, her job as head of stewardship at her alma mater is suddenly in jeopardy, and then there’s that house – 10 Turpentine Lane. This 5 ½ room “dollhouse” is Faith’s first foray into homeownership and the house seems to have a salacious back history. Seems that the former owner’s second and third husbands fell to their death. There is a bright spot in all this, though. His name is Nick Franconi and he’s her office mate, in charge of major gifts. So let’s address the less than sterling things first. Stuart is so incredibly without redeeming qualities that it’s hard to imagine why a woman like Faith would ever think of being involved with him. And the murder subplot gets goofier as the novel wears on.And yet. As with Eleanor Lipman’s previous novels, she creates such a witty and lovable cast of characters that it’s not hard to cheer for them, even knowing how it will all likely end. There are laugh-out-loud moments and poignant moments and moments when you just want to hit your head and say, “Wow, can’t believe THAT happened.” I finished the book with a big smile on my face.

Miller has worked on international peace and security of diplomatic missions and the United Nations, and it shows. His book has the ring of authenticity, which makes for mesmerizing reading.The novel starts in 1991,when two men – a British war journalist named Thomas Benton and a fearless and possibly unhinged American private named Arwood Hobbes, meet at Checkpoint Zulu, close to the Kuwait border. There, after becoming involved in a local situation, they witness the senseless execution of a girl in a green dress.Fast forward. It’s now 22 years later, and the men are haunted by what they’ve seen. Hobbes sees another girl in a green dress on Al Jazeera, and convinces Benton – whom he hasn’t seen in all these years – to join him in a quixotic quest to save her. Benton reflects: “I’ starting to think…that maybe we leave parts of ourselves behind in certain situations – some essential piece of ourselves that we have to cut off, otherwise there’s no way out.” He jumps in with both feet.The ensuing cinematic plot might fall into the adventure story genre, except that Miller knows his stuff. In Catch-22 prose, this author reveals how things really are during these “peace” years: our total misreading of the culture of those we decided to “liberate”, the way that various NGOs come together behind the scenes, how the media gets the story wrong, how hostage situations truly play out, and how girls with green dresses will continue to populate the landscape.In an age of cynicism, the theme of The Girl in Green is this: the only thing worse than evil is deciding that evil didn’t matter. At their Core, Benton and Hobbes still believe that individual lives matter. That message – despite the darkness in this book – is heartwarming. ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Dec 03, 2016","Dec 11, 2016","Dec 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28114442-the-girl-in-green

He’s such a good storyteller, in fact, that it’s remarkably easy to get lost in his narrative and overlook some of the flaws in this novel. I must say, from the time I began the novel, I couldn’t wait to get back to it and find out what happened next.The book centers on two young friends, Robert Carter, the somewhat timid son of an amusement park owner, and Nathan Tilly, the new kid in town who rescues Robert from the town bully. The two become inseparable and soon there’s another reason to bind them: each of them must navigate a personal tragedy that overshadows most of the typical joys and foibles of childhood. Nathan is the hopeful, fearless one; Robert muddles through, trying to make sense of his tragedy and capture some meaning from it.The author beautifully brings these two characters to life and also reveals how slippery the grief process is and how each of us – including the surrounding adults – processes it in his or her own way. Alex George is striving to reach two audiences here – literary adult audiences and also young adults – and for the most part, he straddles the line well. From time to time, he slips in those all-important lessons (for example, when Robert and Nate work at lowly jobs in the amusement park – as a kitchen helper and a janitor’s helper – they suddenly understand how even entry level jobs make a major difference in a well-oiled organization.) A couple of chapters that serve as backstory, revealing the murder of innocent civilians in Japan in World War II, seem gratuitous. One of the characters does something very out of character that I had a hard time buying into. And one of the final reveals was just too over-the-top. At the end, everything is tied up in a neat bow.Don’t let those issues keep you away from Setting Free The Kites.

Or, in the words of one of the characters in Human Acts, “To be degraded, damaged, slaughtered –Is it true that human beings are fundamentally cruel? Or, in the words of one of the characters in Human Acts, “To be degraded, damaged, slaughtered – is this the essential fate of humankind, one that history has confirmed as inevitable?”It’s a dark view, but for those who survived the Gwangju Uprising of 1980, it would appear that cruelty is, indeed, part of being human. As happens all too often in history, laborers and students rose up against a dictatorship and later were arrested or massacred. As a result, in Korea, the name Gwangju is synonymous with “for whatever is forcibly isolated, beaten down, and brutalized, for all that has been mutilated beyond repair.”The novel, told in six parts and encompassing 35 years, shows how this act – like radiation – continues to affect the lives of those who remain. In the first chapter, a 15-year-old boy named Dong-ho futilely searches for his best friend Jeong-dae. Soon we learn that Dong-ho is yet another victim, with his soul staring into his own body’s dead eyes. The massacre is played back by a female editor who was tortured, by a factory worker who was brutalized, and, in one of the most emotionally haunting sections, by Dong-ho’s mother, who heartbreakingly recalls his earliest years. Han Kang becomes her own character in the epilogue, revealing her own reasons for feeling compelled to tell the story.Reading Human Acts in close proximity to Han Kang’s award-winning novel The Vegetarian, it’s easy to detect certain similarities: the unrelenting darkness of the vision, the multiple narrators, the glimpse into acts of resistance, the gradual insights as the big picture emerges. Yet while The Vegetarian was psychologically intimate, Human Acts is broader, dealing not with a family’s trauma, but an entire country’s. As a result, it transcends The Vegetarian’s theme of “what does it mean to be human” and instead, focuses on “what does it mean to transcend our human condition and make the corpses we sing over into something more than just “butchered lumps of meat.”There is no doubt that Human Acts has aggressive goals: evaluating the macrocosm of trauma as opposed to analyzing it on a smaller one-on-one scale. I, as a reader, was affected more deeply by the mother’s story than, say, the editor’s story on the crackdown on literature. In a prologue, Han Kang’s excellent translator, Deborah Smith, states that this book is “A reminder of the human acts of which we are all capable, the brutal, and the tender, the base and the sublime.” Although the balance weighs to the brutal and base, there is just enough of the tender and sublime to provide hope. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Nov 27, 2016","Nov 30, 2016","Nov 27, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28172483-human-acts

I barely remember the topic – something about where to hang some artwork – but I vividly recall that frightening feeling that I had made a ghastly mistake in joining our futures together.Enter Alain De Botton. I wish I could advise my younger self to have read his book. De Botton employs an everyman and everywoman – in this case, Rahib, a non-religious budding architect from Beirut and Kirsten, a woman who had been abandoned early on in life by her father. Sparks fly and we follow the two of them through the course of love – infatuation, wedding, children, disillusionment, adultery, and finally, maturity.Rahib and Kirsten are just foils for the author’s theme: falling in love is easy but maintaining that love is the real challenge. No one, after all, is perfect. “Rather than split up,” the author writes, “We may need to tell ourselves more accurate stories – stories that don’t dwell so much on the beginning, that don’t promise us complete understanding, that strive to normalize our troubles and show us a melancholy yet hopeful path through the course of love.” Each step of Rahib and Kirsten’s relationship is met with an evaluation – even an analysis – of what, precisely, is going on in their heads. The primal needs of this everyman and everywoman still demand attention as they reach adulthood and parenthood and much of their disillusionment stems from a desire to have the partner magically understand what those needs are…without appearing too vulnerable.There is a problem with presenting the course of love through the eyes of surrogates. This reading experience is bound to be intensely personal, and when it deviates too much from the reader’s own experience, there is a waning interest. My husband, and I, for example, never had kids together, and I found myself not all that interested in Rahib and Kirsten’s parenthood experiences.Yet the conclusions – that Romantic ideas of love are a recipe for disaster and that one can only be in love when one has given up on perfection – is compelling. “Rather than notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate dissimilarity that is the true marker of the “right” person.” My husband and I are still going strong after reaching that conclusion. To my mind, this book should be de rigueur reading for every couple contemplating marriage and every couple who wonders why their own marriage isn’t 100% perfect all the time (which is the vast majority of us!)...more",Notes are private!,0,107,1,"Nov 25, 2016","Nov 27, 2016","Nov 25, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27845690-the-course-of-love

It’s the kind of drive-through town that most people pay little attention to, filled with those who hope to escape and those who have settled for a full day’s work in the mine, followed by getting totally smashed later on in a nearby bar.And then something happens: an out-of-control fire kills more than half of the miners and everyone is affected. The book, inspired by a true story, focuses on three of the survivors: David, a college student who has actually escaped from the town’s gravitational pull and now feels lured back…Ann, a young wife who is already learning the implausibility of breaking free…and Lyle, an older miner who has messed up his chances and is now trapped underground.Written in spare but shining prose, Kevin Canty uses each word judiciously and as a result, Silverton and its inhabitants come fully alive. There are dreams here, yes, but only a glimmer of hope that they can be achieved. “Any direction you set out in,” says one of the characters, “it always comes back to the same place. It’s like some gravitational cortex or something.”This pitch-perfect elegy to grief and the way it is experienced confirms the old wisdom that adversity tests us and that some can rise up while others can be weighed down. Kevin Canty writes, “Sleepwalkers…David saw it everywhere, the blank, distracted look on the sidewalks downtown when he went to fetch a prescription for his mother, the face of the boy in his blue uniform who checks David’s oil and cleans his windshield…”Yet in this town that is literally stunned with the weight of its loss and sorrow, David, Ann, Lyle and the secondary characters are tested and their lives are transformed, each in its own way.

Artistically, together, they are a dazzling force of nature. Their talents spark the attention of art world, and their work-of-love, Nashville Combat, wins a narrow niche of fans of animated movies. But eventually, the very qualities that bring them together begins to destroy them.There’s a raw authenticity in the prose that makes these characters demand to be viewed as living, breathing people. So much is pitch-perfect – the dialogue, the details, the excavating of long-buried emotions. This young author is incredibly courageous and she infuses her characters with her own sense of artistic risk. Sharon is authentically intimacy-phobic, and feels her fear like hunger, threatening to swallow everything. She is a sheer wonder of a character, living largely inside her own head where she cannot be hurt again. And Mel is the first fictional gay character I’ve run across in a long time who is unapologetically and realistically who she is and not just a bow at the alter of political correctness. Their friendship transcends gender preferences and their collaboration gives birth to a child – not a living human child, but a living piece of art. “Our project becomes a living thing with reflexes and breath, an animal, our cipher. It takes over….It eats and drinks and sleeps with us. It interrupts our sentences.” In important ways, the project is a gift of sorts, that each of them make to each other.I will not spoil the plot twists, which broke my heart and touched me at a very deep level because it strikes right at the essence of being human.

Yet for me, this debut novel is a classic example of “the emperor has no clothes.” The book focuses on three teens: Nadia, whose mother killed herself for unknown reasons, her boyfriend Luke, and her best friend Aubrey who is pious and estranged from her own mother. The title of the book is very apt, because this book deals with all kinds of mothers: mothers who left, mothers who were left, wannabe mothers, and a Greek chorus of older church-going mothers who judgmentally comment on the goings-on in the community.The Greek chorus, using the third person “we”, has been used successfully by Jeffrey Eugenides in Virgin Suicides and in Joshua Ferris’ Then We Came to the End, among others. When used effectively – as it is here – it’s a powerful tool. And there’s no doubt that Brit Bennett can tell a good story.The premise of that story is found in a blurb on her book jacket –“must we always live in servitude to the decisions of our youngest selves, and to the communities that have parented us.” To buy into that premise, as presented by Ms. Bennett, we must believe this: that an abortion, at age 17, is so extraordinarily emotionally traumatic that it overshadows future accomplishments and relationships and causes someone to act compulsively enough to betray a sister-of-the-heart and one’s own deeply-held values.One example: here's Nadia, ruminating obsessively about the fetus she aborted. ""Baby, no longer a baby, now a toddler, reaching and grabbing. Pulling at her earrings until she unhooks his chubby fingers. Baby hungry always for her face. Baby growing into a child, learning words, rhyming -at words from a car seat on the way to school..."" And here's Luke, speaking to Nadia: ""Dave (his counselor) says he's in heaven right now. And your mom's holding him."" I didn’t buy it (for the record, my own beliefs are both pro-life and pro-choice, which are not separate). On a gut level, I did not understand Nadia’s inability to let go of Luke, despite his abominable behavior following her abortion and the many circumstances that intervened. I did not believe in Luke’s transformation and his eventual connection to Aubrey. I do not believe that we are hostage to our pasts.I have struggled with this question: did my own biases color my reading of The Mothers? It’s a fair question, but I think not. If the novel were stronger, it might have taken me out of my own belief system and put me right into the head of the main characters. (One example of this happening was Salvage the Bones. That book has, at its core, pit-bull fighting, which I thoroughly despise. Yet the writing was so strong that I could understand the characters' motivations, something I never thought I would ever be able to do).So here’s what the crux of it is for me: I did not believe the characters were quite nuanced enough nor did I buy into their motivations. I also thought that some of the plot twists were very predictable (hmmm...two best friends and a boy. Wonder if there will be a triangle relationship?) Again, I am an outlier in my reactions to The Mothers and I don’t for a minute think that my own reading experience is or should be the definitive one. 2.50 stars....more",Notes are private!,2,352,1,"Oct 27, 2016","Oct 31, 2016","Oct 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28815371-the-mothers

I’m not quite sure that Peter Swanson is worthy of that esteemed company but his book is page-turning – enough so that it kept me rapt and engrossed during a long transatlantic flight.Here’s the premise: an attractive young Englishwoman named Kate is victim to an anxiety disorder, caused by a horrendous episode engineered by her unstable ex. When her Boston cousin Corbin – whom she has never met – suggests an apartment swap for six months, she surprises herself by agreeing. But as soon as she arrives at the swanky apartment, she discovers that her next-door neighbor has just been gruesomely killed. Who dunnit? Her cousin, who was, after all, romantically involved with? The nice guy across the way who promises to be Kate’s next love interest? Or, perhaps, someone who is lurking not far in the background?Peter Swanson has a away of racheting up the suspense and leaving the reader gasping for more. I never quite believed that Kate was crippled by anxiety (many of her actions and decisions are inconsistent with the decisions of someone with anxiety disorder). And – without spoilers – I don’t think he quite makes the case for the inner psychology of someone who is held hostage to his own secrets.

Two young people – Nadia and Saeed – fall in love and immediately, Mr. Hamid begins to dispel stereotypes. At first glance, it is Saeed that is most contemporary – after all, Nadia wears an abaya (black cloak). But quickly, we find out that she also drives a motorcycle, enjoys psychedelic mushrooms, and in fact, is far more into consummating the relationship than Saeed, who wants to wait ‘til marriage.As their relationship develops, Mr. Hamid takes great pains to make these two characters likeable and relatable, with their dependence on social media, their risk-taking to advance their relationship, their universal feelings. Once we – as readers – understand and relate to them, in a daring authorial move, they begin to lose their individuality and become avatars-of-sorts. They could be anyone. They could be us.Throughout their unnamed land, which is becoming more and more dangerous, magical doors begin to appear…doors that can transport people away. Saeed and Nadia have no choice but to enter these doors, leaving their homeland behind. It is their lot to become citizens of nowhere, and citizens of everywhere.And herein lies the “meat” of the novel – all of us are migrants, in one way or another, through time and space. Mr. Hamid writes, “…for people bought and sold houses the way they bought and sold stocks, and every year someone was moving out and someone was moving in, and now all these doors from who knows where were opening, and all sorts of strange people were around…”In today’s current xenophobic times, the message that Mohsin Hamid imparts may seem wishful. It veers from being a dystopia to presenting a message of hope and redemption, relaying how the migrants’ journey is the journey that all of us take, one way or the other.

The name represents more than a state; it stands for a state of mind, loosely translated to “come back to me.” It is mesmerizing, it is haunting, and it is very authentic.At the center of the book is an act of inexplicable violence that shatters – in every conceivable way – a father named Wade, a mother named Jenny, their two young daughters. and the music teacher who (we learn early on) eventually marries Wade.Yet the book rarely dwells on the violence; it is ultimately about the powers of love, redemption, and memory. The questions it asks of its readers are profound: what if one loses the memory of losing someone special but does not lose the loss? How do stories fasten themselves to words that hold on like fear, like love? Is it ever possible to leave a place you’ve come to inhabit, and for which you long? I hesitate to go much beyond those questions because Idaho unfolds organically, from various perspectives, back and forth in time and like life itself, it yields no easy answers. Put another way, those who want their stories wrapped up in a pretty red bow won’t find what they’re looking for here since many answers are not forthcoming.What readers will find is a beautiful hymn to both a geographic place and an uncharted emotional territory and how we strive for grace and understanding in a world with no easy answers.

I like my novels firmly entrenched in the real world. But I had a feeling about this book, supported by some of the advance buzz I heard. So I took a chance and in certain ways, I’m glad I did.Jonathan Tropper blurbed the book, and if you like his style, you’ll probably like Elan Mastai’s style as well. It’s breezy and a little wacky but also surprisingly insightful. The first person narrator’s voice is delightful and he’s great at helping the reader suspend disbelief and buy into the premise.And the premise is this: a young man named Tom Barren (choose whatever symbolic meaning you want from that last name) lives in the present day, which looks a lot different from the present day we know. In 1965, a scientist named Goettreider discovered a whole new radical form of energy and changed the world as we know it, automating and synthesizing just about every function. Think of it as a form of nano-targeting – personalized to each person’s wants and needs.When Tom’s demanding father sets up a time travel company to capitalize on customer demand (with everything automated, kicks just keep getting harder to find), he reluctantly brings Tom aboard. Tom is never supposed to be the guinea pig for the first mission back in time, but through a fluke, he ends up in precisely that role. And from there, the story unfolds.Elan Mastal has obviously done his homework (within the first few pages, he pinpoints exactly why other time travel books are based on a fallacy) and I found myself quickly turning pages. He also displays a quick-witted imagination (for instance, why are there summary pages at the end of each few chapters – sort of like crib notes? The answer will be forthcoming.My main problem with the book was that Elan Mastal may have taken on too much. As the book progresses, there are layers added to layers added to layers and eventually, the message begins to get obfuscated. I started to have a hard time following some of the sci-fi overlay, which distanced me from the humanity of the book.And the humanity is this: one badly thought-out decision can change everything and what we THINK we believe may be far from the real truth. The more the book traversed into true sci-fi, the more it lost its way -- for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Oct 10, 2016","Oct 26, 2016","Oct 10, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27405006-all-our-wrong-todays

Do yourself a favor and clear your schedule for 24 hours, find your favorite reading perch, and arrange for someone to walk the dogs…because once you start, you’re not coming up for air.Madeline Furston is fascinated by the study of wolves and no wonder. At 14 years old, she is living in a failed commune with a father who is “kind to objects” and a mother who means well but hasn’t quite mastered her nurturing instincts. An outcast in her north Minnesota school with a keen sense of woodland survival instincts, she tries to make sense of the world – particularly a possible tryst between her history teacher and the class beauty, Lily.When Patra – a 20-something-year-old mother – and her toddler son Paul move nearby, Madeline seizes the chance to become involved. She renames herself Linda and becomes an unofficial governess. But something is not quite right with the scenario. Little hints are dropped that could easily fly by (for instance, why is the 4-year-old still wearing a diaper?) but Linda does not have the social skills to decipher what is going on. And when Patra’s controlling and charismatic husband, Leo, arrives, tension really begins to build and yet it’s unclear as to why.This debut book succeeds on so many levels. The questions at its core are: What’s the difference between what you want to believe and what you do? And what’s the difference between what you think and what you end up doing? At our hearts, are we all children? (Emily Fridlund writes, “By their nature, it seems to me, children were freaks. They believed impossible things to suit themselves, thought their fantasies were the center of the world. They were the best kinds of quacks, if that’s what you wanted – pretenders who didn’t know they were pretending at all.” What happens when our beliefs become so powerful that we become, without intention, freaks?There are many ways that these themes circle and enfold upon each other and to get into that too deeply would be to create spoilers. I will say this: Emily Fridlund is a true master at ratcheting up tension, creating a compelling atmosphere, staying in control of her themes, and ultimately, unraveling what it means to be a misunderstood predator-of-sorts.

A town committee has been formed to monitor the girl to make sure that she is the “real deal” and is not being fed surreptiously. Lib and a local nun trade eight-hour shifts and indeed, neither of them are able to detect if a hoax is being pulled off.Lib has her own backstory, which makes her susceptible to the plight of the continually weakening Anna, who fervently spouts Scripture and seems to welcome her own martyring. The question becomes: is the religion filling Anna’s head with morbid nonsense or has she mistaken morbid nonsense for true religion? Is Anna being used by those who claim to love her most for the glory of religion? And is Anna, indeed, a wonder of faith…or, is every body its own marvel, a wonder of creation?By pitting a worldly and educated skeptic against the superstitions of an ignorant town, Emma Donaghue creates a tension-filled narrative that just about breaks the reader’s heart.

Allow me a minute to decompress after one of the most harrowing and visceral reading I’ve experienced in a long time. Think: Lord of the Flies. Think: A Handmaid’s Tale. And then ratchet up the horror by a few degrees.At the start of the novel, we become aware that 10 young women have been drugged and abducted to a desolate Australian outback, contained within a 30-foot electric fence and supervised by two brutal male guards. What do they have in common? It doesn’t take them long to figure it out: each of them has been involved in a sex scandal with a powerful man. They are “the minister’s little travel-tramp and that-Skype slut and the yuck-ugly-dog from the cruise ship…and the bogan-gold-digger-gangbang slut.”Yet two of the women stand out from the pack: the ravishing Yolanda who possesses stores of strength and the insightful Verla, the one-time lover of a married politico who can’t help but feel she is there by a gross mistake. The author differentiates them while tying them into the rest of the captives.Charlotte Wood writes, “There was no self inside that thing they pawed and thrust and butted at, only fleecy punishable flesh.” Their “crimes” are only hinted at; the author trusts us to fill in the blanks. Here they are degraded, reduced to their animal selves, forced to become feral in order to survive. They are forced to adhere to the natural order of things: the belief that they “did it to themselves, they marshaled themselves into this prison, where they had made their beds, and now, once more, were lying in them.”This is a book about many things: contemporary misogyny, sisterly courage, the interweaving of humans and nature, the cruelty that is masked by our civilized veneers. It is brilliant, stark, gripping and brutal. It is also unforgettable and it will definitely make my “Best of 2016” list....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Sep 12, 2016","Sep 13, 2016","Sep 12, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25876358-the-natural-way-of-things

The crime actually occurred in 1869, baffling the community and capturing the attention of some of the top solicitors and psychological experts of the time.This is not a whodunit. We know “whodunit”; Roddy freely confesses. We also know the motivation. The key victim, Lachlan Mackenzie, is a local constable who abuses his power and conducts a personal vendetta against the Macrae family. No reader will shed tears for his untimely demise.So why, then, was His Bloody Project longlisted for the prestigious Man Booker Prize this year? The reason is the brilliant re-imagining of the author, Graeme Mccare Burnet, who claims to have discovered the incarcerated young man’s memoir while he was researching his own roots. What follows is the “actual” memoir, written in the tone of the 1860s, witness statements, medical reports, a psychological assessment of Roddy (by real-life prison doctor James Bruce Thomson), notes from the trial and so forth. The result is that the reader is whisked away to the town of Culduie and set down among the crofters who stoically work their croft, eeking out a meager living, with nary a chance of upward mobility. Powerless and frustrated, unable to do much more than accept their yoke, Roddy and his family come alive under the deft pen of Mr. Burnet. While Roddy is unusually eloquent for an uneducated young man, his memoir seems quite straightforward…that is, until the doubts emerge. Is his version truly accurate? Or is he partially insane or at least, disingenuous? This novel is extraordinarily ambitious, psychologically complex, and filled with enough narrative tension to keep readers at the edge of their seats.

Norton & Company, for allowing me to be an early reader.James Lasdun knows a thing or two about betrayal and revenge. In the last book I read by him – a memoir entitled Give Me Everything You Have – he tells the harrowing real-life story of being stalked by an unbalanced student.So it’s no surprise that this work of fiction, The Fall Guy, is so darn good. It builds momentum slowly, beginning with the introduction of two of the three main characters – Matthew, a superb haute cuisine chef who is currently unemployed, and his far more successful cousin Charlie, a one-time investment broker for Morgan Stanley. Charlie, who is married to the ethereal Chloe, invites Matthew to spend the summer with them in their second home in the Catskills.The only thing is that Matthew is obsessed with Chloe and Chloe may very well be obsessed with a fourth character, who is fleshed out later in the book. Each of these three characters is unreliable: nothing is precisely as it appears. Lingering in the background is the wide social class and money gap between the cousins and the resentment that traces back to their childhood. As tensions mount and secrets become unveiled, there is an almost unbearable feeling of suspense in the final 100 pages of the book. Who, in fact, is the victim? Who will be the fall guy? Who is the guilty party and what is the nature of guilt? Can someone ever reinvent themselves or is the die cast early on? The relationship between the Matt, Charlie and Chloe is finely nuanced and wonderfully explored and exposed. As the fault lines in these relationships expand to become chasms, it is impossible to look away. Expect to feel unsettled and totally absorbed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Sep 20, 2016","Sep 22, 2016","Sep 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28789706-the-fall-guy

If this author is not a poet, she should be. There is sheer beauty in the choice of words and how they illuminate Ari Appleton’s story. Ari is eight years old – the youngest of six sisters – and her child-struggle with words that are beyond her ken adds to the whimsical feel of this novel.Ari is a lioneagle who finds solace with her imaginary seahorse, Jasper, her trusted companion who never leaves her, and illustrations of Jasper adorn some of the pages. Her real name is Hariet (one r) but her aunts, Mary and Nia – a gay couple – rename her and in doing so, give her a sense of safety. She is also a clay girl: “…Clay absorbs water, same as you soaking up everything in your path. And with a little added grit, but not too much the clay becomes stronger.”The beginning 50 pages can be confusing. There are a number of characters on the Appleton tree and there’s a jumble of names and relationships to keep straight. But once the story begins to settle in, it becomes truly haunting: a child who only wants shelter, safety and love who is torn between a well-meaning stepdad and teachers and her mother’s selfishness, homophobia and inherent meanness. As Ari moves between broken houses and broken people, she struggles to escape the fates of her damaged sisters through the redemptive power of love.Reviewing a book about the child of an incestuous pedophile and an addicted, cruel mother can set any reader on an emotional rollercoaster. Yet the rewards abound. It is testimony to how a little girl can survive – even thrive – through the creative power of imagination and an inner compass that continually points her towards those who are kind and good. It is about the triumph of hope, discovery and self-creation over the murkiness of legacy, loss and despair.

In his debut book, You Deserve NothiAlexander Maksik is no stranger to ethical dilemmas and that tenuous bridge that hangs between desire and action. In his debut book, You Deserve Nothing, he crafts the book as a cautionary reminder of what happens when idealism fails. In his next book, A Marker to Measure Drift, he examines that theme from another angle: how does a person keep fighting to live after witnessing the most inhumane acts of barbarism? Where is the line between recollection and madness drawn?In Shelter In Place, this talented author returns – in part – to these unsettling themes of the failure of idealism and the line between recollection and madness. Our first-person narrator is Joseph (Joe, Joey) March, a young man from the Seattle area, who is beginning to descend into bipolar disorder. At the same time, his mother, Anne-Marie, beats an abusive father/husband to death with seven hammer strokes and is sentenced to 5-to-25 years. Joe finds shelter in the arms of Tess Wolff, a free spirit whom he meets while working part-time as a bartender…or does he? The two embark on a tumultuous and adrenaline-fueled relationship that burns brightly but sometimes feels out of control. Anne-Marie’s imprisonment metaphorically imprisons all the characters: Joe’s father, who becomes stuck, Joe and Tess, who react to it in their own ways, and Claire, his older sister, who breaks all ties.Yet while Alexander Maksik’s first two novels grabbed me at the throat and never let go – until I was almost gasping for air – his latest keeps me at arm’s length. I am primarily a character-based reader, and I struggled to understand their complicated inner lives. Yes, the novel explores important themes: the delicate dance of damaged family interactions, the legacy of mental illness, the unwillingness of authorities to deal with domestic violence, the consequences of unexamined actions, and the volatility of a self-consuming love. And without giving anything away, the ending is beautifully written and organic in its conclusions. Yet the willful meandering and repetition of a bipolar mind and the arms-length portrayal of Tess and Anne-Marie left me not caring quite enough. I yearned for the emotional adrenaline I received from Mr. Maksik’s first two novels.

He launcheThere is a famous adage for novelists: “write what you know.” Ward Just has always done so and fortunately for his readers, he knows a lot. He launched his career as a print journalist for the Waukegan (Illinois) News-Sun, worked as a correspondent for Newsweek and The Washington Post, and fully understands the inner workings of journalism and its influence on Americans’ personal lives.The Eastern Shore – his latest book – focuses on Ned Ayres, who hails from a humdrum Indiana town of Herman and defies his father, a judge, to become his hometown’s city editor. “Some people don’t live in the light of day,” Ned says at one point. “They prefer shadows, a natural habitat. Shadows become them.”Ned lives in the shadows. There is almost an element of Henry James’ Beast in the Jungle in him; his is, in many aspects, a life unfulfilled. There are romances, yes, and there are high points, but mostly, his life is lived as a “procession of newspaper stories, ‘shorts,’ they were called.” One could say, in newspaper parlance, that Ned lives “below the fold.”Accordingly, The Eastern Shore is a quiet book. It’s a book about stories – the stories we tell ourselves, the stories we invent, the stories that we create about others, and eventually, the stories that sustain us and give an organization and meaning to our lives.Ward Just signals his intent by starting the book with Uncle Ralph, the brother of Ned’s father. Uncle Ralph is a veteran of the Great War, whose “memory was phenomenal, story after story rumbling from it in a husky baritone.” Problem is, the stories only have a kernel of truth in them. His father tells Ned to believe them if he wants to, but to remember that the stories are not factual.As Ned embraces his life as an editor, he becomes – quite literally – the person who gives shape to the stories. It is he who identifies the high and low points of a person’s life and determines what will be revealed. Paradoxically, he reveals little of himself. “Editing was as invisible as the work of a careful tailor,” Ward Just writes. No trace of the editor is left behind. Yet as he ages, he is painfully aware that the newspaper business is dying, as fickle readers clamor for social media innovation. In essential ways, he is twinned with the business he gave his life to; soon, it is implied, neither will exist and only the stories will remain.Those who are seeking a propulsive narrative that will raise their adrenalin would be better looking elsewhere. The Eastern Shore is a contemplative book, interweaving the themes of privacy and morality but concentrating most on one’s own inner stories. It is a fine addition to Ward Just’s many fine books (I recommend American Romantic, Rodin’s Debutante and An Unfinished Season for those who want to explore more.)...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Aug 30, 2016",Sep 2016,"Aug 30, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28114468-the-eastern-shore

It’s a lot of drivel about a “smart, friendly, playful, super-cute baby chimpanzee” who was orphaned and later adopted by a nice upper-class family living in New York. One day, the father’s evil girlfriend accuses Mister Monkey of stealing her wallet and it’s almost curtains for the monkey until a committed lawyer fights for truth, justice and the American way.But just as humans have evolved from monkeys, a cast of loosely connected characters evolve because of this monkey. Each successive chapter introduces a damaged character: the middle-aged Margot whose dream of acting on Broadway has been transformed into acting in this childish production…the pubescent Mister Monkey actor who is hostage to his raging hormones…the grieving widower and his young grandson, Edward, who interrupts the production by loudly asking, “Grandpa, are you interested?”…Ray Ortiz, the writer and veteran, who intended the play to be set in Vietnam…the pretentious director Roger…and so on.Francine Prose uses her trademark razor-sharp satire to nail today’s society: upper middle class parents who want their kids to get into the most prestigious pre-school, the furor over mentioning Darwin to the sweet babes, the brave and underpaid actors who must soldier on with each performance, the horror of mismatched first Internet dates, the existential fear that young people share in an uncertain world. Sounds like a lot, but Francine Prose weaves it in seamlessly. Maybe a little too seamlessly; at times this most enjoyable narrative ran the risk of being overplotted.As a result, I was going to give it 4 stars.

Only the rich and the lucky can afford to live without stories, for without stories, as every Haitian peasant knows, life is all just things that happen to you, and you are just something that happens in the lives of others.”I quote that passage because above all else, Peacekeeping is a story and the story focuses on the poorest country in the Western hemisphere – Haiti. There are, of course, fleshed-out characters. But each of them contributes to the Haitian tapestry, particularly focusing on the remote coastal town of Jeremie – a town that does not have a road and therefore, does not have a lifeline.There is Terry White, a U.N. policeman who has lost at the game of life back in Florida and now has grasped a second chance to reboot himself. Eventually, he is drawn to a charismatic district judge named Johel Celestin, who spent years in the U.S. after escaping the Duvalier regime and who has come back finely sensitized to the injustice and poverty that face his countrymen. He is married to a beautiful green-eyed and ebony-skinned seductress. When an opportunity arises to topple the entrenched and morally corrupt senator, Maxim Bayard, Johel grabs it – along with Terry to help lead him forward.The author, I’ve read, actually lived in Haiti and it shows. His knowledge of a country that lives and survives on stories – one’s own story and the story of a land – comes across loud and clear. The themes that run through this book are as old as mankind itself: the insatiable quest for love and power, the varying nuances of morality, the ways we support and betray each other. In this election year – I’m reading this just two months before the 2016 election – the shenanigans and drama of the electoral contest are particularly timely and fascinating. If there is a flaw in this novel, it’s that Berlinski eventually chooses to focus more on the machinations of electoral events as opposed to the characters; one senses that he is using his knowledge a little too intensely and for pages, the book almost reads like non-fiction (although it is, fiction or perhaps gussied-up stories.) “The tragedy of peacekeeping,” Berlinski writes. “…was that you are inevitably on the wrong side of someone who is in the right. Perhaps, he thought that was the tragedy of life.” By interpreting what peacekeeping means – in all its nuances – Berlinki has written a fine novel indeed....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 15, 2016","Aug 19, 2016","Aug 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25664555-peacekeeping

The book has the tone If someone were to have told me that The Golden Age was written in 1954 – the time of its setting – I would have believed them. The book has the tone of a classic, with the potential of rediscovery upon future readings.There are no bells and whistles here. The writing is spare but powerful, carefully calibrated to reveal but not lead the reader. I often separate books into warm (those that touch the heart) and cool (those that touch the brain). On that continuum, I’d place this book at “cool-ish”, not at all manipulative despite its theme.And what IS the theme? In a word, it’s displacement. The Golden Age refers to an actual polio children’s convalescent home in Australia that existed between 1949-1959. Frank Gold (no coincidence, I think, that his name is similar to the home) is sent there just as he stands on the brink of maturity (he is 13 years old). There he meets Elsa, also on the cusp of adulthood, and according to the book jacket, they fall in love.Still, the love story is not truly the focal point of the book. Frank considers this: “Every country had its rules. He had to learn them. How long would he be allowed to stay here? Was this the country where he could finally feel at home?” Frank and his family have already been displaced; they are Hungarian Jews who were forced to leave their homeland during the war and in Australia, view themselves as strangers in a strange land. Polio is a metaphor for this displacement and forces Frank, once again, to learn to adjust in a home with its own history and rules.Frank’s illness and recovery are aligned, in ways, with that of his parents, Meyer and Ida. Ida was an esteemed pianist in Hungary and has not performed for a while; one might say she is dealing with her own form of paralysis. Meyer, who is more optimistic, must come to the realization that his new city “is its own place. It is not like anywhere else.” The entire family moves towards acceptance of a new reality.There are many secondary characters here as well, and none of them receive short shrift. This is a gentle book and it requires careful reading to fully glean all its nuances.

He does not, however, mention George Orwell’s 1984, where the chestnut tree symbolizes betrayal in the name of justice and honesty.And indeed, The Allegations is about betrayal in the age of political correctness. Ned Marriott, one of Britain’s best-known history professors and TV documentary personalities, is accused by someone in his distant past of sexual assault. At the same time, his funny and sarcastic best friend, Tom Pimm, a much-beloved professor, is accused as well; his charge is bullying and insubordination by petty colleagues. He is told, “The point I’m making, Dr. Pimm, is that if someone felt you were being insensitive, then, to all intents an purposes, you are.”In Ned and Tom’s milieu, students are called “customers” and their fragile sensibilities must be guarded at all costs. And of course, everyone must be oh so politically correct. As Tom says, “Ours is a culture in which allegation is assumed to be fact and the bleating of the self-righteous equals justice. I am haunted by the fact that – in an era where most teachers and writers of History concur that it is unwise to aver with any certainty exactly what happened in the past – the CPS, the police, newspaper columnists, victim support groups and HR departments seem suddenly possessed by twenty-twenty hindsight…”If this seems a mite bit preachy, there’s good reason for it. The author himself was the victim of false accusation and surreally sub-legal process and he was ousted from BBC Radio 4’s Front Row amid claims of bullying. It’s obvious that the experience still stings. As a result, the novel – at times – can be bloated (do we really need all the examples of the damage of allegation in literature) and occasionally, Mark Lawson’s voice seems to slip through.Still, the book is so impressively written – it could be a satire except stuff like this really happens – that it becomes a must-read. The exploration of the guilty-until-proven-guilty, the social media trials, the salacious news reporting, the catalogue of “petulant defamations, slyly redesigned anecdotes and evangelical self-righteousness”, the pampering of spoiled “customers”, the inanity of having each smirk or whisper analyzed, the “historical sexual abuse” (which at the time was dual consent), the PC silliness that has become a hallmark of today’s universities – all of this is brilliantly captured, along with destructions of one’s name and family. With shades of the McCarthy era, the Workplace Harmony commissions are our new witch hunts. This book really hits its target. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 05, 2016","Aug 15, 2016","Aug 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31135491-the-allegations

Recently, several Hogarth Shakespeare series have been releasThe 400th birthday of William Shakespeare has prompted the literary world to pay homage. Recently, several Hogarth Shakespeare series have been released: Jeanette Winterson’s retelling of The Winter’s Tale, Howard Jacobson’s rendering of The Merchant of Venice, Anne Tyler’s take on The Taming of the Shrew and soon, Margaret Atwood’s re-imagining of The Tempest.Is it a coincidence, then, that Ian McEwan decided on his own to take on one of the greatest challenges in literature: the tale of Hamlet? I don’t think there are many true coincidences in literature. The irony (and yes, Shakespeare loved irony) is that this slim volume is – in my opinion – the most successful reinterpretation of Shakespeare that I’ve seen to date.Imagine Hamlet as a nine-month-old fetus, privy to the plotting of the murder of his own father by his beautiful and scheming mother (here named Trudy) and Uncle Claude, a dull and oversexed fool. What if the famous line, “To be or not to be?” meant precisely that: would the fetus survive through birth…and after being born, what then?Gimmicky or weird? Some might say so. But the fact is: it works! This conceit functions beautifully, a modern day thriller-of-sorts for today’s times with an obvious nod to Shakespeare’s own art.Our fetus is a particularly articulate and perceptive, pondering over the life that awaits him after birth, considering ways to make himself indispensable to his mothers, railing against the perfidy of his uncle, trying to make himself a player on the world stage. The long-neglected miracle of existence and the dilemma of endings and beginnings is leveraged. Hints of Macbeth (“screw your courage to the sticking point”) and Banquo’s ghost eventually slip in to the tale as well.The writing is – as one might expect from Ian McEwan – exquisite. I read some of the lines over again, and then a third time. Once again, Ian McEwan has revealed himself to be one of the finest writers working today....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,Aug 2016,"Aug 02, 2016","Aug 01, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29752912-nutshell

How old was she?”“Eight.”“That’s creepy.”A normal reaction to the love affair between a young girl and a man in his 20s would – quite rightly – be one of extreme revulsion. It is Bryn Greenwood’s gift to carefully lay out the nuances and to have the reader rooting for Wavy and Kellen. This is no small feat.Wavy is the damaged and ethereal daughter of a meth dealer and a psychologically impaired mother who may be suffering from multiple personality disorder, borderline personality and who knows what else. From a young age she learns that she is dirty and undeserving of love. She speaks little; eats less. Touching is threatening to her…even a normal hug.And then, early on, she meets Kellen, who works for her father. He’s a heavily tattooed ex-con and he, too, is damaged, from childhood abuse and a system that has worked against him. Yet deep within him lurks a good-hearted and kind person. He gravitates to this un-parented little girl, making sure she gets to school regularly, has clothes on her back, and has a safe place to land when there is chaos in her home. Gradually, they fall in love. The book is written in a number of perspectives. We hear from Wavy and from Kellen, of course. We also hear from Wavy’s uptight aunt, her older cousin, her younger brother Donal who is also part of the madness, and from the various people who enter and touch Wavy’s life. It bears nothing that the author (on the book jacket) stats that she is the daughter of a mostly reformed drug dealer. The book has an authenticity and a power that is not seen in most books that focus on the drug culture.In short, I believed in these characters…every single one. Many of the details are dark, yet the book never wavers in his key message of the triumph of love.I was at 5 stars the entire way up until the last 50 pages, which veer to the cinematic. Bryn Greenwood strives to wrap up all the loose ends and as a result, I’m not quite sure that the ending is organic, although for many, it will be satisfying.

That’s all a book has to do.”So says the eponymous Mr. M, a respected yet fading novelist and one of the key characters in Herman Koch’s novel. And by that criterion, Dear Mr. M is a smashing success. Once I started reading it, I forgot myself and couldn't put it down.Years ago, Mr. M wrote a bestseller entitled Payback, based on a widely-circulated news story of a teenage couple who may have been responsible for the killing of a teacher, after the teacher’s affair with the girl ended badly. The male teen, Herman, is now Mr. M’s downstairs neighbor…and he is watching him carefully.Dear Mr. M functions partially as a satire. “In novels, characters never have the same first name. Never” says Mr. M. Yet puckishly, Herman Koch gives the teen his own name – Herman. There are delicious scenes of Mr. M doing the obligatory publicity tour and book signing, answering simplistic audience questions, and dealing with up-and-coming writers who confuse the esteem their book gets with their own sense of esteem.But even more compellingly, Dear Mr. M is a study in two swaggering narcissists – Mr. M and his stalker, Herman – who may indeed be two peas in a pod. Each is a borderline sociopath who has made his way in the world. Each desires to craft the world through his own imagination and craft – Mr. M through his novels, Herman through his videos. Each is attuned to the conflict of freedom of expression versus demanding the right to offend anyone we please. And each is intricately connected to the other through the creation of Payback.We view the backstory and the present through the lens of various people: Mr. M, Herman, the unfortunate teacher, former friends of Herman. What emerges is an unsettling tale of what really occurred during that fatal day, which is not totally clear until the very end.

The fact that I didn’t has more to say about me as a reader than it has to say about Holly Muller as a writer. Those who are intrigued should follow their instincts and judge for themselves.The book – divided into three parts -- introduces us to Ursula Hildescheim, a 14 year old girl who lives in the small Austrian Village of Felddorf in 1944. She lives there with her widowed mother and brother, Anton, whom she adores…even though it is obvious to the reader that he is the stuff from which Hitler Youth are made of. He’s damaged and cruel – almost to the point of caricature – and his influence over Ursula is enormous.The author makes an audacious choice in the first part of the book, turning Ursula into Anton’s accomplice for a morally abhorrent act. For me, this decision did not pay off. At 14, teens are formed enough to know the ramifications of their moral decisions and I quickly felt distanced from her.Ursula must then redeem herself. In essence, the book adheres to many of the tenets of young adult fiction (and let me stress, there is nothing wrong with that. To Kill a Mockingbird, for example, was YA fiction at its finest). How do I define YA fiction? There has to be a good story and the book must move at a good pace. There has to be a young teen (or child) who is undergoing scary and confusing emotions. That teen must undergo a catharsis with little or no real help from adults.Her quest leads her to try to free a mentally impaired friend named Schosi who was captured and forced into a Mengele-like institution. In real life, a feat like hers would have been unlikely – even impossible – and I needed to surrender belief. Only in part three – when the Russians arrive – did I feel that the book became vividly harrowing and fulfill its initial promise of merging in folklore and authentically exploring the evil that lies inside and outside us.Those who love The Book Thief – the majority of readers – have a treat in store for them. I was seeking greater complexity (Why was Anton so damaged? What was so compelling about him for Ursula?) and veracity (Could anyone really aid a boy like Schosi without severe repercussions?)

I am a lover of short stories and I’ve found that that kiss can be anything from a brief (too dry to care), sloppy (too undisciplined) or intense (need a bit of distance).Patrick Ryan gets the formula just right. He’s a natural-born storyteller and I loved every single one of these nine touching stories. All of them take place around Cape Canaveral as public enthusiasm for the NASA space program was dying down. And each is about individuals who have been left at the launching pad, trying to build propulsion for take-off.My favorites? The eponymous story The Dream Life of Astronauts introduces us to Frankie, a teenage boy who is remarkably comfortable in his own skin after coming out to his family. At a public library, he meets a former astronaut, Clark Evans, who is now out of the NASA program and touts real estate business cards that read: “I’ll travel the galaxy to meet your needs.” What happens next is a painful and unexpected look at suburbia and the chasm between innocent youth and cynical adulthood.We will meet Frankie one more time in this collection, in the equally fine story Earth, Mostly. He’s grown up now, yet has moved back to his mother’s home. That story – which also features characters we’ve met in a former story Miss America – cuts right to the chase by portraying ordinary life with all its foibles (including a grandmother who has arranged to meet her married driving instructor after crashing her car).There are more delights in store for the reader as well. One story portrays a bookkeeper of an extortion program who lives in a Florida retirement home under the witness protection program and clashes with the anal-retentive head of his condo board. There’s a great story about a NASA engineer who is romancing his boss’s wife…and wondering if she’s trying to poison that boss. Whether he’s writing about a 70-year-old man who finally reaches closure with his toxic 92-year-old mother or two bullying teen brothers and their stroke-impaired father, Patrick Ryan’s characters ring authentic.The strength of this collection was such that I wanted to read it straight through without pause.

There are certain similarities: the Seattle setting, the razor-sharp wisecracks, the punchy humor, the precocious child and the mother who is barely holding onto her sanity, the poignancy of the message, even old documents as a devise to uncover a troubled past.Yes, Maria Semple has gone back to the well in her new novel. Yet the book is so darn enjoyable that it’s hard not to fall in love with it. From the very first page, I was hooked – and remained so every step of the way.Eleanor Flood is the renowned animator of a popular cartoon called Looper Wash – a New York transplant in Seattle, where she lives with her husband (a hand surgeon for the Seahawks) and her wise-beyond-his-years third-grade son Timby (his name might have been Timothy, but the iPhone autocorrected it). She is also the survivor of a chaotic childhood (actress mother who died early and alcoholic father) and a sometime-student of poetry.She is also an adherent of this philosophy: “The world will be hostile, it will be suspicious of your intent, it will flatter you into self-sabotage…What the world is, more than anything? It’s indifferent.” Yet Eleanor, despite herself, fights against this indifference. And often, she holds a mirror up to our own wishes and hypocrisies.Who among us hasn’t had at least one friend in our lifetime that we don’t like but haven’t been able to shake? Who hasn’t come face to face with a cringe-worthy who is stunted in his moral growth and distances others every time he opens his mouth? Who hasn’t come up against the PC police (Timby’s friend – a girl! -- eviscerates him for his H&M clothing that comes from a third-world sweatshop) or worried that our brains are turning to mush? And who hasn’t used “tricks” to conceal our insecurities and attain more admiration and love?The thing is, Maria Semple gets it – this thing called life. With the one exception of a secondary plot about husband Joe’s long-held secret (rather over the top), this is a book that masters the impossible trick of being witty and achingly sincere at the same time. As an added bonus, there several pages of cartoons from Eleanor’s graphic novel, The Flood Girls (transporting us into her world so we can attest to her talent). It’s a book for any reader who is striven to become one’s best self despite the odds. In short, it’s a book for everyone.

You’ve taken one of my most beloved Shakespeare plays – The Tempest – and breatheth new life into it. In doing so, you’ve done the bard proud.Picture this, if you will: Felix is the risk-taking artistic director of the Makeshiweg Theatre Festival, whose productions have blazed new ground. But a treacherous rival double deals Felix, who soon finds himself living in a prison of his own making, a backwoods hut where he is accompanied by memories of his deceased daughter, Miranda. An opportunity presents itself: teaching a theatre course at the Fletcher Correctional prison . Felix is determined to stage The Tempest, a play he was in the middle of producing before he was unceremoniously dumped at Makeshiwig. There is so much to commend this book that I don’t even know where to start. First, there are the parallels between Felix and Prospero (his The Tempest role): both are in thrall with daughters named Miranda, and both are castaways, hoping to one day achieve their rightful place. Both are, in ways, in the midst of their own tempest, using their creative powers to reach redemption.Then there is Margaret Atwood’s intimate knowledge of the play, which presents interpretations that I had not even considered (with a grad degree in English Literature, I have read the play several times and have seen it produced often as well). Each of the inmates will eventually reveal what they believe happens to the character they play after The Tempest ends. The interpretations are beyond fascinating. Felix’s own production of The Tempest also illuminates what the bard was doing. By viewing characters such as Caliban and Ariel through the prism of prison life, the roles take on whole new meanings….because, as Felix says, The Tempest is loaded up with images of prisons (some real, some imaginary, and some fanciful). Even those who aren’t remotely familiar with The Tempest will delight in the story of a wronged man who seeks his just revenge.

The definition of “happy” can differ widely, There’s an oft-used quote by Tolstoy that all happy families are alike, but that’s not true, not really. The definition of “happy” can differ widely, and the definition of “family” can as well.Christine Reilly tells her readers straight out: “this will be a story about family.” The family in question is Claudio and Mathilde Simone and their three daughters: the overachieving Natasha, the middle sister Lucy who suffers from heart disease, and Carly, adopted from China. It also includes Sawyer, Mathilde’s gay brother, and Jane, Claudio’s schizophrenic sister.Family is an organic concept. As Sawyer’s partner says, “What was family? Just a set of people who thought you were obliged to them, for whatever reason. For helping you exist—or not.” Yet in reality, the Simones do more than help each other exist. They help each other find meaning in a life that is often mystery-shrouded.Two things raise Sunday’s On The Phone With Monday above the usual exploration of a diverse – and let’s face it, all too often derivative – family drama. The first is Christine Reilly’s unique and lyrical slant. Her distinct alchemy is to mine the essence of her story, capturing the gold and letting the debris slip away. In this way, her novel becomes almost mythical. For example, we are not exposed to the brutal medical realities of heart transplantation (such as in the very graphic book Sick Girl by Amy Silverstein). Rather, Lucy is a life force, a catalyst who illuminates the lives of others. Her antithesis might be Aunt Jane; Lucy is hurting to live and for Jane, living itself means hurting. Secondly, I don’t recall any other novel that comes with its own playlist. The author wisely recognizes that each of our lives is accompanied by a soundtrack and nearly 50 songs – from the Beatles to Elton John and Bob Dylan – are alluded to within these pages. The song references ground the reader, both in place and time, and in intent without becoming overwhelming.Christine Reilly’s affectation is to capitalize the word Heart, even if it’s in the midst of a sentence (SweetHeart). The reception to this will depend on the reader; for me, it got a little cloying. Still, this is a debut novel with heart.

Jeremy O’Keefe, a New York academic who had spent a decade teaching in Oxford, receives boxes containing links to all of his online activity. He feels like he’s being followed. He wonders if he is starting to lose his mind. As he begins to search his memory about what would make him a target, he wonders, “Was that ethnical charge sheet enough, \I wondered, to imperil my privacy, even perhaps my liberty?” He is amazed at the slippery slope that can quickly turn a person’s life into a nightmare in this digital age.But my problems with the book are two-fold. First, we become lost in Jeremy O’Keefe’s every thought. He is meticulous in recounting every bit of minutiae and following every thought thread, in a dispassionate and yes, academic, manner. That undoubtedly works for many readers, but not for me. I wanted a greater sense of emotional connection (put another way, I wanted to FEEL the anxiety). Second, at times, I felt that Patrick Flanery had twinned with his characters, so that I wasn’t quite sure whose voice I was following – the author’s or the character’s. the only comparison I can make is to the book Freedom, by Jonathan Franzen, where he indulged in advancing some pet causes at the expense of a propulsive narrative. (At one point, in a page-long, controlled run-on sentence, Jeremy rants, “What is crazy is to imagine we are living private lives, or that a private life is a possibility any longer, and this is not just true for those living out our sentence in the developed world, but anyone anywhere, except perhaps those hidden underground…etc.” Character or author?)Still, I was glad to read the book for the sheer power of Patrick Flanery’s prose, which is indisputably strong, and it’s an important reminder about how rapidly we can fall into the rabbit hole. I received this book from Blogging for Books for this . ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 10, 2016","Jul 12, 2016","Jul 10, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27209269-i-am-no-one

They can distort, but they never lie.”So says Javier Mallinaro, the protagonist of Reputations, and one of the most influential and legendary political cartoonists in Colombia. A caricature from him can define someone for life and make and break a reputation. He fancies himself a humanist, a satirical illustrator, a “driller downer” of complicated personalities and a revealer of the true core of what lies beneath.But at the heart of this slim, provocative and insightful novel lays this question: can caricatures, indeed, invent reality? Even with good intent, can they lie? Does it do any good for anyone afterwards to explore doubt? And what do the caricatures say about the person who creates them?This is a novel of ideas with philosophical underpinnings. Juan Gabriel Vasquez ruthlessly explores a man at the end of his career, conscience stricken over a caricature he created years ago that may have destroyed lives. Whether the caricature was justified or not is almost immaterial; the fact that Mallinaro had the power to make it happen makes all the difference.I’ve come to really respect Juan Gabriel Vasquez’s works and once again, I was not disappointed.

I’ve had the pleasure of reading nearly all of Mr. Watson’s books -- Montana 1948 is near perfection and his last book, Let Him Go, touched my heart – and his prose is always authentic, insightful, and graceful.Yet in this, his newest book, Larry Watson asks us to buy into a premise: Bill Sidey -- the middle-aged son of Calvin Sidey, a recalcitrant old-fashioned cowboy who deserted his family years ago -- asks his father to come back to Gladstone and stay with his grandchildren for a week. It is unlikely the request would have been made and even more unlikely that the request would have been granted. So for the first 75 pages or so, I found myself struggling with the premise.Eventually, though, the sheer power of the writing took hold and I found I couldn’t turn pages fast enough. Calvin is an anachronism, a wild card, who would rather escape from emotions than stand firm and face them. In his small Montana town, he has become near mythic with rumors of murders and beatings, yet Calvin lives by his own set of Old West rules and ethics.The secondary characters – Bill and his wife Marjorie, who must leave town for a hysterectomy (hence Calvin’s visit), 17-year-old Ann and her younger brother Will, and Beverly Lodge, the next-door neighbor who finds herself inexplicably attracted to Calvin, are all well portrayed. The intimate scenes – and yes, there are intimate scenes – of the physical passion between Calvin and Beverly are beautifully portrayed and firmly demonstrate that passion is not just the domain of the young and beautiful.Larry Watson does not take the easy way out; the book does not progress or end the way one would suspect it should. Put another way, he remains true to the essence of who Calvin Sidey really is. Still, there are times when he seems to want it both ways, portraying his character as a self-absorbed Old West cowboy who lives and acts off the grid and as a man who is actually quite caring. So rating this is particularly hard. For personal enjoyment, at least 4 stars.

The island that Miranda, a photographer, chooses for what amounts to a self-imposed exile can be monstrous – with heavy mist, menacing and ruthless nature, guano everywhere. Its inhabitants appear to be caught (as with Prospero and Caliban) in a conflict between educational enlightenment and base desire. Except, possibly, for the intern, all harbor deep wounds and secrets.Miranda’s deep wound is the death of her mother in a tragic accident when she was at a particularly tender age. The scar has never healed; Miranda writes scraps of letters to her mother on a regular basis, never sending them, to maintain the illusion of a connection. A violent incident opens the wound further, making her increasingly emotional fragile. One of the strongest images is when one person captures a tiny octopus and confines it to a cage, to be studied and brought out at will, and treated with benign neglect. It’s a metaphor for Miranda herself Galen, the oldest of the six inhabitants, asks her, “What is your nature?” As a landscape photographer, this is how Miranda describes part of it, “My work is the enemy of memory. People often imagine that taking pictures will help them recall exactly what happened. In fact, the opposite is true…I can either have the impression in my brain or the image in my hand—not both.” So what is the truth about Miranda? What is the truth about any of the six inhabitants who willingly turn their back on the past? Is there, indeed, a “truth” or is the untamed human psyche part of the untamed natural world? When does the concept of noninterference – the job of photographers and biologists – go too far? And ultimately, if there are only two kinds of people in the world – “the takers and the watchers—the plunderers and the protectors”—what side should a person be on?All of these concepts are explored beautifully in this gripping novel that fashions a petri dish of sorts – a restrictive and hostile environment with unknowable characters. Like in The Tempest, the audience – we, the readers – determine if anyone is truly free. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jun 27, 2016","Jun 30, 2016","Jun 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25786411-the-lightkeepers

Home is the place where you are your most authentic self, a place of sanctuary and acceptance.Kathleen Alcott wisely understands that. In a run-down Brooklyn brownstone, overseen by an octogenarian named Edith who is beginning to lose her mind, a ragtag small group of men and women feel anxious for their future. All are damaged, physically or emotionally: Thomas, a once-time well-known painter who is now partially paralyzed by a stroke, Paulie, a child-man who suffers from Williams Syndrome and his tightly-coiled and doting sister Claudia, Adeleine who is an agoraphobe and hoarder, and Edward, a comedian who hides his fears with caustic humor. Together, they recreate the definition of family and learn to trust and love each other.This author’s prose is gorgeous – sometimes, breathtakingly so, and her insights are similarly beautiful. One description of Edith: “She was upset because she said (her memories) were sort of losing their foundation, like they were flooded and pushed into the wrong rooms.” There is the fear of “playing nonsensical checkers with incontinent zombies.” Or, in this description of fireflies: “They had seen only little flashes like the beginnings of lonely ideas but not the crowd of busy angels he had come for.” After a little while, I began noting that every single chapter could actually stand by itself as a short story, although this is definitely a novel with a forward propulsion. Each of thse chapters shimmers like gems.And oh, the themes: what is home? (One character answers, “No need to bring home with me, dear. I know what it feels like.”) What happens when we are forced out of our own poor facsimile of a self-created Garden of Eden into the world to seek answers? Can we recreate ourselves to give ourselves a second chance – through trust of others, the open road, cults, or the great outdoors? The answers are nuanced: some of these characters can, some can’t. I would give this novel 5 stars were it not for one particularly one-dimensional character. Owen, Edith’s son, is the embodiment of menacing evil, and the reasons for his malaise are way too pat. Also, Claudia’s devotion to her brother Paulie sometimes seems idealized and cloying.

It’s elegantly written, lushly imagined, mesmerizing in the world it creates. It creates fully realized characters, brims with charm, evokes a bygone world, provides moments of introspection and even philosophy. In short, Amor Towles has written – in my opinion – a near-perfect book.I have had a problem in the past with books that try to do too much, bridging decades of aging and history, which give the characters short shrift. Not so here. Count Alexander Rostov – by the end of the book – seems like an old friend, one whom the reader does not want to bid farewell. He is also a man of uncommon decency, sentenced to house arrest in the tony Metropol Hotel, and adjusting to his life as a “Former Person.”While exhibiting aristocratic airs with his oh-so-refined taste in wine and food, he also is the very epitomy of decency and fairness. Put another way, he is likeable – extremely so. Mr. Towles seamlessly weaves in the history of Russia, including (for this reader) some truly enlightening scenes of Khrushchev’s rise to power. But make no mistake, exposing the Russian soul is not the key objective here. It is exposing mankind’s soul through the Count.For foodies, there are some fascinating capers as the Count becomes more and more involved with the highly-esteemed Metropol restaurant and its exquisite foods and accompanying wines. For literary lovers, a based-on-truth digression into Chekhov is intriguing. History lovers, of course, will enjoy the glimpse into Russia’s evolution. Movie buffs? There’s something for you, too, with a subplot having to do with Casablanca. But anyone who is human will be enthralled with the marvelous depiction of the vanity of age fading gently into the wisdom of maturity. Mr. Towles writes, “…our lives are steered by uncertainty, many of which are disruptive or even daunting, but…if we persevere and remain generous of heart, we may be granted a moment of supreme lucidity—a moment in which all that has happened to us suddenly comes into focus as a necessary course of events.” I loved this big-hearted and well-plotted book and highly recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Oct 02, 2016","Oct 09, 2016","Jun 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430012-a-gentleman-in-moscow

Henry quotation: “Pull up the shades so I can see New York. I don’t want to go home in the dark.”In NThis powerful novel is prefaced by a haunting O. Henry quotation: “Pull up the shades so I can see New York. I don’t want to go home in the dark.”In New York in the 1980s, all too many people – mostly gay, mostly male – were going home in the dark as the AIDS epidemic gained ground. The rest of us, at least in the beginning, were in the dark as well, not quite understanding the gravity and terrifying implications of this horrendous disease and going blithely about our business. It is to Tim Murphy’s credit that he illuminates the era as he firmly focuses on the legacy of AIDS.The vortex of his novel is an artistically-inclined young boy named Mateo, whose mother, Issy, was one of the first Latina activists against AIDS, and the two liberal artists and urban pioneers, Milly and Jared, who adopt him and raise him at Christodora – the inevitable “triumph” of gentrification -- and a real East Village apartment building. As the novel shifts back and forth from the early years of the AIDS epidemic to a future where AIDS is cured, Mateo is the era’s lost son, struggling to find identity and meaning. Like Saint-Expery’s Little Prince, he is exiled from his own essence and must find his way to a safe place called “home.”Yet while Mateo and his adopted parents anchor the story, it’s the other characters who round it out, including Hector, who leaves the NYC Department of Health to join the fledgling activist group ACT UP. At first fueled with promise and drive, Hector embodies all the anger of “too little too late” and embraces heroin and meth addictions to provide him with a sought-after state of temporary forgetfulness. Moving seamlessly from the day-to-day business of health care bureaucrats to the victims that activism has forgotten to the bourgeois concerns of those who stand ready to serve in AIDS shadows, Christodora is filled with uncomfortable truths. It ambitiously tackles so many important themes: the interweaving of AIDS and drugs, which lets those who are surviving “go through the hole in the sky”, the challenge of parenting and the long shadow of mental illness, the ramifications of gentrification and more. The book made me think and made me feel and most importantly, helped me understand what it is like for those who endured the worst of it, either as a victim or a so-called survivor. Highly recommended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Nov 08, 2016","Nov 16, 2016","Jun 21, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27070074-christodora

Among them are Gordon, the son of a welder, and his girlfriend Leigh, a waitress who is looking ahead toward greener pastures.The book is aptly named because Lions is bigger than any of the characters and its pull and lure shape those that remain. Bonnie Nadzam masterfully conjures up a town on the edge of desperation, where “for sale” signs dot the landscape and inhabitants yearn to “move up” to nearby Burnsville, with its Taco Bells and Motel 6s. There is almost a mythic quality to the twon: “It gave one the sense of a mirror hung somehow, somewhere…the way heat could double and distort the inventory of the town, make the air in the distance shine and buckle and reflect little houses hung upside down in the vacant blue.”There are folkloric tales about a stranger who arrived in town and ended up floating dead in the water tower and of a teacher who dismissed her class early during a raging blizzard to rendezvous with her lover. We get bits and pieces of the characters’ lives – some real, some perceived. Ms. Nadzam suggests that all are ghosts: those who made up the fabric of the town and those who subsist in it still.As Bonnie Nadzam zeroes in on her key characters – Leigh and Gordon – we see, close up and personal, the effects of Lions on two of its remaining citizens. The need to get away is strong but the pull of Lions might be stronger. It’s a very nuanced look at young people on the verge of a new life who must deal with the old life and it’s also a surprisingly effective exploration of grief.

None of these topics particularly appeal.Yet here I am, saying: Read it. Read it anyway. Read it because this is a page-turning narrative that is tragic, hopeful and authentic. Read it because the prose is confident, assured, and muscular.

Put another way, it’s a timely parable for today.Pepper Van Dean – a wonderful creation – has renamed and recreated himself. After a spotted past – going along for a fix in his lightweight wrestling champion competition and performing the life-endangering “hangman’s drop” at a carnival circus – he has no choice but to accept a shady character’s offer to train Garfield Taft.Garfield Taft is a talented heavyweight contender. He is Black with a white wife at a time when this was a hanging offense. He also doesn’t take kindly to being told what to do. But in the rural training camp in Montana, Pepper and Taft form an unlikely bond. And nothing is as it truly appears – not the camp, not Garfield’s background, not Pepper’s back story. Chad Dundas – the real deal – doesn’t take the easy way out. The eventual wrestling match is not a Hollywood version and the crosses and double crosses keep this a lively read. This isn’t a “sports book”, which I feared. It’s a novel of dreaming big and second chances and it’s cinematic in the best of ways.

You can die…You can escape…Or you can convince them you’re sane enough to leave.”The “here” referred to is the Sharston Asylum, on the edge of the Yorkshire moors, at the turn of the 20th century. Right from the start, tension is racheted up to a sticking point as a young woman named Ella finds herself incarcerated within its high walls as a result of breaking a window in the stifling factory she slaved in. Yet actually, for the times, this asylum is more enlightened than most. An experiment has begun; a recently hired doctor – Charles Fuller -- with a passion for classical music plays in the ballroom every Friday for the “good” inmates. It is there that Ella meets John Mulligan, a melancholy Irishman who has lost his job and family. And it is there that love flourishes.The plot is for every reader to discover for himself or herself. I will only speak to my reading experience. The Ballroom is poignant, page-turning, and heart-wrenching. Inspired by the author’s great-great grandfather, who was a patient at the High Royds Hospital with spectacular ballroom, it is also well-researched.This is the time of the rise of the Eugenics Society, headed by none other than Leonard Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, and dedicated to studying all possible methods of preventing the decadence of the nation…including sterilization for the “feeble-minded.” Winston Churchill himself, a young man, is a proponent of enforced sterilization. It’s a time when reading and other intellectual pursuits are considered too taxing for a woman, whose female cells are there, supposedly to “conserve energy and support life.” Indeed, it’s the end of the Edwardian era, when many philosophies are in transition.All of these historical forces play out against a secret love between Ella and John, who try their mightiest to defeat the odds. As Dr. Fuller struggles with what he perceives are unholy urges and falls under the spell of the eugenicist, the stakes continue to rise. Although not a perfect book – some of the characters are a little too pat – I could not put the book down once I started. Definitely recommended. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 12, 2016","Jun 13, 2016","Jun 12, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26797014-the-ballroom

A friend told me I would love and hate it simultaneously, and he wasn’t far from the mark.The focus of the story is Yeong-hye, an unremarkable woman who is melancholy and quite possibly mad. After being haunted by terrifying dreams, she eventually gives up the eating of meat – considered an act of rebellion in Korea, a patriarchal society where carnivores reign. There are three sections to it and each is narrated by a different character – first the husband, then the brother-in-law and finally the sister of Yeong-hye. While the change in narration may be jarring to some, it is essential. Each works synergistically with the others to create the full picture. What becomes clear is that Yeong-hye is a tabula rasa whereby those who consider themselves close to her can write their own obsessions and desires. Gradually, a pattern of abuse emerges. Yeong-hye was the daughter of a tyrannical father, the wife of a cold and distant husband, the sister-in-law of an obsessive artist who uses her body to further his own artistic vision and unholy desires, and the sister of a caring but misguided woman who channeled her own escape from their childhood abuse, allowing her vulnerable sister to take the brunt of it.Yeong-hye’s decision to forego meat, shuck off social constraints, and take on a plant-like existence becomes almost understandable. As someone who has witnessed the ravages of anorexia in my own family, I can also attest to the truth of Yeong-hye’s struggle – so jarring and startling that at the end I was only able to read 10 pages at a time.Needless to say, this is a very dark book, filled with surreal images, sexual perversions and violence. Yet it is also strangely organic; no scene is used just for shock value and each scene provides insights into a woman who may well be too good for this world. If one of the key purposes of literature is to move us out of our comfort zone and cause us to reflect and think, then this novel succeeds masterfully.

The entirety of this taut book focuses on a marriage – that of Maggie, who is suffering from PTSD as a result of a physical assault and her husband Mark, who, despite himself, is losing respect for her inability to solider through.Mark is on the cusp of an affair; Maggie is having trouble functioning. Together, they take off from Chicago with their trusty dog Gerome, but by the time they hit Ohio they run into a severe storm. As they battle a situation that they have no control over – power outages and mounting rain and wind – the worst of the two of them come out – Mark’s perverse stubbornness, Maggie’s total fear of the unknown.“Beached, marooned, abandoned, but also self-reliant. The natural accumulation of years together – years of contempt and content; disappointment and settlement…” In essence, Hannah Pittard’s description could apply to just about any long-time marriage when a couple inevitably hits an obstacle and forges through. As Maggie fights her instinctual fear of people and Mark fights his instinctual fear of impinging technology (he dislikes the anonymity of it), both need to see each other as a rock or oasis in an unsettling world.Hannah Pittard is outstanding at creating an atmosphere of fear and disquiet, without manipulating the reader.

But how to  this book? It renders me speechless and. I almost feel compelleOne of my great passions in life is reading – and ing – books. But how to  this book? It renders me speechless and. I almost feel compelled to reduce my  to two words: “Read it.”Years ago, I learned, while visiting the Lincoln Museum in Springfield, Illinois, that Abraham Lincoln was so prostrated by grief after the death of his favorite son Willie that he visited the crypt for months afterwards, opening the coffin and stroking the face and hair of his deceased son. It’s a macabre image but one that is sears at the very heart of anyone who has lost a loved one.This image is the seed from which Lincoln in the Bardo sprouts. The Bardo, in Tibetian Buddhism, is a sort of limbo state between death and rebirth into the next life. Willie lingers in that state, unable to move forward, while his father languishes in his own bardo: needing to take the helm and steer the country forward while feeling near paralyzed by his despondency.The book is peopled by ghosts except for three of the living: the president, the night watchman, and a woman in a home across from the graveyard. Using a Greek chorus approach, many characters speak in turn – Willie and many of his fellow deceased who cannot move on and two of the three living characters. We never hear Abraham Lincoln’s own voice.Even more remarkably, the book not only intertwines and living and the dead, it also intertweaves history. There are direct quotes from the time (all annotated) as well as fictional quotes from the time (also “annotated”) and then there are the voices. Only the most precise historian would be able to decipher what is real and what is invented.Yet it almost doesn’t matter because the book is not just – or even primarily -- about Abraham and Willie. It is about Every Man. And here is where it becomes remarkable. As the chorus reminds us: “Though on the surface it seemed every person was different, this was not true. At the core of each lay suffering, our eventual end, the many losses we must experience on the way to that end. We must try to see each other in this way. As suffering, limited beings—Perennially outmatched by circumstance, inadequately endowed with compensatory graces.”George Saunders, in soaring and lyrical prose that sometimes approaches poetry, advances the theme that whatever happens to us after we die, it won’t be entirely unconnected to what we are while living. By the end of the novel, I was convinced that this was not a death story. It’s a love story – a love story for humanity and all that interconnects us.One of the characters says, “One must be constantly looking for opportunities to tell one’s story.” To understand our own story and to have the understanding and grace to tell it is truly what matters.

Yehousha’s latest novel, is an accomplished harpist with a Netherlands orchestra, but her own life is out of harmony. Named for a planet in the sky – Venus – her own life is not in alignment. When her recently-widowed mother decides to go for an “experiment” – temporarily leaving her flat in Jerusalem to give assisted living in Tel Aviv a try – Nogu returns to Jerusalem to watch over the rent-controlled home as a result of a plea from her younger brother.Her mother’s view of the “experiment” is this: “It’s a test not only of where to live my life but more than that—what the nature and value of that life will be.” In important ways, Noga embraces her own “experiment.” Living in her mother’s house – literally and figuratively – she takes on roles as an extra, becoming, more than ever, a character in the story of someone else’s life.The theme that A.B. Yehousha explores is this: when do we stop being an extra in life and become a full-bodied character in our own life? It is no coincidence that in her very first role, she plays the forewoman of a jury who must utter only one word: “Guilty.”Noga is guilty of fleeing her homeland that “never ceases to be a threat to itself”. She is guilty of making the decision not to have children – surrounded in Jerusalem by Hasidi (ultra-religious) Jews for whom reproduction is a sacred responsibility. She is guilty of allowing herself to be freed of any obligation other than her music, while her brother is saddled with responsibilities by their mother. And, she is guilty for allowing herself to float through life as an “extra”, always a little bit “less than”.As a childless woman myself, I must admit to being troubled by the implications that childlessness is diminishing. Her mother tells her, “Give him that child, give it to him, and that way something real from you will stay in this world, not just musical notes that vanish into thin air.” While A.B. Yehoshua has never shied from controversy, I wondered if he had gone too far. I actually re-read parts of this book and realized that the author was affirming that Noga did have a choice – a choice that quite literally plays out as the book reaches its crescendo.Mr. Yehousha – now 77 years old – writes, as always, in nuanced and meditative prose, beautifully translated from the Hebrew by Stuart Schoffman. The quiet beauty and gentle power of that prose has nary a note out of place.

It isMischling – the term was used during the Third Reich to characterize those who bore both Aryan and Jewish blood – is not for the faint of heart. It is nightmarish and shattering. It is also – dare I use the term? – uplifting. It resists limpid sentimentality and the contortion of history and pays witness to the darkest of times from an entirely new perspective. In short, I found the book to be astounding.Inspired by the non-fictional book Children of the Flame, Affinity Konar focuses on a particularly horrific ongoing Holocaust event: the torture and experimentation on twins by the Angel of Death, Dr. Joseph Mengele.The heroines of this book are twins Pearl and Stasha, who divide the responsibilities of living between themselves. Stasha takes on the funny, the future, the bad, while Pearl takes the sad, the past, the good. But it soon becomes evident that Stasha and Pearl are two halves of survival – the part that must cope with loss and despair and the part that against all odds, experiences wild hope that cannot be extracted from her or punctured by a needle.The twinning of two young girls – of hope and despair, life and death, fortitude and triumph – is a theme that is interwoven throughout. The narrative is told in alternate chapters by Stasha and then Pearl as they hauntingly describe how a hideous and morally stunted doctor tries to irreparably break the longing for attachment and destroy the most important part of living – the need to be close to another living being. Auschwitz becomes not just a physical hellhole of despair, but also a state of mind. At one point, Stasha reflects, “This is my belief. Auschwitz would end when Pearl returned.” When they are together, they are whole.Given the duality, it is not surprising that Ms. Konar decided to divide the book into two parts: the time together in Auschwitz and the move out of it in search of wholeness. As the tone shift to magic realism, the reader follows Stasha and Pearl into a limbo land, where it’s sometimes challenging to distinguish between wishful thinking and reality. Who is alive and who is not? How will they learn to love the world again after experiencing its most base evils? To survive means having a Someone (a twin) by one’s side – but can one create a twin if the real twin is not present to divide the duties in the journey ahead?This is the kind of book that I want to grab the next person I see and say, “Read this. It will alter you.” It’s been a while since I sobbed aloud from the sheer power and beauty of a book.

I don’t think Danielle McLaughlin quite meets that standard, but I do think that this is a very promising collection of stories that builds momentum as it goes along.Taken as a whole, this quietly powerful story collection each person’s evolving place in an often uncertain, always mysterious universe. The title story is the final story and it includes this description, partially in response to a young boy who believes he has discovered a dinosaur skull : “There were stars, millions of them, the familiar constellations she’d known since childhood. They were white-hot clouds of dust and gas, and the light, if you got close, would blind you.” Animals don’t fare well in Dinosaurs On Other Planets; neither, in many cases, do parent-child relationships or relationships between lovers. A particularly disturbing story, A Different County, focuses on an innocent woman named Sarah who travels with her new boyfriend, Jonathan, to the home of his brother Aidan and his very pregnant girlfriend, Pauline. As labor commences for Pauline, Sarah’s innocence is shattered when she comes across the brothers’ unsettling and secretive activities.Another, In The Act of Falling, centers on a stressed-out wife whose unemployed husband stays home with their antisocial young son. Tension builds as we view the son’s obsession with dead ducks, a traveling preacher who looks like Angelina Jolie, and a depraved man who might be the cause of harm.With psychological acuity, Danielle McLaughlin crafts her stories, which – for the most part – evoke desolution, alienation, and in some cases, redemption.

Her novel, Bel Canto, remains one of my all-time contemporary favorites. State of Wonder left me cold with some of the plot and character implausabilities. So I came to Commonweath with few expectations. I knew I could love it, hate it, or anything in between.And how did I pan out? I think it’s quite good – not as good as Bel Canto but good, nonetheless. The book is ambitious in scope, spanning five decades that radiate out from Franny Keating’s christening party, when an unexpected guest, Bert Cousins, kisses Franny’s mother. The action results in a messy life, composed of a divorce, ensuing marriages, children, grandchildren. Or, as Ann Patchett writes, “…all the ways the future would unravel without the moorings of the past.”If there’s a grand theme in this novel, it’s this: who owns the stories that compose a life? Would one action or one omission cause life to rear in a different direction? What is public and what do we keep to ourselves?As the book jacket reveals, Franny, in her 20s, begins an affair with the famous and much-older author Leo Posen, who uses these stories to get himself out of the doldrums and write a highly popular book. Surprisingly to me, that incident gets short shrift. But I suspect that this is precisely Ann Patchett’s point: the characters in the book are just that – characters- and not the real life family. No one can truly own those stories but the Keatings and the Cousins. Ann Patchett is a compulsively good writer and the story carried me along with its equal measures of humor and poignancy. It’s not an easy task to balance decades of living, a number of characters, and emotional shifts, and in truth, not all the scenes work equally well. The opening seduction is a stunner and just about every scene pulls the reader in. I’d rate this toward the top of the Ann Patchett books I’ve read – and I’ve read many of them. 4.5,...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"May 31, 2016","Jun 03, 2016","May 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28214365-commonwealth

There have been five LaRoses in all, and each of them is special in his or her own way. Erdrich writes, “That name would protect him from the unknown, from what had been let loose with the accident. Sometimes energy of this nature, chaos, ill luck, goes out of the world and begets and begets.”LaRose is called upon to function as the bridge between families, a bridge that heals. Bridges abound in LaRose: the bridge between the traditional and the contemporary, between loss and redemption, between youth and adulthood, between the real world and the mythic one. There are also bridges among the generations, all of whom share hardship and embody a sense of survival.Over the course of this amazing novel, we discover the first LaRose, sold by her mother, misused by her purchaser, and almost annihilated by her Indian body school. She links to the other LaRoses, evolving to the young boy who is the latest link to the tragedies that befall the family. LaRose in his own way is a healer, a Savior.

Salinger’s Holden Caulfield had a tryst with Stephen King’s Carrie, perhaps she would be a bit like Lucia Stanton – cynical, disillusioned, subversive, self-aware, and lost. Her father is dead, her mother is ailing, and she lives full-time with her destitute yet caring aunt, in a converted garage. Every day, she wears the same “uniform” to school, where she is marginalized. Unlike her schoolmates, who are burning with the promise of adolescence, Lucia’s flame may be predestined to quickly burn out. Until she meets up with other misfits in the Sonar Club (an acronym for Arson Club) and seriously begins to explore how she can set fire to the world.There is, indeed, a manifesto printed within these pages that fulfills the promise of the title: stating how to set a fire and why. It is the “why” that fuels the narrative of the book. For those whose promising flames are being extinguished by hypocrisy and injustice, inability to embrace those who are different (or even to recognize their potential), and forced to participate in the “false parade of garbage that characterizes modern life”, burning down the past and striking out for new horizons (evocative of Huckleberry Finn) sometimes seems the only solution.I expect to be prodded and provoked by Jesse Ball’s prose; no two past efforts have been alike.

It portended the rise of a new talent and I was eager to see how Ms. Lee made the transition from stories to a novel.In How I Became A North Korean, this author again mines the Korean experience with the interwoven stories of three characters –Youngiu, Jangmai and Danny – who are forced to leave their unstable and dangerous homes and end up in a border town across the border in China. The book is divided further into four parts: Crossing, The Border, Safe, and Freedom.The novel opens with great promise at a Pyongyang party, overseen by the Great Leader, interfused with a growing sense of terror. Had the rest of the novel lived up to its gripping beginning, the novel would have been extraordinary.Instead, it becomes somewhat derivative. Jangmai smuggles herself into China in the hopes of marrying a damaged Chinese man, therefore saving the life of her unborn child. Yongui, whose father was assassinated, arrives with his mother and sister. And Danny, who is Korean by heritage, is sent back to his mother in China, is robbed of his entire identity, and is forced to connect to an underbelly of other outcasts.The author too often leads the reader (“We couldn’t eat ice cream or thrill ourselves with amusement park rides, try foreign foods like hamburgers and pretend to enjoy them…We couldn’t do anything. But we were usually together.”) The Danny narrative, in particular, seemed flat of emotion, considering that he came from the pampered west – Fresno, California. The survival tale is one that frequent readers are familiar with. Some of the passages are truly haunting: Jangmi’s amazement at a new initial life of consumerism after making do with little…the interactions between the Koreans and the Chinese. I found myself comparing the book, at various points, to Sunjeev Sahota’s Year of the Runaways, which created visceral, original and unforgettable portraits of characters similarly facing hunger, homelessness and uncertainty.

Not unlike the book Olive Kitteridge, the book proceeds in chapters of interlocking stories; we meet his children, her son, the children they have together, her brother and his wife, her ex, and so forth.Just about every person we meet is burdened with an onerous challenge. His older son is tortured by eczema; her son emotionally suffers from stuttering. There is infertility, anorexia, symbiosis, alcoholism…yet in a great feat of writing, the characters rise above their condition rather than be defined by it. These are misplaced and lost characters, searching for their authentic place within themselves. Their searching leads to external travels and internal jaunts (at one point, Daniel thinks, “I am not going to drop myself down, like a speleologist, into those holes and caverns and start digging around,” but of course, he does.) They are searching: for love, for connection, for identity, for affirmation, for understanding. Eventually, they will learn a simple life lesson: “We must pursue what’s in front of us, not what we can’t have or what we have lost. We must grasp what we can reach and hold on, fast.”I won’t go into the specifics of plot, except to say that the plot organically unfolds in the most satisfying manner.

In Nobody’s Fool, we first became acquainted with Sully, a down-and-out, down-on-his-luck, middle-aged son of an abusive father. Other ordinary, extraordinary characters – from Miss Beryl, his landlord/teacher to Carl, his landlord, and Ruth, his love interest, are also memorably portrayed.In Everybody’s Fool, the characters are now older, but no wiser. Sully is back – older and with just two years (maybe one) year to live as a result of a faulty heart. The emphasis shifts to Doug Raymer, a more minor character in the first book, who “married up” to a very attractive woman who died of an accident before the book begins. Knowing he was cuckholded and trying to figure out “who did it”, struggling with feelings for Charice, his formidable take-no-prisoners assistant, and believing his days as police chief are numbered, Raymer is at a crucial crossroads in his life.In Nobody’s Fool, Russo, an ultimate storyteller, shows once again that fate is funny and most of all, unpredictable. With warmth and more than a measure of compassion, he nails the dynamics of a small mill town that is becoming overshadowed by its twin city (Schuyler Falls) with it trendy shops and restaurants that serve – gasp! – ramps. Where but in a Russo book can readers meet a cobra on the loose from a purveyor of exotic animals that emotionally terrorizes the town? Or a dog named Rub (the same name as Sully’s hapless, worshipping friend) who has an obsession with his – ahem – bloody genitals. Or an anxiety-prone officer (“My name is Bond. Jerome Bond.”) who happens to be the twin brother of his love interest, Charice. Or a garage door opener that holds the key to who Raymer’s wife was sleeping with, but which is inadvertently buried with the body of a hypocritical, irascible judge who Raymer has long hated. Or the mayor’s emotionally fragile wife, Alice, who walks around talking into an unplugged princess phone at a time when cell phones have become ubniqutious. The thing is, these situations don’t feel unreal; we believe them and commiserate with the characters…perhaps because we sense that Russo takes them very seriously. And despite ourselves, we cheer for them. We want Raymer to see what’s right in front of his eyes – that he and Charice belong together. We want Ruth (Sully’s love interest from Nobody’s Fool) and her daughter Janey to thrive, despite harassment by Janey’s ex-convict husband (one of the sorriest characters you’ll meet in literature). We want them to self-forgive (as Miss Beryl once said, “We don’t forgive people because they deserve it. We forgive them because we deserve it.”)I loved being engrossed in Richard Russo’s world – the world of Bath, New York – for one glorious week. Sincere thanks to the publisher, Alfred A.

He’s a real cThe Anton Pavlovich Chekhov we meet within Alison Anderson’s pages is more than one of the greatest writers of short fiction in history. He’s a real charmer: right at the cusp of being recognizes for his immense talent, a self-effacing, gentle and confident young man who charms three sisters at a family estate – including the blind older Zinaida.Anton Pavlovich (as he is referred to often in this book) once famously said, “Medicine is my lawful wife and literature is my mistress.” In this, he has much in common with Zinaida, a young doctor herself, who was forced to give up medicine when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Gradually, the friendship between Anton Pavlovich and Zinaida builds; her impending death frees her from verbal conventions and he finds himself drawn to her honesty and frankness.We learn about the budding friendship through entries from Zinaida’s diary in 1888. (In real life there was, indeed, a friendship between Chekhov and Zinaida Lintvaryova). Years later, a promising Russian translator named Ana is given this diary to translate at the bequest of a small and failing publisher, Katya. The structure of the book – while mostly focused on the Anton Pavlovich/Zinaida story, contains alternating chapters from Ana and Katya’s perspectives.Ms. Anderson beautifully lures us into Zinaida’s world. We like her; we believe in her. When the narrative springs to the present, we miss her and want to hear from her again. Our experience is not unlike Ana’s, who is also enthralled by the diary and her chance to shine as the translator of this work. Most compelling of all is that the diary alludes to a novel that Chekhov was writing and gave to Zinaida for safekeeping. Whatever happened to the diary? What would it mean to the publishing world if, after more than a century, the diary surfaced?This novel, though, is more than the mystery of what happened to the novel – a mystery that will keep the reader intrigued to the surprising end. It is also about the power of words. Zinaida muses about Chekhov, “How does he do this? How does he see the tiny detail that restores sight and, with it an impression of being closer to my own life…” In addition to the magic of words, there is also the bestowment of immortality: “The fact of the immortality of his work of his spirit—it’s a vast, worthy conspiracy among the living, a consolation and a source of hope and joy.” The Summer Guest is a triumph, not just for recreating a vanished world and providing insight into Chekhov and his life, but also – and most importantly – as an affirmation of how words can give us all the will to persevere....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 18, 2016","Apr 25, 2016","Apr 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25843231-the-summer-guest

It’s more than exploring the hubris the “unsinkable ship.” To my mind, it’s the larger-than-life stories: Ida Strauss choosing to stay to the death with her husband, retail mogul Isador Strauss…Benjamin Guggenheim donning his formalwear to “go down in style”…John Jacob Astor protecting his new bride…to name a few.But some of the most heartbreaking stories are the “what ifs.” What if the wireless officer hadn’t radioed back, “Shut up, shut up! I am busy. I am working Cape Race!” when notified of nearby icebergs? More poignantly, what if the Californian—the closest ship to the RMS Titanic—had actually heeded the distress rockets and come to its aid?David Dyer wisely knows that stories are what drives the Titanic narrative. His first-person narrator, John Steadman (surely a nod to legendary writer William Stead, who wrote a fictional account of a steamer sinking due to lack of lifeboats), pursues stories of bodies at a time when the Hearst-Pulitzer sleazy journalism war is at its height.When The Californian comes back without any bodies, Steadman is certain there is more to the story. In alternating chapters, we meet Stanley Lord, the self-righteous, hard-edged captain and Herbert Stone, the second officer who was on the midnight watch. Stone knows what he saw – the rockets – and knows he tried to summon the captain. Since the plotline follows actual history, we know that Stone’s questions of being a loyal officer conflict with his honesty and feelings of responsibility. It doesn’t help that Stanley Lord may very well represent his own remote and cruel father.This novel is written with a focus on the Californian; the Titanic is in peripheral vision. Yet at the end of the day, the stories – in Steadman’s mind (and hopefully, in ours) is that the most tragic are not those of the rich-and-famous, but those of the 153 children in third class who were left to die while the rich claimed the lifeboat seats (in contrast, only one child in first class died). It is those spirited victims – including the Sage family of eleven, all of whom lost their life – that Steadman (and Dyer) celebrate.There are some other threads that didn’t quite work for me. Steadman’s daughter, a proponent of women’s voting rights, comes across as too one-dimensional. The “bring me the bodies” refrain of Steadman’s editor becomes repetitive and cloying after a bit. Yet all in all, the book really held my attention with its focus on a lesser-known aspect o the Titanic tragedy....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 11, 2016","Apr 14, 2016","Apr 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25666052-the-midnight-watch

In that book, tFour years ago, I had the pleasure of reading Peter Geye’s novel Safe from The Sea, which – at its heart – was about fathers and sons. In that book, the son procures and sold ancient maps as a career although the map he always needed – a blueprint to who is he is and where he stands as a son and husband – remain elusive.I start with Peter Geye’s former book because similar themes abound in this one. Although it is being dubbed a “60 year saga”, the heart of the story focuses on a time in 1963, when Harry Eide and his 18-year-old son Gustav embark on an audacious, risky, and indeed, life-threatening journey to the northernmost Minnesota wilderness to spend time “wintering” and living off their own dexterity and wits. A theme from Safe from the Sea is seen here, too: Harry carries maps that are virtually useless and in important ways, both father and son are lost.Unbeknownst to Gus, his father Harry has his own agenda. The journey will be pivotal to Gus. As another character says, “Every person, I have come to believe, has a moment of a place in life when all four points of the compass coverage from when or where their life finally takes – for better or for worse—its fated course.” Gus is about to meet that moment.Intertwined with this story is one that is told in first person by his father’s true love Berit, now an elderly woman who has waited a lifetime for Harry. As an adult Gus tells her stories, she shares some of her own and a pattern of generations of the Eide family emerge, filled with heartache, pain, betrayal, passion and love.I’ve seen Peter Geye’s writing style compared to Cormac McCarthy (any author who writes powerful nature scenes seems to receive that comparison), but in reality, his style is closer to David Vann’s or Rick Bass’s…with echoes of Joseph Conrad. As in these examples, Peter Geye writes exquisitely about the magnificent yet often unforgiving Minnesota terrain, which becomes a character in its own right. His sentences bristle with tension and portent – so much so that the reader cannot look away.If there’s a fault in this book, it’s with the inevitable villain, Harry’s nemesis Charlie, who is evil incarnate. Whenever he’s on the pages, a chill goes down one’s spine, yet more nuances would have – counterintuitively – made him even more feared. Also, I questioned why Peter Geye used first-person in Berit’s chapters; her voice was not all that distinguishable from the author’s. Still, this is a book that caught me by the throat and maintained its power throughout.

She and her father are inseparable. But suddenly, Ada begins noticing that things aren’t quite right with David. The person she relied on for a sense of the world might not be so reliable. In fact, he might not even be David. And her only confidante is her father’s close female friend Liston, the mother of three sons around Ada’s age.This is a page-turning read and I am loathe to get into specific plot points. I will say this: once I began the book, I compulsively needed to find out what happened next. So don’t let its 450 pages deter you. The pages fly by.I was able, relatively early on, to figure out many of the plot reveals, including the core mystery that lies at the heart of the story. Typically that would deter me from enjoying the book but that was not the case here. I suspect that Liz Moore is empowering the reader to understand certain things that Ada, as a young teen, cannot quite decipher yet. So, while the mystery of who David is becomes a central focus, for me, the joy of the book was the unveiling of the characters and the gradual dawning of Ada’s awareness. The majority of the action takes place in the 1980s although short chapters go both back and forward in time to provide greater cohesiveness to the story. The last chapter, written from a different point of view, is a marvel.I knew I was in for a treat; Liz Moore’s last book Heft was quite good.

The heart in question belongs to Simon Limbres, a 19-year-old boy, not a perfect boy, a passionate surfer who has barely has had the chance to inhabit the person he will become.In this astoundingly good novel, Malis De Kerangal introduces us to Simon briefly, when he is thrumming with life, surfing on a cold morning with two good friends. Just pages later, he is close to death, the result of a car accident. The effect is jarring: life contrasted with death, risk contrasted with the mundane.Simon is at the core of those connected by his single beating heart, yet this book is never maudlin or manipulative. In long sentences, written with lyricism and confidence, we meet those who are just a heartbeat away – and they are portrayed in exquisitely precise detail. Marianne, his mother and Sean, his father must grapple with the worst news a parent can ever imagine hearing, with the most potent stew of emotions (anger, disbelief, numbness, all at once). When Marianne calls Sean to inform him, and hears his innocent voice, she thinks of it as “the voice of life before”.There is Thomas Remige of the Coordinating Committee for Organ and Tissue Removal, the man intimately attuned to life, who sings Benjamin Britten’s A Ceremony of Carols and revels in the delicate song of his rare Algerian goldfinch. It will fall to him to walk that precarious line between honoring the family’s wishes and honoring life itself by the reuse of the organs. There is the hedonist heart surgeon Virgilio, who is as passionate fan of soccer (and France is about to play Italy) as he is the operating theater. There is Claire, the 51-year-old heart recipient, who is curiously conflicted upon knowing that now, after years of living with no conception of the future, it will open for her through another’s death. We are privy to their most intimate emotions and foibles and they come alive under this author’s exacting tutelage.Most importantly, this narrative transcends plots and even transcends characters. Maylis De Kerangal is looking at the bigger picture: the ubiquitous symbolism of the heart. There are some strikingly beautiful images, a merging of forever time (the rise and fall of the waves Simon loved) with immediate time, and the gravity of recognizing that the “separation between the living and the dead no longer exists.” Kudos to Sam ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Apr 03, 2016","Apr 06, 2016","Apr 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25664510-the-heart

He’s written for Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, and the new HBO series Vinyl. For this author, it’s not just about “what happened”; it’s about “what did it feel like and what did it mean?” And it’s also about more: “Why do soap-opera adventures of the Stones still fascinate?” Can rock save your soul? Is it a religion? If so, why did it go the way of Zoroastrianism? Should we worship the life or the message Is there a graceful way to grow old?”Most of us Stones fans – and I’ve been one since I was a kid and saw them in New York, teaming with raw, unpolished, dangerous energy – know the highlights: the meltdown and suicide of Brian Jones, the drug bust, the Altamont and the Hel’s Angels, the influences of Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, the rift between Jagger and Richards. All this is revisited but what makes it special is that Rich Cohen had unique access and also provides the insights and perception to go beyond – way beyond – the “what happened.”He knows, for example, that the Stones were always “the alternative, the opposite, the anti” – certainly the anti-Beatles. He “gets” that the music did really die sometime in the early 90s and that there may never be a phenomenon like the Stones again – especially now that they’ve become self-perpetuating. And he recognizes that the stories, true and exaggerated, are the stuff that legends are made of.For anyone who loves the Stones – read it. For music aficionados who remember their music as “the sound track of our lives” (certainly I remember exactly what phase of life I was at heard Satisfaction, or Sympathy for the Devil, or Honky Tonk Woman”), give it a try. And for those who simply want to read fascinating revelations about one of the very best bands ever, this is for you, too. To put it in Rich Cohen’s own words: “”It’s not just music. It’s my nation. It’s my country. It’s where I’ve spent my life.” Amen....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,Apr 2016,"Apr 03, 2016","Apr 01, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26699586-the-sun-the-moon-the-rolling-stones

Fortunately, I thought wrong. This is a gripping and mesmerizing story that keeps getting better and better and better. By the time I was in the final stretch, I could barely come up for air.I’ve heard comparisons to the AMC series Mad Men, and those comparisons are apt. The first voice we hear is Cliff Nelson’s – the bohemian writer who, to put it politely, has “daddy issues”. His famous father can barely stand him and he is determined to show him up by writing the new Great American Novel. But between writer’s block and a paucity of talent, he feels stymied at every turn. The 1950s voice rings authentic and the touches (including an old typewriter with a black carbon ribbon) ring true. Cliff gradually reveals himself as emotionally and morally weak.Eden Katz is a Jewish female writer with ambition, at a time when either her religion or her gender would be a reason to relegate her to the secretarial pool forever – if she even got that far. She is feisty, though, and burning with a desire to succeed in a man’s world. And Miles Tillman is a young Harlem man who has his own father issues (his dad might have been a war hero or might have been living a lie); in addition, he is trying to gain clarity on issues of gender identification. These issues – in the McCarthy era – make it hard for him to accept his true self.These interwoven narratives, which focus on an era of strict divisions in race, class, sex and gender – builds to a slow boil as we become embroiled in a tale of ambitions and betrayals. There are a few flaws – for example, the voice of Miles’ mother can be cringe-worthy – but all in all, this book is a very worthy follow-up to The Other Typist.

The love in this book translates to worthiness and sacrifice – between friends, between parents and children, between fellow human beings.The story centers on two coming-of-age girls during the Japanese Occupation. The first, Aya, is a repatriate, driven from her home in Vancouver by irrational hatred of native-born Canadians of Japanese descent and now relocated in Tokyo. The second, Fumi, is her classmate, whose beloved older sister disappeared, and who petitions General MacArthur, who is overseeing the Occupation, to live up to his promise to help citizens in need. Interwoven with these two stories are those of others – a translator, a teacher, Aya’s father, and significantly, Sumiko –Fumi’s older sister who has resorted to becoming a wanton dance girl to receive money to keep afloat.The story succeeds wonderfully as historical fiction. Obviously, Lynne Kutsukake has done her homework and it shows, in the heartbreaking descriptions of the many letters directed to General MacArthur and the translators who know they likely will not reach him. This author also provides insight into the treatment of Canadians of Japanese descent. In a description of Aya’s father, she writes: “They took his dignity and his honor and his pride and his sense of self-worth and it still wasn’t enough. They took whatever they could but they always wanted more – his will, his bitterness, his anger.” Certain vignettes – Aya and her mother shopping for a winter coat in a department store and being willfully ignored and shabbily treated – truly resonate. I don’t recall a character in recent fiction like Aya – forced to “go back home” when home is truly Canada, and treated like a pariah once she arrives in Tokyo.However, it succeeds less as it tries to weave in the intrigue of what has happened to Sumiko. Her journey sometimes feels melodramatic, with a way too neat conclusion. After a while, I felt that Ms. Kutsukake had lost her thread as the novel becomes more of a coming-of-age story of two girls who bond together in the search for Sumiko and the sometimes saccharine thread of Matt – the translator – trying to help them.All in all, I thought this was a worthy book that could have been better – a book that tackles not often discussed postwar events.

As a result, readers will want to judge the book in two ways: how does it succeed in its modern retelling of the Shakespeare classic? And, how does it compare to Anne Tyler’s oeuvre of quirky and wonderful novels?Let’s take the first question first. In the Shakespeare play, a beautiful young woman (Bianca) is wooed by two suitors but her father will not allow her to marry until her outspoken older sister (the “shrew” Katherina) is first wed. It is arranged that the slovenly fortune-hunter Petruchio of Verona will marry Katherina, who eventually is tamed and domesticized through her marriage.Anne Tyler does a masterly job of updating the story to the present. Katherina (now Kate) is urged to marry her father’s lab assistant, a Russian named Pyotr whose green card will soon expire. Her sister Bianca (now Bunny) is rather appalled with this set-up; she is sixteen and Kate has watched over her since their mother’s death. It’s all great fun – so much so that I read it all in one sitting.Yet there are cracks that show through upon reflection. Kate doesn't’ seem particularly outspoken; she seems 	quirky and out-of-place in her milieu (not unlike many of Anne Tyler’s other delightful characters). Kate doesn’t seem like the type of going-on-thirty woman who would go about her father’s bidding. Pyotr is blunt but likeable, and yet, as he begins to exert himself, I had to wonder why Kate readily put up with it. When Kate gets to the famous speech in defense of marriage and obedience, it seemed anachronistic for today’s times.Put another way, there were times I could feel the strain of Anne Tyler trying to make her novel conform to the classic tale. I am a huge fan of this author and when she has no such constraints – Ladder of Years, Breathing Lessons and Accidental Tourist come first to mind – her characters are wonderfully original and strike out in unexpected directions. It is this talent of Ms. Tyler – to truly see the eccentricities we humans possess and to delightfully portray them without ever making fun of her characters – that draws her readers to her, again and again.I liked Vinegar Girl. I enjoyed and sometimes marveled at how adept Anne Tyler was at re-imagining Shakespeare. I certainly recommend it.

(I greatly appreciate classical music but am far from an expert).My natural inclination was to say, “Why, you, of course.” After finishing, a good part of me still believes that. I have since listened to Shostakovich on YouTube and realize without hearing his works being performed, it is not easy to understand why Barnes chose Shostakovich as the “face” if his novel. There is genius in his work but it is definitely not the “optimistic” and harmonious work that the Party craved.But upon finishing the book, I realized that not knowing that much about Shostakovich’s work was oddly freeing, because the book transcends a study into one composer. Indeed, its main theme may be summed up here: “A soul could be destroyed in one of three ways: by what others did to you; by what others made you do to yourself; and by what you voluntarily chose to do to yourself.” The three parts of this book – the first, following the denouncement of Shostakovich’s opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk as “muddle instead of music:; the second when Stalin requests the composer to represent the USSR at the Congress for World Peace in the U.S.; and the third under the Krushchev regime when Shostakovich betrays his principles and officially joins the Party – illustrate what Julian Barnes has set out to do. And that’s to explore how one serves his art yet makes allowances for the “noise of history” that threatens the artist’s integrity.The artist, Julian Barnes suggests, must believe in something. “What could be put up against the noise of time? Only that music which is inside ourselves—the music of our being – which is transformed by some into real music. Which, over the decades, if it is strong and true and pure enough to drown out the noise of time, is transformed into the whisper of history.”The message of maintaining one’s integrity and leaving one’s art to be judged by the ages is one that is timeless and universal. So back to my friend’s original question: who is Julian Barnes writing this book for? Music aficionados will gain an extra layer of meaning but I do believe the book is written for all of us....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Mar 12, 2016","Mar 13, 2016","Mar 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25912206-the-noise-of-time

And if you could, you would wish you didn’t.”So what is the truth that state’s attorney Luisa “Lu” Brant is pursuing? She is getting ready to prosecute the case of a mentally disturbed homeless man who savagely beat a woman to death in her own apartment. There appears to be no connection between victim and perpetrator.As the truth of what happened that night gradually comes out, Lu begins to reflect on the past when her brother – AJ – inadvertently killed a rebel teen who knifed his best friend and was cleared. In alternating chapters, Lu’s life with her celebrated father – a previous state’s attorney – and with her charismatic and overshadowing older brother is revealed.This book is about secrets – those we harbor, those we reveal, and the cost of pursuing the truth at all costs. Is it better to be 100% truthful or to recognize that people make “disastrous decisions that made perfect sense within the context of the world they know, the moment in which they had to act?”From time to time, the book bows upon the altar of political correctness. But for the most part, it is taut and believable. Psychologically insightful, Wilde Lake mines the costs of truth and accountability and the messiness of nuanced lives.

Briefly, it’s the way we imagine the stars attached to a giant invisible sphere surrounding the earth. “It’s a total fiction, really – just a construction we came up with to help us get our heads around the complexity of it all.”The same might be said about Benjamin Wood’s amazing novel. The construction is the isolated and exclusive artists’ colony at the Turkish island of Portmantle. There, artists eschew all ties to the outside world, even giving up their names. Time stands still and egos are held in check as the artists concentrate on one thing only: creating their next masterwork.That is the world that creatively-blocked Scottish painter Elspeth Conroy (known as Knell) voluntarily enters. Indeed, the entire first book (there are four books at all) and the third book are set in Portmantle. There is a patina of surrealism in these sections, which at first called to mind John Fowles’ The Magus – a postmodern novel of a young British graduate who arrives on an exotic Greek island and is drawn into its psychological underpinnings. I had already pigeon-holed this novel as a somewhat fantastical yet reality-based glimpse into the creative process when left alone to feed itself.How wrong I was! In the entire 200-page second section, we get flashbacks of Elspeth – her life so far, the cultivating of her talent, the price extracted to serve that talent. I have read many books in which the topic of the artist’s creativity is explored – Siri Hustvedt’s The Blazing World, Deirdre Madden’s Authenticity, Sue Miller’s Lake Shore Limited among others. And I can comfortably say that this is the very best exploration of the artistic muse and artistic process I have read in fiction. With a vaster understanding of Elspeth, we then find ourselves back at Portmantle. Mysteries that surfaced right from the start become more profound. Elspeth herself seems far more complicated.

It is also the last time that Jane Fairchild, a servant girl, and Paul Sheringham, an upper-class neighbor, will meet for their tryst before he “marries up” and moves to London.The day – a perfect sunny March day that feels more like June – will start off languishingly and sensually yet will take surprising turns. The initial pace is unhurried, as we play voyeur to Jane and Paul who enjoy their lusty coital time together; after his departure, Jane is left to wander around in an unhurried manner in his wake. Gradually, as the novella reveals its intentions, we discover nuggets about Jane’s past and her future as a well-respected novelist.In certain ways, Mothering Sunday reminded me of another book I read recently – a book I also loved: My Name is Lucy Barton by Elizabeth Strout. There, too, the theme is profound self-discovery, leading to a career as a writer. And there as well, the focus is on how we remember and convey truths and how fiction can be used to get to “the heart, the nub, the pith: the trade of truth-telling” and what it means to be true to the “very feel of being alive.”This is an exquisite little book, a paen to the art of fiction and story-telling, a lovingly crafted character tale, and a compelling read.

There is almost a sense of a fairy tale – albeit one gone awry – in the opening chapters, as Effia is whisked away to the Cape Coast Castle, the wife of a white British slave trader. Deep within the dungeon of the Castle – unbeknownst to her – her half sister languishes, a prisoner of the Fante nation’s slave trade.With each alternating chapter, we jump forward and meet the next generation in Effia – and Esi’s – families. Each successive character embodies the times and together, the narrative becomes an overriding story of the evil of racism. Yaa Gyasi writes, “…”evil bets evil. It grows. It transmutes so that sometimes you cannot see that the evil in the world began as the evil in your own home.”In a mere 300 pages, so much is touched upon: the Great Migration and the fleeing of Jim Crow, Harlem and the heroin addiction, the cruelty of the harshest prison system, the difficulty of remaining together as an intact family. At the same time, there is a remembrance of a fuller family that’s just out of sight: “Sometimes in a hut in Africa, a patriarch holding a machete, sometimes outside in a forest of palm tress, a crowd watching a young woman carrying a bucket on her head, sometimes in a cramped apartment with too many kids, or s small, failing farm, around the burning tree or in a classroom.”Yaa Gyasi seems to be saying that this is the flip side of the same story, flawed people in an often unjust world, each person striving to be his or her own nation yet feeling connected – through chains, bloodlines, and stories – to so many others who have gone beforehand. It’s a book about how the past informs the future and how the future is shaped by the past. And, like a fairy tale, there’s a moral: none of us are whole until we face the unknown part of our history, the lost connection. The fact that Yaa Gyassi has so much insight at only 26 years old is astounding. The book’s structure is that of linked short stories – each generational character claims his or her own chapter – but the whole truly is larger than the sum of its parts....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Apr 14, 2016","Apr 18, 2016","Feb 28, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27071490-homegoing

Small wonder, then, that it sets up dualities every step of the way.It’s a book about finances…and the arts. It’s a tragedy…and a comedy. It’s about taking risks…and playing it safe. And, in turns, it’s serious and imaginative…and utterly messy and ridiculous.Here, in essence, is the plot: a solitary French banker named Claude is working in Dublin for the Bank of Torabundo, an investment bank that prudently navigated the market crash and – because no deed goes unpunished – is now headed by a conscience-free new boss who chastises his employees for not taking enough chances. His doppelganger is a washed-up writer named Paul who approaches him with a concept: he wants to write about the life of an Everyman and has chosen Claude as his subject.On the surface, these two men have little in common, but in truth, they are both “driven by the same urge to escape. The writer hides behind failure just as the banker hides behind wealth. They have lost faith in the world, and in themselves.” In some ways, they personify the book’s title: the push-pull between leaving your mark in the world and facing the void that is covered up with our doings. “The void comes from inside us, from deep inside us. And the more we try to escape it, the more we turn the world into a mirror. Of that emptiness.”Had Paul Murray fully embraced that theme, this book would have been a six-star read. But the book begins detouring in all sorts of other directions. Claude is inexplicably drawn to Paul; it takes him far too long to figure out what he’s all about (the reader can sense what he’s about almost right away) and when he does, he still seeks him out like a moth to a flame. There are subplots galore: Paul’s infatuation with a (of course) stunningly beautiful Greek waitress named Ariadne and his Cyrano scheme to win her love. There’s a shadowy ex-KGB guy named Igor, a strip club, the lure of an exotic island, a website called myhotswaitress, a narcissistic best-selling writer, an online book  site (where you can give ratings of thistles or lightning bolts) and a proposed art heist of a painting called – no surprise – La Marque et Le Vide.It’s a testimony to Paul Murray’s writing that through all these twists and turns, I hung on tight, always wanting to read on, never wanting to abandon ship. When he’s satirizing the banking system, he’s razor-sharp and – dare I say it – entertaining. At the end of the day, I’m left with wondering: how can a novel with so many flaws be so darn good?...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Feb 27, 2016",Mar 2016,"Feb 27, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20804235-the-mark-and-the-void

So the first thing I had to overcome was comparing fact and fiction too deeply.The Girls really coalesces around this theme: “To be a girl in the world handicapped your ability to believe yourself. Feelings seemed completely unreliable, like faulty gibberish from a Ouija board.” Recognizing that this is Emma Cline’s real goal – to explore what it means to be vulnerable and powerless – is key to the reading experience.Her main character, Evie Boyd, is the product of a failed marriage. Her father has moved away with his much-younger girlfriend; her mother obsesses about her own happiness and does not spend much time mothering Evie. She and her best friend have had a falling out. So she is ripe for the picking when Suzanne, a spellbinding older girl, draws her into the charismatic but flawed cult leader Russell’s circle at a hidden ranch. There, she “fills in all the blank spaces in myself with the certainties of the ranch.”The Manson story is well-known and so the reader is not surprised by the trajectory of the plot – nor is he or she meant to be. It’s the journey, not the destination, that is compelling: a teenage girl desperate for attention and acceptance, a world that doesn’t truly “see” her, and – through short chapters that ground Evie in the present with her old boyfriend’s son’s teenage girlfriend – a current world that may not have changed all that much. It’s a fine novel, one that I recommend. I’d also suggest the first story in Battleborn (in fact, the whole book is good) or Gold Fame Citrus, by Claire Vaye Watkins, daughter of Paul Watkins, former Charles Manson’s “family” member, for an achingly authentic read....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Mar 13, 2016","Mar 19, 2016","Feb 25, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26893819-the-girls

The biggest risk is when the polemicWriting a successful polemic – a strong attack or argument about a controversial subject – is fraught with risks. The biggest risk is when the polemic crosses the line from becoming convincing to feeling manipulative. Unfortunately Jennifer Haigh – who is a fine writer as evidenced by her past books like Faith – falls into that trap here.Fracking is, many of us believe, a bad thing that can lead to environmental damage and worse. This is the subject of Ms. Haigh’s novel: snaky salesmen who descend on a failing down in Pennsylvania trying to convince down-on-their-luck landowners to allow miners to dig for natural gas, providing them with ample financial incentives.Those residents, who range from a prison guard Rich Devlin and his neurotic wife Shelby to an organic dairy farm gay couple — Rena and her partner Mack — are at the vortex of the story. A coterie of supporting characters, including unemployed and underemployed locals, rig managers, Texas strong-armers, activists, meth addicts, and a pastor or two round out this ambitious book.The panoramic approach begins to wear thin as the main issue – the sinister dangers of fracking – begin to overshadow the narrative. As someone who already has issues with fracking and its gas fumes, carcinogens and environmental risks, I agreed with her message but not the presentation, which came across as preachy and heavy-handed.There’s no doubt that Jennifer Haigh is a talented writer and when she drills down to the individuals who comprise the plot, she does so in an oft compelling manner.

But at Sutton Hoo, another type of excitement is taking place. An ancient Anglo-Saxon burial ground is in the process of being uncovered on the grounds of the widow Edith Pretty. The archaeological team must work quickly before war strikes.This is a modest book without lots of bells and whistles and it is inspired by true events. In an area characterized by “bloody-mindedness and general dislike of authority”, a discovery by Basil Brown, a self-taught local archaeologist, spirals out of his control and into the hands of the professionals of the British Museum. As the ramifications of the find begin to escalate, we see a town stiffening its collective backs against outsiders and the politics of rivalry.But the implications of this book go beyond that. John Preston writes, “It seemed an especially cruel sort of joke that we should be unearthing the remains of one civilization just as our own appeared to be on the brink of annihilation.” The endurance of humankind and the futility of our efforts to pose and posture underlie the action and call to mind Shelly’s famous Ozymandias poem: “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”The author also integrates the buried feelings of his characters with the ancient burial site. Basil Brown, Edith Pretty, and Peggy Piggott – the three key narrators – all harbor stifled feelings caused by lack of recognition, lack of love, or lack of opportunities. The dig illuminates their own lacking. All in all, the book is surprisingly gentle and its meaning is enduring.

Each and every story in thiHow is it that someone barely into his thirties can write stories that are so infused with wisdom, sensitivity, and grace? Each and every story in this collection is a winner. It’s hard for me to identify which one I love the best.The first eponymous story starts like this: “Sid was a nude sleeper. Had been ever since he was a little kid. To him, wearing clothes to bed seemed strangely redundant, like wearing underwear inside your underwear or something.” Within the course of this story, Sid steals a chained dog – liberated, is how he views it – and the story is so masterfully done that I can see it anthologized for its sheer power.Other stories are equally memorable. In “One More Last Stand”, a reenactor of Little Bighorn has a “same time next year” affair with a tribal woman who plays his killer; from her bed, he comforts his wife back home who is facing breast cancer. In Breatharians, perhaps the most haunting of the stories, a young boy learns about the extent of cruelty from his father. In Runoff, a young man is tested in his romantic relationship with an older woman, leaving a legacy behind for his father to cope with. And in the longest and last story, In Hindsight, the author tracks the life of a veterinary assistant whose trajectory from youth to old age is mirrored, somewhat, by the animals within it.These are stories that surprise (“He’d stare at the wild striations of the sandstone canyon walls and invent lives for the four men he’d killed”), amaze, astound, and sometimes mystify. There are characters that step out of the pages, set mostly in Montana and Wyoming, with situations that resonate after the last paragraph. The publicists, predictably, compare the author to writers as diverse as Kent Haruf, Annie Proulx, and Richard Ford. Callan Wink is certainly as promising a talent as the three aforementioned writers, but he has a voice all his own. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Feb 20, 2016","Feb 22, 2016","Feb 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25489089-dog-run-moon

This is the kind of book that I would recommend, without qualification, to both my literary friends and those who simply love to get lost in a page-turning thriller. The framework of the book is simple enough: one summer night, a plane takes off carrying the head of a major television network (think: Fox News) and his family, a soon-to-be-indicted wealthy money launderer and his wife, a security detail, the crew, and one last minute add-on, a painter named Scott Burroughs who is right on the cusp of fame. Sixteen minutes later, the plane crashes, leaving only Scott and the young son of the television mogul alive. On the most elemental level, this is a an old-fashioned mystery: why would a plane serviced just the day before, flown by top-notch pilots, drop off radar minutes after take-off? Given the importance of the passengers, was the crash deliberate? Does Scott know more than he’s saying?But on a deeper level, this is a book that is unafraid to tackle the bigger questions of a catastrophe: the drawing of false conclusions. The 24/7 news media’s need to sensationalize situations and hound the victims. The way that other people’s tragedies have become blood sport in a world where all news – important or not – is flattened out into an endless entertainment cycle on a “boob tube.” The difficulty of believing in heroes. And the biggest question of all: why are we thriving on parasitical vulture exploitation and how have we gotten so divorced from the things that really matter?Go out and get this book.

Using the metaphorical (and often literal) conceit of keys, the stories tackle themes of discovery, connections, and belonging.The first story – my personal favorite – is entitled Books and Roses and reveals Ms. Oyeyemi at her finest. It begins (as do many in this collection) as a fabler: “Once upon a time in Catalonia a baby was found in a chapel.” As the story progresses, two women – both abandoned – share interwoven stories and a special key (and a book of roses) becomes integral to their fates. The story is masterfully conceived.Other favorites are “Is Your Blood as Red as This?”, which centers on puppeteers and blurs the lines between the real and the surreal as characters grasp with sexual identity and confusion and the restoration of order. (“The wooden devil suspected keys cause more problems than they solve, so she followed Myrna with one plan in mind, to do her bit to restore order.’). In “Sorry Doesn’t Sweeten Her Tea”, two young teens are confronted with disillusionment when their musical idol abuses a down-and-out prostitute and take a fabalistic revenge.And, in Presence, the student puppeteer’s compatriots, Radha (a bereavement counselor) and Myrna, are now married and conduct an unusual experiment: isolation in their apartment, which always registers the time as twelve thirty, to reach acceptance loss and the son they never had.Stories like these are merged with modern-day fairy tales – Drownings, a fire-and-water fable complete with an evil tyrant, and Dornicka and the St. Martin’s Day Goose, which are a bit less compelling. The majority of the characters are female on the brink of sexual or life awakening, and they are joined by the nether world of ghosts, puppets, and magical beings.

In this haunting book, Mattis – a slow-witted man in his late 30s – lives in a small village with his lonely older sister, Hege, who feeds and takes care of him. Their isolation is captured by two withered aspen trees that stand side-by-side, in among the green growing spruces, and referred to as Mattie-and-Hege by the villagers.Mattis connects to the natural order around him. When a woodcock starts flying over his house, he views it as a miraculous sign. But then something portentous occurs: the woodcock is killed with his eyes shut and only Mattis is anguished by it. And not long after, one of the eternal aspens is felled by lightning, leaving one remaining. Is it Mattis or is it Hege?Norwegian author Tarjei Vesaas meticulously, sparingly, and respectfully invites us into Mattis’s world, slowly revving up the tension. We experience Mattis’s struggles to connect to both nature and human nature, to retain shreds of understanding and dignity, and to answer that all-vital question, “Why are things the way they are?” The arrival of a stranger will have the power to upend everything. As Mattis strives to figure out what it all means, the novel reaches a slow boil. With wisps of Per Petterson’s works, Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men, and Mishima’s The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea, this book has its own original, lyrical, and unsettling voice.

She survived and even delivered a keynote address later; others who were present were not so lucky.Readers who expect a taut political thriller or even an excavation of what led to this dramatic action will not find it here in this book. Although the book is based on the 1984 events, it is mostly interested in exploring people on the brink, poised to perform a high dive but really going through the motions.Moose, the poignant Grand Hotel deputy manager, is in his mid-forties, bemoaning the glory days when he was poised to become a professional diver. Now he treads water waiting for a promotion that may never come, raising his teenage daughter, Freya, who is similarly treading water. has a temporary job at the hotel while she contemplates life after high school. The third key character, Dan, is a young Belfast man who is tapped to play a supportive role in the eventual bombing.Always, the water is a metaphor for our immersion in life. In some ways, Moose could be a cousin to John Updike’s Harry Rabbit: a one-time star athlete swimming through the enchantments and disenchantments of life, trying to attain grace under pressure and becoming two-dimensional by his very ordinariness. In fact, all the characters grapple with action versus inertia, unearthing the meaningful, and small acts of kindness versus large transformative gestures which may, at the end, mean nothing at all.This is a languid and at times, lyrical book. While we readers are aware of the tick-tick-tick of the bomb, it’s the tick-tick-tick of life and its sundry tasks that absorb us.

Yet the way we approach our deaths says a lot about who we have been in our lives. In some cases, there is bravery and beauty; in others, cold stoicism; in still others, self-destruction and wantonness. Katie Roiphe chooses her subjects well to give a good cross-section of how some of our greatest creative minds approached their deaths. Susan Sontag, for example, is the poster child for another subject’s (Dylan Thomas’) much-quoted poem: Do not go gentle into that good night; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. And rage she does. She is determined to be the one person who defeats death, undergoing arduous medical procedures including near-lethal experimental chemotherapy cocktails. Driven, in all likelihood, by her raging narcissism, she appears stunned that she will die like any other mere mortal.Sigmund Freud is the polar opposite. He is determined to project a cool, rational acceptance of the necrosis of the mouth that defigures and ultimately kills him. He refuses to part with the cigars and nicotine that almost certainly caused the cancer to begin with (Sontag also refused to give up her cigarettes) and another therapist would likely have a field day with analyzing what cigars really meant to him. He maintains control of his death to the end, when his hand-picked physician helps him in an assisted suicide.Dylan Thomas is, of course, a story of excess. Ms. Roiphen writes, “The true mystery of Thomas’ last days, however, is not the precise medical cause of his coma; it is how the unnatural fear and apprehension of death melts into a craving for it…It seems if you are afraid or preoccupied with something for long enough, you begin to develop a feeling toward it not dissimilar to love.” John Updike, the creator of the Rabbit series, attempts to turn “pain into honey” in his last days, with poems that carry the urgency of his early work, the sharpness and swiftness he was afraid he had lost. And Maurice Sendak, who kept Keats’ original death mask in one of his rooms, obsesses about death but lives a long life. The very end includes an interview that Ms. Roiphe conducts with James Salter, who is afraid not of death itself but the fear of death—the panic at its approach.Thoughtful and nuanced, the book has much to say about our acceptance of our own mortality....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 29, 2016",Feb 2016,"Jan 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25733900-the-violet-hour

It’s the story of a Pulitzer-prize winning author – Jhumpa Lahiri – who fell in love with the Italian language.I need to stop and own up to my biases going in to this book. My initial feeling, after hearing that Ms. Lahiri was going to write a book in Italian, translated not by herself but by Ann Goldstein, struck me as enormously self-indulgent. Worse, I felt almost betrayed; I loved Jhumpa Lahiri’s short stories and hated that she no longer wanted to write them in my native language.Gradually, though, this book won me over. Jhumpa Lahiri, born of Bengali parents in the United States, was forced to speak Bengali at home and English at school. She writes this: “When ou live in a country where your own language is considered foreign, you can feel a continuous sense of estrangement. You speak a secret, unknown language, lacking any correspondence to the environment. An absence that creates a distance within you.”She goes on to explain that writing is her only way of absorbing and organizing life and that “language is the mirror, the principal metaphor” of life. Her metamorphosis to Italian – while not making her an “Italian writer” – provides her with the luxury of not having to be perfect, to concentrate on every single word, to take creative flight. Far from self-absorption, this was an act of liberation and freedom.At the end of the day, In Other Words still takes on the themes for which Ms. Lahiri has become known: identity, alienation, belonging. But it’s far more personal because for the first time, she focuses on herself, not a created character. It’s insightful and perceptive.

As the layers of his life are peeled away, we experience him at different junctures – starting at the present and going back in time to the late 1930s – and with each revelation, he becomes more and more heinous.Lying is sport to Roy. “One big lie is all you ever need, he knows through experience, and to feel the joy solely internally is gratifying enough. It’s necessary not to ignore the endgame, but that’s not where the sense of accomplishment lies from Roy. It’s in the execution, the act of deception.”In the opening pages, we meet Roy at the closing pages of his own life. He’s determined to fleece Betty, an attractive and wealthy widow that he meets online, out of her lifetime savings, just for the fun of it. But almost instantly, we discover that Betty isn’t even a fraction as naïve as Roy suspects she is. There’s a sense that she has her own agenda – but what is it?This is a cleverly written book that slowly relinquishes its secrets through by moving backward. While I enjoyed it, there were some elements that were just too pat. Betty never quite seemed the kind of “mark” that would have put up with Roy in ordinary circumstances. Nor did I quite buy into Roy’s desire to create one final lie, given his circumstances and failing health. The denouement seemed more than a little contrived.

The sons are accompanied by their Muslim neighbor, Mansoor, who survives, but is forever transformed. Following the first chapter – Chapter Zero – this novel explores the response to terror – the victims, the victims’ families, the bomb-makers. It is this deep and penetrating analysis of the participants’ inner lives that sets this book apart. No one is radicalized or demonized. No one is a world-class hero. At times, heroes and purported villains merge – or associate – and become twinned. It is the author’s gift that we, the readers, care for each one of his created characters, even the ones that would not ordinarily earn our sympathy.If you are seeking a book that explores the societal or religious or class caste reasons for terrorism, this is not your book. All those factors are alluded to but the key theme is how even the detonation of a small bomb can create shockwaves that transform lives in unexpected ways. “This is what it felt like to be a bomb,” the author writes. “You were coiled up, majestic with blackness, unaware that the universe outside you existed, and then a wire snapped and ripped open your eyelids all the way around and you had a vision of the world that was 360 degrees, and everything in your purview was doomed by seeing.” This same description could be used to define the key characters.

Much of the power of the narrative is not what is revealed by our narrator Spill Simmer Falter Wither doesn’t surrender its secrets easily or gladly. Much of the power of the narrative is not what is revealed by our narrator but rather, what is secreted away.The narrator is 57-year-old Ray, a socially awkward and reclusive outcast, who chooses to adopt a presumably abused and distrustful one-eyed terrier. If you’re looking for a feel-good man-and-dog bonding novel, this is not your book. Both Ray and One Eye are unlovable outsiders who shelter and hide their painful pasts and who have trouble living in a cruel and potentially harmful world.As a conceit, Ray narrates the world around them to the dog, describing (sometimes in excruciating but always lyrical detail) the sights, sounds, and smells of the landscape. We follow them through four seasons as life becomes more and more precarious. “This is the way life’s eaten away, expended by the onerous effort of living oneself.”One Eye is Ray’s one connection, his one reason to hang on. In observing the dog on an exploration journey, Ray muses, “I realize you were not born with a predetermined capacity for wonder, as I’d believed. I realize that you fed it up yourself from tiny pieces of the world. I realize it’s up to me to follow your example and nurture my own wonder, morsel by morsel by morsel.” One suspects that Ray is the dog’s reason to hang on as well. Trust is slow to blossom but takes root.This debut is not a fast read. It is in turns meditative and contemplative, subtle and harsh, not unlike the Irish landscape that almost acts as a third character. At times, Ray evokes Steinbeck’s Lennie (Of Mice and Men) and One Eye is his own unique character. As readers, we suspect the preamble to this story, without ever having all of it fully confirmed.

Dewy-eyed, I worshipped a whole new group of heroes.The mastery of The Last Pilot is that within its pages, the heroes become human. The story centers on the fictional pilot Jim Harrison, who straddles that moment of time when we forevermore separated the old from the new and claimed the heavens as our own. Laconic, enigmatic and courageous, Jim Harrison rubs elbows with the legends of American lore – Chuck Yeager, John Glenn, Gus Grissom Deke Slayton, Jim Lovell. Yet while he’s being tested as a pilot, he also faces a devastating test at home. He and his wife Grace face a heartbreaking trauma and Harrison’s trademark saying, “It’ll be okay” doesn’t necessarily make it so.What’s so incredible is that the author, Benjamin Johncock, is not an American, but a Brit.

Our protagonist, 30-something Essayist Ester Nilsson becomes relentlessly obsessed with the subject of one of her lectures: the much-older and esteemed artist Hugo Rask. Mistaking a sexual dalliance for a full-blown affair of the heart, Ester subsists on the scraps of hope. And here’s what the novelist Lena Andersson has to say about THAT: “Hope…is a parasite. It lives and thrives on the most innocent of tissue. Its survival lies in a well-developed ability to ignore everything that is not favourable to its growth while pouncing on anything that will feed it and help it live on.”The thing about Willful Disregard is this: unless someone is fortunate enough to have met her soul-mate early on in life, she will likely have experienced at least a vestige of what occurs within these pages. As Ester strives to circumvent the plain reality that Hugo is “just not that into her”, she grasps at straws, deceiving herself over and over and over again that a cavalier phrase or a certain gesture means far more than it does.We want to stop her from her self-deception and humiliation and hand her back her power because she is more than Ester…she is us, every woman who has twisted herself into a pretzel on the altar of hope. We join her “girlfriend chorus” in wanting her to flee with her self-respect intact.

That is not to say he doesn’t have a unique voice of his own. I took a chance on these stories, published by a small press, and I was amply rewarded.Want an example? Then look no further than the eponymous story, which happens to be last in the collection. “After the giraffes acquired flight, all bets were off. They were silent fliers, not even the beating of wings, of course, as giraffes are not so equipped…The young were more of a nuisance. Their trajectories were often decidedly terrestrial, and it was common to see them soaring overhead in majestic herds, like human teenagers cruising the main drag after dark, except the giraffes didn’t seem to care if it were ay or night.”I quoted at length to showcase the extent of Mr. Weddle’s dark and rich imaginative prose. And that’s just a small and delicious taste of the companion stories. There is a Feast of Feathers (“You’re ten years old the day the chickens explode.”) There’s a loser of a father who tries to win over his children with a new puppy…with dark consequences. There’s a man who steals a car and finds eight German shepherds wrapped in garbage bags loaded in the trunk. There are people on the brink, on the edge, or simply having a really bad day. And oh yes, there’s the ugliest monkey anyone has ever seen who may be teaching a few lessons about being human.I must admit: the childlike cover almost turned me off because it seemed targeted to a YA (or younger) audience.

In Magda Szabo’s novel, the door is both figurative and literal. At its core, the book is about the borders that separate us and the effort it takes to trust someone enough to allow her access.In this case, the “someone” is a thinly-veiled narrator, also named Magda, who, like the real author, is a prominent Hungarian writer. I do not know how much is autobiographical, nor do I know how much of it is allegorical of Hungary’s history.What I do know is that this is an outstanding character study of two very different women that touches on many barriers, including class levels, intergenerational, educational and belief barriers.Magda and her husband have traded their small flat for a large apartment and is in need of a housekeeper. A friend suggests Emerence, the proud, impassive yet outspoken old woman who is the caretaker of a nearby apartment block. The relationship almost instantly becomes contentious and complex. Emerence has nothing but disdain for the many things that matter to Magda, including the art of creation, appearances, and visits to church. Nor does she allow Magda much access to her inner self. “Emerence was spontaneously good, unthinkingly generous, able to reveal her orphaned condition only to another orphan, but never giving voice to her utter loneliness,” reflects our narrator.Yet gradually, Emerence allows Magda a tiny bit of access to her locked apartment and locked past history. The narrator says, “I alone had the power to make her open that lock. In turning the keys he put more trust in me than she ever did in God, and in that fateful moment I believed I was godlike—all-wise, judicious, benevolent and rational. We were both wrong: she who put her faith in me, and I who thought too well of myself.”Things that Magda does consciously, Emerence does instinctively. She is, in fact, “the sole inhabitant of her empire-of-one, more absolute than the Pope in Rome.” But in trying to save Emerence from herself, Magda becomes the inadvertent key to her destruction. From Magda’s husband: “You were the only person on earth whose words could have induced her to open her door. You are her Judas.” The unbridgeable gap between two women who struggle to love each other is beautifully portrayed. It is a shame, as the preface notes, that the proportion of books published in the English-speaking world that are translations is currently about three percent. The Door is proof positive that this oversight must be rectified....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Dec 28, 2015","Dec 30, 2015","Dec 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/497499.The_Door

Here is a musing from Dr. Hendricks: “Rather older than most people, I supposed, I’d come to admit that no supple pattern would be revealed to me; my life would not acquire the gracious and redemptive shape of art. It would instead be a sequence of non sequiteurs reeling and bumping into one another…”Indeed, that musing is an apt metaphor for the book. As readers, we see Robert Hendricks at various crossroads and we meet people who are seemingly portentous: an uncle locked away, a woman who may love him, a best friend during the time at Anzio, an Italian lover who has remained in Robert’s heart forever. But none of them hold traction and none of it makes us feel any closer to the narrator.In short, this is a classic example of a novel that makes us think, but not feel. I kept reading on, hoping that the book would eventually catch fire, but I found my interest waxing and waning. Sebastian Faulks has done better.

The book revolves around this concept: a woman will occupy forty rooms in the course of her life. The number forty, according to our unnamed narrator’s mother, “is the limit of man’s endurance, beyond which you are supposed to learn something true. Noah’s forty days and nights of rain, Moses forty years in the desert, Jesus’ forty days of fasting and temptation. Forty of everything is long enough to be a trial.”Our narrator is a poet – a GOOD poet (snippets of her poetry appear throughout the book and some of them dazzled me). As a young Russian child, she imagines herself on the dizzying edge of the unknown and dreams of being immortal. Her life – to her – seems limitless and she yearns to experience all its particular, gritty, wonderful details and to capture those experiences in unique words.But, of course, our life is hobbled together while we are busy making other plans for it. And rather than travel the road less taken, our narrator finally dons a name – Mrs. Caldwell, American wife and mother, with a life filled with the material accouterments she was determined to shun.All this may sound pedantic but it’s not. Ms. Grushin writes, “Don’t you have a sense sometimes that our life is essentially just the tip of the iceberg, and if you stop clinging to your puny bit of ice in fear or out of habit and just dive into the water, you will discover this luminous mass going down, deep down, and meet creatures you can’t even imagine, and have thoughts and feelings no one has ever had before…”The questions become: who can you become when you let go of your fears? Must we surrender our dreams to embrace our life? If there were no self-imposed expectations, would you do something entirely different? Is a life without real pain, real joy, or real shame any life at all? What do our choices say about us?With just a hint of Doris Lessing (Golden Notebook) and Virginia Woolf (To The Lighthouse), this book digs deeper than any I’ve read about what it means to be a woman artist. Each of the forty rooms represents a crossroads for our narrator.

I don’t think anyone – not George Orwell, not Paul Auster with Timbuktu, not Jack London with Call of the Wild – could ever come up with something quite this sui generis although they’ve all done some darn good writing of their own.Fifteen Dogs is, to put it quite simply, remarkable. The premise is quirky: Zeus’s two sons, Apollo and Hermes, come up with an extraordinary wager: they will instill select animals with human intelligence and communication skills. If, at their life’s end, any of the animals is happier than he or she might have been, Hermes is the victor, if, however, human intelligence leads to more misery than contentment, Apollo will prevail. It is decided that the fortuitous fifteen will be 15 canine patients of a nearby veterinary clinic.At first, there’s a lot of dogs to keep straight (fortunately, the author helpfully provides a cast of characters) but eventually, the action focuses on just a few: Majnoun, a black poodle…Benjy the Beagle…and most compellingly, Prince, an amicable mutt who is also a poet. Here are some musings from Majnoun as he tries to decipher the state of being human: “What would it be like, for instance, to be unable to distinguish the smell of snow in winter from the smell of snow in early spring? What kind of world was it in which one could not, blindfolded, distinguish the great range in the taste of water or smell when a female was in heat. To be so limited? Inconceivable.”This book is philosophical in the best of senses, dealing with concepts of individual freedom vs. pack conformity, the old ways vs. the new ways, domination vs. submission, tortured knowledge vs. mindless happiness, and more. The questions at the crux of the book are some of the most important of all time: What does it mean to be alive – to love, to think, to suffer, to feel, to communicate, to question? Where do we all – canine and human – fit into the world and when does our dedication to “who we are” rise to being unique and noble? What happens when we become strangers to our own kind…and to our very nature?Andre Alexis weaves in a fair amount of subtle, yet laugh-out-loud humor as he inhabits the dogs’ perspectives. Yet his fifteen canines are essentially noble creatures, and he never plays a scene strictly for laughs. This is really a wonderful book.

But in the post Civil War, Army General Jefferson Kyle Kidd roamed across Texas dispensing vital and exotic stories gleaned from the intelligence reports and the general press to a largely illiterate audience.The fault lines between the two worlds -- ours and the world of yesteryear -- are as difficult to navigate as those of the Texas and the Kiowa tribe. So when Captain Kidd is charged with returning Johanna -- a 10 year old who was ransomed back from the the Kiowans after four years in captivity -- to an aunt and uncle she barely knows, the chasm of misunderstanding is great.Ms. Jiles writes of Johanna: ""Torn from her parents, adopted by a strange culture, given new parents, then sold for a few blankets and some old silverware, now sent to stranger after stranger, crushed into peculiar clothing, surrounded by people of an unknown language and an unknown culture, only ten years old, and now she could not even eat her food without having to use outlandish instruments.""

In her aftermath, she adds that those who survived apparently became Indian in every way and rarely readjusted when returned to their non-native families.This could easily be an adventure story but it's far more; it's a novel with heart. I double dare anyone to not be moved by the growing trust between Captain Kidd and Johanna, and the morally complex ending.

And if we do dare to speak of them, what tone should we use?Last year, I read Martin Amis’ audacious Zone of Interest, a book that used the novelist’s art to convey the absurdity and senselessness of the Holocaust. At that time, I noted that the story was about the death of the collective souls of virtually everyone even marginally involved.I might say the same thing for Kathleen Spivack’s book. The biggest difference – and it is a major one – is that the action is removed from the concentration camps and plays out in post World War II New York City. Here, we meet Herbert – a former Austrian official – and his hunchback second cousin Anna, “a Rat with the face of an angel, made more beautiful by the imperfections that called attention to her beauty. This Rat had the power to enchant.” In the wings is Herbert’s deceased son Michael, his son David and defiled granddaughter Maria, and the Tolstoi Quartet, who sacrificed their four pinky fingers in order to leave Vienna. And front and center is the soulmate of Dr. Mengele, Dr. Felix, who does unspeakable things to his young patients.There are many adjectives that come to mind in trying to describe this novel: daring, haunting, dark, creepy, and surreal are just five of them. Certainly Ms. Spivack succeeds in casting a spell and one of her themes appears to be the pervasiveness of evil—the fact that evil is never truly contained but does become collective. “So maybe it is like the laws of continuous conservative of energy. Nothing ever goes away; it just changes. So evil stays in the world, perhaps only lying dormant for a moment, in a heap, its black wings folded.”And yet, in comparing her work to Martin Amis’ book – which also is Holocaust-themed and pushes the envelope in its attempt to illuminate existing evil – Unspeakable Things came up wanting. From time to time – particularly in the portrayal of the reprehensible Dr. Felix – I could sense the author’s disdain for her character (for instance, having him cross-dress and passionately kiss a photo of the Fuhrer.) I wanted to build up that disdain (not hard to do) by myself. Often, she uses adverbs (“he said, beseechingly”) as if to give the reader stage directions on how to interpret what’s going on.There are other small fault lines as well: we are teased with the story of Michael yet we never get a sense as to why his family survived and he did not. The Rat’s two weeks with the mystical advisor Rasputin skirt are elusive and vaguely pornographic. I assume Rasputin represents Hitler himself – a Satan character who casts his spell over an entire country. But what does that say about Anna? That part of her fell under Hitler’s spell? I was never quite sure.All in all, I applaud Kathleen Spivack’s flights of imagination.

Facing an impending loss without a foundation of faith to fall back on, I find myself Sometimes you don’t go out and find a book; the book finds you. Facing an impending loss without a foundation of faith to fall back on, I find myself asking, “What is the meaning of life if we’re all just going to die?”Paul Kalanithi answers that question in the most meaningful way possible in his outstanding book. A 36-year- old neurosurgeon, Paul wrestled between medicine and literature as an eventual career. Medicine won out and he was just on the cusp of a stellar trajectory when he was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer. Paul nurtured a passionate belief in the moral dimensions of his job. He also strongly believed that the relational aspect between people undergirded meaning and that life’s meaning has everything to do with the depth of the relationships we form in our journey. He says this, “The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win …You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which are ceaselessly striving.Just as his surgeon’s scalpel eased disease of the brain and saved lives, his words give reasons for living. The grace with which he navigates his journey – from a top-rated surgical resident to writer to his most important role of all, husband and father of a young daughter – his book is ample testimony to how one life well-lived can continue to create such a great impact.In the foreword by fellow doctor and writer Abraham Verghese, that doctor writes, “He (Paul) wasn’t writing about anything—he was writing about time and what it meant to him now, in the context of his illness.” And in the afterword by his wife Lucy, the meaning of that time becomes even clearer.

But view closer and it’s obvious that this housewife has ATTITUDE, despite her hair curlers and Emory board. You can see it in her skimpy bikini panties, her bright orange nightshirt, her poise.American Housewife has attitude. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Take the first story: “I hop in the shower and assure myself that behind every good woman is a little back fat. I cry because I don’t have the upper-arm strength to flatiron my hair. I mascara my gray roots. I smoke my eyes. I paint my lips. I drown my sorrows with Chanel No. 5.”It’s fun to read but unfortunately, Ms. Ellis comes back to this type of sentence structure – and this type of humor – in way too many of the 12 short stories. After a while, this reader wanted her to push harder in her wry commentaries on what it means to be a woman in America.There are some really notable exceptions. My Novel is Brought to You by Tampax, the last story, is a laugh-out-loud, wince-worthy look at corporate sponsorship and e-promotion efforts (in this case, of an author’s book). It alludes to a “Jesus Thesaurus which replaces explicit sexual language with church words.” And it portrays Tampax as a sponsor that will go to any lengths for the bottom-line (substitute any company).The Wainscoting War is an epistolary story in which two women who share a co-op floor go from a semi-polite thank-you to an all-out warfare. The Fitter is a surprisingly sweet story of a bra fitter whose ill wife picks out her successor. Dumpster Diving with the Stars takes on the dark side of reality shows with a piercing, but somewhat derivative, look at an author who pairs with a ditzy Playboy bunny with a soft heart. American Housewife is a breezy, fun read with some great laughs. But underneath these light-hearted tales is a serious message: do not underestimate today’s women. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 30, 2015","Dec 02, 2015","Nov 30, 2015",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/25472765-american-housewife

We’ve either given birth or we’ve been born…yet strangely, there are no novels that I know of that focus on the labor experience.Pamela Erens takes on that experience in Eleven Hours. I’ve read this author before – loved her debut novel, The Understory, and her second book, The Virgins. I know I can count on Ms. Erens to create poignant and unflinchingly vivid scenes. She does succeed in her depiction of Lore Tannenbaum, a 31-year-old single mother who arrives at the hospital alone, save for a detailed birth plan that she wants followed. Her nurse, Franckline, has gone through a series of miscarriages and is now pregnant anew, and anxious that she will again lose her fetus. When the spotlight shines on these two women, the book shines. There is an unrelenting rhythm to the book, the anxiety-producing long wait, the brutality of childbirth, the sense of wonder of a child’s emergence. The last 40 pages are “grab ahold of your seat” tension-filled.And yet. There is also a backstory here that intermittently takes up about half of the book in totality. The story is of Lore’s one-time fiancé, Asa, and the woman they both love, Julia, an artist. The love triangle seemed derivative to me; in any event, it was hard for me to connect to Lore’s life story. Perhaps one of the reasons is that in a mere 157 pages, there wasn’t enough dimensionality for me to intuit or feel her emotions and totally understand her choices. Franckline, too, seemed more like a representative character, culled from stories of Caribbean nurses. The only thing that felt real to me was her wavering and fear for her own child…and for Lore’s. So my reading experience was mixed.

That book focused on the unfathomable sacrifices a parent makes for her children and how – at the end of the day – we are unknowable to those whom we believe know us the most.Shelter, the debut novel by Jung Yun, similarly focuses on family life but in this book, the premise is turned on its ear. The question is not “what sacrifices are made by the parent” as much as “what sacrifices are made by the adult child who never received unconditional love and emotional stability.The adult child in question is Kyung Cho, a young father and budding professor whose finances are careening out of control. His parents, Jin and Mae, have done quite well for themselves and Kyung has kept them at arm’s length from his American-born wife and son. But then, one violent day, everything changes. And Kyung must face some of life’s most quintessential issues: how can someone be whole if there’s a yawning gap in the midst of his life? What does he owe a father who has snatched away the ability to feel safe? How does he give to his own son that which was not given to himself? There is some strong writing and some harrowing scenes in Shelter. Watching Kyung unravel is almost like watching the proverbial train wreck; the reader wants to look away at times, but keeps on turning pages to see where it all leads. This reader wanted a bit more nuance; there are times that I felt the author was leading her characters as opposed to letting them lead her.

Her characters include a happily married woman who “wondered what it would feel like to sleepMany of Claire Keegan’s stories read almost like fables. Her characters include a happily married woman who “wondered what it would feel like to sleep with another man”, a pining woman who waits years for a romantic rendezvous with a married doctor and a crass, homophobic millionaire who strips the joy from his achieving stepson’s life.Put another way, her characters can seem emblematic, and that’s the good and the bad of it. There are at least two stories that could easily fit into a “Best of Short Stories” anthology. One is the eponymous first story. In Antarctica, a seemingly satisfied wife and mother is determined to see what a fling with another man is like. “It was December; she felt a certain closing on another year. She needed to do this before she got too old.” The story positively vibrates with menace and we are reasonably sure that this story will not end well. There’s almost a Hitchcockian feel to it.The second story, Passport Soup, is equally mesmerizing. A man named Frank Corso has lost – literally lost – his nine-year-old daughter, shattering his wife. The depths of unrelenting grief – and the eventual unveiling of what the title means – is devastating and authentic.A third story, Quare Name for a Boy, about a writer who returns to her rural Ireland roots, has these great lines: “They don’t know the half of it, don’t know the disguises I made for them, how I took 20 years off their hard-earned faces, washed the honey-blond rinses out of their hair, how I put them in another country and changed their names.”Ms. Keegan’s prose is beautifully descriptive – perhaps a little too descriptive for my subjective taste. There is a wisp of feminism in many of the stories (for example, a downtrodden wife takes the wheel of the car, stranding her bossy husband). And there are times when I could glean where the story was going to end up (I knew – just KNEW – what the key character in Sisters was going to do).

If this is so, then Elizabeth Strout’s consistent story is about imperfect love and striving for connection. Or, to use Sarah Payne’s own words, “…to report on the human condition to tell us who we are and what we think and what we do.”Elizabeth Strout rose to the occasion beautifully with her creation of Olive Kitteridge – a flawed, closed-down woman who has steeled herself from the world with layers of self-protection. There are wisps of Olive Kitteridge in Lucy Barton’s mother, but for Lucy herself, the world still gives ample reasons for amazement.We meet Lucy during her nine-week stay at a NYC hospital for an undisclosed illness. Her mother, who never did enough to protect her from an impoverished life and an unpredictable father, flies to her bedside. The “meat” of the story focuses on what is NOT said during this time period. While her mother compulsively talks about “marriages gone bad”, she is unable to give Lucy what she really needs: verbal affirmation that she is loved.Yet this is more than a simple story of a mother and daughter reconciliation. It goes right to the heart of how we remember and convey our own truths. When Lucy does connect to the writer Sarah Payne, she thinks this: “I liked her books. I like writers who try to tell you something truthful.” At the same time, she muses, “”And then I realized that even in her books, she was not telling exactly the truth, she was always staying away from something. Why, she could barely say her name!” Owning one’s own truth – embodying one’s own name -- is the vital element for redemption and acceptance.

But then he followed it with Gold, and appeared to be trading in his literary gifts in exchange for pursuit of a best seller. In his latest book – inspired by his grandparents’ role in the Second World War – he’s totally back in form with a book that kept me turning pages well into the night. It’s a labor of love and it shows.The book centers on a few memorable characters: Mary North, the affluent daughter of a Parliament member who fervently wants to contribute to the war effort and does so by become a teacher. Tom is her boss and sweetheart; his flat-mate, Alistair, a restorer of art for the Tate, whom Mary meets later on, is overseas fighting for Mother England. Since most children have been evacuated to the countryside in anticipation of the London blitz bombing, the only ones who remain are the “undesirables”, including Zachary, a young black boy and the son of an American minstrel show Interlocutor,, and he becomes one of Mary’s favorite students.There is a gentleness and cleverness in the repertoire between and among these characters. Typically I’d take issue with every character being so bright and witty, yet here, it works beautifully. We come to truly care about each of these characters and his or her eventual fate, which offsets the horrors of the daily bombings of London.It is a delight to see how the plot unfolds, yet there are also some weighty themes that are never too twee, ponderous, or pedantic. At one point, Mary says, “We are a nation of glorious cowards, ready to battle any evil but our own.” The quote is in response to a heinous situation: white children are evacuated to the countryside whereas any child deemed undesirable (including black children) are left behind in London. Even THAT is not enough; Zachary experiences much prejudice for the crime of being born black.Another theme is the necessity of having enormous faith in life and each other during the worst of times. Chris Cleave powerfully shows the impact of war, both overseas and at home, and the unimaginable ways we struggle to stay alive and perhaps more importantly, keep hope alive. He has obviously done ample research, yet it never becomes obvious that this is a researched book. All characters struggle to be brave but there is no manual for what it means to be brave when civilization is on the brink and rules are thrown out the window. Morality no longer becomes a simple matter of black and white one character says, “Everything will be restored. If one won’t believe that, how does one endure all this?” . The forgiveness that the author alludes to in his title is most of all, self-forgiveness. AsIn his preface, the author writes “I hope that readers will see the book simply as the honest expression of wonder of a little man descended from titans, gazing up at the heights from which he has fallen.” As the world actors of World War II take their final bow, his humble tribute brought tears to my eyes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jan 11, 2016","Jan 17, 2016","Oct 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25814512-everyone-brave-is-forgiven

So it is no accident that Sarah Hall’s luminous novel begins with Rachel Caine’s self-exile from the American-Indian reservation in Idaho in which she has been working. Emerging from the American wilderness, pregnant with her Native American friend Kyle’s child, she heads home to the Lake District, where she is hired by an eccentric earl, Thomas Pennington, to reintroduce the grey wolf into the protected confines of his verdant estate.Yet at the same time she reintroduces the wolves in a “rewilding” plan, Rachel is undergoing her own reintroduction to her home territory and face her own worse demons. These include coming to grips with a neglectful and promiscuous recently deceased mother, an estranged half-brother, and her own fear of being tamed through love.“She would like to believe there will be a place, again, where the streetlights end and the wilderness begins. The wolf border,” Sarah Hall writes. The parallelisms between her Earl of Annerdale wolf project and her own animal/human border abound. Her job is to keep the wolves from becoming too domesticated; simultaneously, with motherhood, she is experiencing precisely the opposite. “It will not take them long to be restored,” Rachel muses about the wolves. “Their unbelonging, reversed. Nothing of history will mater to them; land is land, articulate, informative; soon they will dominate.” As Rachel navigates the border of her own unbelonging and her own family history – the story shifts more and more to Rachel’s own connection to what makes her humanThere is true beauty in this book: in the glorious prose, in the organic structure, and in the poignant story. The emphasis of the book is on borders: the border between the past and the present, human and animal, civilization and wilderness, work and personal passions, security and freedom. I loved this visceral book and wanted to linger in its world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Oct 25, 2015","Oct 29, 2015","Oct 25, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23315782-the-wolf-border

And that’s a high compliment to pay to a debut writer.Andria Williams channels the life of a military wife in the late 1950s, a time when the illusion of perfection is all-important. Except Natalie Collier -- born in San Diego, now living in remote Idaho Falls – does not fit the mold. Her young husband, Paul, is one of the operators at the CR-1 nuclear reactor, shielding her from a frightening secret: the CR-1 is not anywhere as secure as the town thinks. But then again, neither is their marriage.“It was improper to be lonely; it was improper to be bored; it was improper, most of all, to be filled with anything like longing.” Nat Collier is filled with all three in a time when gender role distinctions are cemented in stone. Paul must be the strong and silent provider; Nat must be the helpmate who prepares his lunches, irons his uniforms, cares for their young toddlers, and never issues a word of protest.I am wary to give plot twists but suffice to say this: the book balances electrifying tension with an amazing degree of compassion and insights into characters that are struggling hard to “get it right”. Combine a close lens look at a marriage falling into crisis with Cold War failures and army supervisors that care more for promotions than safety, and you have the makings of a true thriller.

The theme was intriguing and here, Gordan McAlpine mines a similar theme: what happens when characters are excised from the universe and “dropped back into some variation of it where (they) never existed.” This is but one of the fascinating subplots of this metafictional novel.A promising debut author, Takumi Sato, is forced to revise his mystery novel, which focuses on a Japanese protagonist after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. The woman with the blue pencil – his intrepid editor, Maxine Wakefield, encourages him to tap into the jingoistic spirit of the country with plot revisions. The irony is that American-born Takumi has been dislocated into an internment camp, a direct target of America’s xenophobic attitude. Takumi Sato eliminates his former character, Japanese amateur PI Sam Samida, replacing him with a Korean character named Jimmy Park, and off it goes.The parallel stories – that of Takumi and his editor, his erased and untethered character Sam Samida, and his characters fictional replacement, Jimmy Park all function in the same universe as the story seamlessly moves back and forth. Different readers will tap into different strands—the abhorrent treatment of Japanese-American citizens during the war, conventional mystery, the metaphysical pondering about whether a character assumes his own life once created, and perhaps most significantly, what a writer is forced to endure to create a commercially successful work. The fact that Gordan McAlpine accomplishes all this in 185 pages – and does it well – is remarkable. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Oct 14, 2015","Oct 18, 2015","Oct 14, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25810271-woman-with-a-blue-pencil

I start this way because this book is inspired by a true story that affected the author. Her good friend was murdered by Leslie deVeau, the victim’s mother. Around the same time, John Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate President Reagan. Later, deVeau and Hinckley became lovers while patients at St. Elizabeths Hospital.This book is not a recreation of those events; rather, it is inspired by them. Any reader who expects a point-by-point comparison will be disappointed. That being said, there is a haunting authenticity to Calf, which pulls the reader in and doesn’t let go until the very last page. Two narratives intertwine. One focuses on Tammy, a disaffected pre-teen who lives in Washington, D.C. with her mother, stepfather, and younger sister and brother. All the pain, alienation and disenchantment of those tender years is fully captured. In fact, Tammy is so real that she can walk off the page. The friend who is eventually murdered is not difficult to guess; we see the event building as if we are watching a trainwreck.The other story, which gets equal time, spotlights Jeffrey Hackney (an obvious Hinckley stand-in) who obsesses over an actress named Amber Carrol. As he emotionally disintegrates, suspense rises although we know (or think we know) where the narrative is going.For me, the more captivating of the two storylines is Tammy’s. There’s a rawness to it that made me feel as if Andrea Kleine was mining some deep emotional remembrances. Yet both storylines are powerful and unsettling.

He won’t be written up as a master of metafiction and the new hot author to watch. But in this book – indeed, in all the books of his that I’ve read – there is something achingly real and downright poignant that makes me want to get lost within the pages.Here he focuses on John Nichols, a good-hearted yet flawed man, who has had primary responsibility for Ethan, his teenaged autistic son. At the start of the book we learn that John and Ethan are taking a road trip from the Chicago area to Charleston to meet the rest of the family for his eldest daughter’s wedding.The family consists of Karen, the “queen bee” (some might say ice queen) who will be marrying a wealthy man with some very decided character flaws. Mindy, the second daughter, is an up-and-coming comedienne on the cusp of becoming really famous. And Mary, John’s ex-wife, will be there as well. As a result of an affair, she has divorced him but John still is carrying the torch for her. John intends to spring a surprise on the family once he arrives and the second part of this book is how that particular plot twist plays out.I am not an expert on autism and I don’t know if Jim Kokoris has had personal family experience with it. I do, however, have friends with autistic sons and the portrayal of Ethan is – to me – exceptionally genuine. “My life with my son had been anything but easy,” John relates, and we learn that he’s not kidding. Ethan is full of tics (he constantly says things like, “Why. Mad?” or “Where. Mom. Be?” or “Family, family, family. USA.”) and sometimes he’ll “pull a Tonto” and fall to the ground. When he wants something, he wants it now (“I. Starving.”) Yet there’s a connection between John and Ethan that defies all the challenges and drills down to the very nature of love.When Jim Kokoris takes on the messy family dynamics – the shared past, failed opportunities, search for one’s real role, love and guilt – he is at his zenith. The book alternates between funny and heartbreaking but at the end of the day, it’s about one family and their road to discovering what “Family, family, family, USA” really means....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Oct 08, 2015","Oct 11, 2015","Oct 08, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23847985-it-s-nice-outside

Her daughters are living overseas with their father. She is a renowned English Literature scholar. And she is, by her own words, an unnatural mother.In this searing book, Elena Ferrante courageously confronts one of our social taboos: what happens if, despite all our expectations, we feel diminished by motherhood? What if we choose to abandon our roles? What does that say about us?Leda reflects, “When my daughters had moved to Toronto, where their father had lived and worked for years, I was embarrassed and amazed to discover that I wasn’t upset; rather, I felt light, as if only then I had definitively brought them in the world.”During her vacation off the Ionian coast, Leda happens across a boisterous and possibly menacing large family, and fixates on the young dissatisfied mother Nina and her cranky young daughter (..there was something off about the little girl; I don’t know what.”) The first-person narration makes us feel almost like complicit voyeurs as Leda studies the family, ultimately committing a simple act that will be a catalyst for self-examination.There is a raw and uncompromising honesty as Leda reveals this about her abandonment of her girls, “I was like someone who is taking possession of her own life, and feels a host of things at the same time, among them an unbearable absence.” Yet this cannot be read as a feminist parable, because she quickly follows with this, when asled why she went back, “Because I realized that I wasn’t capable of creating anything of my own that could truly equal them.”As with Days of Abandonment, another masterful work by Ms. Ferrante, there is ferociously good writing here, laced with a great sense of immediacy and a shockingly honest sense of authenticity. It’s hard to turn away as the narrative propels us to its organic ending. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,not set,not set,"Oct 07, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1058564.The_Lost_Daughter

Katherine (Kit) Carlyle is n IVF baby who retains misty memories of a life as an IVF embryo. In her words, “I was put together – formed – but then had to wait in the cold, with no knowledge of how long that wait was likely to be, or whether it would ever end.”The wait, to be specific, was eight years. At that point, she was implanted and became the daughter of Stephanie, who, we learn early on, dies of cancer and David, an absent and self-absorbed CNN reporter. Father and daughter have a challenging relationship, which is heightened by Kit’s belief that her father blames the IVF procedure for her mother’s premature death.The bulk of this book is Kit’s search for memory and identity; she becomes who she is, ironically, by vanishing. Every occasion—every moment – trembles with a sense of opportunity as Kit looks to strangers to figure out what they are trying to impart. Her vanishing act takes her first to Berlin (a believer in coincidence, she goes there for the flimsiest of reasons: she overhears movie-goers talking about a jilted friend and determines to meet up with him). Even Berlin is not far enough; she journeys to a remote and dismal northern Russian settlement. Her thoughts: “Though I have met new people and visited new places, those aspects of the journey never had much relevance. What has interested me right from the beginning – what has preoccupied me above all – is the prospect of arrival.”As Kit loses herself – even taking on the portentous new name of “Misty” – potential fantasies of her father’s desperate need to find her crowd her thoughts. This is, perhaps, the one weakness of the book: the “daddy issues” compete with the main theme, the self-search. Still, the book is wonderfully written and every locale is rendered with authenticity. This is an original novel that asks a provocative questions: how far does one go to find oneself?...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 30, 2015","Oct 06, 2015","Sep 30, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24388434-katherine-carlyle

It is none of these things. Mary Gaitskill has written a thoroughbred of a novel, peopled with characters that are often combustible, alienated, and out of their depth.Surely Ms. Gaitskill named her character with the beloved film National Velvet in mind – the story of a young girl who wins a spirited gelding and decides to train the rambunctious horse to win England’s Grand National race. But while that Velvet exists in a sort of fairy tale, this Velvet is a child of urban damage and dysfunction. Told alternately from many perspectives – but mostly from Velvet and Ginger’s viewpoint (with a few chapters narrated by Ginger’s husband Paul and Velvet’s highly critical, abusive mother), the book is less about the mare and more about the meres – birth mothers and wannabe mothers, and self-mothering. It’s about stumbling in one’s walk through life and finding inner strength get up and face another day, and defining happiness and success on one’s own terms (for Velvet, it’s often as simple as a veiled compliment from a complicated mother who badly loves, or a text from a boy who may well be trouble but who has seeds of goodness in him). And, because it’s written by an author who knows her craft, it’s a darn good story about a complex teen who – like many teens – is sometimes easy to love and sometimes exasperating to deal with. In sensitively tackling the nature vs. nurture dilemma – can a child who has everything going against her triumph – it raises thoughtful questions.

It’s not even past.” In the latest Tessa Hadley book, the past is very much present. And if the reader has any doubt, there’s a lengthy section that interrupts the flow of a family story, set a generation back in the past.The book focuses on a trio of sisters (Harriet, Alice and Fran) and their oft-married brother with his latest wife who gather together for a holiday at the family house, sundry children in tow. The complexity of a family brought together is summed up beautifully by Ms. Hadley, “All the siblings felt sometimes, as the days of their holiday passed, the sheer irritation and perplexity of family coexistence: how it fretted away at the love and attachment which were nonetheless intense and enduring when they were apart.” The two outsiders who are caught up in these family dynamics are definitely outsiders: the brother’s Argentinian wife Pilar and Kasim, Alice’s ex-boyfriend’s London-born Pakistani son.Ms. Hadley mines the roles and interactions of adult siblings with pinpoint precision. Beneath this idyllic country setting, many emotions boil to the surface (or are suppressed before boiling over) and secrets abound. The “meat” in the middle of the sandwich – set in 1968 – provides insight into their childhood, when their mother Jill leaves her neer-do-well husband and takes her three oldest children (Fran isn’t born yet) back to their grandmother, Sophy, and their vainglorious clergyman grandfather. Time after time, the reader is mildly unsettled by realizing how the past repeats itself.Just as much of a character is the landscape, which Tessa Hadley painstakingly describes. Her portrait of the cottage and the land are lyrical and all the reader’s senses are tapped into. Nostalgic houses in decay (both past and present) are tried-and-true metaphors but even so, The Past is elevated by the sheer beauty of the description.

Here, Pip is female, not male, although she’s still mesmerized by a charismatic flame (Andreas, a Julian Assange type anti-hero who shines as brightly as Estella), and she, too, is in search of her birthright. The themes are every bit as compelling: love and rejection, wealth and poverty and the predestined triumph of pure over evil.Oh, and of course, the novel is BIG. Nearly 600 pages, to be exact. In a nod to Dickens, there are multiple plot lines, coincidences, and hold-on-to-your-seat dramatic twists. But make no mistake, while Franzen gives a nod to Dickens, this book cannot be construed as a homage to him.The book is encapsulated by its title: purity. On the surface, Purity is the birth-name of Pip. But is there such a thing as purity? Can there truly be pure motives, pure ideologies, pure goodness, pure connections, pure love? In this Franzenian universe, the answer seems to be “no.” Everything is tainted by a “moral hazard” (a term Pip learns in economics).Here we meet characters who are struggling with their own definition of “good”: Pip-the-pure…Andreas, a Snowden (or more aptly, Assange) leaker from East Germany (and later Bolivia) who is ostentatiously for transparency and yet commits a felonious deed for reasons that others might deem as pure…Pip’s mother Anabel who forsakes “blood-tainted” family money to live a chaste-like, pure life of poverty…Tom, Anabel’s ex-husband, a muckraker journalist who is a good, yet pliable person who isn’t, by any means, ALL good.Woven into this tapestry are Important Themes: misguided state ideologies and lack of openness, the vacuity of some experimental films, the failings of feminism, the crush of student debt, the eternal quest for power and connection, the false lure of cults and social media, the narcissism of the famous, and all too often, the damage created by suffocating and often too eccentric parenting. (Parents don’t fare too well in Franzen’s world).One friend described this book as “flawless” and it’s not quite that; some of Franzen’s romantic dialogue (between Pip and Andreas, for example) made me groan just a bit and some of his female characters skirt a little too close to comfort with being well-written stereotypes (crazy moms, women who want to discuss their feelings ad nauseum, women who only feel lascivious during certain moon cycles). Then again, the men don’t come out smelling like roses either: they are often testosterone-driven, narcissistic, love-phobic. These quibbles aside, this theme-driven book kept me engrossed well into the night, in ways that his last book, Freedom, did not. Ultimately, Purity is a paradox: an incredibly hopeful book about the folly of moral absolutism, the bequeathing of a broken world and the impossibility of being good. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Sep 13, 2015","Sep 17, 2015","Sep 13, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23754479-purity

Courtney Allen channels the voice of a rural young man named Silas McCarter, whose southern-Georgia Appalachian family is scraping by in the late nineteenth century…and then his pregnant sister Clara vanishes.And, as they say, the plot thickens. Who is the father of Clara’s child? Is there foul play?What happens when you are forced to make harsh choices for mere survival? And how much can a down-and-out family bear?Courtney Allen deftly hits all the hot buttons of a good hybrid thriller and historical narrative in his plotting: greed and betrayal, shocking violence, close-minded people, irrational family feuds, (think: Hatfields and McCoys) rural culture, and ultimately, what a sense of home really means.His characters – Silas and Clara, orphaned early in life, and Uncle Troy and Aunt Bly, the family members who have served as their protectors – are satisfyingly real. For the audience it’s targeted to – those who enjoy harsh-reality turn-of-the-century coming-of-age stories – the rewards are ample. The reader can anticipate being transported to the rural countryside and a time when life was both simpler and far more complex.Disclosure: I was provided with a free copy of Down from the Mountain from the author – whom I have never met -- encouraging me to write an honest . I am rarely receptive to these overtures, but the author’s strong belief in his book (at a time when mainstream publishing has become big business) won me over.

I was haunted by them and eager to read his third book, Like Family. I was not disappointed.When read quickly – and at 146 pages, it can easily be read in one sitting – Like Family at first appears like any other cancer story. A young couple – an unnamed narrator, a physicist who may or may not be partially based on the author himself, and his wife Nora hire a widowed housekeeper, referred to only as Mrs. A. Gradually, her importance in the household increases as she takes over the role as nanny to their son Emanuele, who is not extraordinary enough for his father. Mrs. A, though, has cancer. As her cancer progresses in its inevitable and programmed way, it also becomes a metaphor for the couple’s own lives (“A young couple can also fall ill, from insecurity, from routine, from isolation.”) In losing her – a woman who is like family – they also begin to lose themselves.It’s a simple story, really, and one that has been created before. But Paolo Giordano raises this question: All these cancer stories are the same, yes, but does that mean that all lives aren’t unique, deserving of their own story? Can one person become a shield for a young family that’s “a nebula of self-centeredness in danger of imploding” and if so, what happens when that person removes herself from the equation? And perhaps most importantly, what does it mean to love somebody?As in his other books, Paolo Giordano writes profoundly and elegantly, capturing the pathos of life in a few well-chosen words. His genius comes from his ability to mine the interior thoughts of characters who – by choice or compulsion – cannot break through to nurture themselves or each other. In many important ways, Like Family is a meditation on life, death and most of all, love....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Sep 07, 2015","Sep 08, 2015","Sep 07, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25361884-like-family

He spent most of his time in America, playing househusband and nursemaid to his young son Sean. After undergoing primal scream therapy with Arthur Janov, he viewed himself as unburdened…yet he was also creatively blocked.This is the John Lennon we meet in Kevin Barry’s audacious and often brilliant new novel, Beatlebone. At the start of the novel, he has escaped from the heart of New York City to the west coast of Ireland, where he owns (yes, really!) a tiny island that the locals have dubbed “Beatle Island.” But anyone who expects a straight narrative about a complex and troubled musician has another thing in store. The true theme of Beatlebone is the heavy costs and rewards of creativity. This fictional John says, “What it’s about? It’s about what you’ve got to put yourself through to make anything worthwhile. It’s about going to the dark places and using what you find there.”Kevin Barry is like a magician channeling John Lennon, displaying him as a searching, profane, and lost soul who must get to his own island, literally and figuratively. He must virtually enclose himself in a cave of dead bones, where “he has all the words and all of its noise and all of its squall.” He must look closely to see the tiny details in order to capture the larger scope. Throughout this book there are wisps – echoes really – of words that Beatles fans will associate with some of John’s (and other musicians) songs, but they are so beautifully intertwined with the narrative that lose attention for one second and you’ll miss them.The book was a solid 5 star but here is where it rose to 6 stars: Kevin Barry interjects his own search for creativity in the narrative. As the novel temporarily shifts from fiction to memoir, the author writes, “…what’s left to us is mediated, and it can only be built up again in gimcrack reconstructions, with scenic façade, but if we can get the voices right, the fiction may hold for a while at least.”When he surrenders the spotlight to John, it’s impossible not to view him in a whole different light, understanding the pains that the author has taken to “get it right.” This is an amazing book that will make my personal Top Ten list. Having said that, it’s not for everyone; certainly not for those who are squeamish about profuse profanity nor those who are not willing to journey on a kind of “magical mystery tour”.

Its theme might be summed up in this sentence: “Nadya knew the sensation, the eeriness of discovering a corresponding point between past and present, of realizing that not all memory is mirage.”Indeed it’s not. In the first story, set in Leningrad in 1937, Roman Markin, a virtuoso artist-turned-censor, specializes in removing those who have fallen from favor from photographs to ensure those photographs are politically correct. Gradually he begins to insert his own brother’s face, one of the purged, as well as a talented ballerina he’s erasing. He reflects, “For art to be the chisel that breaks the marble inside us, the artist musts first become the hammer.”All stories flow from this one. In Granddaughters, the next story, we meet Galina, the ballerina’s beautiful granddaughter, who captures the Miss Siberia crown and moving up in life while her first love, Kolya, is sent to fight in Chechnya.In the particularly poignant A Prisoner of the Caucasus, we meet up with Kolya and his fellow prisoner Danilo. There, he “eats his bread, and sleeps with the knowledge that today hasn’t added to the sum of human misery. For now at least it’s peace of a kind he hadn’t imagined himself worthy of receiving.”More interconnections follow. We meet the offspring of Roman Markin’s purged brother – a nephew who shows up at the 2013 exhibition of Roman’s work with his own son. And certainly, we recognize the points where past and present intersect. Throughout, Anthony Marra paints a bold canvas of Russian life from the 1930s to a dystopian future – brushstroking in the paranoia and doublespeak, the labor camps, the lengths young men must travel to avoid being used as fodder in Chechnya (Palace of the People is particularly affecting when Sergei, the grand-nephew of Roman Markin and about to be sent to the front, realizes that he is not an assistant to a legless friend of the family but an apprentice). For me (and each reader is different), The Tsar of Love and Techno is even better than Mr. Marra’s debut book. It is powerful and profound.

A dark fairy tale (think: Brothers Grimm)? A serio-comedy narrative in the vein of his earlier work, Sisters Brothers? It’s hard to define, exactly, but I will say this: for a reader like me, who leans towards strong character-driven or theme-based novels, I was a bit out of my comfort zone and that was just fine. The strong writing and the plot kept me eagerly turning pages and I surrendered to DeWitt’s talent.The main character is Lucien Minor (consistently called Lucy), an earnest and naïve young man. Spindly and pale, and – at the very beginning – at risk of dying – he sees a shadowed man who asks him what he wants out of life. His answer: “Something to happen.”The rest of the book explores what DOES happen as he goes into service to the Majordomo, Mr. Olderglough, a good-hearted man who has a tenuous grasp of reality. The characters of an adventure tale are all here – a mad love-sick baron (who reminded me a bit of the “crazy wife in the attic” from Jane Eyre), an extraordinarily handsome and potentially dangerous soldier, two sneaky (but redemptive) thieves, and of course, the fair maiden who gives Lucy a reason to live.We don’t know exactly where and when this tale takes place (think: Ishiguro’s Buried Giant) but it feels somehow familiar, somehow knowable. There was a point over half-way through – a scene of debauchery – where I began wondering, “Where is the heart of the story? It’s a fine “read”, but what do I take away from it?”On reflection, I had my answer. The book is about life itself. As the majordomo himself says, “What are rooms for if not entering, after all. Or else exiting. Indeed, think of how many rooms we enter and exit in our span of days, boy. Room to room to room. And we call it a life.” A life – defined in this book – is when something happens and we show up for it.

Just last year, Nigeria – the birthplace of Chinelo OkpIt is impossible for me to  this book without first addressing the “why” of its genesis. Just last year, Nigeria – the birthplace of Chinelo Okparanta – passed one of the world’s most punitive laws against same-sex relationships, including lengthy prison sentences and in the northern states, death by stoning. As someone who strongly believes that healthy and reciprocal love between two people – regardless of gender – is always a good thing, I can’t help but applaud this young author for providing a voice for so many in Nigeria who are forced to deny their authentic selves.That being said, I typically default in reacting to a book not to its worthy themes, but how it succeeds in advancing those themes. And here, I must admit to some disappointment.Having read Happiness Like Water, I know what heights Chinelo Okparanta is capable of reaching. In that collection, she writes devastatingly about women and children seeking shelter from abusive husbands, gay lovers who must forego love because one is acquiescing to an arranged marriage, and other traumas. It was – and remains – a fine debut.In Under the Udala Trees, Ms. Okparanta states that her novel is attempting to “give Nigeria’s marginalized LGBTQ citizens a more powerful voice, and a place in our nation’s history.” The book is, at its core, a coming-of-age story in which the narrator --Ijeoma – is sent to live with friends of the family during wartime. Her sexual and emotional awakening at the hands of another displaced girl, Amina, sets in motion a long struggle for self-acceptance.Ms. Okparanta writes beautifully, lucidly, and at times, devastatingly; at no point did I want to abandon the book. In fact, once I started reading, I eagerly turned pages. But I couldn’t help but feel as if she were leading me to conclusions, rather than let me reach them on my own. Nigeria is the second-most religious nation in the world; the author writes, “It’s the Church that has interpreted God’s words to its own benefit…My point is that business is the reason for things like doctrines. Business is the reason for words like ‘abomination’.”No argument there. But somehow, I wanted Ms. Okparanta to go further than what has now become the sad givens: the hypocrisy and perniciousness of religion, the valuing of male children above female children, the forcing of loving people to deny their own realities in order to conform and to enter into false marriages. In ways, I felt this novel could easily be classified as young-adult fiction (and, for the record, there’s nothing wrong with that. My belief is that To Kill A Mockingbird, one of the classics of American fiction, is also YA).

Yet every single movement centers around how we search for meaning, narrative, and grace in a world that may seem random.In the novella, an octogenarian judge named Mendelssohn – same name as the gifted classical composer – arranges to meet his churlish son Elliot on what will be the last day of his life. Thirteen chapters – some narrating his progression through that fortuitous day, others focused on detectives who are, in effect, autopsying that day by cutting it into tiny slivers, introduces a host of minor characters with their own perspectives as this cacophony of melodies finally crescendos to the final true note. It’s a deceptively hard feat to pull off, and Mr. McCann does so beautifully.In the shortest piece, “What Time is it Now, Where You Are?” the perspective of a writer (perhaps the author himself) is displayed, as we, the readers, become witness to the very art of creation and shifting perspectives.Sh’khol, the next piece, centers on a mother spending Christmas in Galway with her deaf and often uncommunicative young son, who disappears around the time she is translating a beautifully written story by an Arab Israeli abut a middle-aged couple who lost their two children. Sh’khol – there is no relative word in other languages – defines a parent who has lost a child. Fact and fiction, the perspective expands to include both.Finally, in Treaty, an elderly nun Beverly – brutally raped in her youth – catches a glimpse of her rapist, now a dignified peacekeeper, on TV. It is established that her memory is fading; what is the perspective? Is “Carlos” the same person who brutalized her in truth? How has he discovered grace? Who this man is depends on perspective.This is a magnificent book without a false note.

Mr. Nadler knows Brooklyn well – Borough Park, the D train, the old walk-ups, Coney Island, Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach – and he brings the borough (and later, downtown New York) to life. At the core of this byzantine plot – narrated by Izzy Edel, who learns via postcard that his estranged and shady father Aloyzy has gone missing and is presumed dead -- is a search for father and identity. It’s a search that is not unlike Telemachus’s search for his father Odysseus who left Troy when Telemachus was still an infant. Not unlike that epic, Izzy must exile himself and go through journeys and trials before he can claim his rightful position in life.Izzy’s own journey takes him to Greenwich village, where he takes over his father’s role in selling books from an outdoor cart, and it leads him to Rayna, a vulnerable woman who appeared (he believes) in his father’s left-behind sketches and who has amorphous ties to a Hasidic sect. It takes him to the underbelly of life, where mobsters lurk and secrets are kept. And it also takes him to his Jewish roots, where folklore and the Talmud combine with the modern day world to weave a tapestry of the fullness of life.Not unlike Carlos Ruiz Zafon’s The Shadow of the Wind – with its famous cemetery of forgotten books – this is also a book about the constructs of fiction, the tales we follow and live by, our desire to become our own storybook hero. Readers who enjoy Zafon or Michael Chabon will particularly relate to Ben Nadler’s writing style, which combines street realities, pulp fiction, and an almost fabulist undercurrent.

And when it soon becomes clear that the “I” in this story is a misunderstood tiger, you also know that this is a writer who is not afraid to take chances.Parameswaran’s world is always slightly off-kilter, with often well-meaning characters and animals who are navigating the life vs. death conundrum and totally puzzled by the concept of love. In this first story, The Infamous Bengal Ming, the tiger thinks he’s in love with his handler, but his primal urges still reign supreme.In I Am An Executioner – arguably the very best of this collection – an executioner-by-trade justifies his profession in fractured and mangled English. “It made me wonder the universe, even we was here many years,” he marvels, as he does his work with “no fussing” and tries to win the affections of his disdainful new bride who is put off – yet strangely attracted – by her husband’s unsavory profession and his impending execution of a young girl for reasons unknown.There are many inventive and sometimes, ingenious stories in this collection. In “Four Rajeshes”, the aforementioned Rajesh, a railway station manager, admits and yet fights his man-love that appears to be going off track, all the while obsessing about the mysterious gibberish written by his newly-hired clerk. In the sci-fi last story, On the Banks of Table River, two disparate worlds – Earth and Planet Lucina – come together and the life-death mystery again takes center stage: “Think of life as a story. Each one must come to an end, for it to have form and meaning. What gives life to the stories are the bodies at the end of it.”There’s more: an exCompuUSA employee sets up a fake medical practice, even performing surgery – although he doesn’t have an ounce of qualification, while his wife hides the secret of her growing cancer.

But the question boils down to this: Any discussion of illegal immigration these days generates all sorts of complex emotions and outspoken opinions. But the question boils down to this: under what devastating circumstances would someone with good intentions abandon the only life he or she has known and desperately strike out anew in an inhospitable country? And, more compellingly: who are the weakest -- those who stay put and call it a sacrifice or those who take a chance and fail?Sunjeev Sahota’s searing new novel masterfully answers this question with the back stories of four characters: Tochi, a Chamaar from the untouchable class Avtar and Randeep, whose fates are twined and who come from formerly middle class households, and Naranda, a pious and chaste Sikh woman who is determined to “do good.” How their lives come together and are ripped apart is the plot line of the book.Synergistically, these four work together to highlight all the way those of Indian descent make it to England: one enrolls as a student, another arranges to marry a visa-wife, yet another sells his kidney in a particularly harrowing scene. Each has high hopes of working hard and claiming a better life back in India, where jobs in their hometowns are incredibly fierce. Each is ground down through the tedium of the struggle to find work, make money, support an overseas family, pay the rent, keep the immigration officials and the bosses at bay, and still be able to save for a sustainable future.Many themes are explored, not the least the lingering death throes of a cruel caste system that labels people by the family they were born into. Tarlochan’s story of almost gaining it all, only to have everything dashed through an accident of birth, unfolds organically. The fissures between the haves and have-nots, Sikhs and Chamaars, naturalized citizens and immigrants, men and women, strong and weak never feel reductive, clichéd or manipulative. Rather, the narrative creates windows into the hearts and minds of these characters, who feel achingly real. I’ve heard this novel described as “dark.” Certainly, it’s not for those who prefer sunny characters and look for positive meaning in our human existence.

All of this plays out against the backdrop of Quebec’s squeaky close 1995 referendum on sovereignty vs. unity, as a divided country held its breath. At times, the parallelisms between Jim’s life and the Quebec seemed a little too neatly telegraphed. Take this, for example, referring to Nan: “She wanted to feel more alive, that’s what she wanted. To live an independent and courageous life. And with that bracing thought something clicked in her brain and she understood Quebec. She understood a place torn between staying and leaving, and therefore always dissatisfied.” In other places, the book shines as it teases the reader with the rhythm and flow of natural and connective life. The rivalry of two brothers, a mother and oldest son estrangement, blended families that struggle to define their individual places, a sister and brother who can’t quite bring themselves to reconciliation, a complicated husband-wife marriage that becomes even more complicated when a best friend shows up…all of these are ordinary events and yet form a tapestry of life as it moves forward. For a great part of this novel, I was waiting for something to happen, a collision between characters that would result in something entirely life-transforming. It was only when I was into the beautifully-crafted last third of the book that I recalled the old adage: life happens within and without you. Indeed, as these characters navigate their competing loyalties, they recognize (to quote Four Quartets) that “the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.” Jim’s life is not by any means complete, but in integral ways, he is whole....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Aug 05, 2015","Aug 10, 2015","Aug 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22747914-his-whole-life

But in Moses Sweetland, Mr. Crummey’s cantankerous and fiercely honesIt is rare that the trajectory of a novel can be surmised by a character’s name. But in Moses Sweetland, Mr. Crummey’s cantankerous and fiercely honest character, the author may well be signaling the key themes of his novel.Moses, of course, is the Exodus hero of the Bible, a story that begins in Genesis. An important prophet, born n a time when his people were an enslaved minority, he demands release. And Sweetland speaks for itself. In this novel, Sweetland also represents a remote island off Newfoundland. Based partially on fact (after Newfoundland joined Canada, the government instituted a resettlement program, forcing thousands of citizens to relocate, abandoning their centuries-old lifestyles).As the novel begins, the government is offering the residents of Sweetland a magnanimous resettlement program with one catch: every person must sign on. Many are glad to do so, but not Moses. Now in his early 70s and unmarried, his homeland is everything to him. Symbolism abounds: Moses worked as Sweetland’s lightkeeper (“let there be light”) until the lighthouse was automated. He is, in ways, the “priest” of the island: saving a boatland of fleeing Sri Lankans, paying tribute to the dead, and standing up to the pervasive lure of money in exchange for generations of history.Ghosts haunt his memories: ghosts of the Sri Lankans, his now-gone sister who was forced into a loveless marriage with a decent man, his “almost” fiancée, his dead brother. Accompanied at different times by a young boy named Jesse who may be on the autistic spectrum and later, the dog of the other last hold-out to the deal (aptly named Loveless),Moses must primarily rely on his own survival instincts. As ghosta and memories crowd his brain, he begins to understand that life is nothing more than a made-up thing, with “bits and pieces of make-believe cobbled together to look halfways human.”Make no mistake, though, Mr. Crummey does not subjugate his plot or his characters to his overriding themes. The characters are achingly real: Moses’ good friend Queenie Coffin (again, the symbolism of names) who is an agoraphobic who remains indoors feasting on badly-written romance novels; his one-time great friend Duke Fewer, who maintains the only barbershop without ever actually giving a haircut; Pilgrim, his blind brother-in-law; and perhaps most of all, Jesse, the quirky and dearly-loved boy who Moses befriends.

Take this: “Your mother,” one charactLisa Gornick has a great deal of insight into the human heart, no surprise since she’s a psychoanalyst by trade. Take this: “Your mother,” one character says, “lived like an egg sliding over a Teflon pan.” In just a few aptly chosen words, we get a blazing insight into the character.The book could be described as a hybrid: not really an integrated novel, but also not a short story collection. Each of the stories is linked to the others, not unlike, say, Tom Rachman’s The Imperfectionists. In the title story, a young woman named Louisa meets an aspirational student William (nicknamed Bear) at Princeton. That relationship is like the hub of a wheel: other characters who are tightly or loosely connected with them are explored in subsequent stories (and one previous one) until we meet Louisa and Bear once again after life has intervened.Arguably the best story/chapter, Louisa Meets Bear is also the most personal: Louisa addresses Bear in the second tense, directly speaking to him. As a result, the reader is meant to feel a complicit part of what is happening between them. And what IS happening is a young man determined to escape the dull grind of his lower-middle-class background, pursuing Louisa as if she were an exquisite prize. Put another way, it’s an exploration of an unhealthy love.We meet Louisa’s cousin’s adopted daughter, Brianna, who travels to Italy with her adopted parents; her father Richard is forced to confront his uncomfortable sexual urges while at dinner with his Peter Pan-like college chum. We get introduced to a significant ex-lover of Louisa – named Andrew – who scares his newly-pregnant wife with an off-hand tale of a horror he experienced as a recent NYU law graduate trying to “do good” in Guatemala. And we meet someone significant in Bear’s future life, a psychoanalyst, who finds a love-obsessed former client decomposing on her office floor. From time to time, the symbolism gets a little heavy-handed: for example, when Bear’s sister Charlotte gains an epiphany-of-sorts while viewing dinosaurs in a museum, where she accompanies an accomplished blind woman. But for the most part, these interlocking tales are spot-on. At the end of the day, this book – which plays out like a symphony unfolding – is about how we inadvertently disappoint each other and ourselves and yet soldier on, shaping ourselves to endure....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 23, 2015","Jul 28, 2015","Jul 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22929499-louisa-meets-bear

The comparisons to giants such as Flannery O’Connor, RayJoy Williams appears to be one of the most accomplished short story writers I never heard of. The comparisons to giants such as Flannery O’Connor, Raymond Carver, Alice Munroe and Tobias Wolff really peaked my interest and I was not disappointed.There are many stories here – four dozen, to be precise – and I am savoring them. These little gems are not meant to be devoured one after the other, but I’ve read at least half of them and will continue to read consistently over the weeks ahead. For those who like their short stories tied up in a little red bow, this is not a collection for you. There is little in way of plotting or likeable characters. Joy Williams excels in ambiguity and her endings are open-ended. In the sobering and heartbreaking story Honored Death, for example, a woman on the cusp of her own life stands by helplessly as her narcissistic mother gradually fades into nothingness. The title alludes to an ancient Japanese ritual: a bear cub is captured and treated like royalty, until he is dragged out and killed. In the title story, a woman who appears to be devoid of meaning befriends an old woman in a mental hospital while visiting a friend. She is asked to look after the poor old soul’s dog, actually, a gray barking machine. In a few well-crafted sentences, Joy Williams sums up this woman’s life: “But it sounded so real, so remarkably real, and the disorder she felt was so remarkably real as well that she hesitated. She could not go forward. Then, she couldn’t go back.”Another favorite is Fortune, a short story about a self-involved group of 20-somethings who feign concern in an unnamed country, presumably in Central America. Their parents descend on them like swarms, with their skewered values and shattered lives. “They felt that their lives were now beginning. At the same time, they felt it was possible that their actual lives were still waiting for them, and that they involved different people. This was something they found themselves thinking about more and more, usually with unhappiness, as the parents kept coming.”Over and over in these stories, there is a search for what’s true and what’s real, the randomness of life, the effects of dislocation and discontent. All of it is done almost as if by sleight of hand, vignettes that make you feel and make you think. For the short story reader, this collection is a must....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Jul 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24195950-the-visiting-privilege

In American Salvage, her last short story collection, she aimed a spotlight on rural Michigan and those who inhabit it, fully penetrating the lives who have learned not to expect too much from life. I loved it.Not so much this one, which I found to be somewhat uneven. Here, BJC mines the same territory yet the portraits are darker and – in my opinion – less nuanced. Arguably the best, the eponymous story is told in first-person by a hospice-bound mother dying of lung cancer to her bitter eldest daughter who blames her for (among other things) looking aside when she was molested. Written in the style of self-justification, the dialogue rings true and the story is incredibly poignant.There are others I liked as well: Playhouse, where the uncomfortable dynamics of a brother and sister are highlighted, for example. A Multitude of Sins, focused on an abused woman and her dying husband who can no longer hurt her is also well-written.Others, though, like My Dog Roscoe, strive for a comic tone and don’t quite make it.

I was going to write this one off as yet another in a quest of understanding women in the twilight of their lives. The serio-comedic, deceptively breezy tone uses the American Reality documentary, This Is Your Life, as its overriding conceit. In that show, which aired on NBC in the 1950s, the host surprises a guest and proceeds to take them down “memory lane” in front of a live audience, with guest appearances by friends and family.But somehow, about one-third of the way through, the book began to grow on me and I started to truly care about Harriet Chance. The theme of the book is universal: “We are the sum of moments and reflections, actions and decisions, triumphs, failures and yearnings, all of it held together, inexplicably, miraculously, really, by memory and association.”In the first several pages, Harriet comes across as an almost stereotypical 78-year-old, embarking on her first cruise alone – to Alaska -- after the death of her husband Bernard. She could be Every Woman, brought up in an era where women focused mainly on husband and children (she has two), subjugating their own needs, hiding behind polite masks of “dears” and “darlings”, afraid to shake the status quo.Gradually, though, the real, flawed Harriet begins to emerge. In a series of flashback chapters, which jump all over the place (from the time she was a toddler to her formative years to just a year before her husband’s death), the real Harriet is revealed. We learn that secrets have been kept – all the way around – and that complexity lies beneath each person’s simple veneer.The book is at its best when it explores mother-daughter relationships. Harriet’s encounters with her grown-up and damaged mid-age daughter, Caroline, ring achingly true. The book’s cover – a cruise ship riding across seemingly placid waves – may say it all: “Still waters run deep.” My rating: 3.5....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jul 15, 2015","Jul 20, 2015","Jul 15, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24001092-this-is-your-life-harriet-chance

It’sThe deepest fear of any parent is to suddenly have a child – whether toddler or teenager – disappear and not know if he or she is living or dead. It’s a plot that’s been beautifully explored by Stewart O’Nan in Songs for the Missing, by Brett Johnston in Remember Me Like This , and by Laura Lippman in What The Dead Know.Now Tim Johnston takes his turn at the plate and man oh man, can he ever write. In a nutshell, the plot goes like this: a dysfunctional family – husband, wife, college-bound track star daughter and younger son – are on vacation in the Rocky Mountains. The sister and brother go for a run in the mountains; a car strikes the brother. The daughter, Caitlin, takes the driver up on his offer to take her to fetch help but instead, kidnaps her. And from that foundation, the novel takes off.This is not just a thriller; it’s a LITERARY thriller. As a result, the reader cannot expect a plot twist a minute or an emphasis on plot at the expense of character development. The question is never about “who took Caitlin” or even “why did he take her”, but rather how such a heinous act can mentally and emotionally destroy each member of a family. That being said, I read the last 75 pages with my heart in my mouth. The prose is luscious. It’s obvious that Tim Johnston knows the Colorado Rockies and the sense of place is quite magnificent. The characters are never black-and-white but rather flawed people with their own issues, many of which are illuminated after the abduction. The randomness of life is often highlighted. (The kidnapper says, “People don’t want to give dumb luck any credit for the turns in their lives, good or bad. People want to believe in some plan, or design, when all around them is the evidence that the whole world is nothing but dumb luck. Going back to the first cells of the ocean. Going back to the stars.”Descent is a thriller. It is literary.

Those who are still alive there survive on cola rations and black market fruit.Ensconced in this dismal setting are two rays of light: Luz (the Spanish translation of light. “Luz was light, she was light-headed, light within light…”) and Ray (think: sun ray). As a deserter and a quitter, his life has been “an archipelago of ambiguity and abstraction and impossibility”; as the former poster child for the Bureau of Conservation, she is defined by her thirsty needs. And then one day, they discover a strange fragile young toddler named Ig. They abduct her to save her and so the real story begins.Claire Vaye Watkins astounded me with her short story collection Battleborn, surely one of the best contemporary collections of the past five years. So even though I am not a fan of dystopian literature (the only two I’ve liked have been Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel and Dog Stars by Peter Heller), I just had to see how far her talent had taken her.The book is a wonder and testimony to a fertile imagination. It’s about how we lay waste to our greatest gifts: our land, our dreams, our abilities to love and nurture. It’s about how we’ve become parched for the anything authentic, seeking false saviors and believing in fake visions as we strive to satiate ourselves. It’s about the mystical lure of cults and drugs and visions and lies…anything that leads us away from ourselves. And it’s about an unknowable child, a child who may just be the catalyst to help those to whom she’s entrusted know themselves.In ways, it’s also about how barren and bereft and lifeless our lives become – both interior and exterior – when we lose sight of what we truly thirst for. Claire Vaye Watkins touches on many issues: apocalyptic weather phenomenon, government conspiracies, cult idoltry, forced evacuations, crowd acquiescence, and loss and forgiveness. Yet Ms. Watkins never ignores her characters; Luz, Ray and Ig come across as all too real.

As a result, I will not reveal anything that is not on the book jacket. And that’s this: suppose you are a bestselling author named Henry whose entire life is a lie…and your wife is the only one who knows it. And now suppose your lover reveals to you that she’s pregnant with your child. Further suppose that a childhood nemesis is hot on your trail.It’s the makings of a compelling read. For those who enjoyed Herman Koch’s The Dinner or (dare I say?) Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl, there will be ample enjoyment in witnessing the machinations of an ingenious (and definitely unlikable) man who constructs his life in ways that others might construct elaborate story-novels.Throughout, Sascha Arango – one of Germany’s most prominent screenplay writers – gently pokes fun at the writing process with winks at the construction of this book. When one fan questions Henry about the “most important thing a writer should remember” (groan!), he gives the stock answer of writing what you know about – another obvious lie. And then he adds, “…and to allow plenty of time for leaving things out…everything you leave out on purpose or delete—that’s what gives you the most trouble and takes the longest.” Similar ruminations are made on the importance (and difficulty) of a novel’s ending.As Henry’s web is woven tighter, I became increasingly unable to tear myself away from the pages. I did have some quibbles with the ending, but Sascha Arango already warned me that I might. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jun 08, 2015","Jun 11, 2015","Jun 08, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23492595-the-truth-and-other-lies

Down and out in post-Katrina New Orleans, he strives to do the right thing. One carefully written line says it all: “…he kicks his leg out from under the sheet and leaves it exposed to lure mosquitoes away from his son.” The ambiguous ending leaves it unclear about whether he will be able to be the dad his father wasn’t…or not.Similarly, in Nirvana, the first story, a digital programmer creates a virtual simulacrum of the assassinated president of the United States as he deals with his wife’s paralysis and growing depression. She is a Kurt Cobain fan; will his tech skills be able to give his wife a reason to live? In Dark Meadow, a pedophile, abused himself, uses his technical gifts to…what? As an officer asks, “Is this guy trying to protect kids by alerting the authorities of a way to catch predators? Or is he trying to help pedophiles by warning them of a vulnerability?” In Adam Johnson’s stories, the endings aren’t wrapped up in a big bow. Like life itself, the characters are presented with a way forward; whether they eventually take it or not is up to them.

Ronald Reagan has always been a lighting rod, lionized by some, demonized by others. Yet at his core, he was unknowable, evading a careful analysis by his own hand-picked biographer. Thomas Mallon has no intention of analyzing Reagan, nor does he have an axe to grind. Accordingly, his novel should stand on its own merits, not as a litmus test about what readers may think of the Reagan years.Those who are familiar with Mr. Mallon’s last book, Watergate, will see a similar structure in this one. There are many familiar – and even unexpected – real-life characters who populate Finale: Richard Nixon, George Schultz, Pamela Harriman, Christopher Hitchens (a good friend of the author’s), Bette Davis, Merv Griffin, John Hinckley, daughter Maureen and inevitably, astrologer Jane Quigley among others. But some of the characters are figments of Mr. Mallon’s fertile imagination, and are portrayed so wonderfully that it’s a good thing that he places a list of characters at the beginning (to tell who is real and who is fictional).The heart of the book takes place in Reykjavik, Iceland, where Ronald Reagan met with Mikhail Gorbachev in an unprecedented summit. At the time, the two leaders came within inches of an historic agreement to reduce all nuclear arms to zero; only the so-called “Star Wars” defense missiles stood in the way. The audacity of this incredible vision for disarmament – so tantalizingly close! – when two men had it in their power to begin the world all over again. It makes for incredibly arresting reading and a nostalgia that that moment was allowed to slip from our collective grasp.The backdrop of the 1980s is all here: antinuclear activists, the AIDS epidemic, Iran-gate, and just a hint of the Alzheimer’s that would rob the Great Communicator of one of his greatest gifts. Whether the president’s mental terrain was vastly more complicated than anything yet reckoned or whether the cupboard really was bare depends on who is doing the judging.All the characters – Republicans and Democrats, family members and lobbyists – come across as incredibly flawed, incredibly human. And at the center stands Ronald Reagan, unknowable, indefinable, yet central to every bit of the action that swirls around him....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 02, 2015","Jun 17, 2015","Jun 02, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24678279-finale

How do you possibly rate it?That’s the dilemma I face with Black Glass. The collection has been dubbed “ferociously imaginative and provocative” and I absolutely agree. Karen Joy Fowler is a superb writer and her blending of magical-realist elements are innovative, erudite and risk-taking. I could not help but admire these stories – each and every one.There are some, of course, that particularly shine. Lieserl, an epistolary story that focuses on Albert Einstein’s first daughter, is particularly well-written. It helps, though, to know the back-story of Einstein’s callous abnegation of responsibility for Liserl to truly appreciate what Ms. Fowler is accomplishing. Another strong story, The Faithful Companion at Forty, is a wickedly satirical piece about Tonto and his midlife meltdown and soul-searching about the Lone Ranger’s narcissism and disrespect (“For every day, for your ordinary life, a mask is only going to make you more obvious. There’s an element of exhibitionism in it.”)Then there are others – the title story, by far the longest, when an introspective DEA agent summons a hatchet-wielding zombie, personified in the temperance crusader Carry Nation…and then is forced to combat her with voodoo. It’s daring, experimental, ferociously intelligent and, at times, downright hallucinatory. Then there’s The Elizabeth Complex, a clinical-study-of-sorts, integrating three Elizabeths into one: Queen Elizabeth, Elizabeth Taylor and Lizzie Borden.So – Carry Nation, Queen Elizabeth, Tonto, Albert Einstein, Mrs. Gulliver, a Japanese Christ-like messiah – all of them and more in a collection that shimmers with craft, inventiveness and more than a touch of outrageousness. If I were a professional critic, that’s the recipe for a 5-star read. But I’m not, and reading is subjective. The magical and sci-fi elements made me gasp in admiration, but I can’t say that it got inside my heart. It’s sort of like standing in an elegant window and seeing a totally original dress…all the time knowing that it would be perfect for someone else, but it’s not really “speaking” to you. The fault, I’m afraid, is in this reader, not in the author.

After reading Circling The Sun, I am sure of it.Here she takes on the lesser known character in the Karen Blixen-Denys Fitch Hatton-Beryl Markham triangle. Thanks to the book and movie Out of Africa, Karen and Denys’s love affair became widely known. What was less known is that he equally loved Beryl, the self-sufficient and wild-spirited daughter of a failed racehorse trainer.“Africa is the cure, then, the opposite of being boxed in. Has it ever failed you?” she asks Denys Fitch Hatton. His answer: “Never. It’s always new. It always seems to be reinventing itself, doesn’t it?”Indeed, Africa does continually reinvent itself as does Beryl herself. Within these pages, we see her shift shapes from a daring young wild child to the youngest horse trainer (and one of the few female trainers) ever licensed, to the wife of a wealthy and well-positioned man, to the charmer of royalty to the aviator of a solo flight across the Atlantic. Whew! That’s more reinventions than the vast majority of individuals ever experience in a lifetime.And yet. And yet. As Janis Joplin famously sang, “Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose.” At one pivotal soiree, one of the characters says, “It’s all just a little empty…I don’t understand that kind of sport.” Liberated from conventions and propriety, Beryl is untamable and often unlikable. The one constant is her self-absorption (e.g., her friendship with Karen Blixen and her betrayal of that friendship to pursue an affair with Fitch Haddon. Or her several marriages of convenience while loving the unattainable Denys.) Self-absorbed people can often be fun to be around…until they aren’t anymore.Since the story is told in the first person, there is sometimes a lack of insight in her telling – never more so than when Beryl marries Mansfield Markham. Almost overnight, her third husband shifts from adoration to frustration and disgust. Over and over, men seemed to fall for her quickly and just as quickly, burn out. Paula McLain writes beautifully and Africa comes alive under her craftsmanship. It was easy to close my eyes and believe I was right there in the “Great Gatsby” era of Kenya. But I eventually began to feel the same way I do at a party when I meet an intriguing yet ultimately self-absorbed person: eager to make my break....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"May 19, 2015","May 24, 2015","May 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23995231-circling-the-sun

We do know this: an unnamed man – called Claimant – awakes in a place called “Gentlest Village”, where he is isolated with a woman called “Examiner”, whose sole mission is to teach him about the fundamentals of living. Eventually, both take on false names as he learns to “engage with the cacophony of objects.” They then move on to the next village in the chain, a village that’s remarkably similar yet just a bit different…and the process begins again.The prose itself mimics the progression of the story. For the first 158 pages, the content is deceptively spare and very exacting, with ample white space. Then everything changes suddenly in the chapter entitled “A Place You Go Last” – 50 pages of dense, unbroken type in a breathless and heady style, reaching a crescendo. It almost reads like a musical composition-of-sorts.So what is it all about? Certainly, it’s about the nature of self and identity and our place in the flow of life. It’s also about memory: “We think of memory as a redeeming thing. We built monuments that appear to be monuments to this person or that person or this struggle or that, but really, do you know what they are? They are monuments to memory itself.” Who are we, indeed, without memory or a known past? When the Claimant says, “..I think we are all alike,” his Examiner answers, “We may be. But feeling we might be – that is what is most important.”Does it all succeed? My answer is “yes.” And “no.” By using the criterion from my first paragraph, it DOES succeed. The book is thoughtfully written and downright haunting; it does help us readers “to be human”. The dense type section does not bring with it the payoff I was hoping for, which was simply this: who was the Claimant before (hints are given, but not nearly enough to satisfy me as a reader).

The book beautifully explores the question of identity and how to disappear in clear sight and morph seamlessly from self to self when the REAL self is shattered.Vendela Vida takes a risk in narrating the entire book in second person, which could easily become wearisome. Yet it doesn’t. The “you” voice creates an intimacy and sense of complicity with the reader and also amplifies the theme. We never learn the narrator’s name (only her false names) and so she could be anyone…even you.Our unnamed narrator arrives in Casablanca, fleeing from something emotionally painful, and within the first few pages, we learn that her backpack has been stolen. The backpack included everything that spoke to who she is: her passport, her wallet, her camera. This incident triggers a chain of events that, eventually, lead her to take a stand-in role for a famous American actress. As she dons the actress’ dresses and wigs, the symbolism is clear: the person who she once was is now gone. And once identity is given up, anything in life becomes possible.As our narrator moves away from the person she once was, the reader gets glimpses of the essence of who she is: spunky, more than a little paranoid, risk-taking and above all else, resourceful. Throughout, the book addresses an elemental question: what happens when we free ourselves from our name and past history and choose to become the creation of our own making?

Her achievements…the illustrious people she knows…her daring pursuits…mesmerize us for the few hours we’re in her company. Yet we walk away feeling as if we only know what she chooses to reveal. At the end of the day, we realize we don’t really understand much about her at all.That, in a nutshell, is how I felt about Amory Clay, the key character in William Boyd’s Sweet Caress.The story starts promisingly enough. Given a boy’s name by a father who yearned for a son, Amory quickly reveals herself to not fit into the mold of the typical “wife-and-mother” track. As an exceptional photographer, her story is often focused on the events of the century: the excesses of pre-Hitler Berlin and the rise of the Socialist party, the Blackshirt riots in London, glamorous France prior to and during WW II, Vietnam. Throughout the ups and downs of her professional career, Amory juggles lovers, a husband, children, and real-life luminaries in the publishing and photography fields.For me, the problem was that I never was privy to the introspection and, indeed, the essence of who Amory Clay really was. It is no spoiler that we know what became of her; various interspersed passages ground us in her present life in Scotland, circa 1977. William Boyd grounds us in another way too: he includes sepia photographs as a means of showcasing Amory’s photography career. (I must admit to more than a little curiosity of the source of the photos). By doing so, he taps into nostalgia and provides a faux reality that can sometimes be elusive in books.The novel soars highest at the beginning and the end. During those times, Amory Clay comes most alive as we witness the troubled relationship she holds with one integral family member and then another. The complexity and pluckiness of the character really shines during these times. But when the book turns its lens on her life as a photographer – particularly as a war photographer in the second World War and later in Vietnam – it seems (pardon the pun) out-of-focus, more interested in the subject matter than the subject herself. In some ways, the book reminded me of another one I’ve read this year: Circling the Sun by Paula McLain – a well-researched book where history sometimes overshadows the depth of character. Now, for many readers, that’s a good thing and I’m the first to admit that reading is subjective. It may well be that, with few exceptions, sagas that span many years are not my “thing.”I loved William Boyd’s psychologically astute Waiting for Sunrise. I’ve loved some of his other books, too. I haven’t read Any Human Heart, but friends who have tell me that this one is somewhat similar. So go ahead and give it a try.

Their themes, however, are ageless: mostly flawed men at their middle point of life who, for have reached crisis points in their relationships and indeed, in their very souls.Set primarily in France and Belgium, some are more compelling than others. In the eponymous story (slightly retitled: The All Saints’ Day Lovers), the timing itself is fortuitous; a night when the curtain that separated this world from the other was torn.” As the narrator’s marriage teeters, he is compelled to spend the night with a grieving widow, taking her dead husband’s place and even wearing his pajamas. “Nobody wants nights like these,” he later says. But there’s a suggestion that we’re all together…alone.In another, At The Café of the Republique, the narrator – a man losing his anonymity as a potentially cancerous growth takes over his neck – uses his struggle to convince his abandoned wife to get together one more time to visit his estranged father. We witness the push-pull of his desire for two mutually exclusive goals.The shortest and most unusual of the collection – The Return – is the only story which pairs two sisters, one of whom killed the other’s fiancée (as well as her chance for future happiness) for love of a house. We follow the jailed sister, devoid of emotion, until we learn the very unusual revenge her sister has wrought.I am a fan of Juan Gabriel Vasquez; his novel “Sound of All Things Falling” is magnificent. And although is craftsmanship is in full display here, I couldn’t help but feel distanced. The somberness – the similarity of narrators living in the twilight of their relationships and the pessimism of their condition – seemed too unremittingly dark.

Perhaps the most famous wizard of all – the Wizard of Oz – famously said, “I know I have a heart because I feel it breaking.”Well, my heart was breaking the entire time I was reading this haunting book. Elijah, a Nigerian boy, believes he is possessed of a different kind of wizard – the receptor of an evil power that lives within him. Wrested from his mentally ill mother, Elijah is cast into a variety of foster homes before finding his “forever” home with Obi, a man who shares Elijah’s Nigerian heritage, and his Caucasian wife Nikki who is eager for motherhood. Both Obi and Nikki have chosen to give back in their professions although having a birth child has eluded them. They know that Elijah has been traumatized and needs special care and attention, and their hearts are big enough to accept the challenge. But they are not adequately prepared for just how wrenching these challenges become.Christie Watson does not shy from painful issues: child torture, pernicious “faith”, alien belief systems, the difficulty of rehabilitating a loving child who believes he’s at fault. The characters – particularly Elijah himself – are totally believable and the narrative builds a momentum that makes it unputdownable.That being said, this is not a perfect book. The narrative alternates between Nikki and Obi’s story and Deborah (the birth mother’s) story. Deborah’s chapters should have been written in first person; I did not totally believe her voice and from time to time, she seemed to be channeling the author itself in educating the reader on Nigerian ways. The foreshadowing at the end became quite transparent and leading. From time to time, I could tell precisely what Christie Watson wanted me to take away from certain passages.That being said, I read the first 150 pages at one clip, unable to tear my eyes from the page. And far more than once, I wanted to reach into the book and comfort this little boy who wanted nothing but to be loved. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 11, 2015","May 12, 2015","May 11, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17924407-where-women-are-kings

White? Certainly T.H. White is a brilliant author, but Arthurian legend The Once and Future King is not the kind of book I gravitate to. So why, then, am I so sure that H is for Hawk will not only land on my list of the best books I read this year, but also take its place as one of the finest contemporary books I’ve read, period?For me, the answer is that the finest books have always taught us what it means to be human. In H is for Hawk, Helen Macdonald discovers that “you feel more human once you have known, even in your imagination, what it means to be not.”But let me backtrack. Helen Macdonald – a naturalist, historian, poet, illustrator – enjoys a very close relationship with her photographer father, who dies prematurely and unexpectedly in 2007. Engulfed by grief, she retreats from the world, taking on a monumental task: training a goshawk, where she is compelled to spend every waking second in a “delicate, reflexive dance of manners.” Here is her description of her goshawk, named Mabel: “The hawk’s wings, barred and beating, the sharp fingers of her dark-tipped primaries cutting the air, her feathers raised like the scattered quills of a fretful porpentine. Two enormous eyes. My heart jumps sideways. She is a conjuring trick. A reptile. A fallen angel.”Indeed, the polymath that Helen Macdonald is – an observant naturalist combined with a lyrical poet – pervade this description and many others. Gradually, Ms. Macdonald colors in the personality of Mabel without ever depriving her of her natural savagery. Take this: “Hunting with the hawk took me to the very edge of being human. Then it took me past that place to somewhere I wasn’t human at all. The hawk in flight, me running after her, the land and the air a pattern of deep and curving detail, sufficient to block out anything like the past or the future, so that the only thing that mattered were the next thirty seconds.”This alone would propel H is for Hawk to the very top of my list. But there’s more. Ms. Macdonald also weaves in “The Goshawk” by T.H. White, a man who is revealed to be a damaged outcast, and a secret sadist who is consistently fighting his basest instincts. Both T.H. White and Helen Macdonald fight demons – his are abuse and his gender orientation; hers is her oppressive grief. Yet a hawk helps each of them take wing. Helen Macdonald performs a magical feat, immersing the reader in a claustrophobic location where nothing exists but the reader, the author, and the hawk. Often, I found myself near tears without quite knowing why. The journey of Helen and the hawk – solitary, self-possessed, free from human emotion, untouched by loss – is one that will remain with me for a long time....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"May 08, 2015","May 11, 2015","May 08, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18803640-h-is-for-hawk

But is she? OThe title of this book – The Life and Death of Sophie Stark – implies that Sophie is the main focus of this nuanced and engrossing book. But is she? Or is the key focus really about those whose Sophie’s life has touched – her love interest, brother, husband, producer and others – and how this accomplished avant-garde filmmaker revealed them for who they really are?I would argue that the latter interpretation makes the most sense, and here, to me, lies the brilliance of the book. We learn about Sophie through a chorus of voices who confess their impressions of Sophie. Sophie herself never speaks; she remains a cipher, someone whose reality is only defined by others.We know this: she is quirky, enormously talented, straightforward, lost, and totally committed to honesty in her art. Even her name is not her own; it is taken from a photo she particularly admired. The voices that describe her are often indistinguishable; I believe, with reason. Although we learn a little more about Sophie from each one, the portrait of Sophie that emerges remains – in many ways – constant. In the most important way, Sophie is defined by the stories others tell of her. As Sophie herself says (as related by one narrator): What is famous? “It’s like having everyone mispronounce your name every day…And after a while, you start to wonder if you even have a name. Are you even a person? Do you even exist?”Great insight, but far more intriguing is how the interactions with Sophie become transformative. Sophie represents “truth” – that nagging feeling that there is something deep within you that is holding you back that you haven’t addressed. Each narrator is damaged in his or her own way, and each one uses Sophie, as a catalyst of sorts, to become more authentic or to overcome an obstacle that stands in the way. “Sometimes the sick part of me just seems like the truest part,” one narrator admits to Sophie.

Julia, the central character of The Unknown Bridesmaid is, indeed unknown: to her family, to us readers, and most of all, to herself.When we first meet her, Julia is invited to be a young bridesmaid at her beautiful cousin Iris’s wedding. Quickly, we see her in midlife; Julia has grown to become a therapist (and eventually, a magistrate) who is responsible for evaluating girls. We meet these girls, one after another, each troubled, each on the precipice of veering off in the wrong direction in life. Yet, as we soon discover, each of these girls provides a mirror-of-sorts to Julia herself. “She could have been any one of a number of women who had appeared before the bench she sat upon.”We learn that Julia has been the catalyst through which bad things have happened to Iris and her family. But questions arise: is Julia simply beating herself up or does she truly deserve blame? Is she the victim or is she the resentful perpetrator who is consumed by envy and resentment? Is she a trustworthy narrator or is she the ultimate unreliable narrator? In short, what can we believe about Julia?An expert in lies, Julia reflects, “There would always be some twist, some wild piece of invention, which she hadn’t thought of.” But again, are the lies a result of self-protection or is Julia a borderline personality? With every turn, with every chapter, we gain intimate glimpses of Julia, yet we’re never entirely sure whether any of these glimpses are true.For readers who demand closure, they won’t find it in this book. The very point of the book is that Julia is unknown, and Margaret Forster keeps us mesmerized and on edge, right to the last sentence. We might never know Julia, but she will be very hard to forget.

It’s a theme that’s been used over and over again: Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice, The Outlaws of Sherwood, and Laird Hunt’s recent Neverhome, to name just a few.It’s a testimony to my high regard for Carolina De Robertis that I still very much wanted to read Gods of Tango, where a young woman named Leda takes on a male identity to be able to perform the tango in 1913 Buenos Aires. The mythological Leda was admired by Zeus, who seduced her in the guise of a swan. Here, too, guides and seduction play prominently. Ms. De Robertis handles the theme extraordinarily well. Leda, who hails from rural Italy, married her cousin Dante by proxy and embarks on a journey to Buenos Aires to begin a new life with him. But upon arrival, she learns that her husband has just been killed at a protest rally. Going back home is not an option for her; she views it as a dead end. So, when an opportunity to pursue her great love for the tango presents itself, Leda usurps Dante’s name, dresses in his clothes, and lives a false – yet rewarding – life as a key member in a band that is committed to refining tango.The author anticipates her reader’s disbelief and answers the key questions of grooming, toileting, joining in group excursions to brothels and more, all in women’s guise. It’s the fluidity of gender identity that most interests Ms. De Robertis. When does the gap begin to close between “inside and outside, self and disguise, truth and pretense?” How does one discover her authentic self and joyfully embrace “the bright jagged thing you really are”? Leda/Dante journeys to discover the answers, and the reader – along for the journey – discovers much about the tango, born in the brothels and cabarets and (like Dante herself), traveling to legitimacy. There are a couple of missteps. A prominent backstory concerning Leda’s sister/cousin Cora never quite fulfills all its mystique. The analogies of the tango (“music as lover”) from time to time seem overdone. Yet all in all, this is a compelling novel from an author who has proven herself to be an outstanding storyteller.

It demands a great deal of self-exposure and vulnerability from the writer without crossing the line into pathos and navel-gazing. It must, I believe, expose the author’s humanity while retaining his core essence.Etgar Keret is a powerful writer. I was most impressed with his short-story collection, a feat of imagination titled Suddenly, A Knock on the Door. I’ve heard him speak in person and was charmed by his honesty, wryness, and authenticity despite so much absurdity in the world. Put another way, I instinctively liked Etgar Keret and sensed he was the genuine article. I wanted to find out more.What I find in The Seven Good Years is reason to once again respect Etgar Keret’s writing. The bizarre and sometimes satirical humor is on full display: his son Lev, who makes his debut in the midst of one more senseless terrorist attack, a lamented sister who becomes Hasidic, an irrepressible father who fights cancer, a number of frequented writer workshops and readings. There are funny vignettes of Etgar Keret dodging a telemarketer who is determined to grab his attention, an unsettling talk with other parents about their toddlers eventual military service, and the befriending of cabbies with bursting bladders. There is a sweetness of sorts in Etgar Keret’s worldview, a touch of the inane, and a generous look at the foibles of family, companion writers, passer-bys in life, and himself. What there isn’t a whole lot of is exposure. This is a memoir that could pass as fictional vignettes. I never get a deep sense of the man behind the words and often felt I was skimming the surface.I contrast this memoir to Little Failure by Gary Shteyngart – another writer who appreciates and captures a sense of the absurd. Mr. Shteyngart achieved that rare balancing act: his memoir retained the humor that permeated his fiction while also being poignant and unflinchingly honest. When I closed the book, I had a sense of knowing the author, flaws and all. With Mr. Keret’s memoir, there are genuinely poignant and understated moments (for instance, a time when his young son Lev refuses to take shelter during an air-raid until Etgar Keret and his wife create a game of “Pastrami Sandwich”, in which they’re the bread and he lies between them), but I ended up wanting more meat, less bread....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Apr 22, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23399025-the-seven-good-years

A poet herself, Ms. Urquhart’s tale of sibling rivalry and Irish legacy is exquisitely and lyrically written, a homage to southwest Ireland embodied in her key character, Kieran.Then why did I somehow not feel completely satisfied with The Night Stages, despite an abundance of admiration for it? I suspect the answer lies largely in the aloofness of the characters that often come across as glorious but inert, not unlike the personages who are frozen within Kenneth Lochhead’s much-lauded mural, Flight and its Allegories, displayed in Gander, Newfoundland’s airport lounge.Flight and inertia are indeed omnipresent throughout this book. It interweaves several characters, connected only by tenuous threads: world war aviator Vi Milstead Warren (the inspiration for her character Tam), the aforementioned famous Canadian artist Kenneth Lochhead, the insightful Irish poet Michael Kirby, and two fictional brothers, the meteorologist Niall and has tantrum-plagued and estranged brother, Kieran.Considering Kiernan is one of the few completely-imagined characters, it is amazing how he lifts up and transforms the narrative. He is bigger than life, as big as Ireland itself: searching for home, place and self, Trapped in his loneliness and eager to prove himself as a bicyclist and to feel “whole” again, Kiernan dominates his pages and at the start, calls to mind another fictional character: Healthcliff of Wuthering Heights.But not unlike another lyrical writer who tackles Irish themes, Colm McCann in his latest novel Transatlantic, Jane Urquhart weaves in three stories: that of Kiernan, that of Tam the aviator who is engaged in a long love affair with an emotionally remote Niall, and lastly, the painter Kenneth Lochhead, whose mural Tam views when her plane is grounded in Gander due to fog. While the other two are fascinating characters, particularly since they’re based on real-life counterparts, they remain rather static. (For example, I never particularly understood or felt the motivation for Tam – an adventurous risk-taker – placing her life on hold for a man who is emotionally and legally incapable of giving her much more than physical passion.) Kenneth Lochhead’s sections, while beautifully rendered, seem extrinsic to the narrative for a good portion of the novel.Without spoilers, I will say that the last 25% of the book more than fulfills its promise, revealing the inspiration behind the book’s title, and highlighting universal themes that weave in all narratives and reveal a bigger picture. To me, this final stretch was that most satisfying of reads, when the real world goes away and the reader feels “at one” with the printed page.

But I’d be hard put to choose from among 17 stories (including some short-shorts inspired by Rebecca Makkai’s own colorful family history.

I’ll leave it right there so that others can discover the fun twists.Then there’s Painted Ship, Painted Ocean; an assistant professor kills the proverbial albatross – literally – discovering to her dismay that she’s known all along that “one little thing gone wrong in her world could unravel absolutely everything else.’ There’s also “The Miracle Years of Little Fork” – a naïve Reverend tries to be useful in a small town where an elephant keels over during the final circus performance and dies of heatstroke. Like in Painted Ship, Painted Ocean, this one event starts a chain reaction, eventually creating a crisis in faith. The Reverend muses, “This was the thing about a crack in faith, he knew, the way one small fissure could spread and crumble the whole thing into a pile of rocks…”There is irreverence here, flights of imagination, an ample dose of intelligent wit, and a marvel at how little things can quickly become big things or cause major insights. In “The Worst You’ll Ever Feel”, a young boy suddenly gains crystal-clear insight about his dad’s flight to the U.S. when a famous Romanian violinist plays a concert in their home after years of incarceration. In “Good Saint Anthony Come Around”, set at the height of the AIDS crisis, one gay man reflects on another man who always had good fortune when “my only magic was in survival.”To say I’m blown away with this collection is an understatement.

This is the core theme of The Sunlit Night, in which two broken and unmoored individuals – 21-year-old Frances and 17-year-old Yasha – find comfort in each other at the “top of the world” above the Arctic Circle in Norway.Rebecca Dinerstein spent significant time in Norway and it shows. The barren and isolated Arctic landscape mirrors the starkness of Frances and Yasha’s internal selves and provides a backdrop for them to infuse authentic meaning into their lives. Frances has arrived there from NYC to serve as an apprentice to an up-and-coming Norwegian artist who is becoming known for his yellow murals after leaving her boyfriend and finding out about her parents’ impending divorce. Yasha goes there to bury his beloved father Vassily, the owner of a NY bakery, who expressed a wish to be buried “on top of the world”; he has long been estranged from his mother.“It was as if they were all waking up, waking up their bodies, each still grappling with a question from a dream,” Ms. Dinerstein writes. In this land of isolation where the sun never sets, the two come together to realize gain an understanding that even in times of darkness (death, loss, abandonment), there is always light that shines through. At the same time, they learn to redefine what the word “home” means when that concept is challenged.The novel is peopled with eccentric and whimsical characters, most of whom fade into the backdrop (with the except of their respective parents). At times, the backstories seem a little derivative; as readers, these New York Jewish characters have been encountered in various iterations and their virtual yet metaphorical journey has also been witnessed in many books such as Richard Wagamese’s excellent Medicine Walk.Still, there’s something that tugs at the heart in getting to know Frances and Yasha and the haunting landscape continues to mesmerize.

Within these chapters, characters ebb and flow like the ocean itself, plunging in head first to reveal themselves to the reader and then receding to safe (or not so safe) shore.Indeed, the structure of the book follows this ebb and flow, starting in current times, withdrawing to 1876, advancing to a horrific dystopian future in 2143, introducing different “players” almost willy-nilly. If you enjoy linear books, this is not a novel for you. However, if you have a high tolerance for books that flow seamlessly back and forth before revealing all their secrets, you’re going to love this one.Ms. Taylor writes, “The Shore is flat as a fried egg; on a clear day from one upstairs porch it feels like you can see into tomorrow, and usually you can just about see the smart smear that is Chincoteague Island off to the northeast. We are one of three islands, off the coast of Virginia and just south of Maryland, trailing out into the Atlantic Ocean like someone’s dripped paint.”The island comes alive under Ms. Taylor’s deft hand: the smell of the salt water, the crabs crawling up the shore, the noxious smell of Perdue chicken from the killing factory. All the while, the author integrates different styles and tenses: from historical to suspenseful, from southern-gothic to dystopian, from fantastical to conventional. There’s also a wisp of feminism philosophy contained within: many of these woman are fighting for survival and self-actualization and in one case and a few have special skills such as herb doctoring and controlling the weather. As the novel progresses, clues are dropped how all these stories link and a more universal theme is introduced.One of the reasons I chose The Shore is that it was compared to David Mitchell and Jennifer Egan’s works. I’m a fan of both. However, I did not really see the connection to either, except for the more experimental form of storytelling. If I had to compare to another author, it would be Flannery O’Connor with a touch of Alice Hoffman. Sara Taylor knows how to tell a story, to rev up the reader’s interest, and importantly, she knows how to sock the reader right between the eyes with some of her story endings. It’s an imaginative novel, inventive, creative, and beautifully controlled and paced by the author. By the third or fourth chapter, I was willing to suspend belief and let Sara Taylor take me anywhere she chose to go....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Mar 24, 2015","Mar 29, 2015","Mar 24, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23128320-the-shore

One of her friends, is stunningly beautiful – a Jennifer Lopez clone. Another, the more fortunate Maria, is born with a harelip and as a result, is able to walk around in relative safety.Ladydi – named for Princess Diana, because her mother loved any woman to whom a man had been unfaithful, recalls THIS as her first memory: “Now we make you ugly, my mother said. She whistled. Her mouth was so close she sprayed my neck with her white-spit. I could smell beer. In the mirror I watched her move the piece of charcoal across my face. It’s a nasty life, she whispered.”In deceptively childlike, yet often lyrical, prose, Ms. Clement narrates Ladydi’s harrowing young life: blackening her face and cutting her hair so she would not look attractive, hiding in holes if she hears drug traffickers approaching, diving for safety when army helicopters arrive, spraying the poisonous Paraquat everywhere except for the poppy fields that are the key to millions of dollars in drugs. Girls are worth so very little in Guerrero: “A missing woman is just another leaf that goes down the gutter in a rainstorm,” Ladydi’s mother says.The trajectory of Ladydi’s life could easily be overly dramatized. But Jennifer Clement does not get overly manipulative or indulgent. The result is a book that sings with the ring of truth and shines a spotlight on the mistreatment of girls and women without the spotlight ever becoming too glaring. I felt that the first half of the book, in particular, was breathtaking in its descriptions. And it affirmed my belief that the invisible and damaged people who live in our midst often deserve our compassion.

He’s everyone’s idea of a hero: saving animal lives, keeping company with the local veterinarian and acting as dad to her young son, and living a principled life on his own terms.But through a series of flashbacks, we discover that Bill is not all he seems. He’s on the run from a less-than-pristine past, where he and his best friend, Rick, got into all kinds of trouble. Rick did his time in the Big House; Bill fled and recreated himself in Idaho. And the questions at the core of this novel are: what price survival? What are the moral laws that govern our lives?It’s easy enough to manipulate sympathy by mining the human/animal relationship. And very occasionally, Christian Kiefer crosses that line. (One example is Bill’s musings about the animals: “They had saved him and he would do the same for them.” We see him tending the blind grizzly Majer, feeding him marshmallows and earning his trust…or the wild injured wolf, Zeke, whose confidence is harder to earn. We get it: there is a very real connection between human and animal and we are never more in tune with ourselves than when we connect with our animal nature. And deep down, we know where this story is heading.Or do we? Christian Kiefer raises issues that, days later, I am still thinking about. What makes a person a “good person” – when he “cares for his people” or when he does his best to shed an ugly past and move on? What does freedom really mean? Is it better to be alive and caged or enjoy total freewill with the probability that death is around the corner? Mr. Kiefer writes, “The universe held its workings in secret and a man could claim nothing from that void and instead would need to design in that obscure and private place that is his heart the laws that would govern his life.”I recognize some of the minor flaws in this book. But still, I found it heartbreaking and shattering.

What wI Am Radar reminds me of a big, frisky St. Bernard puppy who wants to be loved and who ends up making you laugh with delight at all its tricks. What words would I use to describe the novel? Audacious, swaggering, inimitable, bold, ambitious…well, you get the drift.Despite over 650 pages, it’s remarkably easy to read. The prose is confident and accessible, and the pages are rife with diagrams, newspaper snippets and photos (reminding me just a tad of Marisha Pessl’s Night Film, both in scope and in presentation). And the opening – the birth of Radar Radmanovic, an ebony-black young boy born of two lily-white parents at the height of a New Jersey blackout – gently calls to mind John Irving’s The World According to Garp.The plot is – to put it mildly – convoluted. Radar’s mother Charlene is obsessed with finding an answer to her son’s blackness, eventually traveling to Norway to meet with some avant-garde scientists, studying altered skin pigmentation. They’re very eager to test out their electrical experiments on him; the results end up opening up a new set of challenges for Radar.Interspersed with this rather straightforward story, Reif Larsen weaves others: the tale of the Danilovic brothers during the Bosnian war, a look at Cambodian-born physicist Raksmey Raksmey and his adoptive father who believes “all children are experiments.” And interspersed with THAT are studies of performance art – particularly puppetry drama in war zones, quantum physics, father/son dynamics, the definition and costs of liberty and freedom and a whole lot more…including whether puppets are freer than the humans who manipulate them. The book is so brash and so creatively engineered that it can be easy to forgive its excesses. And there ARE excesses: too much bloat (I could definitely see places where an editor’s firm hand would have been welcome), and times when I felt too distanced from the key character – Radar – because of the 100 pages or so that took me away from the key story. The descriptions of the enigmatic Kirkenesferda – artists and political operatives staging interventions and needing Radar to be part of them – can, at times, plunge the reader (as well as Radar) into the dark.About half way through, I became a little exhausted with everything going on and put the book down to read another. But then I felt compelled to go back to it and take up where I left off.

There has been pain, yes, but also incandescent moments and adventures that the vast majority of people never get to experience. And Alexandra Fuller captures it all so well that I’m left wondering how it is that I’ve never read anything by her before.“Africa has been my primarily relationship for most of my life, defining, sustaining, and unequivocal in a way that no human relationship had ever been…,” Ms. Fuller writes. When she leaves it, she feels that an essential connection with this earth has become forever detached “ like a soulless body or a heartless lover.”In loving yet incredibly perceptive prose, Ms. Fuller showcases growing up in a chaotic and often fatalistic home. (She says of her parents: “Together they had lost three children, a war, a few farms, and for a while my mother had seriously lost her mind.”) She is mesmerized by Charlie Ross, an American who has launched a rafting and canoe company in Zambia, and who promises to be every bit as adventurous and risk-taking as she is.Yet the two of them – both of come from highly unorthodox and complicated families – have a mismatched view of the world. His is shaped by American pragmatism and hers is honed by the unpredictability of life. The author writes, “We had glommed onto one another in happy unconscious relief, as if the inherited and accumulated wounds in each of us had recognized their matches, their balms, and their ends.” Yet neither of them is capable of reaching beyond themselves to truly reach the other.This is a brutally honest memoir and a courageous one; Alexandra Fuller does not cast blame as her marriage dissipates and owns her own contribution to the marriage’s dissolution. It’s a book interspersed with poignancy and wit, with perception and intelligence, and the courage of self-examination.

Once begun, it is impossible to wrench oneself away from the extraordinary power of a this narrative of a 40-ish woman who navigates Elizabeth Kubler Ross’s four stage of grief (denial, anger, depression and acceptance).In a clear and non-pitying tone, Olga relates this: “One April afternoon, right after lunch, my husband announced that he wanted to leave me. He did it while we were clearing the table; the children were quarreling as usual in the next room, the dog was dreaming, growling beside the radiator…Then he assumed the blame for everything that was happening and closed the front door carefully behind him, leaving me turned to stone beside the sink.”Ms. Ferrante is unsparing in her portrait of Olga, without turning this into a maudlin tale or a “poor pity me, the victim” type of story. First of all, the prose is precise and exquisite (examples: Olga’s husband blew away the past “as if it were a nasty insect that has landed on your hand.” Or this: “In those long hours I was the sentinel of grief, keeping watch along with a crowd of dead words.” Or this: “Starting at a certain point, the future is only a need to live in the past. To immediately redo the grammatical tenses.”)As Olga falls into the void – the “absence of sense” – she descends into a frenzy of self-loathing and inertia. It take a strong stomach to read about her attempt to seduce a neighbor in a near-parody of what “making love” is really all about. During the end of that passage, it becomes clear that Olga’s “days of abandonment” are not caused by her husband Mario’s departure; rather, they are caused by her abandonment of herself. While she reaches rock bottom, she is also responsible for her young son and daughter and the innocent dog with “good dog eyes”, Otto. One feels their sense of confusion and betrayal as well – and commiserates.I have never read Elena Ferrante before and have rarely read a book with such raw honesty and such ferocious power. I am, fortunately, happily married but anyone who has ever suffered feelings of betrayal (and all of us do, at some point in our lives, through husbands, family members, friends) will gasp in shock at the authenticity of Days of Abandonment.

The novel begins with the tragic sinking of the steamship Eastland – so close to shore – killing 844 Western Electric employees and setting a fortuitous fiction meeting into motion (Benny Lehrman, a Jewish jazz player and Pearl Chimbrova, who lost three brothers that day.)It’s obvious that this author has done her homework and it’s fun to read about the nigthclubs – Slim Betty, The Charleston, the Lincoln Gardens, the Red Rooster – and Jazz Palace (“more a listening kind of place with a gambling room off to the side.”) Famous Chicago personages – most notably, Alphonse (Al) Capone – make appearances and there are references to Leopold and Loeb, Louis Armstrong and others who have long been a famous (or in some cases, infamous) part of Chicago’s tapestry.The sense of time and place is worth the read. Mary Morris gets so much right: the Chicago geography and grittiness, the personages, the ambiance (“of crumbling plaster and mildew, of cat piss and back-alley trash, of stale popcorn and spilled ginger ale”) and most of all, the sounds of a bygone era. Less successful is the fictional story. Much of it is derivative: Napoleon Hill, a black jazz trumpeter whose actions are often too predictable for readers and the aforementioned Benny with his head in the clouds who is compelled to leave his life as a delivery boy and sit in with the jazz group players. We learn about the mob ownership of the speak-easies and the musicians (“It’s just like slavery,” says Nathaniel.” I’m not free.”)The history is all woven in – prohibition, mob rule, machine guns, the stock market crash – coinciding with the rise and fall of live time jazz.

It had everything I love most in literary fiction: strong characters, fluid and luminous prosFor the first 150 pages, I was under this book’s thrall. It had everything I love most in literary fiction: strong characters, fluid and luminous prose, thoughtful narrative, intelligent themes and stunning descriptions of Italy for good measure.In fact, if the book had continued in that vein, it would have quickly become one of my favorites. But then the character makes an uncharacteristic decision. It’s impossible to write about without spoilers, so here it is: YOUR SPOILER ALERT.Frances Godwin (the last name gives you a big clue where this is going) is a high school Latin teacher who marries Paul, her professor with whom she has had an affair. Together, they build a life that revolves around erudite pursuits that range from a passion for ancient studies to classic music and Shakespearean theater. Their daughter Stella, an aspiring poet, is the apple that DOES fall far from the tree: after a series of bad relationships, she ends up with a real hum-dinger, a former felon named Jimmy who is a menace to all those around him – including Stella and her parents. After Paul dies, the abuse on Stella escalates and Frances decides to take matters into her own hands and murder Jimmy. She succeeds.Up until this point, I was reading breathlessly, devouring 150 pages at one sitting. But Jimmy’s murder was a stretch for me. Jimmy is about as one-dimensional as I’ve ever seen in a character: surly and predatory without redeeming qualities. And Stella? I know little about her (and Frances’ relationship with her) prior to her pairing with Jimmy. I do know I had a visceral reaction to her actions, which included not even attending her father’s funeral. With little sympathy or empathy for Stella, it’s hard for me to truly feel for Frances’s choice.But even if I did empathize: Frances had other options available to her. Stella’s close friend Ruthy knows of thugs who will gladly “deliver a message” to Jimmy that he won’t soon forget. Let’s face it, it’s HARD for the vast majority of us to commit murder, even if it’s justified. It’s even harder for someone raised as a Catholic who knows the act will cause eternal damnation. Nothing about Frances’s background convinced me that she was capable of the act. Yet, this book – this spiritual autobiography was not devoid of surprises. As Mr. Hellenga writes, “You can’t quite see everything from where you’re standing. You see a shape, you see ups and downs, conversions, turning points, reversals. But then you keep on living, you keep on driving from one bridge to the next, and every time you look down on your life, you see a different shape.” The same could be said for fictional lives. The last third of the book focuses mainly on one important question: does the universe care, in some way, about our behavior? Is there something in the center; is there meaning? Does it even matter if one lowlife is swept from the world’s tableau?Frances Godwin’s wrestling with these essential questions is nothing short of masterful. “How many times”, she muses, “that everything in my life has been leading up to this moment or that moment only to realize, a minute later, that this is always the case, that every moment of your life is leading up to where you are now.”So here’s my dilemma. In many ways, I loved this book – its risk-taking narrative, its fearlessness in taking on such existential questions, its sheer beauty of prose. Yet – for me – there’s a hole in the middle of it (would Frances really commit murder?) Typically, I would 4-star this book but I know that it will linger with me a long time. And since ratings ARE subjective, I’m giving it 5 stars. I confess, there are times I wish there was NOT a rating system!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 26, 2015",Mar 2015,"Feb 26, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18594395-the-confessions-of-frances-godwin

In spare, unadorned yet poignant language, he gets right to the heart of things, capturing succinctly what makes us feel most human.This last novella-sized work, posted posthumously and written just months before his death of lung cancer at age 71, is particularly affecting. In other hands, this narrative might have been maudlin: a septuagenarian widow, Addie Moore, reaches out to her neighbor, widower Louis Waters, with a simple request: to lie together in bed, companionably, and talk in the dark to ward off the loneliness. Gradually, their lives are laid bare to each other – their dreams and disappointments, their hopes and compromises, and everything that composes the tapestry of an individual life.When Addie’s young grandson, Jamie, comes to stay with Addie temporarily, heir relationship both deepens and is tested. I’ll say no more about the plot; it enfolds so naturally, beautifully and yet heartbreakingly that each reader must come to it on his or her own.I will say this: Kent Haruf had a way of expressing what is true and what is important. Addie says, “I just want to live simply and pay attention to what’s happening each day;. And come sleep with you at night.” And at another point: “I do love this physical world. I love this physical life with you. And the air and the country. The backyard, the gravel in the back alley. The grass. The cool nights. Lying in bed talking with you in the dark.”The only thing to say to that is a gentle “amen.” I am so sad that Kent Haruf’s voice is now stilled but happy that he left his readers one last magnificent gift....more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,"Feb 23, 2015","Feb 24, 2015","Feb 23, 2015",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/23568220-our-souls-at-night

Now a very talented author brings new grist to the table with one of the most astoundingly original voices I’ve had the pleasure to read.“I am a spy, a sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces,” confesses the unnamed narrator in the opening line. Indeed he is – the offshoot of an affair between a French Catholic preach and an underage rural mother, a secret agent for the Viet Cong who professes loyalty to the General (the head of the South Vietnamese National Police).But Viet Thanh Nguyen’s purpose here is not to revisit “who was right and who was wrong”, retell the battles, or provide manipulated substance for moral outrage. He focuses very much on the absurdity of it all as his character wryly and sardonically “confesses” stories of his life as he bides his time in a prison. Our narrator is at his most piercing when he uncovers the preening and pretentiousness of both American imperialists as well as the educational and Hollywood communities. A scathing look at a Hollywood movie (the narrator is a consultant) that captures the Americanized idea of the Vietnam War without ever giving any Vietnamese a speaking part is worth the entire price of the book. (Presumably the movie was Apocalypse now). “This was the first war where the losers would write history instead of the victors, courtesy of the most effective propaganda machine ever created…”And he is his most poignant when he astutely reflects on how, at the end of the day, we abuse our grand ideals: “When it came to learning the worst habits of our French masters and their American replacements, we quickly proved ourselves the best.” At the same time, we lose our sense of proportion: “I had no doubt that in the Auteur’s egomaniacal imagination he meant that his work of art, now, was more important than the three or four or six million dead who composed the real meaning of the war.”In some ways, this is an existential work and in other ways, it is precisely the opposite; a work that pulsates with a desire to form connections despite the absurdity that keeps us from doing so. Viet Thanh Nuguyen’s character aptly shows that it is, indeed, possible to hold two conflicting viewpoints and to not be tethered to either. I am quite sure that at the end of 2015, this book will be on my personal “top ten” list....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Apr 28, 2015","May 03, 2015","Feb 20, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23168277-the-sympathizer

Indeed, in both books, an elderly protagonist (in this case, Etta) toes on an unexpected lengthy and arduous pilgrimage. Etta, a woman in her early 80s who is suffering from early-sage dementia, departs from her Saskatchewan farm to view the ocean. She leaves behind Otto, a one-time soldier and loving husband, and shy Russell, who was raised as Otto’s brother and still carries a torch for her. And then there’s James, but the fewer initial expectations a reader has of James, the better.The book certainly is grounded in the real world – the sights, sounds, rhythms, the trying to remember to forget. Yet there’s something downright myth-like about the tale, from the deceptively childlike cadence of the dialogue to the Etta’s dreamy sojourn with nary but a coyote – long a symbol of the deep magic of life and creation – as her companion.To read this book as a straightforward account is, I believe, a mistake. It must be read as a fantasy with elements of magical realism…the last twilight as we let go of the fundamentals of living and enter into the unknown. With forays into the Depression and World War II, into the pockets of loneliness and fading memories, and into the longings and dreams of struggling yet noble, the tone is often poetic, although sometimes unsteady. It is no surprise to me that Emma Hooper is also a musician; I often could feel the beats and pauses as the novel progressed.

The draw for me was that this collection was purported to be about character-driven stories focusing on Filipinas from every walk of life. During the past few years, I’ve had the privilege of interacting with a number of Filipinas and wanted to know more about the culture.Much to my delight, In the Country is a confidently written – scratch that, at times, stunning written – debut novel with a writer who is primed to take her place with some of my favorites: Jhumpa Lahiri, Tobias Wolff, Francesca Marciano, Claire Vaye Watkins, and Jean Thompson (Alice Munro, of course, is in a class by herself.) There is almost an O. Henry twist in some of the stories. Most of them focus on the masks we wear, the impenetrability of who we really are – and in that, these vignettes are universal. Elegantly, Mia Alvar explores her Filipina protagonists from all angles – from rich to poor, healthy to disabled, working class to politicians, from expats living in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to those who remained “in the country.”In “The Miracle Worker”, for example, Sally is a special-education teacher who is asked to perform a miracle with her young student, a severely disabled young daughter of a wealthy mother who believes she can buy a new reality. The insights into her characters took my breath away. In another, “The Kontrabida”, a pharmacist from the east coast goes home to the Philippines with stolen sedatives to help his mother deal with a tyrannical dying father. In the process, he learns something he never suspected about his mother. In “A Contract Overseas”, a scholarship college student who worships her philandering older brother who works in Saudi Arabia creates versions of his life to keep him alive and safe. And in “The Virgin of Monte Ramon”, a disabled and shunned teenage boy learns this lesson: “Adults I had relied on to explain the world and my life for me – especially when children made that world and life so hostile – had kept the truth from me, then wrecked the fantasy that had replaced it.”These are just a few of the gems in store for readers. What is illuminated the most is how we often hide behind our stories and fantasies to survive…how reality often shifts from what we believe…how we search for a version of our authentic selves. It’s hard to believe this is Mia Alvar’s first book....more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Mar 17, 2015","Mar 22, 2015","Feb 18, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23616578-in-the-country

So the question becomes: who isBefore even opening the first page, readers know precisely what will happen in this incredible novel: Skippy will die. So the question becomes: who is Skippy and why should we care?Skippy is 14-year-old Daniel Juster, an unfortunate nickname he acquired because of his resemblance to a TV kangaroo. He has been exiled – with all the best intentions – to a pricey Catholic boarding school in Dublin (Seabrook College) while his parents sort through a tragedy-in-the-making. In the first few pages, we meet him and his best friend, an obese computer nerd named Ruprecht, and by page 5, Skippy has already expired in the midst of a doughnut-eating race…leaving behind a cryptic message written in raspberry jelly: “Tell Lori.”Most of the time, 14 year olds aren’t inherently interesting; they are often portrayed as sullen men on the cusp of adulthood, driven by their hormones – in short, stereotypes. Yet one of the rewards of Skippy Dies is Paul Murray’s spot-on and well-rounded look into the angst, joys, dreams and humiliations of this tender age. As the book meanders backwards – to Skippy’s school life before his death – and forward, to the effect of Skippy’s premature demise on those who knew him, we see a virtual train wreck about to happen, and yet are powerless to stop the trajectory. The book introduces us to Skippy and examines the precipitous events that lead to his death from many perspectives: students such as his roommate Ruptecht and the delectable love-interest Lori…Howard the Coward, a history teacher who seeks meaning without commitment…Carl, Skippy’s rival in love and a budding psychopath…Greg (the Automator), the Acting Principal who is goal-oriented to a fault, and various other teachers, priests and hangers-on.Yet Skippy Dies is far from an intricate character study. Within these pages, Paul Murray confidently interweaves many topics: quantum physics and the possibility of alternative universes, Irish folklore and mysticism, the lies of history including the forgotten tale of the all-Irish D Company and their doom at Gallipoli in World War I, diet pill drug dealing, the tyranny of eating disorders, sexual abuse of teens by priests (although credit Paul Murray for providing a twist), ethics versus pragmatism, and the effects of family dissolution and illness.All of these characters – all of these topics – are, Paul Murray suggests, a part of the big picture. He writes, “Maybe instead of strings it’s stories things are made of, an infinite number of tiny vibrating stories; once upon a time they all were part of one big giant superstory, except it got broken up into a jillion different pieces, that’s why no story on its own makes any sense, and so what you have to do in la life is try and weave it back together, my story into your story, our stories into all the other people’s we know, until you’ve got something that to God or whoever might look like a letter or even a whole word…” Read it to discover this whole word. Read it to gain insights into the lives of boys who are struggling with the juncture between faith and reason, between childhood and adulthood, between loneliness and connection. Read it for the dark comedy and the resulting tragedy. Read it to marvel at the skill of a writer who can juggle so many balls simultaneously without dropping a single one.

Now, in this companion piece, the focus is on Teddy, Ursula’s brother, and his life as an RAF Halifax pilot and under-the-radar hero.Atkinson holds the magical power to shape time to fit her story and this one moves seamlessly from Teddy’s last treacherous flights (fewer than half of RAF pilots actually survived World War II) to the 20th and 21st century, where Teddy is a husband, father, and grandfather. We get to meet his daughter Viola, who blames him for her mother’s premature departure and makes a mess out of her own life…and subsequently, the lives of her two children.But the key to this story lies in his title, which comes from Ralph Waldo Emerson: “A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams.” Wartime is, the author argues, man’s greatest fall from grace and so she walks a fine tightrope: revealing the amazing heroism and self-sacrifice of the men such as Teddy and his crew yet showcasing how (in her own words) “whether our war on savagery did not, in the end, become itself savage as we attacked the very people – the old, the young, women – that civilization is supposed to defend.” When Ursula asks Teddy, “and how do you define ‘innocence” anyway?”, attention must be paid.The postwar scenario occupies every bit as large a part as the war narrative; Viola never does understand the forces that shaped her father or the fabric of the man he became. As a result, she cannot be called innocent and her own life is often in self-defined ruins.Anyone who suspects that this book is less – well, inventive – than its predecessor will be suitably satisfied with Kate Atkinson’s sleight of hand. A God In Ruins is also the philosophical sibling of the earlier book; everything in life can change quickly – in a heartbeat – and life is little more than a single breath. That breath is particularly precarious during wartime (“All the birds who were never born, all the songs that were never sung and so can only exist in imagination.”) The bottom line (again in the author’s words) is that “War is savage. For everyone. Innocent or guilty.” It dehumanizes us and in too many cases, it takes away our story.

Go ahead and count on something?”God Help The Child, Ms. Morrison’s latest book, is no Beloved. The sheer power and nuances and poetry does not quite reach that level. But like Beloved, it unflinchingly explores the risk of feeling – counting on something – when that very act is risky.Lula Ann Bridewell (later shortened to just Bride, is the daughter of lighter-skinned parents who are shamed of their daughter’s midnight black skin (“she was so black it scared me.”) Bride carries her mother’s rejection to adulthood, where she assumes another kind of skin (all-white clothing, all the time) and takes her place as an executive at You, Girl, a trendy cosmetic company, where “black sells.”But soon everything starts unraveling. Her lover, Booker, tells her, “You are not the woman I want.” And then there’s the run-in with a woman from her past – a child molester she helped put behind bars. Most terrifying of all, more and more, Bride begins to physically resemble her former self. How will she be able to claim – and love – her authentic self?The journey toward self-acceptance is the major theme as this novel progresses. Since this is Toni Morrison – in my mind, a literary goddess – the writing is very often luminous and the issues explored (racial issues, child abuse, emotional scarring, the misplaced emphasis on physical beauty) are dealt with masterfully. I was reminded a little of Helen Oyeyemi’s Boy Snow Bird (although, of course, Ms. Morrison has her own distinct style). I might have preferred the message to be a tad more nuanced (for example, at one point, Bride meets a young girl with a black-and-white kitten. The girl asks her mother “Why is her skin so black?” “For the same reason yours is so white.” “Oh. You mean like my kitten?” “Right, born that way.”) Still, this is a worthy addition to Toni Morrison’s many wonderful works.

You can’t understand a couple, even if you’re part of it.”Indeed, we meet many couples within these pages – current couples that are happily (or begrudgingly) accommodating each other, wanna-be couples, couples from the past. Almost like the movie “Crash”, the characters we meet in these brief 20 chapters careen into each other, relaying a snippet of their life, identifying themselves to us during their brief moment on center stage. (No surprise, this center stage device, since Yasmina Reza is the playwright of Art and God of Carnage, both incredibly well-crafted plays.)There are some memorable little scenes: Robert Toscano, a journalist under deadline, argues with his wife Odile in the cheese section of the supermarket because he picked up Morbier cheese instead of Gruyere – an ordinary decision that reveals the cracks in their partnership. Vincent Zawada waits with his mother for a radiation therapy session, listening to her flirtatiously connect to another patient. Lionel and Pascaline Hutner – a loving couple who are laughed about because they insist on calling each other “my own” – suffer through a particular emotional pain when their son begins to display an unusual affliction. Helene Barneche runs into an old controlling lover who threatens to unravel what she’s built.Part of the joy of reading Happy are the Happy is encountering one of more of the speakers you’ve become acquainted with in another speaker’s narrative. The author seems to be saying that we’re all connected and ultimately, after a while “even life is an idiotic value.” In his or her own way, each of the characters safeguards secrets and somehow, some way, learns to live with the conflicts and challenges that stem from these secrets.This succinct book is written without paragraphs; each story contains a rush of words as if the character is breathlessly trying to get a story out.

In my book, he’s one of the few authors who can make history positively come alive. And his opening note held forth a big promise: “I give you now the saga of the Lusitania and the myriad forces, large and achingly small, that converged one lovely day in May 1915 to produce a tragedy of monumental scale, whose true character and import have long been obscured in the mists of history.”My first thought was: “WHAT true character and import? Everyone knows about the Lusitania – sunk by a U-2 torpedo and finally propelling America head-first into WW I.” Well, after finishing, I stand corrected. The story of the Lusitania still offers up many secrets.Unlike Mr. Larson’s former books, this one is slow opening. The focus is not an individual (as it is in Isaac’s Storm, the Devil in the White City, Thunderstruck and In The Garden of Beasts, with history as a backdrop), but squarely on the story of the Lusitania. So the first 80 pages or so set the stage: the winds of war in Europe, the background of the Lusitania and its captain, William Thomas Turner.But when the Lusitania begins its voyage? Wow! Nearly 2,000 passengers were aboard and also, 170 tons of Remington rifle ammunition, making it a clear and attractive target to the Germans. The passengers were not unaware that U-2 boats were bringing terror to the North Atlantic seas. We meet several of them throughout these pages: the ones who will live, the ones who will die. And we also catch many glimpses of the U.S. president, Woodrow Wilson, a widower who is distracted by a new (and ultimately, enduring) love affair that diverts his attention from the world stage.The book is filled with questions worth asking: why did the Admiralty not provide an escort to the Lusitania, given that the ship carried a vital cargo of ammunition and artillery shells? Why did British intelligence obsessively protect the HMS Orion and provide no protection to the Lusitania? Why did they not divert he Lusitania to the newer and safer North Channel route? And most of all, “why was the ship left on its own, with a proven killer of men and ships dead ahead in its path?” Did the British deliberately set up the Lusitania to force America’s hand to enter the war?Hanging over the story of the Lusitania is its rendezvous with destiny. Had U-2 captain Schwieger not overestimated the ship’s speed, if the Lusitania had departed precisely on time, if Capt. Turner had not made a final turn to starboard, had the torpedo failed (60 percent of torpedoes DID fail), there would not be a Lusitania story.

Out of that tragedy arose this fictionalized novel and early on, we know the ending: J. (as he is called in this book) and his partner Elena are doomed.The two of them, in their mid-30s, want to flee “the whole highbrow-anarcho-lefty businessman bullshit, that mixture of colonial, bohemian and hippie” and buy a finca (a decrepit estate) on the coast of Columbia to “enjoy life, buy a little boat for fishing, a few cows, a few chickens.” The thing is, they are woefully ill-prepared for that type of lifestyle. J. has charisma but he is too addicted to his aguadiente – presumably, tequila – and his business sense is sorely lacking. Elena is a misplaced elitist, never feeling quite “at one” with the poverty, weather woes, and recalcitrant natives of the area.We follow this tale as we would a train wreck – the knowledge of what will happen is never in doubt and for the slim length of the novel, we are right there, watching the train about to careen off the tracks. Mr. Gonazlez is a powerful writer, involving all five of our senses, placing us in the vortex of the action so that we can not only see what’s going on but smell, hear, and feel the environment. Kudos to translator Frank Wynne for his translation.The book is spare but hypnotic and visceral. As we watch this couple turn their dream into a “caricature of a caricature, a pitiful example of what human endeavor can achieve”, we are torn between cheering them on and loathing their hubris. If there is a fault in the novel, it’s in the character of Elena: she is so biting and contemptuous that it’s hard to understand why J. was attracted to her to begin with and, more problematically, why she would ever buy into J.’s vision.This Pushkin Collection book is smaller in size than a traditional book, yet there’s quality in its production.

Have I told you?”) The gardens are unlike anything that Ellen can imagine: “There is a garden in Kyoto meant to be viewed at night in shadows…The point is, the entire thing- the pathways, the fountains, the lakes, the cherry trees—is an illusion: colorless shadows without scent cast by large paper cutouts.”In truth, though, illusions and reality merge. Kyoto, once on the short list in place of Hiroshima, survives and so does Ellen. But in the meantime, its magic looms large in the imagination – the look, the shape, the story of the gardens varying, depending on who is doing the viewing.The ghosts that inhabit Ellen’s life are Randall, Ellen’s first love and mentor…his mother, who died early in his life, leaving him with his elderly father, and the house they inhabited, once an important depot for the Underground Railroad. There’s Ellen’s adult lover, Henry Rock, driven mad by the war and his role in it as an understated hero.And then there are the ghosts that are banished from conversation in the 1950s: unwed pregnancies, illicit liaisons, emotionally and mentally damaged veterans, domestic abuse, lack of empowerment experienced by women. “We are not used to display,” Ellen explains, “this bare truth.” Indeed, as the underbelly of the 1950s are slowly revealed, the effect becomes jarring.To add to the merging of illusion and reality, key plot points rely on letters: the letters sent by Henry to Daphne, Ellen’s friend, that wind up in Ellen’s hands…the false letters that Henry himself writes when Daphne doesn’t answer him…the letter from Randall’s aunt that is the key to a dark family secret…the bloodstained letters used by a professor/horticulturist who advocates for the salvation of Kyoto. And, of course, the Gardens of Kyoto itself, the book that illuminates a way of thinking for an impressionable young girl.The Gardens of Kyoto is a luminous book, somewhat elusive, enormously powerful, and filled with beauty and truths. There is real power in these words....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 13, 2015","Jan 15, 2015","Jan 13, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99654.The_Gardens_of_Kyoto

Anyone who has ever read Madame Bovary or Anna Karenina knows that this saying is true. Emma Bovary is a bored married woman who seeks to escape life’s banality through affairs. And Anna Karenina, arguably the more interesting woman, seeks solace from her cold, emotionless husband through her affair with the far more dashing Vronsky.Why do I begin this  with a look at Emma and Anna? Largely because Anna Benz, a displaced American woman living in a Zurich suburb – married to a gorgeous Swiss banker named Bruno – is their legacy. Readers who are familiar with these two books will be richly rewarded with nods to these classics.This is a mesmerizing book, one of the more psychologically astute books I’ve read. This Anna, on the surface, appears to have it all: the successful husband, three children, a beautiful home, the trappings of wealth. Yet she is curiously disconnected from life, a stranger in a strange land (she barely speaks the Swiss-German dialect that is required of her to fully participate in life). Snippets of sessions with her analyst, Doktor Messerli, tease out some of the underlying layers of this seemingly impenetrable woman.Anna has affairs – lots of them – to fill up the empty hole inside her, skirting with discovery. Yet these affairs are devoid of the passion and emotional investment that one might expect from a novel that focuses on affairs – sometimes jarringly so.Hausfrau veers into territory that its classic predecessors do not – the precision of words. Throughout the book, Anna queries Dr. Messerli on word meanings (Delusion vs. hallucination? Maze vs. labyrinth? Indifference vs. ambivalence? Secrecy vs. privacy?) Anna reflects, “She could have simply told the Doktor that she was good at word games…But that confession would have wrung out another one: that her wittiest moments were her slyest and most often they served her in the way the ink serves the octopus. Smoke screens, she hid behind them.” Words in this novel can obscure and reveal; language can connect or can isolate. And indeed, in many key scenes, they do.As the book veers toward its preordained conclusion, it touches upon so many issues: the nature of love and betrayal, the fine lines of morality, the continual search for self and meaning, and the lengths we go to fill the voids in our lives. This is an incredibly fine debut that portends good things for Jill Alexander Essbaum....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Mar 08, 2015","Mar 12, 2015","Jan 12, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22725443-hausfrau

So I couldn’t wait to get my hands on her newest one, Act of God.In ways, Act of God has a lot in common with Heroic Measures. In each, New Yorkers become panicked due to an outside danger (a gasoline tanker truck that become stuck in the Midtown Tunnel in Heroic Measures, a toxic phosphorescent mushroom infestation in Act of God). Both books also contain shifting points of views and characters who are striving to make sense of the craziness that has suddenly taken over their lives. These quirky, eccentric characters – a hallmark of Jill Ciment’s – vaguely call to mind Anne Tyler’s loveable protagonists.This book opens with twins Edith and Kat, two women in their mid-60s who are rooming in the Victorian home of their landlady, Vida Cebu, a would-be Shakespearean actress who has become notorious for her role in a female libido drug commercial. To add to the chaos, a young morality-challenged Russian girl is flopping in Vida’s guest bedroom without her knowledge. When the mushroom is discovered, HAZMAT is called and all their lives are thrown into complete upheaval.As each of them muddles their way through, themes begin to emerge. In Vida’s case, “She felt oddly free, as if she’d escaped. Had the house been that much of a responsibility? Why didn’t she feel worse?” And in another snapshot, one of the twins is trying hard to salvage the letters of her deceased mother, a one-time grande dame of advice columnists. Gradually, the twists of their lives echo the plaintive cries of the old letters, “Will I find love again? Why did she lie to me? Am I lovable?”The slim novel raises some big questions: Who deserves forgiveness? When do we take responsibility and when do we blithely proclaim that a natural tragedy is an “act of God?” How do we build a sense of community at a time when we feel all alone? The book is compelling and page-turning – I read it in one sitting. But I couldn’t help but feel as if Jill Ciment was recycling some of the themes of her previous novel.

WOW!If life were fair, Richard Wagamese would be a household name by now. His latest novel – at its core – is an absent father’s redemption through the art of storytelling and a son’s growing knowledge of his own sense of identity. Franklin Starlight, 16 years old, grows up under the guardianship of “the old man”, a man of few words who lovingly teaches him how to co-exist with nature and survive. He knows nothing of his mother and little of his birth father; only that every few years, a drunk wreck of a man shows up and fails time and time again at connection. Just as he’s becoming reconciled that he has no father, he is summoned by his dying father Elden, who asks him to take him into the interior so he can die “in the warrior way”, facing east.The 40-mile journey that encompasses this book is a well-worn metaphor for an internal journey and indeed, that is what occurs here. But it is done masterfully. Both father and son are men of few words, but Frank eventually reveals this to his father, when queried about “the old man”: “At first he brung me out all the time when I was small. Showed me plants and how to gather them. Everything a guy would need is here if you want it and know how to look for it. You gotta spend time gatherin’ what you need. What you need to keep you strong. He called it a medicine walk.”Indeed, Franklin begins to gather what he needs – hard-won stories from his father about his hard-luck life and the forces that shaped him into a man who had little left to lose. In doing so, he provides his son with the missing pieces to embrace his own complicated legacy. I cannot praise this book highly enough. As with other of his Canadian compatriots – I’m thinking of Joseph Boyden, and Elizabeth Hay, for example – the sensory descriptions of the B.C. interior take on a life of its own. As a result, Franklin and Eldon’s story, while important, becomes a sort of asterisk to the bigger world, where each of us is folded in to the natural rhythms of life. The naturalistic dialogue – and I wonder, how can so much wisdom be condensed into such pithy statements – interweaves beautifully with the subject at hand.This is a marvel of a book, one that explores human truths, the nature of identity, what it takes to achieve redemption, and how we are interconnected with nature and each other. It’s as good as – no, better than – Mr. Wagamese’s former book, Indian Horse.

Although it’s set primarily in 1940s war time, it is not a war book; it’s more of a primer about how we fit into the grand scheme of things and what it means to live a meaningful life. In terms of tone, I would compare it to the late, great Kent Haruf – confident yet quiet prose.First, we meet James, shot down by the Germans during his first mission. As the endless war wages on outside the POW camp, James seeks his own meaning, keeping a journal on a family of redstart birds. In that pursuit, he has an unlikely supporter: the Kommandant, a fellow nature lover and former classics professor whose heart is not in the brutality of the war.The other two characters are Rose, James young wife, who married him in haste and – if truth be known – does not really love him anymore. Enid, his sister, is bombed out of London and bunks with her sister-in-law out of necessity. She, too, is at a crossroads.Each of the three are in his or her own prison: in James case, literally…in the case of the women, figuratively. Each needs to search inside to find out what it takes to get life right. As Enid reflects, “All the small balances are impossible to strike most of the time. And then there are the larger choices. It’s hopeless.”Yet this is a hopeful book. James thinks, “How beautiful that one mallard’s voice is carried aloft by the flight of his companions.” All of us play our own role in the natural environment and the tapestry of life itself. The metaphor of the birds – the redstarts and others – can sometimes be just a wee bit too obvious.The fictional novel is based on three actual events, including the story of the German Kommandant.

It’s a book about the limitations of memory, the inevitability of fate, Blood-Drenched Beard is – let me say it straight out – an extraordinary book. It’s a book about the limitations of memory, the inevitability of fate, the distinction between myth and legend, and the boundaries of forgiveness.And if all that sounds too heavy, let me add that it’s an extremely accessible tale, expertly translated, with a unique and original character that earns his place as one of the more memorable protagonists in contemporary literature.The character is unnamed. We know that he is somewhat unmoored, an excellent ocean swimmer, who moves to the Atlantic resort town of Garopaba with his father’s old dog Beta after his father kills himself. The town is stingy with its secrets; the man’s grandfather, a larger-than-life old gaucho, was supposedly murdered there by fellow villagers. Or was he?The young man is not only nameless, he also suffers from a rare neurological condition called prosopagnosia; he cannot recall faces, even his own. While he struggles with his own congenital memory black-out, the village seems to suffer from its own; no one can quite remember much about the grandfather and how he died.In many ways, the character’s trajectory resembles Joseph Campell’s The Hero’s Journey. In this archetypal monomyth, the hero receives a call – a call that he at first ignores – to head off into the unknown. There his guide or magical helper (Beta) appears and together, they cross the threshold into danger, facing a series of tasks and ordeals. In the end, the hero returns, free from the fear of death…which in turn gives him the freedom to live authentically.Our character is given this advice: “Don’t invest too much energy in these things. Folk tales can bury reality forever. You’ll only be able to reconstruct what really happened up to a certain point. The rest becomes legend.” On his Hero’s Journey, our hero discovers the stuff that legends are made of. The tale is mythic and yet grounded and in many ways, foretold and fated.The book is also beautifully atmospheric. I felt I was right there in Porto Alegre, and could smell the salty ocean and hear the resort sounds. And any avid dog-lover will connect to this core story of a man and his dog.One more thing I feel compelled to mention. The Guardian’s Justin Cartwright wrote a particularly mean-spirited  about the “shameful translation.” I’ve read a number of translated books and this translation – by Alison Entrekin – is absolutely luminous, drawing me into the novel without hitting a false note. The new year isn’t even upon us yet and I think I can safely say that this book will be in my Top Ten for 2015.

In the opening author’s note, Austin Ratner quotes Andre Gide: “Fiction is history that might have taken place, and history is fiction which has taken place.” Using that definition, The Jump Artist is based on history: Philipp Halsmann, a 22-year-old Jewish Latvian young man, joins his father for a hike in the Tyrolean Alps. His father temporarily wanders off and is murdered. Despite woefully lacking evidence, Philipp is falsely accused and jailed.The ensuing story – taking up about half of the book – boggles the mind. In the anti-Semitic Austria of the late 1920s, Halsman is convicted not just once but twice – a foreshadow of the horrific excesses of Nazism. As Halsmann’s lawyer states, “The values that matter here are not the values of Jews or Latvians or Russians or Poles or Swiss or French. The values that matter here are Austrian values, and we value the truth or we have nothing. We may mean well, but without the truth, we could murder our own flock out of fears of mange, when the real culprit may be a wolf.”Halsmann’s miscarriage of justice attracts the attention of intellectuals the world over, including Albert Einstein. Indeed, the opening of each chapter incorporates true quotations from Halsmann and other key protagonists in this sorry situation.Had I stopped half-way through, I would have rated this book with the highest star rating. But the second half of the book then moves on to Halsmann’s post-jail life as a famous photographer (Philipp Halsman becomes a well-known portrait photographer of luminaries that include Marilyn Monroe). His character becomes surprisingly inert. I did not gain a sense of Halsmann’s own internal struggles after such a life-scarring event; rather, Halsmann (Philippe Halsman after arriving in France), seems like a one-dimensional character and there’s little sense of connection with his readers.I suspect that Austin Ratner relies too heavily on the research (not unlike, say, Cold Mountain, which – in my mind – was similarly inert). I wanted Mr. Ratner to dig deeper into the man who was determined to succeed despite the damning label of patricide and the knowledge of the world’s cruelties.

It offers three novellas that start out gently and gradually build in intensity while maintaining their dreamlike state.In the first, a truculent teen named Aya is obsessed with her younger foster brother, Jun, a diver. As the “only child who is not an orphan” in the orphanage run by her sanctimonious parents, Aya is teeming with resentment…which eventually plays out in near-tragic cruelty to a little girl. Aya is eventually deprived of the illusion of Jun’s comfort: “If he had attacked me outright, I might have been able to defend myself. Instead, he exposed my secret as if offering himself to me.”Pregnancy Diary, the second of the three, also presents an emotionally detached narrator (as do many of the tales in Revenge). Like the stories in Revenge, food is focal point. When the unnamed narrator’s sister recovers from several months of early pregnancy nausea, the narrator sadistically begins feeding her sister huge quantities of grapefruit jam. “She ate spoonful after spoonful. Her protruding belly made her look almost arrogant as she stood there by the stove, pouring the sticky globs of fruit down her throat. As I studies the last puddles of jam trembling slightly at the bottom of the pan, I wondered whether PWH could really destroy chromosomes.”Lastly, in Dormitory, a wife – who will soon be joining her husband in Sweden – helps her young out-of-town cousin secure a room in her old college dormitory. There she becomes reacquainted with the manager, a dying triple amputee with one leg. As she becomes drawn into his mad world, the nightmare begins to engulf her.These novellas are haunting and certainly set the stage for Yoko Ogawa’s later work with three alienated “watchers” whose emotions simmer beneath the surface....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Dec 09, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1337973.The_Diving_Pool

You get introduced to the characters, take up residence with them in their Baltimore neighborhoods, watch them muddle through their challenges and triumphs, and inevitably, feel as if you’re saying a fond farewell to family members when you close the last page.That’s the beauty of Anne Tyler’s writing. Her characters are quirky, eccentric, and so achingly real that they could step off the page and seamlessly walk right into your home. Virtually every one of her novels offers a heartbreakingly hilarious and often poignant look at f everyday families: marital secrets, sibling jealousies, skeletons in the closet, unexpected loss, and love unearthed in the strangest ways and in the strangest places.A Spool of Blue Thread weaves its way into the tapestry of Anne Tyler’s works and offers its own charms. Like its predecessors, it takes place in Baltimore and focuses on a family – in this case, the Whitshanks. As the book traverses back and forth through time, we meet Linnie and Junior, their son Red, his wife Abby and their four children…and their children. The lovingly hand-crafted house where they reside becomes its own character, paying witness to four generations until “the filmy-skinned ghosts frolicked and danced on the porch with nobody left to watch.” These fully-realized characters reveal themselves to us – the readers – as the narrative slowly surrenders its secrets. Anne Tyler’s characters are distinctly themselves but they could be anyone: they may say the wrong thing or take the wrong path and their lives are often messy, yet at their core, they are good people who are just trying to forge their way through.And oh, how Ms. Tyler makes her insights seem so effortless. Here’s one character’s reaction to another’s forgiveness: “The sudden, alerted sweep of her eyes across his face had made him feel the way a parched plant must feel when it’s finally given water.” Or this: “Maybe when he was grown, she remembered thinking during his childhood, he would finally tell her what used to make him so angry. But then when he was grown she had asked him and he had said, “I don’t know, to be honest.” It all rings so true.I’ve said little about the plot and that’s deliberate: it’s up to every reader to discover all the nuances of this family and what drives them forward.

It’s why I was a huge fan of his novel,Charles Baxter has a knack for taking disparate characters and weaving them into an almost dreamlike tapestry. It’s why I was a huge fan of his novel, Feast of Love, for which he was a finalist for the National Book Award. In his new short story collection, there are threads of that process. The stories are interrelated and organized into Virtues (Bravery, Loyalty, Chastity, Charity and Forbearance) and vices (Lust Sloth, Avarice, Gluttony, Vanity). But, of course, it’s not as cut and dry as that. Characters appear and reappear. For instance, in the first story, we met a doctor named Elijah—the same name as the prophet and wonder-worker – who appears in several of the stories. Is he great and righteous or flawed despite his healing powers? Gradually, we learn more and more about him.It’s the title, though, that is the key to each of these stories. In every story, the key character is approached by another, who, in effect, tells him/her, “There something I want you to do.” Whether it’s to see that person’s authentic self, take an emotional risk, help the character through a crisis, conduct a rescue or something else, this becomes a distinctly moral book, but not in a preachy way.Mr. Baxter is too good a writer to provide easy answers; his focus is on the ambiguity of life, the crossroads that we all reach. Whether he’s writing about a broken-hearted architect who stops a woman – a stand-up comic – from jumping off a bridge to the doctor coming across Alfred Hitchcock’s ghost, these are brave little stories that build in momentum as the collection progresses.

(I’m thinking of novels like The All too often, when novelists write about the artistic process, they treat it as if it is a Serious, Weighty Matter. (I’m thinking of novels like The Blazing World, for one.) As a result, we, as readers, never get the sense of well-rounded characters.For the most part, Deirdre Madden gets it right. In Authenticity, we meet three artists: Roderic Kennedy, whose single-minded passion for his art has turned him into a success but who leaves behind a broken marriage and severe bouts with alcoholism in its wake…his much younger lover, Julia Fitzpatrick, who is also driven by her artistic muse and who may very well be at a breakthrough in her career…and William, the man she chances upon who has relegated his muse to second place as he dutifully follows his destiny to money and position.When Julia meets William on a park bench, she senses that he is despairing and quite possibly suicidal. She befriends him; while her relationship isn’t sexual, it offers the reader a contrast between the two men. Roderic is – quite literally – bigger than life, a giant of a man with a great sense of charisma. William, who has not followed his art (and his heart), is more diminutive, drained of a joie d’vivre and a reason to live.The theme is summed up at one point by Roderic: “Unfortunately, William really has made a huge mistake. He’s done the wrong thing. It isn’t just what he thinks he’s wasted his life, he knows he’s wasted his life…It’s not enough to have a gift. You have to have the courage of your gift as well.”Art, Ms. Madden suggests, is giving up something private and precious. The pursuit of art to someone with the calling is not optional; at least, not if the artist wishes to live an authentic life. The artist does not serve his/her art; the art serves the artist. In a particularly illuminating passage, Roderic muses, “He thought of his painting as though it were a flame, a fragile lit thing that he had guarded with his life. Entrusted to him, he had succeeded in keeping it from being extinguished in spite of the winds and storms through which he had carried it; in return, down through the years, it had afforded him a subtle and complex joy.”This is a stunningly accurate portrait of the artist. Even though the characters tend to be more reserved – more distanced – than I typically like, the portrayal of those for whom art serves is extraordinarily well done.

Brick-and-mortar prisons have long been used in books as a metaphor for a character’s own sense of emotional imprisonment, and so it is here, in S.M. Hulse’s assured debut.We learn early on that former CO (corrections officer) Wes Carver, a stoic man with a stronger sense of right and wrong than most, has long been emotionally imprisoned by a fateful few days where he was held hostage in a prison riot. During that time, his fingers were shattered, depriving him of his greatest joy in life: playing his father’s handcrafted fiddle, which he did exceedingly well. When we first meet up with him, he has suffered another massive loss: the death of his wife Claire from leukemia.This opening setup brings Wes back to his hometown Black River to bury his wife and come face-to-face with his estranged stepson Dennis – now grown -- and also his memories: his torturer is now up for parole.The rest of the plotting is for the reader to discover. The themes are fair game, and they are universal: is there ever a point when a bad person is entitled to forgiveness? The inmate Williams claims to have found God, but as Wes relates to his pastor, “A man like that doesn’t deserve to believe when I spent my whole life trying and still can’t do it.”Black River explores what is justice? Can a brutal inmate by freed from the physical walls that surround him when his victim is placed forever into an emotional prison of his own? What is the appropriate punishment when an inmate takes away the only voice that Wes Carver really has – his eloquent fiddle playing (in contrast to his often ineloquent speech). What does it take to move on and is there ever a sense of redemption and self-forgiveness?From time to time, the plotting is a little too defined (for example, both Wes and his stepson play out their ancient battle through a damaged teen named Scott. Dennis becomes a surrogate father while Wes sets himself up as a mentor).

So it is no surprise that his new nKazuo Ishiguro is a master stylist, with books that range from futuristic, sci-fi, surrealistic and post-colonial. So it is no surprise that his new novel is unlike anything he has written before. Like its predecessors, this novel concentrates on memories: their power to silence, distort, and forever haunt, with characters that are often alienated and searching. Yet the book is distinctly an adventure fable, integrating an ancient British civilization with fantasy.The two questions are: is it good? And is it satisfying? The answer to the first question is absolutely yes. All the trademarks of Ishiguro – his masterful prose, his characters’ search for meaning and his feats of imagination are all well on display. The answer to the second question is far more subjective and will very much depend on what each individual reader enjoys.The novel takes us into post-Arthurian Britain, populated with those mythic heroes, including a still-living Sir Gawain, yet there’s a twist here: A mist has fallen on Britain, forcing the isle into a collective loss of memory. (“IT’s queer the way the world’s forgetting people and things form only yesterday and the day before that. Like a sickness come over us all.”) Axl and Beatrice (and are we sure these are even their names?) are an elderly couple who visit their adult son, of whom they have only the scantest of remembrances. During their journey, they encounter an honorable knight, a warrior on a quixotic quest, a young boy, a sinister hidden dragon, an evil monk and more, each holding a key to their quest.At its core, The Buried Giant is a fantastical fable, an old-fashioned adventure story with thrills a-plenty. But scratch the surface and you get more. There are allusions to so many other classics: obviously, King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable, but also Orpheus and Dante’s Inferno (particularly in the character of Beatrice, the cherished soulmate), and certain childhood fables.We also get an in-depth look at universal themes: memory and forgetfulness, love and aging, war and peace (and how peace can hold “for ever built on slaughter and a magician’s trickery” and what it takes to be a good and a loving person. From Axl to Beatrice: “For what good’s a memory’s returning from the mist if it’s only to push away another? Will you promise me, princess? Promise to keep what you feel for me this moment always in your heart, no matter what you see once the mist’s gone.” The narrative builds as it goes along and the central question – at what price do we remember, at what price do we forget – is captivating and its broader meaning – the collective memory loss of a nation is timely. The message is delivered within the fantasy adventure framework, which will appeal to some, but not all readers. I cannot say I loved it (as I loved Remains of the Day, Never Let Me Go, The Unconsoled and other Ishiguro works) but I admired this achievement. And I must admit to a little misting in my own eyes as the fable finally surrenders its secrets....more",Notes are private!,0,96,1,"Jan 08, 2015","Jan 12, 2015","Nov 14, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22522805-the-buried-giant

I’ve read every single one of his fiction books and have gasped aloud at his ability to tackle this toughDavid Vann takes his readers to dark places. I’ve read every single one of his fiction books and have gasped aloud at his ability to tackle this toughest of question: “What do we owe for what has come before us, the previous generations?” I know in his own life, he has wrestled with his father’s suicide when he was a pre-teen. Similarly, his protagonists – who are also often pre-teens – address this issue in its many shapes and forms.Twelve-year-old Caitlin, the first-person narrator of Aquarium, is another such character. She lives alone with her mother Sheri, a docker at the local container port, with little knowledge of her extended family (including her father and grandparents), barely getting by. In this microcosmic world – in this aquarium – Caitlin struggles to relate to her very damaged mother, who, in turn, is struggling to overcome the rage of her own abandonment.“Anything is possible with a parent. Parents are gods. They make us and they destroy us. They warp the world and remake it in their own shape and that’s the world we know forever. It’s the only world. We can’t see what it might have looked like otherwise.” So writes David Vann and as Caitlin ricochets between her unstable, twisted mother and the magical lure of the aquarium, she tries to forge her singular place in the world. The unexpected appearance of a third important character helps her recognize that one’s destiny is indeed a blueprint that’s at least partially inescapable: “…somewhere there’s the shape of my life, and I had the chance to choose a few variations, but not far from the pattern.”A type of present day fairy tale with real live demons, there are times when Mr. Vann pushes his metaphor a little too far (in just one page, we hear that the world is the “largest of aquariums”, that “a person might take any form, as varied as fish”, that “we can be like fish”, and so on.) But just as this was beginning to enter my consciousness, the story swerves into darker territory and I began following breathlessly, thoroughly submerged in the patterns being exposed.It's worth noting that this is the first time that this author has written from the perspective of a young girl (as opposed to a young boy) and it’s also the first time that despair is vanquished by release and redemption; characters are taken to the precipice but are given rudimentary tools to save themselves. In this aspect, it’s a particularly satisfying read.I typically don’t comment on the look and feel of a book, preferring to limit my  to content only. But Aquarium is worthy of comment. Similar to Richard Flanagan’s novel, Gould’s Book of Fish, this elegant book contains thicker-than-average page stock and 15 vividly colored illustrations of fish at crucial places to aid the reader in visualizing the fish that are described throughout. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 04, 2015","Feb 06, 2015","Nov 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22668848-aquarium

The author was Jenny Erpenbeck and, since then, I’ve eagerly awaited her newest work. And finally, it’s here.The theme she so beautifully explored – the fluidity of history and time – is front and center of this book as well and, if possible, even more fully realized. Those who have read Kate Atkinson’s book Life After Life will note an almost eerie symmetry (although this book was published in Germany in 2012, mere months before the Atkinson book.)The premise derives from the German saying, “Es ist noch nict aller Tage Abend”, translated to, “It isn’t over until the end of all days.” Starting at the turn of the 20th century, a baby girl has lost her brief battle with life during the Habsburg Empire. But what if she had lived? The next of the five interwoven books imagines her as a poor and despondent teenager in Vienna during post World War I Vienna, where – again – she meets up with death. In the next rendition, she has survived into adulthood and is now a fervent Communist until her rendezvous with death. And so on.Unlike the Atkinson book, Erpenbeck’s novel goes beyond the “wind back the tape and let’s see what happens” scenario. For one thing, there are Intermezzos between each rendition, which prods the reader to see how one minute or one move could make a world of different. There’s something more organic about all of it.We never – or, at least, not to the final book – learn the name of the characters. They are called daughter or mother or grandmother. That is a deliberate choice on the part of Ms. Erpenbeck; in Shakespeare’s words, “We are poor players who strut and fret our last hour on the stage.” They could be any family. They could be us. A paraphrase of the title is used in the first book: “A day on which a life comes to end is still far from being the end of all days.” Jenny Erpenbeck’s book is cobbled together around Hegel’s truism: “The truth is the whole.” In each section, we see part of the truth: what may have happened, what happened from a certain character’s perspective, what may not have happened at all. Only until we get to the end do we understand the importance of continuity: (to paraphrase the author), we carry within us a vast dark land, all the stories our mother never told us or that she hid from us…all the stories our mothers never heard of or never knew. In a lifetime, regimes rise and fall, people vanish or fade away, material goods find new owners. Yet life goes on.There is incredible beauty in the prose, translated to perfection by Susan Bernofsky, such as, “Her body is a city. Her heart is a large shady square, her fingers pedestrians, her hair the light of streetlamps, her knees two rows of buildings. She tries to give people footpaths…” From the almost folkloric or mythic feel of the first book to the more strident tone of the third to the achingly poignant tone of the final book, Ms. Erpenbeck flirts with the notion of possibility, fate, and death. She is an exciting writer who deserves the widest audience possible....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 10, 2014","Nov 12, 2014","Nov 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15834147-aller-tage-abend

If there’s another book that tackles violence against women and the resulting PTSD, I don’t know what it is. But once you begin it, it has the gravitational pull of a strong magnet: it’s impossible to tear yourself away.Mireille is the proud daughter of a proud “pull himself up from the bootstrings” Haitian magnate, who lives in lavish excess in Haiti, where most of his fellow countryman live in abject poverty. In the opening pages, Mireille and her American husband Michael – a “blan” – are on their way to the beach with their baby; their car is surrounded, Mireille is taken, and $1 million in ransom is demanded. It’s business-as-usual in Haiti, but these kidnappers do not count on her father’s pragmatism: he knows that if he gives in this time, his other family members will eventually be kidnapped as well as the kidnappers become bolder and bolder. He guesses she will return relatively unharmed once they realize he will not give in to their blackmail. He guesses wrong.The resulting scenes are among the most harrowing you will ever read about abuse against women, written by an author who was a victim of rape herself. Just when the reading becomes almost too intense, Roxane Gay switches to back-story of Mireille and Michael’s courtship and marriage. Bland in comparison, and slightly idealized, these scenes are very necessary and also mimic what Mireille is going through: periods of release before being plunged back into her nightmare. Just as harrowing is the portrayal of PTSD; it rings authentic and sad and true.Underlying the story is a political question: do those who are almost obscenely rich have a responsibility to their starving countryman who live in the most wretched of conditions? And also, there is a feminist question: Why is it that so many corrupt men take out their worst frustrations on women who are unable to physically fight back? When Mireille says to the Commander, the “main man”: “You are complicit too. Don’t think for a second you aren’t”, she is reminding him that violence begets violence and that those in power (whether wealthy or not) will always exert this type of heinous control over the less powerful.

I was eager to read a novel by Mo Yan, who won the Nobel Prize last year. This one, published in 2009, is not new, but is finally being published in the U.S. Frog spotlights a particularly egregious Chinese policy: the controversial and restrictive one-child policy imposed by the Mao regime. Although the scourge of overpopulation was indeed a major economic and environmental threat to China, the zeal with which the Communists followed it calls to mind certain dystopian novels.Narrated in the form of four letters (and a play) written for a Japanese sensei by a playwright/army officer named Tadpole, the book centers on the story of his aunt Gugu – a staunch Red party-liner who follows country policy to the letter. There are many haunting passages; for example, a fanatical hunt for a petite woman, a friend of Tadpole’s, who is seven months pregnant with her second child. As she races against time (as soon as the baby is born, the baby becomes a person with full Chinese rights), the possibility lingers that she will be caught and forced into a dangerous late-term abortion. Indeed, Tadpole himself is forced into a quandary when his wife becomes pregnant with a second child and is pursued relentlessly by his aunt to destroy it.For the western reader, there are some challenges to be overcome. First, it is difficult to keep track of the similar Chinese names. As we find out early on, in the rural villages, it was thought that a child represented a piece of her body. Therefore, there are names such as Chen Er (Ears) and Chen Mei (Brow) and Chen Bi (Nose) and so on. For those of us who are used to concentrating on first names, it’s often hard to keep it straight; certainly the fault of the reader more than the writer.Secondly, there’s the title to consider. Why Frog? As easterners know (and westerners mostly don’t), a frog is a symbol of fertility; the cry of a newborn baby just out of the womb is thought to be not unlike the croak of a frog. The aunt/midwife Gugu reveals this ephiphany while in a marshy area: ""The croaking of frogs is often described in terms of drumbeats...But the cries that night were infused with a sense of resentment and of grievance, as if the souls of countless murdered infants were hurling accusations."" Mo Yan only briefly skirts the despicable favoritism of boy babies over girl babies (many Chinese families murdered a first-born daughter so they could have another chance to hit the jackpot with a boy).Lastly, there’s the issue of translation. Sometimes, the narrative veers into the cartoonish: Gugu “sneers” and “snarls” so much that I envisioned her as a one-dimensional villain, although her back story does provide insight into why she is so heartless and overly zealous. There is also a degree of detachment on the part of the characters, which may or may not have been intended to that degree by Mo Yan.Frog is reportedly based on Mo Yan's own aunt. And all in all, the novel is worth the read – for its incisive view of the violence done to women through the one-child policy, for the insightful look at rural superstitions and mentality, for several very well-written scenes, including ones on the ubiquitous crafting of fertility dolls. I can’t say I loved it, but I admired it greatly....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Oct 27, 2014","Oct 30, 2014","Oct 06, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22522167-frog

Scott Fitzgerald, we remember him as a literary legend: the creator of the Great Gatsby, part of the glittering Scott-and-Zelda duo, full of shimmer and promise.In this latest book, Stewart O’Nan introduces us to Fitgerald-as-outsider: “a poor boy from a rich neighborhood, a scholarship kid at boarding school, a Midwestern in the East, an easterner out West.”Daringly, he recreates and re-imagines the Hollywood years, striving to support his increasingly estranged wife Zelda who is in a sanitarium and his daughter Scottie (“Pie”) who, away at a pricey boarding school, is the tenuous link between her parents.Mr. O’Nan has obviously done his research: the love affair with the irrepressible and ambitious Sheilah Graham, the friendships with Bogie and Mayo (yes, THAT Bogie!), the stints as a writer during the great screen era (who would have thought that Fitzgerald wrote briefly for the Gone with the Wind script!), the drunken adventures with the scion of the head of Paramount, the rivalry with Ernest Hemingway, the shared spaces with Aldous Huxley and other literary greats. A book like this will inevitably open up the age-old debate: is it fair for one of today’s writers to mesh his own fictional voice with the voice of an iconic writer? Should fiction ever impinge upon fact? I am of the mind that the writer should have free rein to imagine, as long as he labels his work fiction and not biography.Stewart O’Nan wisely does not try to capture F. Scott Fitzgerald’s voice but he does capture the sense of futility that haunted him at the end of his days. And he also captures the ruthlessness that defined Hollywood in that era. In places, I found O’Nan’s book to be spellbinding in its mission to summon the spirit of F. Scott Fitzgerald. As long as the reader approaches the book with the realization that this is fiction-based-on-facts, it’s a very compelling read....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 20, 2014","Oct 26, 2014","Oct 06, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22522296-west-of-sunset

There may be no better author to answer that question than Somali-born Naruddin Farah, who provides an insight glimpse of a Somali photographer who must decide between freedom and family.Bella is a renowned photographer who has never had to curb her private love life and her professional ambitions. But when her the man she loves most of all – her half-brother Aars, a U.N. official – is killed in a violent terrorist attack, she departs immediately to Nairobi to take on the responsibilities of her teenage niece and nephew. That journey places her at odds with the children’s birth mother, Valerie, who has deserted them many years ago for a freer life with her gay partner, Padmini. All begin to interact with each other as prescribed by who they are: their clan identity, their gender preferences, and, in the case of all the adults, their formerly nomadic lifestyles.There are no major fireworks in this novel and the terrorist act is prologue to the wider backdrop of family conflict in an unsettled age. There is a lot to be learned about the modern day Somali woman: the bigotry against the Somali by the Kenyans, the treatment of gay women, the myths that pass as truth in defining those we don’t really know. Gently and compassionately, Farah creates a symphony of characters – ones that are rarely addressed in literature and not understood by the world in general – and provides insights into what motivates and drives them and how their interactions cannot be readily defined by our own expectations.If I have any quibble with the novel, it’s this: Nuruddin Farah sometimes excercises his authorial right to lead the reader.

Our country couldn’t possibly have committed the types of excesses of Abu Ghraib – torture, waterboarding, physical and sexual abuse -- could it?Well, COULD IT?Ellen Meeropol’s On Hurricane Island reads like a cautionary tale – one that weaves the reader in to its net of suspense and horror. Her main character, U.S. citizen and math professor Gandalf Cohen, is kidnapped by federal agents while on her way to a mathematical convention and sequestered off the coast of Maine in a civilian detention center. This 60-year-old female academic may have the most tenuous of connections to a terrorist and as a result, is placed in a confounding nightmare situation.Integrated into this tale is Austin Coombs, a newly hired civilian guide who is getting an education she never bargained for…her grandparents whom Austin lives with, who are guarding a mysterious past…Henry Ames, the FBI man-in-charge, who shields his own potentially career-ending secrets…and Tobias, the sadistic second-in-command who throws rules out the window in his singular focus to get results.This author has matured a lot since her first book, House Arrest, which was a worthy, albeit slightly flawed, debut. In this book, she interweaves several plot lines, takes literary risks, and creates characters that the reader cares about and roots for. I am loath to provide plot spoilers (although, of course, when a book is named On Hurricane Island you can be rest assured that a hurricane is going to enter into it!), but I will say that the book rings of a painful authenticity. Suffice to say that I was turning pages quickly, on several occasions with heart pounding.About two-thirds in, the book veers towards the cinematic, which will capture the majority of readers but distanced me. This is a subjective observation; I much prefer interior lives to exterior adventures. The integration of two of the plot points seemed a bit implausible (who would concentrate on family letters when their physical well-being – indeed, their lives == were on the line?) Still, On Hurricane Island stands its own, and then some, against books that ramp up tension and yet make the reader consider the implications of our misguided policies. It tackles a topic of vital importance: government surveillance and extra-legal interrogations gone awry.

In this case, Finding Jake is compared with Lionel Shriver's We Need To Talk About Kevin.The problem is: that book was filled with confident and powerful prose and acute insights into a damaged and unknowable child with serious psychological issues. In this case, the prose is faltering, which made me not at all sure I could trust the author to take me through the story.Unflaggingly supportive wife...hushed tones...fateful decision...icy blue eyes (wife) and eyes as dark as midnight (his)...fresh-faced new girl...expectant silence: these were only a few of the clichés from the first few pages (interestingly, the author has his character tag some of his own thoughts as clichés, yet the author himself doesn't avoid them). As the book progresses, the clichés don't cease: jellylike legs, icy pain, doubt creeping back into his thoughts...and so on. And finally: numb hopelessness, blazing anger fueled by senseless shame...well, you get my drift.Even the name of the main character - Jake - is evocative of another famous book in a similar vein - Defending Jacob. And the plot itself seems to predictably unfold in the vein of Shriver's ""Kevin"".It gives me no great pleasure to write a less-than-sterling  on a debut book. I often read debut books and am astounded that authors are willing to invest their time and emotions in ""creating life.""

He needn’t havRight before the prologue, Paolo Giordano provides a helpful list of characters from the seventh alpine regiment and the third platoon. He needn’t have taken the trouble. The characters in The Human Body are so intricately rendered that each of them is impossible to forget.There’s medical officer Egirto who has willfully exchanged the war zone at home for the war zone overseas. Marshal and troup leader Antonio Rene, a male prostitute who has just learned that he is to become a father. Corporate Marshal Roberto Ietri, a wet-behind-the-ears 20 year old virgin, for whom everything is new and interesting. Senior corporation Major Francesco Caderna, a brusque bully who singles out one unfortunate soldier for his cruel pranks. And there’s First Corporal Major Angelo Torsu, who falls seriously ill after food poisoning and spends his spare time online, trying to connect to a virtual “sweetheart.”These are just some of the characters that populate The Human Body, and if they sound one-dimensional or stereotypical, that is far from the truth. Each is fleshed out with subtle brushstrokes and yet given his (or in a few cases, her) own individuality.For readers looking for a “war book”, with details of battle and wins and losses, they won’t find it here. Although the background is Afghanistan, there is very little action depicted. As readers, we know from the prologue that there will be one ill-fated mission and that some will live and some will die. But even that engagement is narrated from the internal lives of the characters more than the action outside.Ultimately, we begin to care greatly about these imperfect characters, placed in a heinous pattern of waiting, and the struggles they embody: what they’ve left behind, what they’re experiencing, and what they are destined to endure. The war zone itself serves as a catalyst for helping each of these men – and women – realize who they are and the necessity of eventual transformation and connection. Beautifully translated from Italian by Anne Milano Appel, the book is particularly strong in its details: for example, right before disaster, a teeming herd of red sheep overcomes the convoy. These images are powerful and disturbing.

A chorus of voices – first, the teacher, Yuko Moriguchi, and then successive voices – the “mastermind” and his weak accomplice, the accomplice’s deluded and overly protective mother, and so on – provide the reader with insights into what happened and more importantly, why it happened. The technique calls to mind a similar award-winning best-seller from Korea: Please Look After Mom.Yuko Moriguchi’s voice is absolutely arresting: “You’re the last students I’ll ever teach, and I’ll remember you as long as I live.” Determined to avenge the cruel death of her daughter, she puts a plan into place, but – as with most plans – it takes on a life of its own. There are plenty of surprises in the plotting and far be it from me to spoil any of it.So let me address the themes. One theme that emerges is the self-absorption and narcissism of current society. This is a society where adults fulfill their own dreams, with little regard to what’s best for the child…and where young teens lack the courage to withstand peer pressure and fall victim to self-justifications. “The victimized often feel that they have only two choices: put up with the pain or end their suffering in death. But they’re wrong. The world is a much bigger place than that.”If I have one major quibble with this book, it’s that author Kanae Minato doesn’t trust her readers enough to connect the dots. Had the book been written in third person, it would have lost its immediacy but it would have gained the ability to provide omnipotent thoughts from each character. Naoki, the mastermind of the plot, is way too self-aware and his motives are too spelled out, depriving the reader of the joy of discovery. Shuya’s mother is also given too much self-awareness for her position.

And before you are emptied for sleep, what are you. And when you are emptied for sleep, you are not. And when you are filled with sleep, you never were.” That tile is not a coincidence, because in profound ways, parts of the narrator feel as if they’re gasping for air. Damon Galgut’s hauntingly conceived and elegantly written book is about the fluidity of identity. In three interwoven sections – The Follower, The Lover and the Guardian – the narrator, whose name is Damon, attempts to form a connection with a pivotal “other”; a relationship that always ends badly.In the first—The Follower – Damon opts in to a particularly punishing hike across Lesotho with a man named Reiner, of whom he knows next to nothing. A sort of doppelganger, Reiner, in reality, is Damon’s opposite: stoical, preening, cold and vain. Through that journey, we learn more about Damon than Reiner: “The truth is that he is not a traveler by nature, it is a state that has been forced on him by circumstances…He is also never going towards something, but always away, away. This is a defect in his nature that travel has turned into a condition.”Yet in The Lover, we see Damon taking his first steps towards that “something”…the potential of love with a young backpacker named Jerome. Almost despite himself, he cajoles African officials to let him into the country and pursue Jerome after spending days together. Yet, “The story of Jerome is one he’s lived through before, it is the story of what never happened, the story of travelling a long way while standing still.”In the final story, the one that begins to feel intensely personal, Damon accompanies a recently diagnosed manic, psychotic friend with a death wish, Anna, on a journey to India. He engages in a harrowing and futile attempt to save her, eventually recognizing that “There’s no theme, no moral to be learned, except for the knowledge that lightning can strike from a clear sky one morning and take away everything you’ve built…”Damon Gulgut organically weaves from third person to first person narrative (here’s an example: “At this remove, his thoughts are lost to me now, and yet I can explain him better than my present self, he is buried under my skin.”) It’s an effective way of displaying his remove from his own persona and his alienation from self.I do not know how much of the real Damon Galgut is contained in his character Damon (J.M. Coetzee uses a similar rhetorical delivery in his book Summertime). I would be surprised if these journeys were entirely fictional.

His latest book chronicles the story of post-war Chinese translator Gary Shang, reportedly based on the real-world Chinese spy, Larry Chin.Gary Shang straddles two worlds. A loyal Chinese Communist, he is reasonably content in a newly-arranged marriage and in the presumably temporary position he has working for the Americans. When the Americans leave, they ask Gary to go with them – a boon for Gary’s Communist handlers. Gradually, he settles into a double life, married to the narrator (Lilian’s) Irish-American mother, and torn between his love for the country he lives in versus the country he left…and still loves.It’s all fascinating stuff, but I couldn’t help but feel as if Ha Jin was torn between presenting his readers with a history lecture or focusing on the fictional world he creates. There are many insights into the 1950s and 1960s mileau (including John Foster Dulles’ desire to use a nuke on Red China). And there are many passages like this one on Vietnam: “Some Chinese army hospitals south of Kunming City has been treating wounded Vietcong soldiers. It looked like China was becoming the rear base of North Vienam. If the Chinese continued backing up the Vietcong on such a scale, there’d be no way the Americans could win the war.”So I come back to my first paragraph: can straightforwardness embrace eloquence and ambiguity? It can, but not always here. In the end, I learned a lot but wasn’t quite able to immerse myself in a fictional world.

He begins to write letters to strangers on the outside, first providing a false version of himself and gradually writing more and more authentically. “It’s just a piece of paper, but he’s sitting there with it in his hand like it was some kind of life or death thing and that, he suddenly finds himself thinking, is the trouble with letters: the way they have their own existence, independent of both writer and reader, the way they can continue to have an effect even after you might have changed your mind…”In a lacerating portrait, Kathy Page does not shrink at creating a character for whom most tender-hearted readers should not have any sympathy…yet infusing him with complex feelings and a push for transcendence. Indeed, Simon Austen embarks on the true Hero’s Journey, from the depths of the prison system to an experimental program, which, in its own way, causes more pain than all the gang-beating and sordidness of the traditional model. But more importantly, the journey takes him from being closed in in his own personal prison to finding his way to the two simple words that can free him: “I’m sorry.”Alphabet – and its in-depth look at an unsettling character who is both manipulative and seductive yet brilliant and sensitive – is amazing.

Every single day, six billion texts are sentMany of us are absolutely obsessed with staying connected – texting friends regularly throughout the day. Every single day, six billion texts are sent in the United States. Reggie Shaw, a young clean-cut Mormon teenager, was one of those texters. He did not know that he was quite literally on a collision course with destiny. As he inadvertently wove in and out of the lane, his car smashed into another car containing two family men, rocket scientists on their way to work. They were instantly killed.This gripping book – one of the most important books I’ve read – highlights the journey of Reggie Shaw from collision to reckoning to redemption. By placing a face on the tragedy, Pulitzer Prize winner Matt Richtel drums home the human costs of texting while controlling a two thousand pound piece of machinery.Yet A Deadly Wandering is far more than one man’s tale. It is a tale of our digital age gone awry. Our brain evolves at a glacial pace, with part of it operating unconsciously, automatically, driven by sensory stimulus and contextual cues” – a phone ringing or the sound of our name. Yet technology has exploded, overwhelming us with more information than we can handle. Much as we want to, we simply cannot focus 100% on two or more things at once. As a result, driving and texting is like driving impaired…not unlike drunk driving. We simly don’t have the brain capacity.Matt Richtel writes very accessibly about science: “When the phone rings, it triggers a whole social reward network. And it triggers an orienting response that has been wired into us since hunger-gatherer times. You had to pay attention for survival. If you didn’t attend you got eaten by lions. We’re hardwired that way, no matter what we want to do.”Each person in this sad and cautionary narrative is treated with empathy. Reggie Shaw is a good kid whose life is turned upside down by the tragedy. The victims, Jim Furaro and Keith O’Dell, were good men who died needlessly, leaving behind loving wives and daughters…and propulsive careers. Terryl Warner, the victim’s advocate, is a true survivor, relentless in her pursuit of justice. And Judge Thomas Willmore, who balances justice with fairness and orders his defendants to read Les Miserables, is surely one of the finest of his profession.On a personal note: as someone whose business depends on fast response, my cell phone is right next to me when I drive. This is a behavior-changing book that persuasively shows the human cost of distracted driving. Reggie Shaw’s texting cost two lives; his mission to publicize that tragedy may save thousands. As Arthur Miller wrote in Death of a Salesman, “Attention must be paid.”...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Sep 03, 2014","Sep 07, 2014","Sep 03, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20604365-a-deadly-wandering

The first-person narrator, Alex Morris, flees from her former life as a theater director to take on the challenge of teaching dysfunctional kids in Edinburgh after the unfair death of her fiancée. As a novice teacher, she gravitates toward her oldest class – two boys and three girls, all 15 years old. Her goal is to use drama therapy to help them “to find ways of talking about terrible emotions and difficulties, without focusing on their own lives all the time.” And unexpectedly, she begins to succeed. The teens –Ricky, Jono, Carly, Annika, and particularly Mel, an astute and intelligent deaf girl whose diaries punctuate the book – are inspired by the ancient tales of guilt, vengeance and self-discovery.Ms. Haynes shines with these classroom vignettes, which capture the self-conscious, insecure and often raw nature of troubled teens. The reader, along with the students, will enjoy reconnecting with the Greek tragedies, which take on new life here.Yet as the denouement neared, I was realized I felt distanced. As a reader, I knew that Alex was torn apart by her fiancée Luke’s death, yet I knew next to nothing about Luke (other than his profession) nor did I get a sense of them as a couple. As a result, I never had a visceral sense of what she lost.I also had a hard time believing that Alex – merely 25 years old – had been a renowned theater director in London and that she was given the responsibility of challenged kids with no experience. And the takeaway lesson began to get a little murky. Was it that “if society doesn’t punish the criminals, the gods do?” Or the difficulty of making choices when the only options are bad? Or perhaps, the enduring lessons of the Greek tragedies that hold sway over the years? This is, indeed, a well-written, often psychologically astute book and I’m glad I read it, even with its perceived flaws.

One connection – a pathological liar and former husband, the famous eccentric French philosopher Simone Weil, the German novelist Thomas Mann, or a millionaire patron of the arts – enables the somewhat ordinary protagonist to gain insight and self-knowledge.In the eponymous The Liar’s Wife, the opening story, Jocelyn is a wealthy, sheltered and anxious dowager, “the child who wept when the swings were taken down for the winter.” Into her carefully ordered life suddenly enters her first husband, Johnny, an Irish neer-do-well, a self-created man with an oversized love of life. Through her interaction with the down-and-out Johnny, she realizes, “If love casts out fears, does it follow that fear casts out love?” And she finally realizes that “without Johnny she wouldn’t have known, really, who she was. Because he had taught her who she was not.”The two sandwiched stories – Simone Weil in New York and Thomas Mann in Gary, Indiana” are similar in that both are focused on ordinary students who interact with these renowned yet very flawed individuals. And, each deals in its own way with the early years of World War II and America’s blindness about the impending horrors. In the first, Genevieve – a student of Ms. Weil – recognizes that “The times demand of those who live through them certain acts, gestures, and understandings that they would not have come to in ordinary times.” Similarly, Bill, who feels indelibly and permanently marked by Dr. Mann, recalls“The waking was a shock, a laceration, but it was one we needed. His words lanced the infection of our refused to understand who we were”. The last novella, Fine Arts, weaves these themes together, along with themes that those who are familiar with Mary Gordon’s past works, particularly Spending, will recognize: the arts, the joys and pitfalls of faith, the search for self. Theresa Riordan, an attractive young scholarship student, nurtured by Milwaukee nuns, is ill-prepared for the larger world – her married lover, and eventually, her affluent much older mentor who collects Matteo Civitali sculptures. Gradually, her life leads her to understand that sometimes, one doesn’t need to know what to do…but does know what not to do. Ms. Gordon’s characters are all self-reflective and contemplative with the trappings of a good life…and yet with happiness as elusive.

He puts on a mask and adapts an attitude for an old-fashioned minstrel show and suddenly becomes intimidating and untouchable. It’s not a far stretch to say it’s about how we all hide behind our inscrutable masks with hints of the racism and marital problems that pervade society.Another, Minor Matt, questions what we value the most.

And there’s I’m the Meat, You’re the Knife, where a writer verbally torments a former English teacher, now helpless and dying, with subtle reminders of his past abuse.These are tales of revenge, self-recognition and sometimes, redemption --often rooted in the common situations (such as the war against raccoons).

That is, until he meets Connie, beautiful, artistic, impulsive and bohemian. This unlikely coupling works – he is “the rock” and she gives his life meaning – until, right before their silver anniversary, she tells him, “I think our marriage has run its course…I think I want to leave you.”The timing couldn’t be worse. The couple is about to embark on a Grand Tour of Europe with their 17-year-old son Albie before he leaves for college. Douglas is determined to save his marriage and so the three of them depart.Many of the scenes in Europe – Connie and Albie both love art – reminds me of viewing a friend’s photo album. Yes, the sights of Europe are magnificent and you want to step right into the photo, but you still wish there were more photos of your friends and less of the scenery. I felt that the characters became subjugated to the Grand Tour in the middle section.Albie, as the reader discovers, is a rather obnoxious, entitled teenage brat. And he places his parents’ personality differences in stark contrast: “”Raising Albie accentuated the differences between us…To make an analogy from botany, she imagined a child as an unopened flower; a parent had a responsibility to provide light and water, but also to stand back and watch. In contrast, I saw no reason why the flower should not be bracketed to a bamboo stick, pruned, explored to artificial light; if it made for a stronger, more resilient plant, why not?”And here’s where the “Us” becomes “all of us.” The reader may ponder: which parenting style is better? Is it all right to give up on marriage because it has “run its course”…or should a couple buckle down and try a little harder? Is it okay to not intervene when your teenager is rude (even if it’s for a good cause)…or should standards be set? Us becomes a mirror, of sorts, to view our own marriages and child-raising abilities.I had my opinions, of course; other readers will have theirs. There were many fine insights into these flawed but ultimately likeable characters, who come across as very genuine.

Throughout these pages, he is, simultaneously, a lyricist, a historian, a dialect master, a craftsman, and a ventriloquist. In a series of first-person narrations, he channels gang members, informers, drug dealers, CIA agents, a Rolling Stone reporter and even a particularly insightful ghost. Lurking on the periphery is also a fine portrayal and analysis-of-sorts of the Singer, an obvious nod to Bob Marley and the assassination attempt against his life at the end of 1976.Two questions beg answering: “Are there really seven killings?” And “If this is a brief history, why does it take nearly 700 pages to get to the end.” The answers: there are far more than seven killings and the readers will gain clarity about the title eventually. As far as the length, Marlon James seems in no hurry to get to his final destination. His goal is sweeping: to portray the turbulent, often violent history of Jamaica and to highlight that one shining moment when peace might have been possible. (“Dangerous thing, peace. Peace make you stupid. You forget that not everybody sign peace treaty. Good times bad for somebody.”)The conflict, centered upon the animosity between the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the People’s National Party (PNP) provides a glimpse of a Jamaica that tourists don’t see…along with CIA paranoia about the advent of communism (and other “isms”). One of his finest character creations is Nina – who had a one-night stand with the Singer – and who consistently reinvents herself four times in the novel, displaying the impossibility of fully escaping the violence of the past.A Brief History is both sprawling and demanding. Marlon James helpfully provides the reader with a list of characters at the start, and I often had to refer to it. There are times when the complex political situation and drug culture – which weaves its way into the boroughs of New York City – can seem confusing. Yet Mr. James voice(s) are so assured and the writing is often so elegiac that I could easily forgive its excesses. Some of his stream-of-consciousness passages literally took my breath away.

It's an absolute winner!First, a big thanks to GoodReads FirstReads and Soho Press for enabling me to be one of the early readers of this collection. It's an absolute winner!Years ago, I remember reading this line: “A father has two key jobs: to love and to protect.” Rainey Royal has lost the lottery in the father department. Her father, famous jazz musician Howard, is incapable of doing either. Or, in Dylan Landis’s own words: “Howard’s attention is like the sun. Too much burns the edges of her leaves, yet the atmosphere is thin without it.”If truth be known, Rainey hasn’t done all that well in the mother department either. Her mother Linda left her in the care of her father, taking off for an ashram. It’s now up to Rainey to get it right…or at least, get it to the point where she can survive.Rainey isn’t exactly what you call a likeable character. She’s a bully, a thief, and at times, a sadist. She is also distinctly human. Her friend Leah – the focus of Ms. Landis’s previous collection, Normal People Don’t Live Like This, reflects, “She loves Rainey Royal, who is both cruel and kind, who works with objects that belong to the dead, who can sweep the gaze across Leah’s white-box life and make her feel, if only for an hour, that she is the most thrilling person Rainey knows.”Insights like these abound. This is a breathtakingly astute book, harrowing, poignant, and spot-on. At one point, when Rainey is violated by one of her father’s many acolytes, there’s this exchange: “It sounds like something went very wrong, baby girl.” Rainey: “Will you throw him out?” Howard: “I’ll give him hell…Will that do?” Through this rather minimalistic exchange, the reader cannot help but intimately feel the sense of betrayal.About five years ago, I read Normal People, and was astounded at Dylan Landis’ ability to create such authentic, aching teens at the cusp of adulthood. Her character Leah Levinson, was a middle-class girl trying to find her way in a world of more damaged peers. Dylan Landis has taken this path even further; Rainey Royal is even more complex and – if possible – more “alive.” This book is an achievement and I give it an enthusiastic five stars....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 29, 2014","Sep 29, 2014","Aug 04, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20176975-rainey-royal

Nothing new there; coming-of-age books, including Catcher in the Rye, To Kill A Mockingbird, Skippy Dies, She’s Come Undone, This Boy’s Life, A Prayer for Owen Meany and so on – have long been staples of American and world literature.In fact, there are so many great coming-of-age books around that I always approach a new one somewhat skeptically. Fortunately, Darcey Steinke has a good story to tell and she tells it well.Pre-teen Jesse is a child of the 1970s, growing up in Roanoke, Virginia. Her defrocked minister father and emotionally-fraught mother move to a duplex area, inhabited by a number of down-on-their-luck fragmented families. The 1970s takes center stage here: the fascination with Cher, TV rage (Welcome Back, Kotter and The Carol Burnett Show), Patty Hearst kidnapping, Nixon resignation, Playboy Bunny phenomenon, Lynyrd Skynyrd and more – all woven seamlessly into the narrative. But the beauty of this book is its pitch-perfect character studies. Ms. Steinke, in a first-person narration, provides snapshot interactions with five characters: Sandy (“to me, she was as exotic as a lizard soaking up the sun”) in her leopard-print bikini is just about stone-broke and relies on her sleazy oral surgeon boyfriend to financially care for her. Jill is Jesse’s BFF with the “spark and intensity of a downed electrical wire”, eccentrically trying to survive despite an uncaring, absent mother.There’s Sheila, the unapproachable beauty who is inappropriately acting out, and whose friendship comes at a steep price. Julie, who is her mother’s BFF, a wannabe dancer whose narcissism alienates her daughter yet holds Jesse’s mother in thrall. And Dwayne, one of the school’s bad boys, whose claim to fame is that he looks like David Soul…and who is more gullible than he would ever want to reveal. Lastly, there is Jesse herself: trying to figure out where she fits and her place in the world.If you think you know these characters from other books (“the school beauty, the bad boy, the wannabe”), well, maybe you have.

Does he write in hushed whispers or clear outrage? Or does he accept the absurdity and senselessness of the Holocaust and use his art to convey that illogicality?Martin Amis has chosen the latter route. Let me first say that the publicist’s blurb has done the book a huge disservice: “The Zone is Interest is a love story with a violently unromantic setting.”Well…no. Or at least, not really. The story is less about love than it is about death: the death of the collective souls of virtually everyone involved: “the malefactors, the collaborators, the witnesses, the conspirators, the outright martyrs…and even the minor obstructors. We all discovered, or helplessly revealed, who we were.”Martin Amis utilizes three main narrators: Golo Thomsen, the nephew of Martin Bormann, a real-life prominent Nazi official and private secretary to Hitler…Paul Doll, the numerically-obsessed and more than slightly crazy Commandant, and Szmul, head of the Sonderkommando, who states, “We are the saddest men in the Lager. We are in fact the saddest men in the history of the world.” It falls on his shoulders to send other Jews to the gas chambers and to ferret out their “riches” after the dirty deed is done.Golo Thomsen lusts after Paul Doll’s wife, Hannah, who likely reciprocates his feelings -- which comprises the barebones of the promised “love story.” In reality, self-love – or any love – has difficulty surviving here. The book’s main focus, I believe, is more focused on the banality of evil, the sheer stupidity of it, the ludicrousness of those unimaginable years.In his afterword, Martin Amis quotes a Jewish-American writer, Michael Andre Bernstein, who states that “dealing with the Nazi genocide is central to our self-understanding.” Mr. Amis seems to imply that we can deal with the Holocaust but never reach that point of understanding: how, after all, can a sane person understand forcing victims to pay their own fare to get to Auschwitz, for example? For those who wonder why we need “one more Holocaust book”, read The Zone of Interest.

On one hand, his prose is meticulously crafted, lovingly rendered, and it’s clear from the very first sentence that the reader is in the hands of a master. On the other hand, there’s something a little detached and reserved about his plotting and characters, keeping me at a respectful distance.Nora Webster goes further than his past books to draw readers like me in, although the gap still remains. There are no fireworks here: Nora Webster’s beloved husband Maurice dies before his time, leaving his widow to sort through the debris – two daughters who are of university age, two young sons (including Donal, a sensitive boy who stutters and may be partially based on the author himself.)There is insightful beauty in the almost stream-of-consciousness of Nora’s life: “It was not the solitude she had been going through, nor the moments when she felt his death like a shock to her system, as though she had been in a car accident, it was this wandering in a sea of people with the anchor lifted, and all of it, oddly pointless and confusing.”The book shines the most in the interactions of Nora and Donal, both of whom are solitary and waiting for a new life to begin to take shape. Nora reflects, “…how easy it might have been to have been someone else, that having the boys at home waiting for her, and the bed and the lamp beside her bed, and her work in the morning, were all a sort of accident.” She struggles quite literally to find her voice as she belatedly pursues her dream of being a singer. Similarly, Donal hides behind his camera – where images at first are underexposed – and connects to the world through it.As Nora emerges from Maurice’s shadow – and Donal emerges from his mother’s – we begin to see the possible trajectory of their lives. Or do we? As Nora’s singing teacher says on hearing of Nora’s dream to sing, “We can all have plenty of lives, but there are limits.” Colm Toibin’s insistence on being true to life – life relentlessly moves forward with its share of unfair moments, sadness and joys – elevates this book among so many others who force false dramatic epiphanies. Still, as a very open person, I couldn’t help but feel the way I do when meeting a self-described “private person” – as if I were being held just a tad at arm’s length. That is the intention, but I’m not so sure it was satisfying – for me....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Nov 05, 2014","Nov 10, 2014","Jul 23, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21412360-nora-webster

Few Americans are intimately familiar with the embattled post-World War II Taiwan – once Japanese-occupied and now given to the Nationalist Chinese as a sort of booby prize. But the history is lush and heartbreaking and Julie Wu has a great chance to educate her readers.The novel centers on two key characters – Saboro, the least favored third son of a self-important father and his love Yoshiko, who shuns the advances of his oldest and mean-spirited brother who is on a fast track to success. After suffering through a childhood straight out of Dickens, Saboro wins a coveted engineering scholarship to the United States, right at the time when American scientists are in full fervor over the space program.This debut novel explores the dualities that continually pull Sabaro in different directions – “aware of convention but burdened by it”…pulled by the traditional legacies of family and the personal freedoms of American life…of reaching his most-cherished goals while feeling tethered to his responsibilities as a new husband and father. On another level, it’s about the brutalities and limitations of the past and the promise of a limitless future.Julie Wu writes in an engaging and fluid style that draws the reader in with her often riveting story of a man who beats the odds. The biggest problem, for me is that Saburo’s trajectory began to strain credibility. Almost like Forrest Gump, he is consistently in the right place at the right time, and always managing to prevail in the most strained moments. On one hand, I found myself rooting for him and hoping that he would emerge a winner; on the other, I began to almost wish he had stronger setbacks that mimicked what would likely happen in real life.I recommend this journey to others, especially for the insights into Taiwanese life and politics, which ring very authentic, and for the fine writing.

He never revisits the same plot lines and themes twice. So I always find that a new book of his is cause for celebration.The Children Act is short, spare and yet rich – Enduring Love and On Chesil Beach come to mind. It centers on England’s 1989 Children Act, which placed the welfare of children as the court’s paramount consideration.Judge Fiona Maye – “My Lady” – has reason to come head-to-head with the Children Act. Near 60, highly regarded in her career, she has had her share of difficult cases and has recently shut down emotionally and physically with her husband of many years. As she contemplates the impending dissolution of her long-time marriage, she is given a case: a teenager named Adam, who is three months away from the age of consent, has chosen (along with his parents) to forego life-saving blood transfusions because he is a Jehovah’s Witness.Ian McEwan explores broader themes than whether blind adherence to a cultish religion is acceptable. In fact, he takes pains to show both sides of the story rather than falling back on stereotypes. The overriding themes are these: if welfare equates to well-being and interests, how is welfare best served in a case like this? Should there be protection against religion? When a judge steps into the grown-up role and makes life-altering decisions, how responsible is she for the aftermath? What accountability does she share? Or, as Ian McEwan so beautifully writes, “Without faith, how open and beautiful and terrifying the world must have seemed…”This is a book that will divide those who believe in blind yet sincerely-held faith and those who believe in the meaning that only free-thinking, not the supernatural, can give. It will further divide those who believe the secular court has gone too far in eroding religious rights and those who feel it hasn’t gone nearly far enough. It will, however, unite readers who enjoy provocative topics....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Aug 19, 2014","Aug 21, 2014","Jul 18, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21965107-the-children-act

He can skillfully mine the levels of the subconscious and create images that will haunt your dreams. Just as easily, he can dive into the darkest of areas and sometimes create metaphorical conundrums that can provoke lively conversations among his readers.This is my way of saying that I was prepared for yet another excavation into the surreal. Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki does maintain many of Mr. Murakami’s signature flourishes but it is also the most accessible and even linear book he’s written in a long time – perhaps since Norwegian Wood. Once I began it, I couldn’t put it down.The plot centers on five very intertwined childhood friends; all literally have names that translate to colors that connect to nature. Aka is red pine, Ao is blue sea, Shiro is white root and Kuro is black field. Only Tsukuru is colorless in every sense of the word, yet he is happy being “locked up inside the perfection of that circle.” Early on in the book, all four of his friends ostracize him without explanation, leading him to a profound depression. Now a man of 36, Tsukuru realizes that “you can hide memories, but you can’t erase the history that produced them.”Tsukuru – which translates into “the builder” – is a builder of railroad stations whose life has derailed and who has become “a refugee from his own life.” Poised at last on the precipice of giving himself emotionally to a woman, he must first give to himself. Inspired by a musical composition by Liszt – the Years of Pilgrimage suite – he recognizes that “one heart is not connected to another through harmony alone. They are, instead, linked deeply through their wounds.” How this all plays out is for the reader to discover. Mr. Murakami wisely – I think – leaves many of his threads unraveled, instead of sewing it all together and handing it to us in a neat little bow. Dispensing this time – at least, for the most part – from the suppressed fantasies, unconscious urges, and disconnects between the unreal and the real, this latest novel is beautifully written with a hypnotic simplicity and with a profundity and grace. Its key themes reminded me of Joseph Campbell’s The Hero’s Journey. It’s bound to appeal not only to diehard Murakami fans like me but also to those who have never had the fortune to read his work....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 22, 2014","Aug 25, 2014","Jul 15, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19288239-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage

At 74 years old, she creates characters who are mostly aging and feisty, bohemian and free-spirited, increasingly self-aware, and ready to correct and revenge the ills done to them in their callow youth.Perhaps the most compelling are the first three tales, which function as a trilogy. The first tale sets the stage: young Constance, the renowned writer of a fantastical series of books about the fictional Alpinland, is the lover of a self-important writer of The Dark Lady poems – a legend in his own mind – named Gavin. The two successive tales let us know what happened to Gavin and his subsequent lovers and worshipers: “It’s like being drawn into a time tunnel; the centrifugal force is irresistible.” The tales are pitch-perfect and mildly satirical, gently skewing writers and our ephemeral lives: “He had a great body,” one character says, “While it lasted.”Two other strong favorites for me are The Freeze-Dried Groom: Sam, an aging con-man whose wife has just tossed him out, bids on an auctioned storage space. What he finds there is far more than he bargained for…and perhaps, exactly what he deserves. The eponymous tale, Stone Mattress, focuses on Verna, a three-time widow who meets the man who raped and humiliated her on an Alaskan cruise. She is avenged by a 1.9 billion-hear-ld stromatolite (the titled stone mattress), in a particularly imaginative revenge fantasy.In the last tale, Torching the Dusties, Ms. Atwood touches on one of the collection’s themes: “You believed you could transcend the body as you aged…You believed you could rise above it, to a serene non-physical realm. But it is only through ecstasy you can do that and ecstasy is achieved through the body itself. Without the bon and sinew of wrings, no flight.” These luminous stories – some of which succeed more than others – Ms. Atwood again helps her readers to soar....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 26, 2014","Jul 30, 2014","Jul 15, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22429563-stone-mattress

In the second of the series, Home, the view changes to John Ames’ best friend, a fellow minister named Boughton, and we meet Lila again through oblique references. In Lila, we finally get to know this enigmatic woman who, quite literally, becomes “the balm of Gilead” for the minister.Here, in this novel, we learn that Lila has lived a hardscrabble life, traveling with a ragtag band of drifters, unable to fully trust or feel safe anywhere. She drifts into Gilead where she meets the much older, thoughtful minister and widower, John Ames, who offers her shelter, kindness, and security through marriage.The biggest question that looms for those of us who have taken Gilead to our hearts is this: “Does the novel Lila live up to its predecessors?” Each reader must answer that question individually, but for me, the answer is complicated.I am unschooled in theology; a friend explained that certain Bible passages that Lila studies with John Ames are extraordinary statements from problematic parts of the Bible. My friend argues convincingly that through their conversations, Lila and Ames teach each other the meaning of existence.Yet I can’t overlook a sort of verbal tic. Lila would make an off-the-cuff statement and over and over again, the next words (referring to Ames) are: “He laughed.” John Ames’ laughter is that of pure joy and recognition; it is neither cruel nor dismissive. Yet somehow, I began to feel that the interaction was one of a doting father to his precocious daughter and that Lila’s view was not quite as meaningful as Ames.A major difference with Gilead is that that book was written in first-person from a gentle minister who was trying to make sense of his life, his humanity and his relationship with God. In this third book, written in third person, he is now in great part a teacher, and even though Lila – the protagonist – is a worthy sparring partner, I couldn’t help but feel that Marilynne Robinson was leading the reader that John Ames’ view was the right one to uphold and it would be a matter of time before Lila agreed.That being said, there is no way I can four-star this book. It is lovely and thoought-provoking and the writing soars; it’s some of the best writing I’ve read all year.

But if any of her previous books are half as compelling and page-turning as The Paying Guest, I have a big treat to look forward to in the near future.To sum it up in three words: it’s a stunner. Any exploration of the plot will spoil the carefully-constructed narrative with its unexpected twists and turns. The bare bones are these: Frances Wright, considered a spinster at age 27 and believed a little “odd” because she is a lesbian, lives with her newly-impoverished mother in an upscale south part of London. Due to the ravages of the first world war, she and her mother are forced to accept lodgers (euphemistically called “paying guests”): a young couple, Leonard and Lilian Barber, of the clerk class. There are fractures in the couple’s marriage and soon, the situation will turn dire and fraught with consequences.Why did I love it? First, the book is psychologically gripping. It alternately deals head-on with the thorniest of moral issues, including guilt, shame, and desperate hidden love. Secondly, the depiction of the postwar social landscape is meticulously painted. The class distinctions, the rise of the clerk class, the pretensions of the upper class, the undeserved elitism, are flawlessly rendered. Historically, too, this book is a winner, revealing the dashed hopes of ex-soldiers, the shifting expectations of the various classes, and the mores and manners of the 1920s. Lastly, the careful look at England’s system of justice seems like it's an anachronism in our high-tech world, and that’s what makes it so very fascinating. It's like being permitted a glimpse into a time-capsule…into a society where everything was markedly different than it is today.Exquisitely atmospheric, filled with psychological nuances, and laden with anticipation and suspense, The Paying Guests is a “can’t-put-down” read, told by a consummate storyteller.

These are a couple of the questions that are posed in Brazilian writer Michael Laub’s spare and shimmering new book, Diary of the Fall.The narrator is two generations removed from Auschwitz, a privileged boy who is attending a nearly all-Jewish school. His grandfather, an Auschwitz survivor, kept multiple notebooks filled with the most banal and Pollyanna-ish descriptions of his life after leaving the concentration camp…only to end his life while the narrator’s father was at a tender young age. The narrator’s father – in struggling to make sense of this tragedy – inundates his son with persecution tales that shape his thinking.And then there’s the fall: literally and figuratively. The narrator spearheads a cruel practical joke, severely injuring his non-Jewish classmate Joao who is tossed into the air 13 times during his manhood year and deliberately dropped on the final count.. The narrator reflects, “My father – with his stories about the Holocaust and the Jewish renaissance and the obligation of every Jew in the world to defend himself using whatever means he had – was in some way responsible for Joao, making him the enemy that will always be there before you…”The narrator, like his grandfather (and his father) writes his own text through this book, which consists of numbered paragraphs and frequent repetition of key events. The questions raised in this book are highly introspective: what role does memory serve, what do we recall and forget, and how do we deal with guilt, forgiveness and redemption. Translated beautifully by Margaret Jull Costa (and through time, I’ve learned that translation is so important in the appreciation of international literature), this book focuses on three generations affected by the long shadow of Auschwitz: the grandfather, whose memoir is about “how the world should be”, the father, whose own memoir is about “how things really were” and the son, who is struggling with the question, “is human experience really viable.” It’s a fine book. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,not set,"Jul 08, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19335805-diary-of-the-fall

OIt’s no accident that Emily St. John Mandel opens her haunting new novel with a scene from King Lear, who ends up mad and blind but clear as a bell. One of that play’s memorable lines is: “The oldest hath borne most; we that are young/Shall never see so much nor live so long.”Indeed, there is a divide between those who have borne much and those who will never see so much. In the opening pages, renowned actor Arthur Leander dies while performing King Lear. Before the week is out, the vast majority of the audience – indeed, the world – will be dead from the pandemic Georgia flu.There are two key story lines – one before the end of civilization and one after it. The first focuses on Arthur, along with his three ex-wives, best friend Clark, and Jeevan, a one-time paparazzo and good Samaritan, who tries to save him. The other line centers on Kirstin, a young girl who witnessed Arthur’s death, who is now part of a Traveling Symphony, a musical theatre troupe that roams the wasted land to bring music and Shakespeare to the limited number of people who remain…not unlike original Shakespeare actors during plague-filled days of the past.Woven into these tales is the inspiration for the book’s title. Arthur’s first wife, Miranda (likely based on the character from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, who utters, “O brave new world, That has such people in’t!”) She is the writer and designer of a sci-fi graphic comic, with threads of what eventually happens on earth: “There are people who, after fifteen years of perpetual twilight, long only to go home, to return to Earth and beg for amnesty; to take their chances under alien rule. They live in the Undersea, an interlined network of vast fallout shelters under Station Eleven’s oceans.”Station Eleven is a terrifying, haunting, and stunning book that speaks eloquently on many key themes: survival during devastating times, our ephemeral existence and the fleeting nature of fame compared to the endurance of art. Indeed, it is only our shared stories – from Shakespeare to graphic books – that ties us all together, connects us and makes us human. After turning the last page, I sat completely still for a minute, stunned, before taking my dogs out. While outside, I was driven to tears by the beauty of the fireflies lighting up against a dark Chicago night. Station Eleven – in many ways, a psalm of appreciation for the simple things in our current existence – wields THAT sort of power.

Yet he becomes increasingly despondent; he meets no one worth devoting his life to. One day, a child appears requesting passage. Even though the child is small, he seems so heavy that Christopher feels like he is carrying the weight of the world.The child reveals himself as Christ. And the Professor ends his tale with these words: “Each of you is both Christopher and the child he carries on his back. You are all forging your way through adversity in this difficult world on your way to the other side of the river…You will think that the thing you choose will serve as your boat or raft to carry you to that other bank. But if you think deeply about it, you may find that it does not carry you but rather you carry it.”I’ve spent so much time on the novel’s beginning because this it is the key to the Kyung-Sook Shin’s writing. Set in South Korea in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the book has political (not religious) underpinnings: university students are protesting against the new dictatorship. Yet the heart of the story is only peripherally about the political situation; it’s mostly about those on the cusp of adulthood who carry emotional scars too deep to allow them the solace of selfless love and connection.Jung Yoon, the main narrator, is emotionally damaged by the premature death of her mother. Her deepest connection is with Dahn, her childhood male friend. In college, she begins to fall for Myungsuh, who, in an inverse relationship, cares deeply for his female friend, Miru, who harbors her own disturbing loss. These damaged individuals struggle to come together – and at times, actually do – while at the same time, feel torn apart by the cruelties and capriciousness of the world they live in.The Professor, whose appearance bookmarks the story, reminds his students, “Every time that enormous weight presses down on us and the waters of the river rise over our throats and we want to give up and slip beneath the surface, remember: as heavy as the loads we shoulder is the world we tread upon.” Or put another way, the only real choice is to “love and fight and rage and grieve and live.”Those who read Please Look After Mom – Kyung-Sook Shin’s breakout book in the U.S. market – will find this book to be very different from her first book, yet with the trademark intelligence and insights that made it such a compelling read....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jun 17, 2014","Jun 23, 2014","Jun 17, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18209505-i-ll-be-right-there

In Laird Hunt’s brilliantly conceived novel, Constance Thompson – renamed Ash – disguises herself as a man and takes on the role of Union solider in the Civil War. (Of her husband, she says: “I was strong and he was not, so it was me went to war to defend the Republic.”)But is it as simple as that? Ash Thompson seems to be harboring some secrets. How much truth is she revealing to us? Is she an ultimate unreliable narrator?Laird Hunt offers up an original and confident voice and dialect, and is consistently in command of his material. The prose is beautifully crafted and near flawless. (The only flaw is that I had some qualms about whether this was a true female voice or a male-author-channeling-a-female voice).It has a lot to say about the false glorification of the Civil War (Ash reflects, “In these stories women are saints and angels and men are courageous noble folk and everything they do gets done nice and quick and nothing smells like blood.”) There’s the stuff of legend and the stuff of reality…the lure of adventure and the lure of home… the roles we’re born into and the roles we invent for ourselves to play. It’s a fine book and I rate it 4.5 stars. I do have one nitpick: Laird Hunt mentions Kettering, Ohio on the very first page; actually, that town got its name in 1955, way after the Civil War. ...more",Notes are private!,1,17,1,"Jun 15, 2014","Jun 17, 2014","Jun 15, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20454109-neverhome

It’s not even past.”This line is certainly true for Amina, a once promising photojournalist who was traumatized by the events leading to her most famous picture – a Native American activist deliberately plunging over a bridge. Since then, Amina has been navigating her own bridges into adulthood. At 30 years old, she works as a wedding photographer, deals with her dysfunctional parents Kamala and Thomas, and struggles to integrate core tragedies of her past.With a keen eye towards the messiness of family interactions, Ms. Jacob weaves her narrative back and forth from Seattle – where Amina currently lives – to Albuquerque (the home of her parents) and to India, the land of their ancestry. Some might embrace the overused term “immigrant experience”, but for me, this was the experience of any family who struggled with ties that do not let go and relationships that cannot be forgotten. The novel – tenderly written and often page-turning – tackles the themes of familial bonds, grief survival and self-forgiveness. There is not only plenty of food (Kamala never ceases to create sumptuous meals even during the most stressful occasions) but also food for thought in this beautifully-written novel. At times, Kamala and Thomas are written a little too broadly and comically; for the most part, though, the characters are authentic and lovingly rendered.And the sleepwalking? Yes, one of the characters quite literally sleepwalks, but the broader theme might be how we all must eventually stop sleepwalking and take hold of our visions.

But it could as easily apply to the Cartwright family – seven living sons and one daughter in the fictional town of Struan, near Crow Lake, in the backwoods of northern Ontario at the end of the 1960s.The narrative shifts between three family members – patriarch Edward (written in the first person), who is curiously absent from his family life; Tom, the eldest son and drifter, who abandons a promising career in aeronautical engineering after the suicide of his best friend; and Megan, the foundation of the family, who finally escapes from voluntary servitude to a life in London.The choice of Edward as a first person narrator is deliberate; he holds the key to the disintegration of the family as he struggles with his past, diving into his mother’s diaries and calling forth memories of an abusive father. All three of these characters are struggling to reach (or escape) from their potential, but the focus of the book is Megan, whose story is that of every woman who strives to redefine her role – indeed, to redefine herself – as the consequences of her departure echo throughout her family.“If you kept walking south and east eventually you would hit civilization; if you kept walking north and west you would hit Crow Lake, where the road comes to an end,” one character muses. It’s a fine metaphor for the Cartwrights, who, in some essential ways, have come to the end of the road and who are muddling forth to find direction.As in Mary Lawson’s past novels, the writing is beautifully authentic…the themes of family loyalty and personal sacrifice versus freedom and self-actualization are convincingly rendered…and the characters are achingly real.

They enfold us in their world and make us step outside of ourselves and become transformed. And sometimes, if we’re really lucky, they ennoble and affirm us.The Narrow Road to the Deep North is such a book. Once I got past the first 60 or 70 pages, there was no turning back. I turned the last page marveling at Mr. Flanagan’s skill and agreeing with historian Barbara Tuchman that, “Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science cripples, thought and speculation at a standstill.” The Narrow Road is based on an actual event: the building of the Thai-Burma death railway in 1943 by POWs commanded to the Japanese. The title comes from famed haiku poet Matsuo Basho’s most famous work and sets up a truism of the human condition: even those who can admire the concise and exquisite portrayal of life can become the agents of death.The key character, Australian surgeon Dorrigo Evans, is also a study in contradictions: a man called “Big Fella” who protects those under his command from starvation, heinous deceases and senseless dehumanizing while struggling with his own demons. The passages are haunting and heartbreaking: the skeletal bodies covered in their own excretement, the bulging ulcers, the breaking of mind and spirit. Yet Mr. Flanagan does not depict these scenes to shock the reader. Rather, he reveals the senselessness of it all: “Nothing endures. Don’t you see? That’s what Kipling meant. Not empires, not memories. We remember nothing. Maybe for a year or two. Maybe most of a life, if we live. Maybe. But then we will die, and who will ever understand any of this?”And later: “For an instant, he thought he grasped the truth of a terrifying world in which one could not escape horror, in which violence was eternal, the great and only verity, greater than the civilizations it created, greater than any god man worshipped.” Richard Flanagan implies again and again that only books and poems survive.One of the book’s strengths is that it never resorts to “us” and “them.” After depositing us in the midst of hell, he delivers us back to a post-war world where Japanese and POWs alike struggle to justify and endure. The only weakness is an overwrought love affair at the beginning of the book but to Richard Flanagan’s credit, he doesn’t take the easy way out in crafting its culmination.The dedication – to prisoner san byaku san ju go (335) was so enticing I Googled it, only to find that the prisoner alluded to was actually Richard Flanagan’s father. As he states early on when describing the unofficial national war memorial commemorating the railroad, “There are no names of the hundreds of thousands who died building the railway…Their names are already forgotten. There is no book for their lost souls. Let them have this fragment.” Richard Flanagan does honor to these unsung heroes....more",Notes are private!,0,117,1,Jun 2014,"Jun 03, 2014","Jun 01, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17905709-the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north

My  begins after the First, I am very grateful to the Goodreads FirstReads program and to Little Brown for enabling me to be an advance reader. My  begins after the close of the book. In his epilogue, David Bezmozgis discusses the difference between journalism and fiction writing. He has this to say: “Journalism is reportage, and therefore retrospective. The novelist who tackles social and political phenomena has quite a different position. He must posit a world and commit to it fully. He cannot merely describe – he must anticipate an outcome, if only a little.”Mr. Bezmozgis could not have anticipated the flare-up in Israel when he wrote this book. Unfortunately, there are zealots who will note his character – Baruch Kotler, a Soviet Jewish hero and fierce advocate of the settlements, now an Israeli politician laid low by a smear campaign – and will one-star this book without reading further.That would be a crime. The Betrayers is a thoughtful and insightful book – a moral book – whose themes are timeless and universal. It’s also a beautifully written book that provides much food for thought about what it means to hold to one’s principles…and whether it’s better to be a saint who “loved the world more than any single person” or a “man who loved one single person more than the whole world.”Baruch Kotler is indeed saint-like; some might call him stubborn or even rigid. He does not sacrifice his principles even if his very life is at stake. After spending many years in jail – as the result of a former friend who denounces him to the KGB – he emerges as an Israeli hero. But when photos reveal that he has taken on a much younger lover, the couple is forced to flee to a Crimean resort. (All this is set up in the first several pages.) There, Baruch and Leora end up confronting the very friend who was the cause of Baruch’s misery years ago.The book explores major themes: is being moral always being right? Is there such a thing as absolute truth? Can rigid morality cause more harm than good? Are we all guilty of something, to a degree? Is ""character"" in-bred and is it possible for someone not born with character to acquire it? Are there different definitions of “doing right”, depending on what could be lost? What are the different ways we betray each other? (Mr. Bezmozgis writes, “…guilt and innocence were not fixed marks. There were extenuating circumstances. Wasn’t that the governing logic of the times?”) The Betrayers will make you think. It will also make you feel. Any book that can do that – and do it through wonderfully crafted prose and believable characters – is a 5-star book for me....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Aug 12, 2014","Aug 14, 2014","May 27, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18741817-the-betrayers

On the surface, he provides attentive care, but underneath, he’s simmering with a nearly pathological hatred of the human body. (Or, in his own words: “Despite my distaste of the human body, I had always done my work well. For twenty minutes, I would wear my most understanding expression.”)He,is, in ways, almost the polar opposite of Ralph Meier, a famous actor who is his patient with a rapacious and sometimes uncontrollable appetite for the body…at least, the female kind. From the opening pages, we know that something has gone terribly wrong between them: Ralph is dead and Marc is being investigated for “medical error.”The rest of the book uncovers the “whys” of the fatal interaction between these oversized egos at Ralph’s summer home in the Mediterranean. There, the Schlossers (Marc, his wife Caroline, and his two teen and pre-teen daughters whom he dotes on), the Meiers (Ralph and his wife Judith) and a legendary sociopathic film director and his barely of-age exquisite girlfriend.Get three sociopathic and narcissistic men together and things are bound to unnerve. As Marc muses, “Sometimes you run your life back to see at what point it could have taken a different turn. But sometimes there’s nothing at all to run back – you yourself don’t know it yet, but the only button that’s still working is forward.”It’s up to the reader to learn what he’s referring to. This is a page-turning psychological suspense novel, with intriguing undercurrents of Dutch medicine and euthanasia, the lies we tell ourselves, the objectification of young girls, our worship of celebrity status and much more.

My Salinger Year made me understand – all over again – why J.D. Salinger was such a phenomenon…”because the experience of reading a Salinger story is less than reading a short story and more like having Salinger himself whisper his accounts into your year.”But make no mistake, this book is not about J.D. Salinger. Not really. It’s about Joanna Rakoff, but it could be about any young woman, straight out of college, naïve and wishful, striving to get in touch with what’s authentic and what’s real.For Ms. Rakoff, that means taking a job with sub-standard pay at a literary agency called the Agency – although just a little bit of Googling reveals that the Agency is Harold Ober Associates, a venerable agency that represented J.D. Salinger. There she worked for Phyllis Westberg (referred to as “my boss”) who fiercely protected his privacy and his legend.Young Joanna, living with her socialist would-be writer boyfriend, Don in a dumpy Wiliamsburg apartment, spends her days on her Selectric and Dictaphone…right at the time when more forward-thinking agencies have invested in computers. One of her tasks is to respond to J.D. Salinger’s many fervent fans through an Agency form letter; quickly, she abandons that practice and surreptiously begins writing her own heartfelt responses.Eventually, it dawns on us what “My Salinger Year” really means. It’s not just a year of spent responding to the voluminous and candid fan mail…and sometimes, speaking with “Jerry” himself. It’s also understanding the ongoing significance of Salinger in her life: “To somehow find a way to live in a world that sickens her. To be her authentic self. To not be the person the world is telling her to be, the girl who must bury her intelligence…who must compromise herself in order to live.” That’s not just a description of Franny. It’s an apt description of Joanna Rakoff. Indeed, these are sentences that can apply to each of us.

How can you not laugh out loud with this special promotional feature sponsored by the St. Renard Ministry of Tourism (“Finally, don’t leave St. Renard without sampling the delicacies of our bright blue sea.

It is unrelentingly dark and full of moral ambiguity.At the center of the novel is Pete, an unlikely long haired social worker in Tenmile, Montana, who has made a mess of marriage and fatherhood. His recalcitrant brother is on the lam, and he can’t even count his friends on one hand. He describes himself this way to his ex-wife: “I take kids away from people like us.”When a pre-teen, partially feral boy – Benjamin Pearl – crosses his path, he becomes involved in the lives of the boy and his mistrustful father, Jeremiah, a paranoid survivalist who believes in the End of Days and the evilness of the government. (“The devil, I know how he comes. With cans of food and fresh clothes and coloring books.”)As Pete tries to help Jeremiah and Benjamin and another out-of-control boy, Cecil, the son of an abusive mother, his own daughter dives into the underbelly of an uncaring and evil world. As one of the boys disappears into the system and the other into the Montana wilderness, the realization comes to light that “these absences were twinned in Pete’s mind as if the one could not be solved without the other, and he harbored the absurd hope that the revelation of the one would reveal the other.”Fourth of July Creek has a lot to say about a lot of issues: where is the thin line between those who want to help and those who shun society’s help? Is protection always the right thing if it means sacrificing liberty and being forced into faulty institutional venues? Are we – quite literally – our brothers’ keepers? Do we have a right to legislate – or even interfere with – those who live outside of the norm, even if they choose a life of paranoia?The writing is confident – brilliant in places – but not for the faint of heart. As an interesting aside, Smith Henderson, a debut author, wrote the Emmy-nominated Super Bowl commercial “Halftime in America” (featuring Clint Eastwood). ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"May 13, 2014","May 19, 2014","May 13, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18651980-fourth-of-july-creek

Francesca Marciano’s nine stories are so beautifully realized, so breathtaking in their scope, that I lost track of time while under their spell.“After seven years of European lie, she found herself smiling at the predicament she’d found herself in. It was a reminder that there were still places in the world where one could vanish, be lost, be found and rescued by strangers,” Ms. Marciano writes in one of her stories.Indeed, each one is, in its own way, a study of reinvention: of suddenly becoming visible or invisible, of uncovering elusive truths in exotic locales, of turning one’s back on a tedious past, of recognizing the person one was meant to be.In the Presence of Men – perhaps my favorite o the collection – a divorced woman named Lara attempts to reinvent herself in a charming and innocent Italian village. There she befriends an older woman, an extraordinary local seamstress. Yet when her brother arrives in town, accompanied by a famous actor, the ragged seams of the unspoiled town begin to reveal itself.In another, Indian Soiree, an unmoored writer and his dissatisfied wife travel to India, where both begin to question the solidarity and trust of their relationship and who they really are. “The feeling they both had was of a tidal wave that kept gaining speed and had crashed upon them before they could take cover,” the author writes,’’And, in the eponymous story, The Other Language, three young children travel from Rome to Greece with their father after the sudden death of their mother. “It impressed the children and seemed to cheer them up as if this time of greatest loss would coincide with the promise of a richer and more exciting lie. As if, by losing their mother, they had been promoted to a higher level of lifestyle.” Many years later, the middle child reflects on what she lost…and more importantly, what she gained.There is not one mediocre story in this entire marvelous collection. Whether Francesca Marciano is writing about a penny-pinching Venetian woman who splurges on a Chanel dress that becomes a lifetime talisman or about a hermetic man who lives in a small island in Africa where he is found by a past girlfriend, the insights are extraordinary. (“Maybe he has chosen this place to venture inward rather than expand, since everything here – the people, the buildings, even the geography – lacks beauty and brilliance”).Do I love this book? You bet! For anyone who gets enthused about internal or external journeys or who are prepared to believe that “one always had to be prepared for anything to happen”, this is a short story collection that will resonate long after you close the pages....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Apr 24, 2014","Apr 26, 2014","Apr 24, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18209281-the-other-language

For a character-based reader like me, this luminous debut book is sheer manna from heaven. It’s certain to make my personal Top Ten list of 2014.The concept is deceptively simple: an 11-year-old boy named Justin goes missing one day and is likely abducted. His parents, Eric and Laura, and his younger brother Griffin are all well-liked in their Corpus Christi community; they muddle their way through the four ensuing years, coming apart personally and as a family. And then (no spoiler – it’s in every book blurb), Justin is found.And there’s where the happy ending comes in. Except…it’s not. The genius of this author is that – without any manipulation – he closely examines what the granting of this fortuitous return really means to each of them. The emotions are so real that the writing took my breath away. Take this description of his mother, Laura: “Those four years had gutted her family. How could she not understand such hideous gravity? Everywhere she looked, the absolute and crushing weight of the past. At times she’d been bloated with sadness, leaden and unmovable. Other times, she would have sworn she was a sieve.” And later: “Life started to feel – what? Not normal. Not familiar. Inhabitable. Navigable.”There is not one false note in this book. Not one. The writing is assured, confident and clear eyed; the characters are so real they could step out of the pages; and the insights are organic and beautifully realized. There are no huge surprises or “drama for the sake of drama”. These are all good people, regular and steady and seemingly unafflicted. They’re people who – in the aftermath of one of life’s worst traumas— take cautious and struggling steps to deal with a range of unexpected emotions and work mightily to make themselves whole again. It’s not the mythic Hollywood ending to a kidnapping; rather, it’s an achingly intimate view into the emotional canvas of a family damaged by circumstances beyond their control. I simply cannot recommend this book highly enough. I envy those who are starting it for the first time....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Apr 22, 2014","Apr 24, 2014","Apr 22, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18112175-remember-me-like-this

Here are Amy Bloom’s first lines: “My father’s wife died. My mother said we should drive down to his place and see what might be in it for us.”How can you resist a book that starts like that? And the good news is, the prose and cadence remain consistently good throughout Lucky Us.The author of Love Reinvents Us focuses again on the themes of love, reinvention…and also, the families we’re born into and the families we choose. Eva, our first-person narrator, and her half-sister Iris are plucky young women, coming of age in 1940s America. As they stumble their way through scandals, unusual turns-of-events, heartbreaks and more, Eva’s grandmother’s words resonate: “It’s good to be smart, it’s better to be lucky.”In the hands of a less assured writer, some of the plot twists might strain credibility. One of the key characters embraces her essence as a gay woman; another woman – a black singer – becomes involved with a white man. We’re talking the 1940s – a decade before the McCarthy era – yet although there is censure, the outrage and moralizing of that decade is muted and the acceptance comes without much cost. Would that it had been so!Also, some of the narrative is punctuated by epistolary entries, primarily from Gus, a character who plays an increasingly significant role, to the teenage Eva. The letters retained the tone of the narrative; I did not see them as the distinctive voice of Gus. In fact this character – who truly is reinvented time and time again – and his enchantment with Eva through the decade did not quite seem organic to me.The strength of the writing and the story were such that I never – not for a minute – wanted to abandon this book despite these perceived flaws. The ability of these characters to redefine – no, reinvent – their definition of family and indeed, their definition of the future – is what will remain with me. It’s not perfect, but it’s a darn good book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Apr 18, 2014","Apr 21, 2014","Apr 17, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18316089-lucky-us

They are referred to as “the wife” and “the husband”, or by pronouns, but they could just as easily be you and me.The arc of the story is told in fragments and could be anyone’s arc. A writer in Brooklyn falls n love, married, has a colicky child, combats bedbugs, becomes an outsider in her own marriage, and muddles through the bad times. Her domestic life and her creative life vacillate between being rewarding and demanding. Each fragment exists unto itself but also contributes to a larger whole – not unlike life itself.There’s a raw energy in these fragments, which invoke sayings from Yeats, Keats, Kafka and Einstein as well as snippets of Russian cosmonauts, Buddhist and Manichean beliefs and more, seamlessly and organically woven in so none of it never seems out of place.Jenny Offill is a confident writer; many astute readers will note the point of view shifts (from “me and you” to “she and him” to “us.” There are psychological insights and very real observations about the universal pursuit of intimacy, love, knowledge, pain, and the vacillations of life.

Is everything in our life controlled by an all-knowing creator who bends the future in any way that he – or she—wishes? or do things happen more or less randomly based on free will?Azelea Lewis, the key character of this novel, is the Queen of Coincidences. Her life is shaped by a series of uncanny events, starting from the time she was three years old and found wandering a fairground in England on Midsummer’s Day, 1982. Later, on Midsummer’s Day 1992, the couple that adopted Azelea are presumed killed by Uganda’s cult-like Lord’s Resistance Army. And the coincidences just keep piling up from there.Her lover and nemesis is Thomas Post, a respected academic who uncovers the scientific explanation behind so-called coincidences. In particularly fascinating prose, Thomas debunks some of our most widely-known and oft-repeated historical coincidences in an attempt to show that the universe is, in fact, random.This book will make you think about the concepts of pre-destination versus free will. Can anyone change the way the universe will unravel? Or have we humans tapped into a clever mechanism that allows us to enter our own will into the equation? And in the end, does it all even matter?

HerLily King has traveled a long way from the emotional territory she journeyed to in Father of the Rain…all the way to Papua New Guinea, circa 1932. Here she sets up her characters – the American anthropologist Nell, inspired by Margaret Mead…her mercurial Aussie husband Fen…and our narrator, Bankson, an emotionally damaged Brit who has been studying a river tribe for many years.All have arrived at this destination with their emotional baggage. Nell has written a controversial best-seller about Samoan child-raising and is dealing with fertility issues. Fen is suffering professional envy and he doesn’t want to study the natives as well as become one. And Bankson? Haunted by the death of his two older brothers, feeling alone and isolated, he is primed to ignite a firestorm in their lives.The key is establishing and maintaining a precarious form of balance. As Nell writes in her journal, “…there is something about finding the balance to one’s nature – perhaps a culture that flourishes is a culture that has found a similar balance amongst its people.”But balances can quickly toppled. A triangle, by its very nature, suggests unbalance and the personalities of Nell and Bankson stand in contrast to the often out-of-control nature of Fen. As they struggle with their own inadequacies (Bankson says: “…I am bad luck in the field, utterly ineffective. I couldn’t even manage to kill myself properly”), they also risk overturning the carefully-honed balances of another culture.The book has a lot to say about these cultural balances, presenting Ruth Benedict (a real-life anthropologist who wrote Patterns of Culture) as an offstage presence. Every culture has its own unique goals and orients its society in the direction of these goals. What happens when our own egos and greed begin to countermand these goals? As in many journeys, there are times when the book veers off-course. The tribe that Nell studies, the Tam, is female-dominated and sexually aware, throwing a match on the physical feelings that are smoldering among the three. There are times when it seems that the book becomes a little off balance: is the main focus the passionate love triangle, is it the way that the study of native cultures changes those who study it? Both can be included but it’s hard to have it both ways.This territory (strangers in a strange land) has been explored in other books: Ann Patchett’s State of Wonder, Barbara Kingsolver’s Poisonwood Bible and Mischa Berlinski’s excellent Fieldwork, to name three.

But don’t let that deter you; it’s also one of the finest novels I’ve read in a long, long time.The narrator – Jack Gorse -- is a damaged man, who once had a promising future as the only son of an affluent theater couple and, in his own right, an up-and-coming lawyer. Today he lives alone, illegally, in a soon-to-be-demolished apartment building without heat or creature comforts. The only thing that keeps him going is his structure and routines and his walks through Central Park. Likely an obsessive-compulsive, he becomes nonplussed when anything interrupts his simple life.And soon, something does, when he meets up with an architect named Patrick, who brings to the surface a lot of confused feelings he is ill-equipped to deal with.So what is an understory? As Jack reflects on one of his walks: “I like bare as well as lush, probably better. What speaks to me most is close to the ground: the shrubs and vines, rather than the great elms, oaks, and maples. The understory, as botanists call it…It is the shrubs that allow the park to survive.”Jack’s story is the understory of New York; he is one of the easily discountable individuals who, with his bare life, is akin to the shrubs and vines that allow the rest of the city to move on. He is overlooked and under-appreciated and is only interested in living, not thriving. In many ways, he is “at one” with nature.From the start, the reader feels the vibrations of a life that is increasingly becoming destabilized. The plotting is almost inevitable, and flows organically from that premise. The narration is pitch-perfect and Ms. Erens manages to navigate that difficult task of building sympathy and compassion for someone who, through his actions and his confusion, may not be all that likeable. This is a wonderful novel without a word or a scene that’s misplaced.

When I talked about it with other people…The episode is the anticipation of something more. But there was nothing more, he rang the doorbell that day, and after that he disappeared.”The opening sets the stage for the episodic quality of this novel. Drama is always lurking beneath the surface – and sometimes rises to the surface with the clear sense that something bad is about to happen, but this isn’t a novel about action; it’s a novel about inaction.Eva and her husband are an elderly Norwegian…and now he’s mute, a metaphor of the history of silence the two of them have shared. She muses, “Underneath everything, the house, the children, all the years of movement and unrest, there has been, this silence. That it has simply risen to the surface, pushed by external changes.”Over and over, themes and motifs rise and fall again: both individual and societal retreats into unconscionable silence. The abandonment of those who deserve love and caring (whether it’s a child, a dog, or an entire people). The need to seek comfort and refuge and the failure of faith. Perhaps most of all, the search for an authentic self-narrative.I thought this book was absolutely brilliant, beautifully atmospheric and crafted, insightfully focused on the repercussions of secret-keeping and missed connections, with a remote yet descriptive style that perfectly captures every scene.

There’s a ring of authenticity to his books and insights that, for me, call to mind Graham Greene. For me, American Romantic ranks among his very finest.Foreign services officer Harry Sanders is at the beginning of his career, yet realizes that his “fate was to witness events I didn’t understand and would never understand.” He is the American Romantic personified, clear-eyed enough to recognize the shifting reality of his role and yet pursuing it anyway. Early on, he is tapped for a potentially dangerous and sensitive mission, to meet with the enemies who may or may not be ready to begin a dialogue. The ensuing events could only be written by an author who is in-the-know and can carefully craft the intricacies of a diplomatic mission and its nuances.We see Harry not only though his own eyes, but through those of his lover, a young German woman, Sieglinde, who is far more advanced in knowing what the world is all about. About Americans, Sieglinde says, “They take pride in their makeovers, a nation of actors, or should I say playwrights, each examining her own story. That’s the myth, anyhow. A nation in an eternal state of rewrite.” Although she views Harry as “a lovely man”, she knows instinctively that he is limited: “He was not as interested in his history as I was in mine.” Put another way, Harry is incapable of a certain perceptiveness. When Sieglinde tells a fellow German that Americans are romantic, he counters, “I would not say romantic. I would say optimistic. Yet it is true that optimism is a precondition of the American temperment.”In the second half of the book, set in the present, Harry has taken his place in the diplomatic community as an ambassador. He has married an attractive woman from Vermont named May (the only character who did not ring quite true to me) and has begun to recognize what he cannot recognize: “American was a parallax universe, powerful, hypnotic in its own way, quarrelsome and petulant, and irrelevant to him. His birth country had become thing of curiosity; the farther away from it, the more dangerous it seemed. A matter of optics.”American Romantic is, at the same time, accessible and dense, with disquieting and acute observations of how our romanticism and optimism doom us to repeat scenarios – from Vietnam to Afghanistan. It’s a brilliantly written book and a strong indication that Ward Just – who is close to 80 years old – is far from slowing down. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 02, 2014","May 06, 2014","Mar 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18222776-american-romantic

How do solidify our sense of who we are if we don’t know where we came from? In what ways can we take our place in the universe if our knowledge of our past is incomplete?Kit Noonan has reached a fork in the road. Underemployed with no clear sense of purpose, he is floundering, until his wife urges him to take some time away to work out the secret of his father’s identity. That search leads him back to his stepfather Jasper in Vermont – a self-sufficient outdoorsman who effectively raised him along with two stepbrothers. Eventually, the journey brings him to Lucinda, the elderly wife of a stroke-ravaged state senator and onward to Fenno (from Julia Glass’s first book) and his husband Walter.Through all this, Kit discovers the enigma of connections and which connections prevail. As one character states, “..the past is like the night: dark yet sacred. It’s the time of day when most of us sleep, so we think of the day as the time we really live, the only time that matters, because the stuff we do by day somehow makes us who we are. We feel the same way about the present…. But there is no day without night, no wakefulness without sleep, no present without past.”The biggest strength of this novel – by far – is the beautifully rendered portrayal of characters. Kit, Jasper, Lucinda and her family, Feeno and Walter – even Kit’s twins – are so perfectly portrayed that they could walk off the pages. As a reader, I cared about every one of them and – as the book sequentially goes from one character to another – I felt a sense of loss from temporarily leaving him or her behind.The only weakness was an overabundance of detail (scenes, back story, etc.), which robbed me of using my imagination to “fill in the blanks.” While vaguely discomforting, this story is so darn good and the writing is so darn strong that I was glad to be immersed in its world for the several days I was reading.

The premise is quite enticing: a Danish headmaster, Frederik Halling, is on vacation in Maorca with his wife Mia and their teenage son, Niklas, when it’s discovered that he has a non-malignant brain tumor… and likely has had it for many years. The tumor, situated on his orbitofrontal cortex, coordinates emotions, modulates those all-or-nothing signals, and provides a more nuanced human expression.Yet even after surgery (all this is at the very beginning), Frederik remains overly impulsive and indifferent. Worse, it quickly comes to light that he has embezzled from his local private school, quite probably when the tumor was in its development stage. Is he responsible for the crime? Was he aware of what he was doing? But even more importantly, who is the real Frederik? Or, as Mia muses: “Among all the thousands of chaotic little conflicts and oddities that make up everyday life in a family, what’s the first episode, however minor, that I can point to and say Frederik wasn’t himself?”These are important questions and the author makes the wise choice in muddying the waters with the character of Mia. Not brain-damaged, Mia is hindered with a distinct lack of empathy. In fact, she’s selfish and an unreliable narrator (and observer). She, too, is a changed person so other questions arise: “What about those who change as a result of being with someone who has been transformed by a brain tumor? Physiologically and emotionally, what lies at the core of our personhood?”This fascinating plot, coupled with the obvious intelligence and research of Mr. Jungersen, should make You Disappear a runaway winner. Yet there are two things that kept me from totally connecting. The first, I suspect, is an overly literal translation. There’s a certain distance in the narration that robbed me of a more emotional involvement.The second is that Chrisitan Jungersen seems to straddle back and forth between enlightening and educating. The research he put in is too publicly on display, keeping me from immersing into that alternate world of a fictional work. For instance: “Since then I’ve learned that a tumor can make it harder or someone to multitask, that it can lead to monomania. Medically, it’s certainly possible that it took root at the beginning of our marriage, transforming my marvelous charming husband into an unfaithful workaholic. That it then stopped growing until he earned to compensate and, for three good years, became more like himself again.” Granted, Mia has steeped herself into research, but from time to time, I got the feeling I was being educated by the author; in the best of books, that educational element is seamless.I’ve no doubt that this style will work for many other literary readers. The questions raised are so compelling that I recommend it, despite my own subjective reservations.

Yet in many stories that focus on intimacy and betrayal, the writer carefully draws between the lines. Robin Black is too good a writer to fall into that easy trap; her drawing of a life is imbued with subtle tones and hues.The story is simply yet compellingly told. Augusta – known as Gus – and her husband, Owen, are creative types (she’s an artist, he’s a writer) who have gone into a form of self-isolation after Gus’s affair of the heart. At the start of the novel, Gus is no longer a seductress but instead, an “old, tired soul”, dealing with a heavy load of loss: detached from family, watching her father wither into the twilight zone of Altzheimer’s, feeling the loss of never bringing a child into their lives.Into this mix comes Alison, a possibly disturbed neighbor whose life is upended except for her unconditional love for her teenage daughter, Nora. Their inadvertent trespassing into Gus’s and Owen’s life launches a trajectory that none of them can foresee.Life Drawing is at its best when it explores the ghosts of past, present and future that haunt the couple: Gus’s long-deceased mother and sister, the children never born, and Gus’s latest professional passion, painting imagined dead soldiers whose obituaries were found in the newspapers that insulated Gus and Owen’s farmhouse bathroom. Also, the professional balancing act that occurs when one member of a creative couple is inspired and the other is not hearing his muse is beautifully expressed, as is the concept of trust and withholding.After reading Peter Heller’s The Painter, I wanted to believe more in Gus’s acclaim as an artist than I did. And the ending contained some melodrama that – I believed – cheapened the story. Yet despite those critiques, Robin Black has very adeptly drawn the messiness that occurs when our past gets in the way of our future.

Each ends up living in what the author describes as a “life-long quarantine against love and life.”Kinder than Solitude is not primarily a mystery of a poisoned woman nor is it an “immigrant experience” book, although it is being hailed as both. Rather, it’s a deep and insightful exploration about the human condition – how one’s past can affect one’s future, how innocence can be easily lost, and how challenging it is to get in touch with – let alone salvage – one’s better self.“To have an identity – to be known – required one to possess an ego, yet so much more, too: a collection of people, a traceable track lining one place to another – all these had to be added to that ego or one to have any kind of identity,” Yiyun Li writes. In the case of Moran, who married and divorced an older man she still cares for,what she called her life “…was only a way of not living, and by doing that, she had taken, here and there, parts o other people’s lives and turned them into nothing along with her own.” Riyu, the most enigmatic and detached of the characters, is an empty vessel, unable to connect or to experience much pleasure or pain, who strives to receive an “exemption from participating in life.” And Boyang, a successful entrepreneur with a cynical sense of the world, has discovered that “love measured by effort was the only love within his capacity.”This is a deeply philosophical book, one that delves into its characters, with an ambling narrative that shifts from the shared Chinese past to the present –China, San Francisco, the Midwest. It is not for everyone – certainly not for readers who are anticipating an action-packed, page-turning suspense novel.

For many people, a name is a link to a proud lineage, a tethering to the past, a solid reinforcement of identity. The key character, Isaac, reminisces, “I had thirteen names. Each name was from a different generation, beginning with Father and going back from him. I was the first one in our village to have thirteen names. Our family was considered blessed to have such a history.”All Our Names – surely Dinaw Mengestu’s most assured book to date – explores what happens when names become interchangeable, when lives become alienated, when love becomes synonymous with danger. It is a devastating book and it is a must-read.The story is told with two parallel narratives. The chapters entitled Isaac are actually narrated by a friend of Isaac, a would-be writer who befriends the charismatic student. Times and dates are blurred: we suspect that the timeline is the late 1960s, we know the action takes place in Africa (but which country?). The more privileged students are all scornfully called “Alex” by Isaac, and we’re never quite sure if “Isaac” is the protagonist’s real name. The second narrative is also told in first person by Helen, a white social worker, also living through tumultuous times (by U.S. standards) during the Civil Rights movement. Isaac – who arrives with only the sketchiest information – is her client, her lover, and most importantly, her love. She is struggling with smaller scale identity issues, trying to define herself against small time prejudices and an overly cautious mother.How do you love a chimera? How do you love yourself? How do you even define yourself? In one plaintive scene, Isaac tells Helen, “I was no one when I arrived in Kampala: it was exactly what I wanted.”Dinaw Mengestu masterfully describes a world where “seeing was power, nostalgia meant nothing” and where people – and the battles they fight – ultimately become interchangeable.

Mr. Matthiessen has a strong voice and an inimitable style. For many readers, this may very well be a 5-star book and the fact that it wasn’t for me has far more to do with my reading tastes than it does with the quality of the writing. That being said, this is a book more for the head than for the heart. It’s a somber book, Clements Olin – an American academic of Polish descent – joins others on painful missions incompletely understood at the infamous death camp of Auschwitz. The ragtag group – stricken descendants of the “perpetrators”, relatives of the victims, morbid curiosity seekers – all gather to pay witness.But victims to what, exactly? “The emptiness? The silence? What can they hope to offer besides prayer in belated atonement?” Together and in pairs, they address anti-Semitism, man’s capacity for evil, and “confronting the Nazi within.” As the days pass, tensions bubble to the surface, bickering becomes commonplace, and core secrets begin to get unveiled. And gradually, Clements Olin gravitates towards Sister Catherine, a young nun who is also questioning the foundation of her life.There is a great deal of philosophizing (Can those who were penetrated by the horror truly be transported by passion? Does the line dividing good and evil cut through the heart of every human being? Is any nation or any man truly unstained?) Yet I could not shake the feeling that this gathering was a type of incubator that fertilized these musings. In tone and in style, a certain formality – call it a type of contemplation—distanced me from what should have been a far more intense reading experience. In Paradise will make you think. If it makes you feel is another matter. Like Clements Olin – an observer who needs to gradually remove his cloak and bear witness – the reader often has the feeling of being on the sidelines of history.

So what went wrong for me?Just this: my personal bias is that I should not be steeped in knowledge of western philosophy and sometimes obscure contemporary art to be able to immerse myself in a book. When one character says that Harriet has “taken the Kierkegaardian position”, I shouldn’t need to scratch my head. When philosopher Arthur Danno, Vasari, Diderot, and others are mentioned in one paragraph, I should have at least a simple roadmap about what it all means. And when fictional footnotes are added, I shouldn’t believe that it is the author displaying her eruditeness.I am not unintelligent; I hold a Master’s degree from an excellent university. Yet I felt adrift. My belief is that in the very best books, words are precisely used to clarify the human condition and create a connection with the reader rather than distance that reader. From time to time, there was an intellectual connection to this novel, but not a visceral one. Certainly there was little warmth.The structure – beginning with a preface from the editor of a narrative about Burden and punctuated with various voices and statements – is imaginative yet alienating. The reading pleasures of dialogue and character interaction is withheld. The Blazing World reminds me of a sometimes lovely but often inaccessible piece of contemporary art: one can admire the work and understand its craftsmanship but without that all-important connection, one doesn’t have that compulsion for it to hang in one’s living room.

And no. Rachel Pastan’s debut book, Alena, is actually less of a reimaging and more of a recasting of the du Maurier’s masterpiece. Think of Shakespeare production updates: Henry V with flak jackets and video screens, for example. In this case, the unnamed narrator – a naïve and insecure young curator – finds herself competing with the larger-than-life presence of the enigmatic Alena, who disappeared mysteriously.The framework of Rebecca is all here with one far-reaching change: passion and longing are replaced by admiration and worship. On her first trip to Venice, our narrator meets Bernard – the gay, charismatic and exotic owner of a private avant garde Cape Cod Museum while in Venice, and accepts his invitation to become its curator. Quickly, she discovers that she is in way over her head and that the museum’s bookkeeper and her niece (the equivalents of Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca) remain fiercely loyal to Alena’s memory.But herein lies the problem. The gothic twists and yearning romance that made Rebecca so engrossing are missing in Alena. As a 21st century heroine, the narrator is not as constrained as the Rebecca narrator: she can simply walk away from her position, for which she seems woefully unqualified. The romantic bonds that tied the Rebecca narrator to Max de Winter are not as powerful in what is – in essence – an employer/employee situation. The obvious question becomes: why not judge Alena on its own merits without the comparisons? Perhaps because the comparisons are so omnipresent for anyone who has read both books and very hard to shake. This book has its own merits and I wish that Ms. Pastan had untethered herself from Rebecca. The story shines as it explores the inner workings of the world of contemporary art exhibitions. Those who are steeped in this world (I am not one of them) will likely delight in the insights into real-world artists.What elevates this book, though, is the lyrical and confident prose. Rachel Pastan is the daughter of one of my favorite contemporary poets, Linda Pastan, and she’s obviously inherited “the gift”. Filled with lush descriptions and more than a hint of the Gothic, Ms. Pastan writes beautifully and elegantly. I will definitely be in line for her next book.

In other words, a “lesson” book.Yes, in the very loosest sense, that’s what Accidents of Marriage is about. But I’m pleased to say that it also includes the psychological acuity, beautifully-rendered insights and strong character development that causes it to soar to the top of its genre.The characters are Maddy and Ben Illaca and their three children: Emma, who has just entered adolescence, her nine-year-old sister Grace, and her seven-year-old brother Caleb. Theirs, in many ways, is an ordinary family: Ben is a true Type A attorney who flairs up when the messiness of family life upends his carefully-plotted days, Maddy is a social worker who excels at her job, and the kids are…well, kids.But then, during one pressure-packed day, everything changes in an unintended accident. Randy Sue Meyers carefully mines the perspectives of Ben, Maddy, and Emma in the aftermath and she hits every note. None of these characters are black-and-white: they are all authentically developed, people who could live next door to you. The dialogue is pitch-perfect and the arc of the story is organic and real. As a reader, I cared about this family – so much so that I yearned to return to the book when I was away from it. Even secondary characters come alive here. That says a lot about Ms. Meyers as a storyteller.If there’s any flaw in the book, it’s that after the beginning, Ben is portrayed so empathetically that I couldn’t help wondering if Maddy was being too hard on him. I don’t think that was the author’s intention. Yet, at the same time, I understood Maddy’s feelings and reactions and wanted her to do what was right for her. Accidents of Marriage will not win any literary awards. But not every book has to. There’s something that’s also valuable in books that tell a good story and make the reader want to turn pages well into the night. Accidents of Marriage is that kind of book....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jun 11, 2014","Jun 15, 2014","Feb 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18774980-accidents-of-marriage

Akhil Sharma’s canvas is a dis“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” So wrote Leo Tolstoy over a century ago. Akhil Sharma’s canvas is a distinctly unhappy family, and we’re alerted to it from the very first line: “My father has a glum nature. He’s been retired for a few years and he doesn’t speak much.”There’s a reason for his father’s glumness. As Indian immigrants, Ajay (the young narrator’s) parents had high hopes for their life in America, mainly centering around Ajay’s older brother Birju – a brilliant young scholar. Early on in the novel, Birju dives into a swimming pool, striking his head, leaving him forever brain damaged. It is now up to Ajay to navigate the treacherous waters ahead: deal with his own guilt and resentment and at the same time, strive to remain happy and make his parents proud.Akhil Sharma does not go for bells and whistles. The narrative is written in a spare and somewhat flattened tone, echoing the sense of loss and futility that pervades the closed-down Mishra family life. The price exacted by this personal tragedy – the isolation and alienation, the deceptions, the drinking and loss of identity – are balanced against a somewhat empty striving for the American dream. I was alerted to the fact that Family Life could be autobiographical by Ajay’s budding sense of himself as an observer and recorder of his life, reimagined into fiction. (Ajay is particularly enamored of Hemingway and indeed, Mr. Sharma’s style here is not unlike Hemingway’s in its distancing of emotion). Sure enough, after Googling the author, Family Lie is indeed based on his own experiences. In an article, Mr. Sharma states, “The story I was planning to tell had very little plot. A truly traumatic thing occurs to the family and then the family begins to unravel. This misery of this family’s daily life takes a slow toll.”To the book’s credit, it comes across as very authentic and believable without any of the manipulation one might expect from a topic of this sort. It is universal in examining a family’s response to loss and distinctive in its spotlight on the Indian community in general, and the Mishra family in particular. It is a genuine look at those who are forced to embark into unchartered territory and how, as an immigrant nation, we become removed not only from our roots but also from our own best selves....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 24, 2014","Dec 28, 2014","Feb 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18377952-family-life

My friend, a German admiral whose name you would know, let himself into my office and put my darling Darius on my paisley shawl. He died, exhausted by the strain of turning all those colors.”History – and the people who compose it – is itself a chameleon, subject to multiple interpretations. Ms. Prose seems less interested in exploring “what is the truth” and more intrigued with the question, “Is there truth?” The title derives from a photograph that defined the career of the fictional photographer, Gabor Tsenyl: two female lovers lean towards each other at the Chameleon Club table. His is one of five narratives that punctuate the novel. The showcase narrative – written as a biography by the grand-niece of one of the participants – focuses on Lou Villars, a one-time Olympic hopeful and scandalous cross-dresser who crosses over to the dark side and becomes a Nazi collaborator. The other four narratives are composed of devoted letters from Gabor to his parents; the unpublished memoirs of Suzanne, his wife; excerpts from a book by the libertine expatriate writer Lionel Maine; and finally, the memoirs of a benefactor of the arts, Baroness Lily de Rossignol. Each narrative plays off the others and provides subtle suggestions that the other narratives may not be entirely accurate.What is the truth of this intoxicating time, when artists of all kinds gravitated to the Paris scene and when war with Germany was an increasingly sober possibility? Francine Prose suggests that the truth is fluid. Reportedly, Lou Villars was inspired by a real person named Violette Morris. There are more than a few hints of Peggy Guggenheim in Lily de Rossignol and Lionel Maine bears a resemblance to Henry Miller. How much is fact and how much is fiction?And once the reader gets over that hurdle, how much of what is revealed by the fictional characters is distorted through their own lens? How much of that is truth and how much is perception? Can we ever know the real person who lurks behind the mask? As Francine Prose writes, “The self who touches and is touched in the dark ,between the sheets, is not the same self who gets up in the morning and goes out to buy coffee and croissants.I’ve said little about plot and that’s deliberate: the unfolding of the plot is for each reader to discover himself or herself. I will say this: the writing is exquisite and in my opinion, elevates an already talented contemporary writer to entirely new levels. The ending is breathtaking in its audacity. The setting – Paris in the late 1920s – is mesmerizing. The themes touch on universal matters: getting in touch with our authentic selves, crossing society-imposed gender barriers, understanding the fluidness of morality, searching for love and approval in dangerous places, making sacrifices for art, and discovering that history is not immutable, but changes depending on who tells it.I read Lovers in the Chameleon Club directly after another very disparate book: Helen Oyeyemi’s Boy Snow Bird.

When Boy is really a girl? When a beautiful pale-skinned youngster actually shares the bloodline of the blackest of black individuals? When beauty is not truth and when truth is not beauty? When a mother or a grandmother is not a safe haven but something else entirely? Helen Oyeyemi explores questions like these in her own imitable way, mixing a dose of fantasy with a dollop of reality. Her writing gifts, carefully honed in her startlingly good prior novel, Mr. Fox, are on display again here as she merges the real with the fantastical to create a canvas all her own.The book’s curious title is a compilation of the names of three unique women: Boy, who escapes from her abusive rat-catcher father to settle in a New England town called Flax Hill; her strikingly attractive and widely treasured stepdaughter Snow; and the daughter she conceives with Snow’s father Arturo, named Bird. As the publicist’s blurb on this book reveals, Bird is “colored” since Arturo and his family have long passed for white. The observant reader can pick up the threads of the Snow White fairy tale: the “evil” stepmother (who is perhaps more protective than evil), the removal of Snow White from the scene and particularly the “Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Who’s The Fairest of Them All” query.Who, indeed, is the fairest? Helen Oyeyemi writes, “”It’s not whiteness that sets Them against Us, but the worship of whiteness. Same goes if you swap whiteness out for other things—fancy possessions for sure, pedigree, maybe youth too…” Or, to put another way, nothing – not race, gender, or beauty – is valuable onto itself; it is we who place the value on these attributes.Ms. Oyeyemi sometimes overplays her hand. The narrative (told by Boy in the first and third sections and by her daughter Bird in the second section) loses a bit of steam when Bird takes over. The metaphors on race become too concrete as the author tackles the unfortunate devaluing of persons based on shade of pigment; the writing is far more effective when the reader draws his/her necessary conclusions on the tyranny of the mirror rather than being lead there.Still, Boy, Snow, Bird is so freshly-conceived – with writing that often leverages our mythic beliefs in fairy tales and soars into our subconscious – that it still manages to beguile. Ms. Oyeyemi is comfortable shattering many of our perceptions about race, gender, appearance, and family and does a masterful job of forcing us to confront our own mirror and ask, “Is the person reflected in the mirror a true representation about who I really am?” 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jan 28, 2014","Jan 31, 2014","Jan 28, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18079683-boy-snow-bird

Years later, he helps his friend Cam – also the victim of parental abuse – wrest a giant sick prehistoric alligator (representing the Freudian id) into their truck to set him free. He reflects, “We don’t know where he came from. We don’t know where to take him. How will he survive in the wild? How will he learn to hunt and catch fish and stuff?”It’s a fool’s errand and in the last story, Dan is off on another one, fighting the clock – and the law – to reach his son’s bedside before he succumbs to AIDS. The odds of making it on time are not in his favor, but it is the journey, not the destination: in his attempt to reach his son in time, he achieves a degree of self-awareness transcendence.In many of these stories, animals appear: a Gila monster, a bison, a goose, a dog, for example. Mr. Poissant seems to be postulating on our uneasy relationship to the natural world and our own sometimes out-of-whack internal nature. As with every short story collection, I have my favorites. One is Last of the Great Land Mammals, where Arnie and Linda – cousins who have become an adulterous couple, -- take off to Big Bone Lick State Park, the breeding ground for bisons. Arnie reflects on what his biologist wife ahs told him, “The habitat could never sustain that degree of life. The basin only thrives as long as the resources aren’t used up…From an evolutionary perspective, the animals are drawn away so that they don’t destroy what they have.”Another winner is the two-part The Geometry of Despair, where a grieving couple is stretched to the limit after the death of their infant daughter. The emotional pain is palpable. And the two back-to-back stories reflect the themes of this collection: the primitive attack of an animal (again, the id at work), the chaos, and the restoration of balanced. That theme is also echoed in Nudists; in that one, a man whose wife has tragically died in an accident visits his estranged brother, a park ranger who finds it hard to express emotions. The man – Mark – is seeking absolution and forgiveness from his deceased wife and realizes that it is only in his power to embrace forgiveness.There are some stories, of course, that are stronger than others…as is always the case in a short story collection. And not every person will agree to which ones are the strongest. Still, this is a very formidable debut from a natural storyteller, with characters who will remain with you....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jan 22, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18144025-the-heaven-of-animals

His memoir, Little Failure, shoIf it’s true that every one of us is a book just waiting to be written, then it’s particularly so for Gary Shteyngart. His memoir, Little Failure, should be taught as an example of how memoirs should be written. It’s courageous, poignant, often bitingly funny, entertaining and achingly real. There’s nary a false note in it.At a surface level, the memoir delves into the challenges of bridging two disparate cultures: the monochromatic country of Soviet Russia and the almost too colorful, let-it-all-hang-out United States of America. Brought to this country as a young boy of seven – right at the height of the Evil Empire fears – Gary (formerly Igor) is advised to “…get rid of the great furry overcoat. Trim my unkempt, bushy hair a little. Stop talking to myself in Russian. Be more, you know NORMAL.”Caught between his parents’ frugal and cautious life outlook and his own desire to fit in and be loved by his new classmates, little asthmatic Gary Shteyngart’s caustic wit (dubbed “Snotty” and “Little Failure” by his parents) is alive and well. The thrill of receiving a Publishers Clearing House direct mail piece stating “You Have Just Won Five Million Dollars! (would the U.S. ever lie?) or, at ten years old, given the present every boy wants – a circumcision – is hilariously funny.But look a little deeper and this memoir is not about the immigrant experience as much as it is about one boy’s experience. Gary becomes “a kind of tuning fork for my parents’ fears, disappointments, and alienation”, the envoy between not just warring countries but warring parents, striving to reconcile parents who love him deeply yet can only display that love through corporal punishment (father) or deep silent treatment (mother).“The greatest lies of our childhood are about who will keep us safe,” Mr. Shteyngart writes. As he lurches from childhood to the elite Stuyvesant High School and eventually, Oberlin College, he seems bent on fulfilling his parents’ prophecy of becoming a failure while at the same time setting the groundwork for his eventual success.The making of a writer is also front-and-center here: “I write because there is nothing as joyful as writing, even when the writing is twisted and full of hate, the self-hate that makes writing not only possible but necessary.” We see the seeds of Gary Shteyngart’s future profession early on in some of his imaginative sci-fi effort titled “The Chalenge” and that talent takes wing despite his best efforts to sabotage it.By removing that veil that stands between a well-known author and his readers, Gary Shteyngart seems to be asking his readers to do what he frequently urges his parents, lovers, and mentors to do: accept and love him. There is something brave, endearing, and just a bit heartbreaking about that quest. Yet for this reader, it succeeds. I closed these pages really liking Mr. Shteyngart and admiring his ability to strive for not so much forgiveness as understanding. This Little Failure is a big success....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 22, 2014","Jan 25, 2014","Jan 22, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17857652-little-failure

It is a thinking person’s book and a page-turner at the same time – a challenging feat to play off.Yvonne Carmichael is a highly respected geneticist, married for many years to her husband Guy.

The opening 100 pages – the background information that fleshes out the characters – could be edited down a bit. A very minor character appears in the second half of the book and I had to wade back through pages to remind myself who she was. Another minor character’s part could easily have been written out. And so on.But in general, this is a page-turning novel that will easily appeal to both literary and mass readers because it’s so darn good. The focal character is Eileen Leary – wife, mother, nurse, and striver. Upwardly mobile, she marries Ed, a man who is, in many ways, her opposite: a reliably knowledgeable man who lacked the tolerance for superficial interaction, a scientist and professor. Together, they welcome a son, Connell, who becomes the center of their lives.But – to paraphrase George Bernard Shaw – men dream and the gods laugh and make other plans. The family is tested in an unforeseen way. Each of them must strive to figure out what’s important and what’s authentic in a life where the future is shady and the rules have been turned upside-down.This is a book that poses questions that each of us have mulled over in our minds. How do we claim our own lives and live by our own inner radar…as opposed to what we THINK we want? What makes a life worth livable? How do we survive when the odds are long? What endures when little else remains?Matthew Thomas creates an authenticity in this story and breathes life into his characters.

It’s lengthy, for one thing – more than 530 pages. It’s packed with strong themes, original characters and non-stop action. And it has “best seller” stamped all over it.The action takes place mostly in the 1940s, set during World War II, and like his short story collection, it delves deep into the light that lies deep in our minds, beneath the visible world. The short, alternating chapters focus on two key characters: the blind daughter of the master locksmith of Paris’s National Museum of Natural History (Marie-Laure) and the precocious German orphan boy, Werner, who is a whiz with radio transmissions. There is a symmetry-of-sorts here: Marie-Laure dwells in the realm of darkness, Werner is immersed in a world of sound.As Germany invades France, the interweaving of these two stories becomes irresistible. Certainly I turned pages well into the night and who wouldn’t? The backdrop of a world war, two very likeable characters, the exploration of what the war does to dreamers and how to be true to oneself during a time of insanity – how could I NOT become engrossed? Add to this a first-rate mystery -- the Sea of Flames diamond, which comes with a double-edge sword: the keeper of the stone will live forever, yet misfortunes would unendingly fall upon those he loved.Anthony Doerr is an exceptional prose stylist and his sentences never fail to excite. From start to finish, he is in total command of his narrative. My problem – and I concede that this is very personal – is that there may not have been as much creative risk.I knew which characters I was supposed to like and which I wasn’t. That is not to say the characters are one-dimensional; Mr. Doerr is too good for that. It’s simply that none of them particularly surprised me in their actions. (The sinister seeker of the Sea of Flames diamond – Von Rumpel – is perhaps, the only exception; he DID appear a little too stereotypical). The entire Sea of Flames sub-story – again, for me – trivialized the more important themes of encapsulated by this line: “How does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a world full of light?”I can easily see All The Light We Cannot See adapted into a movie. I can definitely see it sitting atop the best-seller list. It’s a fine book.

Yet each, in its own way, chronicles a journey toward spiritual regeneration, a journey to finding grace in a merciless universe. The Painter reconfirms that Peter Heller has a massive talent. Our narrator is Jim Stegner, an expressionist New Mexican artist, an avid fly fisherman, and the father of a teenage girl whose life ended tragically. He also has a self-defined heart of a killer (the very first line reads, “I never imagined I would shoot a man. Or be a father. Or live so far from the sea.”) Yet as we quickly discover, Jim is a murderer with sensitivity: he rids the world of a lowlife who viciously abused a vulnerable little roan.The dichotomies of Jim’s life – his artwork and the murder – represent his two polarities, the art of creation and the art of destruction. And both serve a more important goal: freeing himself (and the world) from pain and moving toward redemption. (Jim reflects, “To paint simply and to feel a cooling, the calmness of craft, of being a journeyman who focuses on the simple task: pin this one corner together and make it fit in an expanding universe.”)As Jim’s paintings become more inspired, borrowing from what is happening in his life and his soul, he gradually moves from personal loss to growth. Mr. Heller writes, “Because the process has always been craft, years and years; then faith; then letting go. But now, sometimes the best work is agony. Pieces put together, torn apart, rebuilt. Doubt in everything that has been learned, terrible crisis of faith, the faith that allowed it all to work.”The Painter can be read on many levels. On its most surface level, it’s a suspenseful narrative of a tortured man and brilliant artist who must evade the authorities as well as the vengeful clan of the man he killed. On a deeper level, it’s a book about grief and the dark places it takes us, and the ways that we struggle for understanding and the regeneration. On another level yet, it’s about how art can help us transcend our demons by capturing and recreating them. It’s a brilliant book and I can’t wait to see where this author goes next....more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Apr 28, 2014","Apr 30, 2014","Jan 14, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18310201-the-painter

It’s an older work by Teju Cole, published in 2007 in Africa. It’s fiction only in the loosest sense; in reality, it’s a short book (the size of a novella) that reads partially like a travelogue or an analysis of the Nigerian psycheWhat the publicist gets right is that it’s very, very good. As Teju Cole displayed in Open City, he definitely has writing chops. His seamless insights, well-crafted prose and sense of storytelling are just spectacular. My  is based on what this book really IS, rather than what it is presented to be.Teju Cole – or his narrator (I suspect there’s a lot of blending) – cast an unsparing look at life in Nigeria. He writes this: “Nigeria was declared the most religious country in the world. Nigerians were found to be the world’s happiest people, and in Transparency International’s 2005 assessment, Nigeria was ranked sixth from the bottom out of the 158 countries assessed in the corruption perceptions index. Religion, corruption, happiness.”All three of these ingredients are on high display in this slight book,a travelogue, really, providing an insider’s view about life in Nigeria. When the narrator arrives back in Lagos after an extended stay in New York, he gets to experience his country’s creative, malevolent, ambiguous energies again with new eyes.Corruption is rampant and bribes are omnipresent. The tragic past – from slavery to dictatorship – is buried. (The narrator muses, “What, I wonder, are the social consequences of life in a country that has no use for history?”) A constant sense of foreboding about the fragility of life is constantly present. Supernatural explanations are favored for the most ordinary events. Yet through all this, there’s a sense of hope: the narrator glimpses a young woman on a bus reading Michael Ondaatje, for example.Since this book was written seven years ago, it’s hard to tell what has changed; I wish an update had been added. The author (or narrator) deplore the lack of Nigerian and African writers but in the past year or two, there has been a renaissance of extraordinary debut writing: A. Igoni Barrett, Aminatta Forna, Okey Ndibe, NoViolet Bulawayo, Chinelo Okparanta and others that I’ve read and loved. There may be other changes as well.

Written in a fairy-tale tale style that evokes The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society or Major Pettigrew’s Last Stand, this is a love song to those who cannot imagine living without books.Here’s the story: A.J. Fikry is a broken man – a widower before his time – who owns a failing bookstore on Alice Island. He has definite opinions on the literary books he wants to sell: “I do not like postmodernism, postapocalyptic settings, postmortem narrators, or magic realism. I rarely respond to supposedly clever formal devices…” But when a valuable (but not all-that-cherished) early Poe book is stolen from him, a chain of events occurs that takes him off his own self-imposed island and opens him to the world.The bookstore itself plays a vital role throughout this heartwarming novel. “We read to know we’re not alone. We read because we are alone. We read and we are not alone. We are not alone.” Every few pages, there are gems that define A.K. Fikry and also resonate with any avid reader: “We are not quite novels…We are not quite short stories…In the end, we are collected works.” Or: “You know everything you need to know about a person from the answer to the question: What is your favorite book?” Or this: “The things we respond to at twenty are not necessarily the same things we will respond to at forty and vice versa. This is true in books and also in life.”The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry covers several decades and yet the love of books remains constant and at the center. There’s a lot of truth about book publishing that are bound to produce chuckles (A.J. Fikry refers to blurbs as “the blood diamonds of publishing” and book jackets as “the redheaded stepchildren of book publishing.”)From time to time, the book borders on the twee (when one character says, “…Children often spoil a story for me. I don’t mind them in real life. I just don’t want to read about them”, I wanted to say, “Amen”…particularly since there is a precocious child as a main character here.) Yet all in all, this is an enjoyable and breezy book that is filled with nuggets of wisdom for us book people.

Her physician, Dr. Charlotte Rowe, becomes emotionally involved as she races to keep her alive and locate family members…and gradually, finds herself involved in ways she never suspected. In flashbacks, we learn about the back stories of these two women…and also about Eric, Charlotte’s science journalist partner who has his own stakes in the evolving story.The story itself is scintillating and beautifully written but it is the themes that elevate GEMINI far above the traditional medical mystery. Carol Cassella is interested in the duality: do we defer to scientific advances or to moral wisdom? What is the fine line between life and death and when does life become not worth living? Where do truth and emotional intersect…and divide? Or to put another way, when do we function as humans with limited knowledge and when do we play God?As one of Charlotte’s colleagues reminds her, “You’ve forgotten your school lessons. Castor and Pollux, the twins. One the child of Zeus and one a mortal. When the mortal Castor is killed, Pollux splits his immortality to save him.”Although the medical mystery provides the bare bones, GEMINI is, at its core, a love story. “There are all types of love: the kind that hits you like a truck hauling down a highway, the kind that needs as much nurturing as a winter campfire, and the range between.” Through her doctoring of Jane Doe, Charlotte begins to explore the manifestations of love and understand that “time will go forward with or without you, implacable and unceasing, glacially grinding down anything that won’t move it its pace.” As the stunning answers begin to unfold for Jane Doe –and for Charlotte – it becomes evident that GEMINI is also a morality tale, filled with emotional insights and touching on the entire cycle of life and its interconnections. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 09, 2014","Jan 13, 2014","Jan 09, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17742914-gemini

That is, until a number of killings occur in Funnland, an arcade in the seaside down-and-out town of Whitmouth and one of the girls – now an investigative journalist – comes face-to-face with the other, now a manager in charge of cleaning up the Funnland mess.Wicked Girls, though, goes way beyond the mystery genre. It’s not much of a mystery, really: most astute readers will rather quickly guess the identity of “whodunit.” Rather, Wicked Girls is an indictment of the probation system (“Probation aren’t there to help you if you get into trouble. They’re there to punish you if the trouble’s your fault”), as well as the salacious British tabloids (“She feels…ashamed of her colleagues and their ability to use words to throw any light they choose on a situation. Innuendo, allusion and false connection: the staples of a media that’s still Society.”)This is a society that “doesn’t really care who it blames, as long as it blames someone.” In frequent flashbacks, we learn just what happened the horrifying day that Jade and Annabel’s actions caused the death of the young child. Carefully, skillfully, Ms. Marwood – the pseudonym for The Independent journalist – shines a laser light on the past and the present and how they come together…and more importantly, how society crafts its own story and destroys lives in the process.In Funnland, a metaphor for society with its maze of mirrors and horrors – we, the readers, get to see how class distinctions shape characters, how a true attempt at rehabilitation can make a major difference, and how secrets can be terribly destructive. Although every now and then, Ms. Marwood’s plotting goes over the top (the ending, in particular, seemed more of an action movie), the writing in general is powerful and arresting and the atmosphere of Whitmouth (where people who “can’t afford, or lack the passports or the probationary permission, to spread sangria vomit over warm Spanish concrete”) is meticulously done.

During the day, his instrument of choice is the drill. (“It was one big mouth to me – one big open, straining, gleeking, unhappy, discomfited, slowly decaying mouth.”) Yet during more ruminative times, he continues to drill within himself, seeking the answers to how to move forward in a meaningless world filled with decay.And then one day, his existential search for meaning shifts into a whole other dimension when a mysterious stranger hijacks his identity on the Internet. Suddenly, Paul is forced into the online world with a website, Facebook page, tweets, and provocative blog comments regarding an obscure religious sect called the Ulms (who claim to be the natural heirs of Amalek from the Old Testament). Their chief belief is NO belief; they believe in nothing but their obligation to doubt God. As Paul soon learns, “Others believe we face a real enemy, an existential threat, in every generation. Every generation must recognize who Amalek is or that generation, and every generation must prepare to fight it any way it can.”What’s a poor atheist to do? Even Paul’s office manager and former love interest begins to wonder if the postings are really from Paul. And Paul – who worships only the Red Sox – becomes more and more unsettled, remembering misguided affairs and luring temptations with a Catholic woman and a Jewish woman and the rituals and fervor of their faith and their family.This seriocomic novel takes on a number of timely and relevant topics: the growing disconnect of generations that are now tethered to their me-machine (i.e., cell phone) instead of to each other. The particular dislocation caused by online identity theft. The difference between an authentic life and an online pretend life. The attraction of the trappings of religion versus the reality of the tribalism and exclusion inherent in all of them. As Paul struggles with the knowledge that his invented online version may be a better version than his real self, he reveals the human condition and the search for meaning: how there has to be hope no matter how hopeless. It’s a dazzling feat.Joshua Ferris has obviously done ample research into the ancient religions and Paul’s exploration of what it means sometimes threatens to hijack the narrative.

In the hands of Marina Mander, a talented Italian writer, the story is mesmerizing and haunting. While most child-based narrations eventually become cloying, Luca’s musings remain fresh and often poetic.Luca’s deep-seated fear is to be sent to an orphanage: “There are lots of parents who decide to split up, lots of kids who see only one or the other parents, and only once in a while; but not orphans, that’s really a nasty business, like you’re missing something and everyone only sees the part that’s not there.” This fear drives him to pretend to the rest of the world that his mother is still living and that everything is going on like before.As Luca experiences total freedom (“I’m free and I’m a prisoner at the same time, like hamsters who spin their wheels and stay in the same place”), he becomes a master of the true lie, telling stories as if they’re his “personal lullabies”, surpassing fear because “you’re the one who invented them.”Eventually, Luca determines to identify himself as a “single human being” rather than an orphan, although we – the readers – know that he doesn’t have the emotional wherewithal or the financial means to be able to survive on his own. In ways, the reader becomes complicit; there were many times I wanted to reach into the pages and save Luca and keep him loved and safe.

This Just when I think there’s little new under the sun, along comes Helen Oyeyemi and shatters all my perceptions about how a story can be narrated. This young, brave, gifted Nigerian-born British writer is a modern day Scheherazade, weaving her tales in the form of a most unconventional love triangle: St. John Fox, a “serial killer” writer (the women in his books always die), a muse (or is she?) named Mary Foxe, and his wife Daphne.The book is loosely based on the legend of Bluebeard – a feared and shunned nobleman who murdered multiple wives after they enter his forbidden room. His last wife-to-be is able to escape her fate.In Helen Oyeyemi’s book, the misogynous Mr. Fox is confronted by Mary Foxe and delivered a challenge: to join in on her game to engage in competition, to avoid pat endings and to create a story that breaks the mold that he’s become all too comfortable with.The stories are at first slightly self-conscious and increasingly become richer and richer as the characters (Mr. Fox, Mary Foxe and Daphne) begin to connect in surprising ways, across time periods and genres.In fact, this book is hard to pigeonhole. Certainly, it is imaginative. It is also timeless: the tales amply leverage the romance and violence that are part and parcel of the best of our historic fairy tales. Mr. Fox, for example, bridges the gap with legendary foxes such as the seductive Reynardine and in one unforgettable story, becomes a fox of folklore, trying to escape his fox-like nature.The stories themselves are marvelous: a young woman with violence in her past who meets a widower who challenges her ability to trust, a highly unusual prep school for perfect husbands…each tale is a joy onto itself. The themes within the stories have a lot to say about the creative process, the challenges of mature loving, the echoes of post traumatic stress disorder, the discovery and acceptance of one’s true nature, the agony and ecstasy of taking creative and personal chances.As Helen Oyeyemi leads us from absorbent fantasy to hints of the truth of Mr. Fox’s struggling marriage and need for creative release, reality and fantasy often flirt with each other and sometimes even collide.

It’s disturbing, lyrical, original, provocative, and experimental in the best of ways. Yet it stands on the shoulders of giants that came before it: Sartre comes to mind, as does Camus.The premise is instantly (pardon the pun) arresting. A thread salesman named Oda Sotatsu signs a confession for a crime that has baffled the Japanese authorities – eight older individuals disappear without a trace in what becomes known as the Narito Disappearances. Yet once jailed, he utters barely a word….even though we, the readers, know he is not guilty from the first pages.A man who refers to himself as the Interviewer – named Jesse Ball – meets with Sotatsu’s parents, brother and sister, jailers, and a woman perceived as a love interest. Written in the conceit of notes drawn from interviews via tape-device, the story takes on an immediacy and fascination – particularly as we realize that the character Jesse Ball is in search of existential answers in his own life.“One can’t say how one behaved or why, really. Such situations, they are far more complex than any either/or proposition. It is simplistic to produce events in pairs and lean them against each other like cards.” And so it is here. Each person whom Jesse Ball encounters provides a credible part of the puzzle, yet each urges him not to trust anyone else. From one character: “You have to be very careful whom you trust. Everyone has a version, and most of them are wrong.” Who is telling the truth and who is lying – and in the grand scheme of things, does it even matter? As Sotatsu’s brother says about their father: “He said I had a liar’s respect for the truth, which is too much respect.”The author Jesse Ball (through the character of Jesse Ball) raises the most elemental and universal issues. Among them: it is impossible to see things while we’re still searching; we can only find things by seeing what is there. Reason alone is not the answer; we go to absurd lengths to prove ourselves reasonable.Interwoven with fables and poetic language (it is no surprise that Jesse Ball has published several works of verse), this story is also grounded strongly in reality. For literary readers, this book is sheer genius and has put Jesse Ball firmly on my radar for his past and future books....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Dec 05, 2013","Dec 07, 2013","Dec 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17883918-silence-once-begun

In 1872, it was found drifting in the Atlantic Ocean – deserted, unmanned, yet seaworthy and with its cargo fully intact. Valerie Martin uses this mystery as a main plot device in her latest novel – a page-turning triumph that kept me up for two nights way past my bedtime. But into this mystery, she weaves two additional threads. One focuses on Arthur Conan Doyle, fittingly, the creator of one of the most legendary sleuths of all time, Sherlock Holmes. When we first encounter him, he is launching his career by writing an anonymous and sensationalistic tale of the mystery of the doomed ship. And the other explores the resilient bond between two disparate women, the spiritualist Violet Petra – the sister of the captain’s wife – and a skeptical journalist named Phoebe Grant.As a result, Valerie Martin broadens the definition of ghosts to include the many ghosts that haunt us in our quest for love and connections: the ghosts who have influenced what we have become, the ghosts of what we might have been. “What draws the bereaved to seek the departed still in this world?” she writes. “Is it hope, I wonder, or is it fear?” The ship, in a metaphorical way, becomes the symbol of our hubris: “What vanity of men, to sail about in fragile wooden boxes tricked out with sails, putting their lives, their fortunes, their families at the mercy of this ravenous, murderous, heartless beast of a sea.”There is so much to recommend this book that I don’t even know where to begin. Ms. Martin steers her prose confidently forward, whether she’s writing about authentically terrifying ocean disasters which make the reader feel RIGHT THERE or the nuances of a haunted young woman – Violet – who “was left on the shore in this charade of a life.” The realism of her prose had me scrambling to Google more than once to discover what was real and what was fiction. Instead of relying on a tried-and-true linear structure, Ms. Martin takes three seemingly unrelated vignettes and then weaves them more and more intricately into one overriding and satisfying narrative.She’s not above poking a little fun at herself. At one point, this thought is attributed to Arthur Conan Doyle. “The public, he knew, demanded a strong plot, adventures at sea went well, also ghosts and mysteries of all kinds. Why not put them all together?” Why not indeed?

The first is that Esther Akello, who has experienced and witnessed horrors that no pre-teen girl should ever be forced to endure. Now striving to adapt in a rehabilitation center, Esther has become robotic as her mind struggles to cope with what she has been forced to undergo.“How were our days? We searched for food. We gathered vine leaves and cooked them. We ate cassava leaves, simsim, boiled sorghum. We carried the radio, carried water, and were always thirsty…” The prose is both understated and filled with precision as Susan Minot, in unflinching detail, allows Esther to relay the ritualized rapes and impregnation, the beatings, the dehumanizing of these previously sheltered and innocent girls. The story is realistic and haunting and very convincingly depicts a young girl whose tortures have not extinguished her sense of self and unrelenting hope for the future.Esther’s story is alternated with that of Jane Wood, an American reporter, whose sense of self – in contrast to Esther’s – is very lacking. Jane travels to Uganda to interview the kidnapping victims yet the reader suspects that her unspoken purpose is to fill the emptiness in her own life. Upon arrival, Jane in short order connects with her one-time acquaintance Lana, begins a romance with a 22-year-old named Harry who is 15 years younger, and travels to the site with a group of other free-spirited Americans.For much of this book, I was in 5-star territory. The contrast of Jane’s own rather pitiful and privileged attempts to find meaning and love seemed in direct contrast to Esther’s far more compelling story of survival and striving for self-definition (as opposed to Jane’s striving for definition-through-others). “She would never forget them, she thought, then immediately wondered how long it would be before she did,” Jane reflects…and sure enough, her obsession with Harry quickly helps her mitigate what she sees. Yet unaccountably (for this reader), Jane’s concerns are elevated to the level of Esther’s as Ms. Minot strives to bring home the message that we are all connected with our losses and our dreams. At one point, as Jane and her entourage listen to Esther and the victims, Minot writes, “By the time the girls finished talking they were hitting at each other and laughing, the white people before them looking pale and shattered.” I wish the author had taken the more courageous option of focusing on the separateness of experiences that ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 05, 2014","Feb 08, 2014","Dec 02, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17567218-thirty-girls

So kudos to author Sarah Cornwell for taking on this challenging task and doing it so authentically.Olivia is a recently divorced mother with sole custody of two children – teen Carrie and her younger brother Daniel, who as recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. On a trip back to their hometown, Daniel disappears and Olivia is catapulted back to her own strange childhood with her erratic mother, Myla, a psychic…and the ghosts of her stillborn twin sisters. “I trusted that my thought were laid out for her to read like a played hand of cards. As I grew, I found that I was wrong – that I could hold my thoughts away from her, and this discovery made me bolder but lonelier, too.”What I Had Before I Had You is about any number of things: it’s a coming-of-age novel for anyone who has lived a life that is out of sync with the rest of the world. It’s an ode to memories and how our imperfect thoughts and beliefs can suddenly take form when the missing puzzle pieces are put into place. It’s a search to embrace our most authentic stories and to claim our own authenticity.But most of all, it’s a powerful look into a multi-generational trajectory and how our greater understanding of the bipolar disorder has influenced perceptions and actions. In earlier years, Olivia reflects, “I feel myself rising and falling like an old helium balloon, and I think that if I don’t ground myself now, I will float up to join my mother, high above reason, trailing a snipped string.” Olivia’s reactions to her mother are often driven by rebellion, frustration, distaste…and befuddlement, since she doesn’t know where her mother goes when she quite literally disappears.Later, her beliefs are more nuanced: “What I all the transcendent moments of your life, the sound-track moments, the radiant detail, the gleaming thing at the center of life that loves you, that loves beauty – God or whatever you call it – what if all this were part o your illness. Would you seek treatment? I have, and sometimes I wonder if the greatest passions are just out of my reach. And sometimes I am so grateful.”As Olivia accepts and manages her own diagnosis, she is better able to understand her son, whose early-onset diagnosis presents entirely new challenges.

For dog-lovers like me, the answer is obvious – the pure, half-magical devotion an animal can have to a person. And for those who are NOT dog-lovers (or who are on the fence), Susan Orlean’s explanation is about as good as it gets:“It was the story of an extraordinary journey – across land and sea, in war and in peacetime, from poverty to wealth and back again, from obscurity to fame – and, from there, into the murky world of the once famous and almost obscure. It was also a journey through time.”In short, Rin Tin Tin was more than a dog born in 1918, found on a battlefield in France, and catapulted to Hollywood fame. His legacy lives on and evolves and is part of our collective history, defining who we are as a nation at any given point of time. Susan Orlean describes this exceptionally well. At the start, Rin Tin Tin was “everything Americans wanted to think they were –brave, enterprising, bold, and most of all, individual.” As his invincibility wears off, he becomes “the dog you could aspire to have, and maybe even manage to have, at home.” And finally, Rin Tin Tin becomes an archetype, a “product” to be merchandised, promoted, and ultimately, sued over in the courts.Ms. Orlean does an amazing job at merging Rin Tin Tin with his world and in bringing back to life those who were integral in his success: Lee Duncan, who spent part of his time in foster care, who saved and trained the original Rin Tin Tin, and Bert Leonard, who brought his story to the small screen, to name two.Along the way, we learn about the history of German Shepherds, other movie-star dogs such as Lassie, the evolution of dogs from heroes to companions, the way that archetypal stories are marketed and packaged, the lightning strikes of fortune in Hollywood and the advent of television, and the making of a legend that will not die.While a little repetitive in places, I found the journey to be fascinating – deeply researched and often thought-provoking. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 18, 2013","Nov 22, 2013","Nov 18, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11238914-rin-tin-tin

They’re decepRussell Banks’ short stories don’t rely on fireworks and bells and whistles; there’s no hint of post-modernism or genre bending in them. They’re deceptively simple and straightforward…even dispassionate in tone. Yet in many ways, they are morally complex; certainly, they pack a wallop.Most of them focus on men of a certain age – time-tested, time-broken men who have struggled through broken dreams and damaged relationships. In the eponymous story – the story of a post-divorce family – the aging dog is the last tenuous link to the two families. “None of us knew that she was helping us postpone our anger and need for blame – blame for the separation and divorce, or the destruction of the family unit, for our lost innocence.”In Christmas Party, a cuckolded husband attends the holiday party of his ex-wife and her new husband and discovers that their veneer of amiability is strained during the time of good cheer. The story Snowbirds begins with the death of Isabel’s spouse George; her good friend Jane flies down to Florida to comfort her. Yet Isabel is in scant need of comforting and the focus shifts to Jane herself. “It made Jane believe for a moment that she could be fearless, as fearless as Isabel, that she could be reborn as someone else, as someone unformed, and that, like Isabel, she could become an adolescent girl again.”Lost and Found is a beautifully-crafted story about a middle aged man, lonely in his marriage, who teetered on the brink of infidelity and “didn’t want to remember what I lost that night. And what I found.” The satiric story Blue – set in a used-car lot – is different type of story with shades of Stephen King. And the final story, Green Door, is a more complex tale about postponing desires, cultivating fantasies, and ultimately realizing that what we want isn’t necessarily what we get.A Permanent Member of the Family is proof positive that short stories can shine through sharp insights, provocative themes, and a laser focus on alienated individuals yearning for understanding and connection.

There, tortured by past memories and fortified by alcohol and solitude, he eschews the company of others. Yet early on, he receives an unwanted visitor: Cadillac, the daughter of Tosca, who teamed with him as a scout to spy on the Japanese army in the Solomon Islands.In one sense, the theme is how we evolve and own our memories. In the past, Jim examined how the tongues of different bird species evolved to adapt to different flowers of particular islands. Now he finds himself evolving to circumstances beyond his control: the lack of mobility, the inevitable encroachment of memories and of significant others. As the book travels back and forth in time – to his youth in the early 1900s, to his stint in Naval Intelligence in the Solomon Islands, to his respected career collecting for the Museum of Natural History, the one constant in his life has always been birding. “Birding, he realizes, offered him both a way to engage with the world and a means to escape it.” Indeed, skinning birds reduces them to their very essence.So it’s no surprise that even as the book opens, Jim has taken upon himself a quixotic task: to evaluate whether Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island was really one of the Solomon Islands. And herein lies another theme: the dastardly pirate Long John Silver, in Treasure Island, remarks how alike he is with the novel’s young hero, Jim Hawkins. Good and evil can exist simultaneously in nature and in life…or can it? Can both co-exist in Jim himself?The book blurb implies that Tosca and his daughter Cadillac will play an integral role of capturing “his heart and that of everyone she meets.” I believe that sets up false expectations. Cadillac is indeed a catalyst to help Jim arrive at some clarity but for this reader, the center focus of the story is always Jim.

At one point, Stella answers that question herself: “In the wrong contexts, cleverness is just an inhibiting clumsiness.”Stella is the type of girl who outsmarts herself; in a sense, she is the “everywoman” of the often chaotic sixties and seventies.” We meet her when she is only 10 and then, in shimmering vignettes, follow her until she is in middle age as she struggles against the boring existence of her mother and stepfather, flirts with feminism, deals with premature motherhood, gets involved in a couple of disastrous love affairs, and tries on and discards various “selves” as she tries on – and discards – various iterations of life in her quest to find the authentic one.There is an intimacy in Stella’s recounting of her tales that made me think – more than once—that I was reading a memoir. A Bristol girl who makes some poor choices and who wrestles with failed affairs and missed chances does not, in any sense, add up to an extraordinary character. She could just as easily be you or me.And yet. And yet. There’s something that’s truly extraordinary in the episodic telling. Tessa Hadley’s keen ability to capture an emotion, an interaction, or a juncture is so real that Stella could walk off the page. We believe in Stella and we also believe in her evolution, which sometimes comes in a crystal clear moment of enlightenment and other times in a hard-won battle for clarity. Through the episodes that Ms. Hadley chooses to illuminate, we begin to see Stella coalesce into an integrated whole…and to trust in her cleverness.

The prose – dense, descriptive, and beautifully-wrought—flutters like a butterfly, taking flight (as memory itself does) in the past, then alighting back in the present, making its way back and forth to answer the question: what happened on a pivotal evening man years back, at her charismatic uncle’s orchard farm?As Liz mulls over the events leading up to that fortuitous evening, she thinks, “Sometimes I feel the past will eat me alive, will devour me in the same way that the now abundantly overgrown cedar bush is devouring the pioneer rail fences on which, as children, we used to stand.”Small wonder. Her charming yet impetuous and damaged uncle Stanley – who looms larger than life in her memories --vanished years back and his daughter, Cousin Mandy – poet and soldier – is also gone, killed on active duty in Afghanistan while in the throes of a mysterious love affair. And then there’s Teo, a young Mexican boy, whose fate is darkly hinted at almost from the beginning.Uncle Stanley was the keeper and weaver of generations of family mythology, and the stories he tells -- and Liz recalls – are vibrant: ancestors immigrating from Ireland to become lighthouse keepers, others who became farmers and pined for love and experienced it in one fleeting moment. These “great-greats” permeate both the topographical and the emotional topography.In just a little over 200 pages, Ms. Urquhart effectively mines so much of our human experience: love and death, lies and secrets, the paths of migration and the arcs of life, our personal metamorphosis and the integration of nature into our lives.Are there flaws? Perhaps a few. I never quite understood Mandy’s decision to enter Canada’s armed forces – given her character development – and I couldn’t help but feel that the Afghanistan story was tacked on to create modern relevancy. One of the ending denouements – which I won’t spoil – seemed a little too implausible. Liz’s vocation – as an entomologist – is never capitalized on (we never see her at work, for example), which make the butterfly metaphors less organic in their evocation.All in all, this is a beautifully lyrical and haunting book, but not a perfect one.

The very title of the book is based on the work of a sixteenth-century cobbler named Jacob Boehme, who believed that “God had hidden clues for humanity’s betterment inside the design of every flower, leaf, fruit and tree on earth. All the natural world is proof our Creator’s love.”Or is it? Is it the Creator’s touch or the scientist’s playground? How much are we meant to understand? What does one consider a “fortunate life?” What about the anomalies of human compassion and self-sacrifice? And is love still love if it’s too pure for this world?Now, take all these questions and fold them into a great adventurous yarn – the rags-to-riches story of Alma’s father…the smuggling of plant clippings to eager entrepreneurs …the challenge of being a sister to a beautiful abolitionist sister…unrequited love and the discovery of self-pleasuring…and a love affair with a man who is as committed to the mystical as she is to the concrete.Along the way, the reader learns about the customs and culture of Tahiti (and what a cruel Tahitian sport can teach us about the human animal), a woman’s role in the Age of Enlightenment, Darwin’s theory of the never-ending struggle for survival, and where our journeys take us in the quest for knowledge.Kudos to Elizabeth Gilbert for stretching herself far beyond her best-selling memoir Eat Pray Love and searching even deeper into the questions of our time....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Nov 08, 2013","Nov 18, 2013","Oct 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17465453-the-signature-of-all-things

Do those who believe they hold all the answers always think they have the right to hurt those who don’t believe them? These two broad questions are at the core of Robert Stone’s latest novel.The eponymous black-haired girl is Maud Stack – beautiful, mercurial, spoiled, and self-destructive. While attending college in New England, she begins an affair with her middle-aged and emotionally damaged college advisor, Steven Brookman. To prove her mettle, Maud writes a highly inflammatory college newspaper article tackling the faith-filled anti-abortion protestors at the most visceral level. There is no doubt what happens to Maud; the very title of the book gives the main plot point away.But is the book truly about the death of the black-haired girl…or is it a book about the death of all our illusions? In the most important ways, this book is not about Maud at all and it’s certainly not any kind of classic whodunit. We meet the people who hang on the periphery of Maud’s life: Jo Carr, school counselor and ex-nun, who is still mentally tortured from horrors in South America, her father, Eddie Stack, an emphysema-ridden former policeman who lives with his own nightmares, her friend and roommate Shell, an actress with a mentally disturbed ex-husband, Lieutenant Salmone—her father’s ex-partner and many more.All of them struggle to make their lives – and Maud’s death – make sense and mean something at a time when the institutions that are supposed to protect them (the churches, the law, the colleges) are failing. All of them strive for a sense of connection yet most must carry on alone.It’s a strong premise, but it didn’t entirely work for this reader. To buy into any of this means that the reader must first buy into the premise of Maud and Brookman and how her death unravels those around her. But her character not nuanced enough. As portrayed, Maud appeared as an unstable, potentially alcoholic, terribly entitled and naïve young woman; her smartness, creativity and beauty seemed secondary to that. Some of the scenes between Maud and Steven did not seem quite genuine.Also, at times, I felt that Robert Stone was walking a thin line between serious literary work and crime novel territory. Both are valid genres, but for me, the cohesion between the two had to be more seamless.I wanted to give this a 4 star rating for many reasons: the assuredness of the prose, the universal questions it raises, and the simple fact that once I got going, I didn’t want to stop reading. But it never really coalesced, hence my 3-star rating. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 23, 2013","Oct 26, 2013","Oct 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17165876-death-of-the-black-haired-girl

The Free is a hymn of sorts to the working-class American…the man or woman who grew up placing one foot in front of the other, ever hopeful, ever courageous, despite being left behind in the dust. The characters are so authentic and big-hearted – the dialogue so pitch-perfect and real – that I wanted to leap into the pages and give them a hug. Willy Vlautin has placed his finger on the pulse of America and found its heartbeat.Three stories are interwoven. Leroy Kervin is an Iraqi War veteran whose brain has been caved in by the war, a man who hasn’t had a minute of clarity. One day he awakens and it was “like his mind had suddenly walked out of a never-ending snowstorm…Was he finally free? Was he really himself again?” In the first few pages, we learn that as Leroy gains clarity, death becomes the most sensible option. In his eventual stupor, his mind creates sci-fi reveries that center on a group called The Free, who hunt down those with a green mark that reveals they are unpatriotic.The night man at Leroy’s group home is Freddie McCall, a caring and honest man who has fallen victim to the American nightmare. His younger daughter needed major medical care and since then he’s been drowning in debt, struggling to make ends meet with two jobs, not free from the memories of when he was on top of things with a wife and kids (who have since left) and a non-mortgaged home.And finally, there’s Pauline Hawkins, a nurse who is shut in emotionally – caring for her mentally disturbed father, turning her back on opportunities for connection. That is, until a young down-and-out teen named Jo shows up at the hospital and reminds Pauline of the promise within each of us.Individually, these characters are beautifully rendered – real, heartbreaking, relying on inner strength and the kindness of strangers. Together, they compose a portrait of today’s America – the scars of war and the soldiers who come home maimed and wrecked, the collapse of the American dream and the looming bills, the struggle with medical and housing costs that are always just out of sight.Each character will eventually discover his or her wn definition of freedom. With the exception of the sci-fi reveries – which distanced me from the immediacy – I was totally absorbed, reading at a fast clip. And at some junctures, the characters broke my heart.

Yet its real theme is not the deaths of individuals as much as it is the death of a utopian dream.That dream: kibbutz life, based on social and economic parity. Or, to put it another way, the whole has to be greater than the sum of its parts. In reality, a life without self-fulfillment and self-actualization is a life of self-sacrifice, loneliness and an increasing rigidity in roles.There’s David Dagan, for example, a kibbutz founder who has become immune to criticism, living with his good friend’s 17-7ear-old daughter. There’s Zvi the gardener, who can’t wait relay all the bad news to the community and who turns rigid whenever he’s touched. There’s Roni, the father of a bullied son, who cannot protect him because all children are the “property” of the kibbutz, not the parent. And there’s Moshe, a sensitive animal lover, who is only permitted to leave the community overnight to visit his sick father.Gradually – and this is no accident – the lone characters that we meet begin to interact with other characters by appearing in other stories. The individuals who are in conflict with themselves eventually are also in conflict with other individuals and ultimately, with the ideal of communal living.Mr. Oz writes, “The old-timers are actually religious people who left their old religion for a new one that’s just as full of sins and transgressions, prohibitions and strict rules. They haven’t stopped being true believers; they’re simply exchanged one belief system for another. Marx is their Talmud. The general meeting is the synagogue and David Dagan is their rabbi.”In the end, no ideal can ever eradicate the very human traits of envy, pettiness or greed. Yet humankind can still dream and even plan for a community that’s denied it. Amos Oz’s triumph is in recognizing both the good and the bad in kibbutz life and the conflict that is inherent within it. Translated flawlessly by Sondra Silverston, these stories are deceptively simple and beautifully rendered. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Oct 18, 2013","Oct 20, 2013","Oct 18, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17302874-between-friends

And if you are easily bruised by cuss words and examination of the enhanced libidos of 20-somethings, you better avoid this book as well.If, however, you’re looking for a really imaginative and – dare I say FUN -- anti-travel guide – a guide that touches on everything from a very drunk and out-of-control Kiefer Sutherland, a real-life comedian mayor named Jon Gnarr who ran on a platform of not letting anyone in his cabinet who hadn’t seen all episodes of The Wire, and an explanation of why so many Icelandic women become Miss Universe – well, here’s your book.Stephen Markley and his two friends visit Iceland a little while after the country’s highly publicized economic crash, touring massive craters where massive blobs of magma crashed into the earth, exploring glaciers that are rapidly disappearing due to climate change, and in the process, recognizing the heart of Iceland” “the embodiment of those ever-warring human impulses, the ongoing spar between independence and community, freedom and collaboration, the Viking yearning clashing with the undeniable democratic power of the Althing, the bipolar nature of humankind somehow captured by these seasons of ultimate dark and ultimate light in the Cove of Smoke.”The book is funny and irreverent and breezily written but – and Stephen Markley may hate this – it’s also highly informative and educational. He shines a spotlight on why Iceland was the only country to bounce back after the economic crash by going through a process of personal reflection and readjusting its expectations rather than “partying on.” He gives a sobering look at what the glaciers mean to the world’s water supply and why ours might be the last generation to explore them. And he provides a very candid look at Reykjavik’s charismatic and surprisingly down-to-earth mayor, the “hidden people” (trolls and elves), and why Iceland’s lure continues to entice.Within this framework, there’s a “buddy bonding” story – three young guys who traveled there after buying into the fantasy that “supermodels work at McDonald’s”, along with a fair amount of male libido jokes and bodily function remarks (hey, they’re in their 20s, so you can just imagine!)

ReminisceSo many of the stories in this collection are absolute stunners that it’s easier to forgive the few stories that don’t quite make the grade. Reminiscent of Ms. Bergman’s Birds of a Lesser Paradise – yet (in my mind) much better executed, the finest stories interweave the immutable connection between humankind and the rest of the animal kingdom.The opening story, Terror Birds, awes with its power. It’s set in an Arizona ostrich farm, told through alternating first person narrations of mother and son. When Jack’s childhood security is threatened by his father’s adultery, he reflects, “I had no interest in a superhero with a mind at work. I loved the ostriches – and all the other monsters—for what they were: sheer brute force, untempered by either conscience or consciousness.” These reflections are portentous and Ms. Geni keeps her readers on a tightrope as we watch how it plays out.Dharma at the Gate has its own power, setting up a compelling triangle: an emotionally damaged teenage boy, his girlfriend who is desperate – but unable – to break away, and her loyal dog. As she fights for possession of her own future and her own soul, she recognizes what she must give up to attain the freedom that calls to her.The eponymous The Last Animal centers on a middle-aged woman whose husband deserted her many years ago. She sets out on a journey of catharsis to Mexico, where he had mailed her a number of letters. As she witnesses rarely seen ocean life, she discovers something important about herself: “On the whole, she preferred in the realm of mystery and miracles. In the end, she preferred not to know.”Captivity is beautiful in its terseness, focusing on a 31-year-old octopus handler living with her mother and struggling to make sense of her brother’s disappearance. She tells a co-worker: “When I started working here, he was furious at me. Mostly because of the dolphins. Unconscionable, he said. We had a big fight about it. I told him that at least they were alive in here. Out in the wild, they could be tuna.” Eventually, her definition of “being alive” shifts and changes.And, in Flight Blight, Cosmo, a gardener grieving over his wife’s miscarriage tries to come to terms with his loss, surprising his returning wife with a “wild, blooming layout…a strange, new living thing” to give solace and a touch of hope.The finest stories are those that most closely explore our bond with other animals; those stories are haunting and unforgettable. There are a couple of others that are less compelling, but Abby Geni is truly a writer to watch. When she’s good, she’s very, very good.

White Dog Fell from the Sky. And to this group, I now add Aminatta Forna’s masterwork, The Memory of Loss. Perhaps it is no coincidence that each of these works, at its core, is about the survival of the human spirit and the triumphant resurgence of love during the worst times of war and torture. At our harshest times, we become the most human and reveal our best and our worst.So it is with this story. Adrian Lockheart, a British psychologist, whose heart may indeed have become frozen and locked, comes to Sierra Leone with the best of intentions. He quickly becomes friends with Ka Mansaray, a gifted and tormented young orthopedic surgeon, whose current patient Foday may be a metaphor for the country: crippled and in need of reconstruction to embrace the future. Adrian also deals with a patient of his own: the elderly Elias Cole, an unreliable storyteller if ever there was one, whose captivating recitations center on post-colonial times and his obsession with the wife of a colleague.All of these men (with the exception of Foday) will be swept into the vortex of one charismatic woman whose present and past history will define them within themselves and in relation to each other. While this plotting may rely a tad too heavily on coincidence, the characters are so fleshed out and the story is so stunningly told that this plot device can easily be given a pass.In this “land of the mute”, the stories that are told are compelling and can also be self-serving. As one character states, “It’s happening all over the country. People are blotting out what happened, fiddling with the truth, creating their own version of events to fill in the blanks. A version of the truth which puts them in a good light, that wipes out whatever they did or failed to do and makes certain none o them will be blamed.”It is up to the characters to recognize the silence of the lie, even when the lie becomes internalized. Ms. Forna delineates the two types of liars well: the less educated who express their conflicts physically through psychosomatic illnesses, muteness, paralysis, nightmares, fugues…and those who are “clever” enough to intellectualize their experiences and transform them into a different type of story.At its heart, The Memory of Love is a love song to a country.

I was thrilled to win this book since I loved Ms. Joyce's debut book, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Frye.Rachel Joyce deserves applause for not going back to the well. PERFECT is an entirely different book, revealing the versatility of this author. And indeed, I expect it WILL be Perfect for some readers. My personal reading experience was a bit more conflicted.The book focuses on two boys: Byron and James, two privileged 11-year-olds who attend Winston House School because it is private. James is the cleverer of the two, and shares some trivia with Byron: two seconds will be added to time to balance time with the earth’s movement. Those two seconds will eventually make a world of difference when his focus on the time anomaly coincides with a terrible miscalculation on the part of his mother, Diana.Alternating chapters center on an older man named Jim, a gentle but damaged character whose obsessive-compulsive disorder and memory loss place him out of step with those around him. These two seemingly unrelated stories eventually provide the whole of a puzzle.The author knows how to tell a compelling story; she has proved that before and she proves it again. Yet the story, this time, may be a little too pat. Acquiescent Diana – who tries mightily to be the perfect wife-- and her controlling husband, Seymour, are a little too clichéd, even for the early 1970s (which is when this book takes place). Her would-be friend, Beverley, who is of a whole different social class, is too evident in her manipulation; I couldn’t quite understand why Diana couldn’t see through her. And Jim’s therapeutic guidance can seem rote (“Yes, we have done some very good work,” says the counselor. Jim is ready to let go. He can get on with his life now.”)Additionally, the theme is hammered home once too often “You said we shouldn’t play with time. It isn’t up to us, you said, “You were right. It’s playing with fire when we tamper with the gods.” And later “All those years of trying to get it right –they meant nothing. You can run and run, but in the end you won’t get away from the gods.”While not perfect, this is far from an imperfect read. I can imagine this book being a favorite of book clubs for the questions it evokes about social strata and rigid gender expectations, fractured lives and false self-perceptions, the stigma of mental illness, and perfection is often not the standard we should strive for.

For some, the success of harvesting souls.""This sweepingly ambitious novel by Joseph Boyden – a 500 page epic – focuses strongly on all these successes as well as failures in the early beginnings of Canada, when the Huron, the Iroquois as the Jesuit missionaries clashed together. It’s narrated by three characters: the well-respected Huron warrior Bird, the Iroquois girl Snow Falls, whom he claims as his daughter after slaying her true family, and Christophe, a French Jesuit missionary whose faith defines his very existence.It is evident that Joseph Boyden did exhaustive work to unearth this story of 17th century Canada. It rings of authenticity, from the description of the missionaries (called “crows” because of the way they are perceived to hop around and peck at the dead or dying… the oki, or soul, that resides within each human, animal and thing…the rules of battle between the Huron and the Iroquois…the meticulous creation of the wampum belt…and so much more.The cultural barriers between the Huron and Iroquois and the Christians are both dark and brutal and enlightening. Torture, to the Christians, was a barbarian act used to punish and demean. The Huron and the Iroquois used another word for torture: they called it “caressing”, and its purpose was to honor their captured and to celebrate a strong spirit that a courageous enemy might possess. Mr. Boyden goes into great detail about the torturing rituals and while the scenes are definitely cringe-worthy, they heightened my understanding enormously.But let’s get back to the start of this : the measurement of success. That measurement left me conflicted for many days now, contemplating how to measure a book such as the one Joseph Boyden wrote.From a literary standpoint? There are many passages that are six-star brilliant. The opening, in which he twins his characters with animals (I wasn’t quite sure if I were reading about a human or an animal) was beautifully crafted. Descriptions of the inadvertent harm caused by the Jesuits – upsetting a balance generations in the making, and shifting from a more mystical view of the world to one in which humans crave more and more control are stunningly portrayed.Yet there are also times when the prose falls down, or doesn’t strive nearly hard enough. As the story becomes more of an adventurous telling, I missed finding out more about the interior lives of the characters. Yes, Christophe is faith-filled and resilient, but what in his past made him so? Is he ever troubled by the beginnings of doubt? And yes, Snow Falls is a wonderfully rebellious character, but how is it possible for her to balance her growing daughterly love with the knowledge of her family’s massacre? Some of the prose appears out of place, as when Bird turns to his sidekick Fox and explodes, “Tell me again why I thought bringing them among us was a good idea?” So over and over I asked myself: what determines a 5-star book? Is it a book that educates us or morally enlightens us? Is it a book that grabs us by the collar and won’t let go until we breathlessly turn the last page? Is it a book that changes our way of thinking and remains in our minds, long after it’s been read? Or is it a book that is defined by consistently sterling prose and authentic characters?The best answer is “all of the above.” Those are the books that end up as classics and I don’t think Joseph Boyden’s The Orenda is quite there. But days later, I can’t get the book and its contents out of my mind. It may be flawed for this reader, but I’m giving it 5 stars. There’s too much that is good about it to give anything less....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Sep 22, 2013","Sep 27, 2013","Sep 22, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17661831-the-orenda

In the very best of these stories, a young boy or girl is forced to witness the ugliness of society and then must move forward – suddenly older, wiser and sobered.And so it is here with Montana 1948, an absolutely breathtaking and spare novel, with images so searing that the line between reality and fiction was totally blurred.The premise: 12-year-old David Hayden – only son of the Bentrock, Montana sheriff, grandson of the dominating ranch owner and former sheriff, and nephew to the town’s doctor – has its world turned upside down when Marie, the Sioux housekeeper, accuses his uncle of unspeakable things. The aftermath sets brother against brother, son against father, and the plainspoken townspeople against the voiceless Indians. In the space of a few weeks, David will see first-hand what occurs when practicality and expediency are set against moral absolutism and when long-time family loyalty comes crashing against one’s personal sense of what is right and what is just.I cannot give enough accolades for this book. There is not one single excess word; each word reflects the purity of prose that is the mark of only the finest writers. Yet in a mere 169 pages, Larry Watson sets up a situation of such moral complexity – and introduces characters that are so real, vibrant and flawed – that it is literally impossible to read the book in more than one sitting.

It’s a rather ancient yellow-and-white Lisbon funicular train that unfailingly carries its cargo of housewives and office workers every workday morning. It forks off, continues its way, enters into dark tunnels, and sputters its way into daylight once again.In short, it’s a metaphor for love.Love and relationships are subjects that fascinate Herve Le Tellier, who focused on it in his prior book, Enough About Love. Here he explores it once again in all its glorious (and not-so-glorious) aspects.Vincent Balmer – middle-aged journalist, writer, translator and lovesick fool – moves to Lisbon after being spurned by Irene, a much younger woman who is the object of his obsessions. There he partners with the photographer Antonio to report on an infamous serial killer’s trial…while at the same time, pursuing his own obsession of writing a book (with the provisional title Electrico W). Vincent is dense about love, unlike the more jaded Antonio…who harbors his own love for a girl he calls Duck, whom he met as an impressionable teenager and can’t get out of his mind. Irene may have a thing for Antonio. But so does another girl he meets. And is another woman about to shock Vincent out of his love addiction?Yet in addition to the love theme, Herve Le Tellier is interested in relaying the stories we tell. Vincent – in addition to the novel he is working on – is translating a number of quirky short-shorts by Jaime Montestrela. Fiction and fact, truth and perception, and love, obsession and languor all co-exist simultaneously, leading the reader through his or her own journey. Sometimes it seems slightly contrived, other times it works beautifully. To quote Arthur Miller, “Attention must be paid.”It’s worth mentioning that Le Tellier is a member of a French literary group Oulipo, which is dedicated to finding new patterns and structures that writers can use in any way they enjoy. As one story recedes and another begins, as stories overlap, it becomes evident that Electrico W is really about how we tell ourselves stories…and which stories are true and false. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 16, 2013","Sep 20, 2013","Sep 16, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/13642338-electrico-w

For me, the only one that didn’t quite live up to its potential was Letters From An Academy, an epistolary story that seemed as if it would be better crafted as a narrative (I never believed in the authenticity of the letters).

Or more specifically, what is an American in Molly Antopol’s world?A traditional answer might be to have a personal sense of identity and to be unencumbered to pursue one’s most shining hopes and dreams in a land where anything is possible. Molly Antopol’s characters are mostly Jewish and they are mostly alienated – from spouse or kids, from past ideology and beliefs, and often, from their most authentic selves. Each story is a little gem onto itself.We meet an American actor of Russian ancestry who has eschewed his Russian past, only to leverage it in order win a part with a leftist film director. Fingered during the McCarthy era, he goes to prison in support of beliefs that aren’t even truly his. Upon release, he spends a weekend with his admiring 10-year-old son and comes face-to-face with his hypocrisy.In one of my favorites, A Difficult Phase, a downsized Israeli journalist –floundering in her life – begins to question her life choices when she meets an attractive widower and his young teenage daughter. “This is what she was good at: being the blank, understanding face across the table; putting people so at ease they revealed the things they didn’t want to share with anyone, the things they wished didn’t exist at all.”Another story, The Old World, focuses on a middle-aged tailor who meets and marries a Ukrainian widow, and travels with her back to her hometown, only to discover that he is a poor substitute for her dead husband. He reflects on his grown daughter who is a “born-again Jew”: “Maybe in religion, Beth really had discovered a way never to be alone. Maybe I am the lost one, wandering the streets of Kiev, competing with a dead man.”Other stories are equally well-crafted and psychologically acute: a decorated Israeli solder comes home and suffers a fluke accident, which sets in play some poignant dynamics between him and his brother. A political dissident in Russia discovers that his neglected daughter has written an autobiographical play with himself as a key character. A young American woman and her Israeli husband must face the reality of their marriage, which is “so scary and real it required an entirely different language, new and strange and yet to be invented.”Psychologically astute, subtlety crafted and haunted, this is a confident and poised debut, which may very well end up on my Top Ten of 2014 list.

Larry Watson is a master of breathing life into his characters through ordinary conversations and actions that hint at extraordinary revelations that bubble right beneath the surface.The story takes place in Dalton, North Dakota in 1951 in what some people refer to as the “real America” – a place where people don’t waste words, where hard work and straight talk is respected, and where the people and the land are reliant on each other. Their grown son has met with tragedy, and Margaret prevails upon her taciturn husband to travel to Gladstone, Montana to find his namesake Jimmy…a boy who has been caught in the web of his stepfather’s violent Weboy family.Larry Watson walks a delicate tightrope; what he doesn’t reveal is every bit as meaningful as what he describes. Is the long and tender marriage of Margaret and George more complex than it appears? What were they like as parents to their twins – James, who is now dead, and Janie, who is estranged from them? Does raising Jimmy give them the right to another chance?Along the way, there are brutal surprises and heartbreaks and words so true they cause the reader to gasp at their validity. Take this, for example: “A four-year-old has so little past, and he remembers almost none of it, neither the father he once had nor the house where he once lived. But he can feel the absences – and feel them as sensation, like a texture that was once at his fingers every day but now is gone and no matter how he gropes or reaches his hand he cannot touch what’s no longer there.”At the end of the day, Let Him Go is about what’s worth fighting for and what’s worth sacrificing for along this rocky road of life. Gutsy, authentic, and downright riveting, it’s a book that succeeds at blurring that thin barrier between fiction and the outside world. Quite simply, it’s hard to believe that these characters are anything but 100% real. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 07, 2013","Sep 08, 2013","Sep 07, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17318621-let-him-go

And I took a pass…until friends urged me to give it a try. Don’t make the same mistake I nearly did. This is a fantastic book without a false note. It’s intelligently written, non-manipulative, and, in certain places, really heart rendering. And it has very much transformed my perception of Navy SEALS…a perception that recognized their heroism without fully understanding what the external and internal wars they must fight.Sara’s son Jason is the very embodiment of a Navy SEAL – “soldier, scholar, son.” The only child of a somewhat stoical and loving mother and a much-older father who is no longer around, Jason surprises himself and his mother by signing up for SEAL training after nine eleven.He finds himself training for a much different conflict than, say, the Vietnam War. He writes his mother, “What we are learning now is that so much of warfare is fought at close quarters, and the essence of fighting in close quarters is restraint. Restraint, intelligence, conservation. This emphasis changes the calculus of war.”Slowly but surely, Jason goes through the rigorous training of a Navy SEAL. He learns that “feelings are things to be analyzed and discarded before the load-out.” Gradually, he learns to be in complete control of his emotions: he rarely has anxiety pangs or doubts and increasingly, his training even takes over the fabric of his dreams. Ms. Carpenter writes, “The emotional arc of an operator is not unlike that of most civilians: born idealistic, cynicism comes from experience, and then develops into caustic optimism – or acceptance – of the tasks at hand. Controlling emotion when op tempo isn’t a skill; it’s an art.”Jason is not an automaton, though. He develops strong and protective feelings for his Team members, remains a loving son, is a scholar who knows his history, philosophy, and literature, and believes strongly in his own sense of purpose. It is very, very obvious that Ms. Carpenter has conducted many interviews with actual SEALS and she breathes life into her character.The other side of the equation is Sara. While Jason sees heroism, she sees mindless sacrifice. To her, Jason is not a hero on a mission; he is her son, her world. And while she does not deny the risks – Jason’s father, after all, was tangentially involved with the military -- her toughness is tempered by a mother’s loving concern.The title – Eleven Days – represents the number of days that Jason goes missing while on a high profile mission.

Add in a less than savory caregiver who gives copious hints that she is not everything she says she is. It’s a formula that has been used by Tatjana Soli in The Forgetting Tree and the Finnish author Tove Jansson in The Unwanted Guest… among others. Fiona McFarlane revisits it in The Night Guest and places her own spin on it. And the great thing is – it works, exceedingly well.The two key characters are Ruth Field, a woman who lives alone in an Australian seaside home after the death of her husband, often commanding up memories of her Fijian childhood, her two sons who live far away, and her first love, a man named Richard. Into this lonely world comes Frida Young, who claims to be sent by the government as a caregiver.Yet right from the start, the reader senses that something is off. Frida doesn’t exactly act like a typical caregiver. Ruth seems…well, some of her actions are called into question. And the dynamics between the two women smack of a certain sadomasochism. And then there’s the question of the tiger, that Ruth swears enters her parlor at night, and which Frida appears to buy into. What is true and what is false? What can the reader believe?In Fiona McFarlane’s capable hands, all this is quite believable. The writing is assured, confident, hypnotic and suspenseful…and often luscious with detail. The psychological underpinnings are subtlely rendered and the denouement is authentic and organic. And the themes are universal: aging and the loss of independence, trust tempered with fear, memory and reality.Ruth – an ordinary yet extraordinary older woman – comes across as fully-realized; she is overly considerate, her back hurts, she doesn’t want to give up her car, she still has that spark of life, she is able to laugh at herself. Fiola is appropriately menacing and yet…in a strange way, seems to genuinely care about Ruth.

So first, I’d like to thank GoodReads FirstReads for the privilege of reading The Returned before the general public.That being said, this is a very hard  to write. How do you  a book that you strongly suspect will be a real winner for a large audience…but you do not feel part of the intended audience? I guess, with candor and honesty.So let’s start with the good stuff. There is no doubt that Jason Mott can write. His writing flows like a knife through butter – engagingly, beautifully, even poetically in places. Going one step further, this is a definite YA crossover, which means that both adults and their teenagers can equally enjoy it. And, among the themes it with well is our universal experience of loss and how we respond to it.The premise is this: all over the world,people’s loved ones are being returned. The story focuses on one particular family, Harold and Lucille, whose only son, Jacob, drowned before his eighth birthday party. Now, half a century later, he’s returned to them, exactly as he was the day he died.But who is Jacob, really? Is he a religious symbol of redemption? Is he the devil incarnate? How do people accept what they don’t understand? The plot does not focus on answering these questions as much as it explores what occurs as a result of these “returned.” And what occurs is fear, fighting, government meddling, internment and building tension.The obvious next question is, “Why didn’t I love it?” For one thing, I could not accept the premise as (to quote Lucille) a “blessing from God.” Or, as the town pastor says, “I would argue that ultimately, everything of the physical world is rooted in the spiritual. God and the supernatural are the roots from which the physical world grows. In spite of all of science’s advances, in spite of many disciplines and theories, the flashing lights and buzzers of its modern phalanx of technology, the biggest questions – how the universe began, what is the ultimate fate and goal of humanity – remain as unanswered now by science as they always have been.”As the book progressed, I came to believe that this is Jason Mott’s belief…but as a nonbeliever, it is not mine. I was surprised that the characters accepted The Returned so quickly and easily. I was seeing an overlay: science, supernatural, something to tether the story. Incredibly, most people rather quickly accepted “The Returned” as part of the End Times.In some pivotal ways, The Returned reminds me of The Lovely Bones (another book everyone loved but me). I felt I was manipulated into a sort of “feel good” narrative where life and death are blurred. By saying so, I realize I am revealing more about my own biases than I am about the book itself.If you loved Lovely Bones – or Tom Perrotta’s book The Leftovers, on a similar theme – by all means, read this. If you don’t need to dig too deeply to enjoy a book, read this. And finally, if you’re seeking lovely prose with a YA crossover appeal, read this.

It also helps to surrender to the journey – a journey that spans over 700 pages – because immediate answers will not be forthcoming. This is a big book in every sense of the word: big in breadth, in ideas, in audacity. You will lose your heart to it and end up shaking your head in awe and admiration. And along the way, you will learn something about the shadowy world of politics and espionage, the hypocrisy of religion, and the lengths that the players go to keep their sense of identity – their very soul – from fragmenting.So what IS it about? That’s not an easy question to tackle. The eponymous woman of the title is Dottie Chambers, the hypnotic and damaged daughter of the elite spy Steven Chambers – surely one of the most screwed up characters in contemporary literature. As a young boy, Steven witnessed the atrocities of Tito’s Muslim partisans against his own father, and he came to age with a zeal to right the wrongs…eventually pulling Dottie into his malignant orbit.That is all I intend to say about the plot, which spans five decades, many countries, and a wide range of themes. The novel consists of five separate books, some short, some long, a catalog-of-sorts of 20th century atrocities and the loss of not only the individual soul, but our collective soul as well. Mr. Shacochis has choreographed a spellbinder, with hints (depending on where you are in the book) of David Mitchell, John Le Carre, Ernest Hemingway, and others…while keeping the narrative distinctly his.The themes this author tackles go right to the heart of identity and destiny. “We choose the lies in which we participate and in choosing, define ourselves and our actions for a very long time,” he writes at one point. In other passage, we are first introduced to Steven with these words: {Steven would be} “introduced in the most indelible fashion to his destiny, the spiritual map that guides each person finally to the door o the cage that contains his soul, and in his hand a key that will turn the lock, or the wrong key, or no key at all.”The questions he asks are universal: how do you change back if your former self no longer interlocks cleanly with the shape you have assumed? What happens when you become an actor in a theater without walls or boundaries or audiences? Where is the thin wall of separation between “patriotism and hatred, love and violence, ideology and facts, judgment and passion, intellect and emotion, duty and zealotry, hope and certainty, confidence and hubris, power and fury…” And when do we have the right to challenge and to reclaim our own souls before it’s too late?This is an amazing book, a true magnus opum, a story of who we are and how we came to be that way.

After turning the last page of Cartwheel, I am sure of it. This is an exceptional novel: poised, confident, filled with strong prose and fully fleshed-out characters.There’s no getting around the fact that the book is inspired by the highly publicized Amanda Knox case. Instead of Italy, the setting is Buenos Aires. But Lily Hayes, like Amanda, is studying abroad when her roommate, Katy, is found murdered. Again, like Amanda, her emotional affect is “off”; put another way, she’s “not likeable.” In fact she performs a cartwheel while waiting for interrogation (Amanda Knox performed splits), which doesn’t prove that she’s guilty but DOES indicate that she’s “not sad.”This novel, though, is not a “did she do it?” book, nor is it a nod to sensationalism. Rather, it explores the prisons of our own making…and how perceptions can sometimes create reality. Each major character is confined in his or her own prison-of-choice (Lily’s parents are suffering from the death of a child that preceded Lily in the birth order, Sebastien – her boyfriend – is fossilized in a mansion where he hides from the world, and the beautifully-portrayed prosecutor, Eduardo, has imprisoned himself within his rules.) Only Lily appears to be “free” (or is freedom just another word for nothing left to lose?) as she drinks in the sights and sounds and experiences of Argentina, waiting for life to explode around her.Lily and her prosecutor, Eduardo, are philosophical opposites. Lily, as described by her younger sister, “thinks the whole world revolves around the gaping vacuum of her needs.” Lacking in authentic emotions and believing her needs are “the vortex of reality”, she is not a sympathetic character, yet she bursts forth with life. Her philosophy: “Someday we’ll all be dead, but we’re not dead yet. And something is finally happening.”Eduardo, on the other hand, is a highly principled man who trusts the rules and his instincts to a fault. He believes: “We must act as though our understanding, as limited as it might be, is the most panoramic and complete understanding possible. We must act as though everything in this life counts; as though we have only one shot to get things right. We must act as though nobody would see the truth if we did not see the truth.”The reader, unwittingly, will become a major player in the equation. Your reactions to Lily and Eduardo – your belief or disbelief in her innocence or guilt – will say a lot about your own view of the universe. As a character-focused reader, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It’s a true page-turner that will make you drop everything until you finish it....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,Sep 2013,"Sep 05, 2013","Aug 22, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17857661-cartwheel

It focuses on two characters, Alice – the youngest daughter in a family of three girls, who has left behind unresolved relationships, both with her soon-to-die father and her boyfriend Kal. Daniel, a street hobo who experiences vibrant colors as letters and is mourning a loss, is on his own unfinished mission. Slowly, they move closer towards each other and to some sense of stability and connection.It’s a strange, fugue-like book that seems to lurch between sugary manipulation and poignant emotion. Alice’s sister – and then Alice herself -- eventually says, “Things were better off left unsaid.” And things are unsaid. There are a lot of plot twists and motives that are simply left for the reader to imagine. At many crucial junctures, I found myself asking, “Why?” but the answer is never readily forthcoming. Anchored between each chapter is a deceptively simple list of 10 things (from the prosaic “Ten ways other people might describe me” to the more tantalizing “Ten things I found that spell your name.”)At the end of the day, I found that the overriding message – a message that combines the search for love and identity, the sacrifices we make even when we have very little to offer, the meaning of home and connection – were deeply affecting. Yet still, I found myself striving for more – wanting to gain more insights into the characters and their motivations.This is a very difficult book for me to rate. I can easily see it being a 5-star for some readers…a 2-star for others.

Nigerian born and Amherst educated in economics, he is underemployed as a New York City cab driver, where he spends his days anxious about his substantial debt, incurred when he married a greedy woman to obtain green card status.Driven to desperation, he hatches a nefarious plan: travel back to his homeland, steal the village’s powerful war god Ngene, and sell it to the tony art gallery – Foreign Gods Inc. – and specifically to its proprietor who buys and sells foreign deities.It’s a very innovative and imaginative premise and for the most part, Okey Ndibe really pulls it off. One key theme is the ubiquitous encroaching of materialism and the worshipping of the new religion: the almighty dollar. Ike’s return to Nigeria – where most of the book takes place – reveals him to be displaced, neither of here nor there. Worshipped himself as a rich American (of course, there’s nothing further from the truth), Ike is caught between his foolishly pious mother, who has under the influence of a shady and hypocritical Christian pastor, and his revered uncle, who clings to the war god Ngene and the old ways.Yet though Ike fully inhabits neither world, he is a full-fledged citizen of the World of Temptation, a world that is governed by consumerism, money worship, and the transference of esteemed cultural icons to items to be bought and sold. If there is a fault, it’s that in certain places, Okey Ndibe’s satire becomes a bit too farcical.

I chose the latter. The skeleton facts are all there: the 32-year-old mother with six (or is it seven?) young children whose spirit remains strong even while the family is suffering hunger pains…and the photographer who wrestles with her ambition while making a different decision about her own two children. Add in a completely fictional character, Walker – a professor of cultural history who has his own reasons for pursuing his interest in this story – and you have three intriguing perspectives of the times.This type of concept could easily have fallen into hagiography, but it doesn’t. Marisa Silver does a great job of recreating the era and sketching her characters with enough attributes – both good and bad – to make them come alive.And then she goes one step further to ask a vital question: when you see a photograph like Migrant Mother, do you look or do you truly see? How far does any photo go to capture the life of the subject rather than just a frozen moment in time? Are we all inadvertent historians? As Walker reflects: “It is the human fallacy to believe that we discover any single thing. It is only that we are slow to learn how to see what is in front of us.”Marisa Silver has written a fine novel, beautifully weaving imagination with historical fact.

And the “lesser planets” are his first ex-wife, a physician who has worked hard to reclaim her identity, and their two shared adult children, Will/Billy and Anna. The story soars when it displays how Will and Anna struggle to get out from the shadow of the fame that always threatens to eclipse them. Will is at odds, always a little bit angry, never quite sure of what his place is in life and where he is heading. Anna, who follows her mother into medicine, finds herself attracted to a father substitute figure, who possesses some of the charm and deceit of Renn himself. Other stables and hanger-ons – including Renn’s second ex-wife, his new much younger girlfriend, and Will and Anna’s lovers – also get their moment in the sun.To me, the book did not entirely succeed for two reasons. First, it was important for the reader to truly feel Renn’s overwhelming charisma, and I never did. For the most part, he seemed like a cardboard character: a super-star who indeed, was interchangeable with just about any other superstar out there. The uniqueness of Renn never really took hold.And second, there just wasn’t enough differentiation in the voices of the characters. A certain sameness in tone suggested that each character was a less-important extension of the “big man”. Although the characters each had their own uniqueness, there were too many times I felt I was being lead. (For instance, when Anna becomes involved with a father figure, I don’t have to be told that he may be a father substitute by the author. I can figure it out for myself.)Christina Sneed is a very good writer and her perspective – from the family’s perspective instead of the superstar’s – definitely has merit.

I urge anyone who picks this up to clear the docket for the next couple of days. Jane Harris’ narrator Harriet may set the standard for unreliable narrators and her “memoir” will have you on the edge of your seat.Harriet Baxter comes across a little-known artist named Ned Gillespie. She is a woman of means, a “spinster” in her mid-30s, and footloose after nursing an old aunt who has just passed away. After a brief encounter with the artist, she chances upon him and his family – his wife, two young daughters, and elderly mother – on a visit to Glasgow.Gradually, Harriet will form a strong relationship with this family and becomes an integral part of their individual lives. After certain events transpire, the questions become: can we trust Harriet’s version of the events? Are our fates foretold and are they inexorable (or as Harriet puts it, “Are all of us doomed to live out our destinies?”) What lengths do we go to get what we want?I hesitate to say much more, since much of the power of the book comes from the unexpected turns of plot. Even the themes hint at what is to come. Suffice to say that this novel of obsession is laced with Victorian period details and strong character delineations and keeps the reader off guard in discovering what is true and what is not true.

Then, Julian Barnes implies, it is up to the writer to go in search for them for his very salvation.Levels of Life is a heartbreakingly personal meditation on the unrelenting grief of an uxorious husband – Julian Barnes himself -- upon the rather sudden death of his wife Pat Kavanagh. It is also a book of linked narratives – a historical essay on ballooning and photography, focusing on the French balloonist and photographer Felix Tournachon, and a fact-based fictional piece that centers on Tournachon’s desire for Sarah Bernhardt, herself a balloonist. It is not until halfway through the short book that Julian Barnes introduces his own story.At first, the stories seem loosely linked and certainly unconventional. But wait – there is a pattern and a theme that ties them in. “You put together two things that have not been put together before,” the first narrative begins, “and the world is changed.” And the second narrative? “You put together two things that have not been put together before; and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Finally, the third: “You put together two people who have not been put together before…sometimes it works, and something new is made, and the world is changed.” Julian Barnes is interested in how things are put together and what happens when they are torn apart. His book comes back time and time again to themes of flying and soaring…of drifting…of sinking. Time and again, he returns to themes from his first two narratives: how far each of us falls in life, how we try to avoid the depths and regain a little height, how our memories – the mind’s photographic archive – fails us as images blur. Even as the reader feels like a voyeur in witnessing the grief of a known author and fellow human being, we watch from our own distance – not unlike viewing the world below from a balloon or examining it through a photographic image. Grief – that journey we all must take – and life itself is “so clear, so sure, until, for one reason or another – the balloon moves, the cloud disperses, the sun changes angle – the image is lost forever.” The writer can unveil patterns but it is up to the reader to decipher the images and the connections.

Earlier this year, Mohsin Hamid explored the topic in his book ""How To Become Filthy Rich in Rising Asia."" Now Tash Aw weighs in with Five Star Billionaire. Interestingly, each of these accomplished authors employ a ""how to"" self-help book conceit (in this case, How To Achieve Greatness, How To Manage Time and so on).The problem -- or perhaps the point -- of this novel is, after a while, the strivers and the wannabes begin to blend together in a patina of sameness, threads in the fabric of Shanghai. Each of Tash Aw's characters is searching for success and wealth, which won't necessarily equate with happiness. Each arrives in Shanghai with an amorphous identity, looking to the city to define who they are. And each carries the seeds of self-destruction, with the inability to engage in deep introspection. Each, in a word, is false and self-deceptive. As one character says, ""There is not one aspect of myself that I haven't lied about.""Phoebe is a factory girl in rural Malaysia, determined to reinvent herself and make it big in Shanghai. The way to a real success for her is to accumulate the fake accoutrements that Shanghai is known for: a fake LV (read: Louis Vuitton) purse, a fake ""expensive"" watch, and so on. In her recreation of herself, she becomes not ""more than"" but ""less than."" She is, for me, the most compelling of the characters and perhaps the one with the most to gain -- or lose.Justin, the scion of a wealthy real estate family, is in Shanghai to salvage his family's disappearing prospects, but fears that he will not be able to live up to expectations. Leong Yinghui runs a highly successful high-end lingerie company but falls into the ultimate stereotype: the woman who does well in business but is a failure in her personal life (and oh, it would be great to retire that stereotype!) Gary is a pop idol who sabotages his own spiraling career through a drunken night club altercation. And finally, there's Walter Chao, the first-person narrative of the self-help book and the eponymous ""five star billionaire"".All these individuals will rub against each other, testing fate and becoming intertwined in their quest to move ahead. Sometimes the interactions seem organic; sometimes they don't. I paused in several places to determine whether they - or the situations they were in -- passed the test of credibility.Having said that - and in all fairness - I wonder if I'm criticizing the author for writing the book I want him to write instead of the book he DID write. And THAT book is done exceedingly well with a powerful depiction of Shanghai, a ruthless city on the make, a city that encourages dreaming but uncaringly spits the dreamers out at any opportunity. It's a city of fake luxury goods, iconic sites (such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa) carved from humps of snow, and false individuals who hide behind their created images and Internet exchanges to forge a tenuous sense of intimacy. Tash Aw writes, ""This is what happens in Shanghai. People say it is the size of a small country but it is not: It is bigger, like a whole continent, with a heart as deep and unknown as the forests of the Amazon and so vast and wild as the deserts of Africa. People come here like explorers, but soon they disappear and no one remembers them; no one even hears them as they fade away."" Tash Aw creates an exceptional sense of place...particularly a sense of place in a particular moment in time.Five Star Billionaire - long-listed for the Booker prize - is an ambitious novel and it's well-written with what I suspect is a great deal of authenticity. I would not discourage anyone from reading it. Initially, I gave this book 3 stars but found I cannot get it out of my head and came back and re-rated it. I came to realize the fault may not be in the stars; it may be in me, the reader. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jul 26, 2013","Jul 28, 2013","Jul 24, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16071831-five-star-billionaire

Arrested with another maidservant, Sigga, and the son of a local farmer, Fridrik, Agnes is singled out for particular scorn because she refuses to repent in the expected manner.Spirited off to northwestern Iceland to await her execution date, Agnes thinks: “They will say ‘Agnes’ and see the spider, the witch caught in the webbing of her own fateful weaving. They might see the lamb circled by ravens, bleating for a lost mother. But they will not see me. I will not be there.”This spellbinding debut has much to recommend it. The research is impeccable: all place names used in the novel are true to life and many of the working farms remain to this day. The author, in an aftermath, reveals that many of the letters, documents, and extracts beginning at the start of each chapter are translated and adapted from their original sources and that the framework of the novel is all based on solid fact.Yet Hannah Kent weaves this historical record into something close to poetry The seasons pass – the punishing landscape with its “wild screaming of snow”, the colorful and violent northern lights, the majestic and cruel peaks, the fading daylight. The reader can almost feel the whims of nature and the frigid chill in the air, and see the last vestiges of light begin to disappear.Believed to be a scheming murderess in her country (not unlike Lizzie Borden here in the States), Ms. Kent humanizes Agnes, who unburdens herself to her spiritual guardian, the young Assistant Reverend Thorvardur Jonsson. Although Agnes has never truly had control of her life, she is able to control her story: the personal saga that will be left behind.There is so much that’s good in this book that it may seem a little churlish to point out the few weaknesses. Agnes’ confrontations with her historical victim, Natan, sometimes stretch credibility; Natan is portrayed as such a dark character that I could imagine killing him myself! It was difficult to comprehend his attractiveness to Agnes or the naivety of a born survivor. The telling of the murders could also be more nuanced.That being said, this tale of a harsh, isolated life in claustrophobic settings, the strong character development, and the startlingly vivid depicture of Iceland in the 1800s makes this book a real winner. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Sep 13, 2013","Sep 16, 2013","Jul 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333319-burial-rites

(The refrain is: “He must have done something.”) Antonio is with Ricardo during a drive-by motorbike shooting that ends one life and destroys the other.What follows is one of the most harrowing descriptions of PTSD I’ve read as Antonio lives in terror of everything. The only salvation for him is to uncover the facts behind the life of the mysterious “ghosted” Ricardo and Colombia’s ignoble past. That is only the early foundation of this book. It touches on many themes: the tentacles of the drug business in Colombia and how one person’s actions have a boomerang effect on so many others. How it feels to live with a “terrible awareness of my vulnerability” – where planes fall from the sky, where bullets fell the innocent, where memories burst out of nowhere to transform and paralyze those who live through it.As Antonio reflects on the unsuspected intensity of his memories, which are “just now beginning to emerge like an object falling from the sky”, he thinks: “My contaminated life was mine alone: my family was still safe: safe from the plague of my country, from its afflicted recent history: safe from what had hunted me down along with so many of my generation (and others, too, yes, but most of all mine, the generation that was born with planes, with the flights full of bags and the bags of marijuana, the generation that was born with the War on Drugs and later experienced the consequence).”I must note that Mr. Vasquez does not place the drug war as front-and-center of his book; rather, his purpose is to display how things fall apart in a world that forces good people to relinquish their own power. As we fall out of the sky, only redemptive love can save us. By the end of the book, I had tears in my eyes from the sheer power of the writing.

But what if a mischievous teenage stunt went horribly wrong? From that point on, everything else would simply be epilogue.That is the basis of Ben Dolnick’s new book and he has the chops to deliver a well-crafted storyline to the reader. The “action” focuses on the narrator, Adam – a decent kind of kid, nice-looking, popular. He befriends the smartest kid in the school, Thomas, who despite his social awkwardness has an appealing rebellious side. The two of them become inseparable.To reveal much more about the plot would be entering spoiler territory. The two are torn apart by a terrible secret they both must bear, and as a young adult, Adam is forced to enter his friend’s spiraling-out-of-control orbit once again. The majority of the book takes place in the present, as the ramifications of this secret radiate throughout their lives.This type of plot has been done before. What elevates this book is the care and insight that Ben Dolnick has taken to explore the search for redemption and the authenticity of his approach. Among the themes: running towards, not away, from what is most terrifying, descending into cavernous areas of one’s mind, and experiencing the utter darkness to come out through the light. If this sounds “new agey” it is – a little. But it never gets preachy. As a reader, I cared about Adam and Thomas and their individual and totally distinctive struggles to embrace or evade the questions that took hold of them.

The author tips her hand in the titled quote: “Happiness is like water…We’re always trying to grab onto it, but it’s always slipping between our fingers.”These are stories where urgent needs of the characters are often unmet and where emotional survival is often precarious. These are also uniquely Nigerian stories; as readers, we get to see the culture and mores of this fascinating country up close and personal. But most of all, these are strong stories – intimate, accessible, authentic, and gracefully written.The anthologized story, America, focuses on a narrator named Nnenna, a science teacher, who is appealing for a visa to join her gay lover, Gloria, in America. The timing is right: America has just suffered a well-publicized oil spill. Yet is the need for a less-complicated life a betrayal of sorts since Nigeria also needs its talents? Nneena reflects, “Now the mangroves are dead, and there is no birdsong at all. And of course, there are no fish, no shrimp, and no crab to be caught. Instead, oil shoots up in the air like a fountain of black water, and fisherman lament that rather than coming out of the water, they are instead harvesting Shell oil on their bodies.”Ms. Okparanta’s stories are peopled with those in trauma: in Wahala!, a barren young wife is forced to go to a dibia to remove a “curse by the enchanted” and then to endure a painful act of sex in order to conceive a child so that her husband will retain community respect. In Runs Girl, a young student whose mother can’t afford proper medical help is coerced into an act of prostitution. We find women and children seeking refuge and shelter from abusive husbands, gay lovers who must forego love because one is acquiescing to an arranged marriage, and barren spinsters who will cross moral boundaries to have a child.Yet despite the dark material, these stories are so darn good. Chinelo Okparanta has a wonderful voice and power of description, and her portrait of Nigerian life shines through. In the past few months, I’ve read fabulous books by Nigerians Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, A. Igoni Barrett, and now Chinelo Okparanta.

The People of the Trees is rife with moral ambiguity throughout, which makes it a particularly mesmerizing and mind-challenging debut.A short Google search reveals that the book was inspired on real Nobel laureate Carleton Gajdusek. The book purports to be the memoir of celebrated scientist Norton Perina, edited by his colleague and admirer Ronald Kubodera, after Dr. Perina is jailed for the molestation of one of his many adopted children. What we get is the compelling back story, as told by an unreliable narrator. Norton Perina travels to a Micronesian island, called Ivu’ivu, where an amazing discovery is made: this primitive culture contains humans who have been alive for hundreds of years, far exceeding the natural lifespan. Although their bodies are preserved, their minds deteriorate. The import of this discovery – dubbed Selene syndrome – has vast implications for Perina’s career and reputation.The questions that arise are vastly titillating: what happens when man aspires to be a god? When we encroach on the world of the gods, when we see what we are not meant to see, how can anything but disaster follow? Or to be even more direct: what price do we place on progress? What are we willing to sacrifice and forgive?There is more to contemplate: how do we view a man with a great mind who is not so great in his personal life? Is he a legend or a monster? Should one, like Faust, sell his very soul for immortality? Does the very quest for the forbidden turn us into something less-than-human?In creating a realistic novel, Hanya Yanagihara drives readers from their comfort zones. There are some very disturbing scenes of man’s inhumanity to man…and man’s inhumanity to the animal kingdom that trusts him. There are hints of misogyny and outright examples of colonialism. The book is meant to shake us out of complacency and is not meant for readers who are seeking “feel good” narratives.If there is one problem with the book, it’s the shift in tone as the book progresses. There’s a bit of a disconnect between the professional Perina and the increasingly personal glimpses into Perina’s amorality. That being said, there is bridge that connects and solidly addresses the discrepancy between scientific progress and ethics. This is a far more transformative and fully-realized novel than, say, Anne Patchett’s State of Wonder, which tackles some of the same themes. It’s a devastating look into depravity and darkness in the name of science…for those courageous readers who are willing to take that rewarding journey....more",Notes are private!,2,642,1,"Aug 21, 2013","Aug 27, 2013","Jun 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16126596-the-people-in-the-trees

And that’s a very tall order. Does Ivy PThe cover blurb of Visitation Street promises a book that recalls Richard Price, Junot Diaz and Alice Sebold. And that’s a very tall order. Does Ivy Pochoda’s prose evoke the potent blend of sheer poetry and sassy street talk of Diaz…the raw-edged, dialogue-driven voice of Price…or the story-telling sentimentality of Sebold? No writer can have it all three ways.And indeed, Ivy Pochoda’s prose is not evocative of any of the three, let alone all of them together. Indeed, she is a strong writer who is at her very strongest when she is evoking a mood or setting a sense of place. As a born-and-bred “Brooklyn girl”, I recognized the “history being buffed and polished away in the longshoreman’s bar…the projects built over the frame houses, the pavement laid over the cobblestones, the lots overtaking the factories, the grocery stores overlapping the warehouse.” This is, after all, a story of ghosts, and Brooklyn’s Red Hook section is a key “character” in this urban opera. In the story, I recognize the ghosts of a Brooklyn in constant flux, consistently filled with “ghosts” – dead and alive – who haunt the bars, the bodegas, the schools, the churches, and the piers.But while Ivy Pochoda’s goal is ambitious – according to her publisher “it’s the evocation of an urban world and all the wandering souls – some hopeful, some broken, a few somewhere in between” – I am not quite certain she pulls it off.The focal point is a mystery – two bored teenage girls, June and Val, take a raft out on the Hudson River one humid summer evening and only one survives. The rest of the book centers on how this disappearance affects the others in the town: the surviving girl; a young black man named Cree who was in the wrong place at the wrong time; Fadi (perhaps the most intriguing character)-- a Lebanese bodega owner; Jonathan, a washed-out musician-turned-teacher, and a mysterious young man named Ren.As in many operas, these characters intermittently take their place on stage, “singing” their tale, yet the narrative fails to reach crescendo. Ms. Pochoda often leads the reader too much, like in this passage “Ghosts aren’t the dead. They’re those the dead left behind. Stay here long enough, you’ll become one of them – another ghost haunting the Hook.” The theme of ghosts becomes too concrete, whisking away the underlying mystique.By the end, I realized that I didn’t really care about what happened to June – and on a surface level, I should have. While I acknowledge this writer’s vivid prose and applauded her ambition, I didn’t quite fee; that the pieces were coming together in an organic way – for me. I can certainly understand how other respected readers and ers may differ in their points of view. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 27, 2013","Jun 30, 2013","Jun 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16240790-visitation-street

A collection of shacks inhabited by displaced families, the run-down town is just a stone’s throw from neighboring Budapest, where whites and wealthy Africans absorb the good life.NoViolet Bulawayo’s prose soars in her descriptions of this poignant childhood. We experience the hunger pangs that force Darling and her friends to venture out and steal fruit from the abundant guava trees. We feel the misery and powerlessness as Darling’s absent father slinks home from South Africa, another faceless victim of the spreading AIDS home. And we shudder in horror as Darling and her friends don the roles of the crew of the TV show ER, in order to rid their 11-year-old friend Chipo from an unwanted pregnancy with a rusted clothes hanger and other primitive instruments.Yet We Need New Names never becomes the stereotypical book about the horrors and despairs of poverty-in-Africa. Rather, NoViolet Bulawayo’s destination is interior, not exterior; her goal is to help us explore the landscape of Darling’s fertile mind.And what a mind it is! Like most any imaginative child, Darling is entranced with Paris Hilton and other icons of American culture. She makes leaping associations: the NGO workers who embarrass the children by insisting on taking photo after photo are not unlike the press that hounds American celebrities. A luxurious bed in a smashed-up home is a good place to jump and jump and jump…”the springs lifting us so high we raise our hands and almost slap the white ceiling each time we go up.” Nothing can rob Darling of her childhood.Yet half-way through the book, the focus shifts to America; Darling is one of the fortunate ones who can escape, living with her Aunt Fostalina and her common-law husband, Uncle Kojo. As readers, we’ve traveled this territory before: the oddness of snow, the gun shots, the ubiquitous technology, the ever-available porn, the teenage slang and disrespect. There are times, even in this section, where Ms. Bulawyo’s words rise to poetry: “We ate like pigs, like wolves, like dignitaries; we ate lie vultures, like stray dogs, like monsters; we ate like kings. We ate for all our past hunger, for our parents and brothers and sisters and relatives and friends who were still back there. We uttered their names between mouthfuls…if only our country could see us in America, see us eat like kings in a land that was not ours.We Need New Names is almost, but not quite, a 5 star book.

In Jessica Francis Kane’s latest story collection, characters are *this close* to making a meaningful connection, but they veer too near or too wide. Virtually every one of these short stories are about ill-defined relationships that intrinsically contain a fatal flaw, which may be in the omission of an action, a connection, an ability to move forward or to evolve with the situation.The 12 stories are written sparsely in deceptively simple prose, exhibiting the push-pull of relationships between mothers and daughters, mothers and families, husbands and wives, neighbors.In perhaps the most heartbreaking story, Next in Line, a grieving young mother exists in a sort of twilight time, unable to communicate or share her tremendous burden of pain with her husband. Each day, she haunts the CVS store where a churlish old woman seemingly predicted her daughter’s death. “It’s all so vivid, for some reason, what it was like to be her mother that day. I don’t want to let it go,” she says.  In another story, Double Take, a young man reaches out to the mother of his drowned friend – too little, too late – “but she did not want to be around those boys who had gone into the sea and come safely out again.” And in yet another, American Lawn, a once-tortured Croatian gardener becomes the unwitting pawn as two neighbors – one older and set in her ways, the other brand new – compete for his attention and approval. In two disparate stories – The Essentials of Acceleration and The Stand-In – daughters (one an adult, one a youngster) resent their fathers for surviving, even thriving, when their mothers are dead or damaged. The two stories before and after The Stand-In sketch the family dynamics that occurred before…and after.For the most part, these are quiet people, inward and passive (sometimes passive aggressive) who simply don’t know how to forge more meaningful connections.

In Maggie O’Farrell’s latest book, it does indeed. “As a Bunsen burner applied to a crucible will bring about an exchange of electrons, the division of some compounds and the unification of others, so a heatwave will act upon people. It lays them bare, it wears down their guard.”It is 1976 and London is in the grip of an historical heatwave. And in the midst of it, Gretta Riordan discovers that her husband of 40 years has gone. Her three adult children – each in the midst of his or her own personal crisis – are summoned home to deal with their father’s surprising disappearance. While together for the first time in years, they reach some understanding of who they are and what they need to move forward.The plot itself isn’t unusual. We’ve seen variations of it before: The Gathering by Anne Enright and Lying with the Dead by Michael Mewshaw, to name two recent ones. What is unusual is the meticulous care that Ms. O’Farrell takes in crafting characters that could walk off the pages.These are three adult characters who come alive: Michael Francis, the father who has never reached his full professional potential and now stands in the hailstorm of a failing marriage; Monica, mom’s favorite, whose former marriage was destroyed by a ill-kept secret and who feels like a duck out of water in a current one; and finally, Aoife, the brilliant-but-illiterate “baby” of the family whose life in New York is built on one big lie.The talent of Maggie O’Farrell is that this never descends into soap opera territory. There are lyrical insights about the intricacies and nuances of marriage, the tenuous thread that holds siblings together, the devastating and long-range power of secrets. I could not stop turning pages.Then why did I withhold the fifth star? Two reasons, really. The first is a too-pat ending that doesn’t live up to the potential of the rest of the book. Life is filled with ambiguity and the ending does not reflect that. But secondly – and more importantly – I never got the sense of the grown children’s connection to their father. He was the reason they all traveled home, but the fear and other emotions that are intrinsic to a father’s disappearance never take root.

Susan Choi’s latest novel incorporates both these themes, but in a distinctive way, spiced with strong insights into the very nature of love, marriage and forgiveness.Rather early on in the book, Ms. Choi throws a curve ball at the reader, turning our preconceived notions about what the book will be about on its ear. Everything else in the book will radiate from this plot twist and it is unfair to discuss it – which makes even amateur ing particularly challenging.The bare bones of the plot –without spoilers – are these: a first-year graduate student in literature named Regina is fascinated by the legends that surround a particular professor…so much so that she signs up for his class. She is appointed his TA, and gradually, falls under the orbit of the professor – Nicholas Brodeur – and his magnetic, free-spirited wife, Martha. The writing is luscious (with the exception of a few wince-worthy sex scenes) and finely-crafted. But it is the themes that entice the reader. Through her characters, the author asks the reader to consider the thin lines between lightning-bolt love, emotional intimacy, friendship, and sexual ardor. What happens when the lines blur? Can they co-exist? What if two lovers are in completely different places? As one character says to the other, “I don’t feel the way you do. I don’t mean I don’t share your emotions. That when you feel happy I’m sad. I mean something more basic. Not type but degree. Whatever I feel, I don’t feel it the way that you do.”Ms. Choi also takes a close look at the difference in love at different stages. In her early 20s, Regina refers to herself as “a perfect impostor”. She says, “Only love mattered to me: the singularity of it, the damnable difficulty of it, the solution I knew must lie just out of reach.” She is in turns, obsessive, insecure, tortured, yearning, and demanding; unselfishness and generosity of spirit have little to do with it. Her lover is far more nuanced, given the years that separate them.Secondary characters, such as Regina’s brilliant housemate and one-time lover Dutra, a surgical resident who lives by his own strict codes of love, are brilliantly rendered, as are the other characters. Regina – who narrates the entire book – is not particularly “likeable”, but in her own selfishness and struggle to grasp what it means to love, she comes across as believable.

They’re lonely, adrift, down on their luck, trying to reinvent themselves…even rename themselves.Jean Thompson is first and foremost an outstanding short story writer, and in these sketches, her key talent shows through. There’s Linnea, a damaged teenager who is exiled from her home to live with her absent birth father after she witnesses the school shooting of her hated stepsister. And Connor, a handsome and good-hearted teenage hustler with a big heart, who has spent too long nurturing his injured father Sean – who is addicted to pain pills. There’s Art, Linnea’s father, a Peter Pan character who never has really grown up and accepted responsibility . And in the center of things, the is Mrs. Foster, an elderly, slightly daft widow who, along with her nurse Christie, concoct a nonprofit foundation called The Humanity Project with an audacious premise: to pay people to be good.Can we really invest in goodness? At one point, Ms. Thompson writes, “But surely even within our brief and mortal selves, there were possibilities. Amazing transformations. Changes of luck or circumstances. And while some of these had to do with money, which might always be beyond our reach, there was also love, which was not.”The arc of the novel might suggest that it is love, or connection, or ability to risk emotionally, that can cause transformation and reinvention…not money, which always comes at a price. The characters who grow most understand that the true currency in life is emotional, not financial.Jean Thompson touches on the aspects of modern day living that can easily go awry: dysfunctional homelife, school bullying, cyber-dating, ill-guided do-gooders, the growing division between rich and poor. She’s at her best when she focuses squarely on the humanity of her characters; there are few writers today who can create a believable character as well as Ms. Thompson.The novel becomes less seamless when she dives into satire (some of the names of The Humanity Project sessions are “Learning From The Rural Poor of India” or “What We Talk About When We Talk About Wealth.”) My emotional connection sagged during the foundation sections and surged again when the chapters focused on Conner, Linnea and their hapless fathers.

She raised a lot of buzz with her first book and now she's back again with a hypnotic and spellbinding book that redefines the outer limits of ""mystery.""We initially know the bare facts: Ashley Cordova, a fearless and wild pianist and the daughter of the reclusive cult horror film director Stanislas Cordova, is found dead in an abandoned Manhattan warehouse...presumably, a suicide. Investigative journalist Scott McGrath - no fan of her father's, who indirectly torpedoed his career - is determined to discover the real story as a redemption-of-sorts.Relatively standard so far. But here's where, as they say, the plot thickens. Marisha Pessl is interested in exploring nothing less than the nature of fear itself and the wavering line between reality and fantasy. She sets her goal in the very first two lines: ""Mortal fear is as crucial a thing to our lives as love. It cuts to the core of our being and shows us what we are."" As a result, Night Film charts new territory.Stanislas Cordova is a dark acolyte, who leads fans ""away from what was stale and tedious about their daily lives deep into the world's moist, tunneled underbelly, where every hour was unexpected."" He is regarded as a hypnotist in the vein of Rasputin...more than just a filmmaker. His film philosophy is defined by three words: sovereign, the sanctity of the individual who wrestles authority from society. Deadly - a constant awareness that one's own death is inevitable. And perfect: the understanding that life and wherever one is at the present is absolutely ideal, with no regret and no guilt.As a result, the novel veers into the metaphorical. To quote Stanislas Cordova, ""I love to put my characters in the dark. It's only then that I can see exactly who they are."" The reader might easily conclude that Scott McGrath is in the dark. He is divorced from a wife he still loves... a haphazard father to his little girl...and he flounders to regain his footing in his profession and in life. To move on, he must face his fears to live freely.One could read Night Film as a literary mystery feat and also as an allegory. Ms. Pessl digs deep into subconscious fears and desires and how we imperfectly translate them. The symbols of fear - from occult hexes to devil worshiping - are all mined, and the traditional and supernatural all are interwoven together. It's as if Ms. Pessl is saying that these are all different sides of a coin - our way of trying to make sense of the fears and darkness that threaten us and disturb our dreams. ""Magic was all fun and games,"" she writes, ""Until you had the H-bomb of spell materials on the bottom of your shoes.""This book - which succeeds in portraying life beyond the cusp, way out in the outer reaches where most people never have the guts to go - is often brilliantly rendered. Yes, there are a couple of missteps: I never quite ""bought"" that an investigative reporter would team up with two dysfunctional teenagers, and some of the action scenes could have been edited - but the whole more than equals the sum of its parts. In the words of Stanislas Cordova: ""Will you step back and cover your eyes? Or will you have the strength to walk to the precipice and look out?""...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 10, 2013","Jun 14, 2013","Jun 10, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10281556-night-film

When Amy takes a fall and bangs her head on a birdbath, she is suddenly – organically – freed to say whatever she wishes without restraint.Her interview with a reporter is candidly blunt and hilarious…and goes viral. As a result, her old agent Maxine gets back in touch and begins to milk her fame, getting her sit-downs from sources that range from NPR to a Rush Limbaugh-type interviewer…along with a particularly humorous keynote speech at Book Expo America (BEA).There are some particularly hilarious scenes: for instance, the skewering of a local creative writing guru who advocates exercises and thought experiments. Amy, who is also a mentor for would-be writers, ends off her students’ requests by compiling exercises such as: “Write a story backward, using bulleted lists…Describe a recent outing, then go back and excise all modifiers.”Other funny moments are Amy’s attack of the term “fearless writer” and her original answer to the hackneyed question about “writer rituals.” Amy answers, “Most writers aren’t all that interesting They spend their time writing, which is not a spectator sport. We don’t write to in order to be admired, or emulated or wondered about. Especially wondered about!” Interspersed with the laugh-out-loud humor, there are some really good insights into why we write: to fashion sense out of chaos…to achieve order through narrative. Or to use Amy’s words, “We don’t read fiction to learn acts; we read it to make sense.”There are ample references to Ms. Willett’s prior book, The Writing Class. Although this book makes sense without reading the former book, I increasingly got the sense that it would have helped to have read that book first. There are also forays into Amy’s past – a close gay friend whom she married named Max – which seemed, to this reader, a little too derivative.I’d recommend especially to would-be writers and power readers – a group that might also enjoy Steve Hely’s How I Became A Famous Novelist, one of the funniest books about publishing I have ever read....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 07, 2013","Jun 10, 2013","Jun 07, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/16066896-amy-falls-down

The plane that carries his wife and young daughter explodes in mid-air over Scotland – not unlike the tragedy at Lockerbie – and a Mideast suspect is tried and found guilty. Yet Alan knows in his heart that justice has not been served. When a retired and deathly ill American stranger – likely CIA – shows up at his door in an attempt to get right with his God before death, Alan gains the impetus he needs to confront the sole witness on whom the conviction hinged.“Sometimes you set off and you draw a map as you go. You’re looking for some end point but you don’t know what or where it is. And other times you do know, and it’s a question of how you get there. The narrative is how you get to the right destination.” So says the CIA agent but it could be Alan’s narrative as well. How do you get to what you’re searching for? How do you know when the narrative is invented or off-course?Certainly you can rearrange the pieces of the narrative. But eventually, it imprisons you for the crime of not being able to believe. Alan Tealing has gone 18 years trying to get to the truth. He is, in a very tangible way, the eponymous Professor of Truth, even though truth “is not pure and separate. It is dirty and decayed and has frayed edges, and holes and tears in it.” Still, Alan must keep on his quixotic quest for truth, although he alienates many people around him.To arrive at peace, Alan must literally face the fire; his personal narrative starts and ends with fire. Only then can there be clearing, can the narrative make sense, and can he come back from the living dead.

As a coming-of-age story, it falls into that time-honored genre that includes books such as This Boy’s Life by Tobias Wolff, Indian Horse by Richard Wagamese, Stand by Me by Stephen King…and you can almost hear Bruce Springsteen’s Born To Run playing in the background.It’s hard to bring something new to the time-honored coming-of-age story, particularly one that’s set in the late 1960s, where everything has become almost a tired plot cliché: Vietnam, the assassinations, Woodstock, Boomer nostalgia. But Mark Slouka has done it here. This book broke me and put me together again, touched my heart and made me ache for the characters and for humanity. That’s a tall order for a book.What’s it about? It takes place in Brewster – a real blue-collar city that’s about an hour away from the glamour and glitz of New York City. Jon Mosher, our narrator, is shunned by his devastated mother after his older brother falls victim to a hapless accident in childhood (shades of Ordinary People.) His best friend, Ray, is a good-hearted bad boy who is raised single-handedly by a violently abusive and alcoholic ex-cop father. Both boys see a gleam of light at the end of the tunnel: Jon, through his talent as a track star and Ray through the transcendent love of a classmate, Karen.This is a book about outsiders, and Jon quotes Gandhi: “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.” Or are the odds so stacked against you that you can’t win, no matter what? Where do you go when you’re seventeen, when there’s nowhere to go, and when you’re running the only race you’re meant to run…with a goal so elusive it’s hard to ever imagine getting there? The eventual answer has a lot to do with loyalty and finding of self, and when it comes, it packs a wallop that will take the breath out of you. It’s filled with psychological acuity and gritty realism that makes the characters leap off the page.And it’s beautifully written. AN example: “It was a beautiful September, stunned and perfect, lie the world had been hit on the head: chill mornings, a warm mist over the cold grass, now and then a leaf dropping down like it was being lowered on a string, sparkling in the sun, then going out.” Brewster—a book that’s not afraid to tackle broken lives and broken dreams and the overwhelming urge to survive when life won’t let you – is, as the book jacket suggests, an “unforgettable coming-of-age story.”...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 16, 2013","Dec 16, 2013","Jun 04, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16241151-brewster

I read each of the nine stories with mounting excitement. There is not one false note or one less-than-sterling story in the bunch. The theme is loosely about love (“Love means you make me happy until you don’t) but nothing even close to romance drives the stories. Rather, each is a furtive look into the flawed lives of damaged characters living in modern-day Nigeria…and focuses on the sometimes tragic, sometimes comedic, sometimes poignant, and sometimes misguided condition of the human heart.In the eponymous story, a seething policeman – overinflated with a love of authority – becomes a tyrant when he dons his uniform, even to his wife. Yet Mr. Barrett does not indulge in one-dimensional characterizations: Eghobamien Adrawus is not only an abusive, ethically-compromised tyrant, he is also a loving father who craves the nurturing that his wife provides.In another, Godspeed and Perpetua, Mr. Barrett autopsies the painfully slow unraveling of an arranged marriage between a Nigerian civil servant and his much younger and beautiful trophy wife. Mr. Barrett meticulously delineates the shifts between husband and wife and the power plays created by the unequal love of their daughter.The Shape of a Full Circle, one of my favorites, introduces young teenager Dimi Abrakasa, who loses the family money that is meant to go towards food. The love/hate relationship he has with his alcoholic mother is beautifully rendered; when his mother has what she needs, she strikes out at him. Take these lines: “Her gaze was reptilian in its steadiness, and his eyes, luminous from despair, were the shape of a full circle. When Daoju Anabraba, s smile playing on her chapped lips, uttered the words, “I hate your eyes, my son,” he slapped her.”Filled with betrayal, dejection and hope and cackling with energy and confidence, this wonderful collection renews my faith in the future of short stories.

They were able to purchase the house due to a foreclosure; the planner of the community, Paul Krovik, abandoned the community after his neighbors sued him for shoddy work and now he has lost everything – perhaps even his sanity. One other key character, Louise, a black woman whose claim to the land stems from her sharecropping great-grandparents, is now disposed and lives on the land in hiding, refusing to abandon it.That is the plot in a nutshell – the interactions of these five characters who, each is his or her own way, is an “outsider.” When Copley claims to hear a “giant man” prowling around in their basement – the place where Paul Krovik has taken up residence – the wheels begin their relentless spin out of control.It is not necessarily the plot, but the theme, that propels this novel. Nathaniel works for a huge corporation that is hell-bent on taking away freedoms in the name of ultimate profits: His boss tells him, “We need responsible officers, people who understand that the way their live their personal lives, at home, is a reflection on the work they do in the corporation, and out in the world.’So much of the unfolding of this novel strikes close to home: the demonization and removal of perceived immigrants, the harsh punishment for anyone who breaks the rules or is “different”, the rules-oriented schools that don’t give children the freedom to step out of the lines, the paranoia about security, and the surreptitious monitoring of personal information. Yet the beauty of Fallen Lands is it tackles not just the demons outside of us, but the demons that possess us. Paul Krovik – “the man in the basement” – may be a part of each of us, the part that dwells in our deepest recesses. Each of us, the author suggests, may be the instrument of our own destruction.The land, of course, is another major component. Paul reflects, “He needs a job, he needs money, but he needs a house, his house, he needs to regain it first, but first he needs a job, he has to have the house in his possession to prove his ability to build other houses, he needs money to reacquire the house, needs the house to acquire money, needs the money and the house to fight for the return of his family.” It’s a conundrum that is also indicative of our society today. Flanery writes, “Perhaps we are merely a future civilization’s prehistory, terrible apes who soak the land with our own blood”. This is a dark tale, filled with moments of insight and supreme tension, that ultimately tackles the complications of pursuing the American Dream and the warping and distortion of that dream. Coupled with his first wonderful book, Absolution, Patrick Flanery has become one of my favorite contemporary writers....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 02, 2013","Jun 07, 2013","Jun 02, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17670009-fallen-land

What other book can YOU name that takes an octogenarian widowed American Jew who mourns a son “who named his daughter for a Greek Titan before being killed by a Vietnamese mine in an effort to please his Marine father who was once a sniper in Korea.”Just – wow! Add to the fact that the American Jew – Sheldon Horowitz – may be suffering from dementia and also harbors a great deal of guilt for the death of Saul, his only son…and further add his witnessing of a violent argument between his Balkan upstairs neighbor and a scary stranger – and there is plenty of plot to propel this book forward.The first 100 pages were extraordinary. Derek Miller masterfully creates a new twist to the “stranger in a strange land” story. Sheldon Horowitz says to his granddaughter, who has convinced him to emigrate to Norway: “A thousand Jews! I read it in the Lonely Planet guidebook! Five million people and one thousand Jews. The Norwegians do not know what a Jew is. They only think they know what a Jew is not.”There’s a lot of real meat here: a combination of sociology and theology, deep insight into Norway’s culture, and the frosting on the cake – Scandinavian thriller-type elements.Sheldon is a watchmaker by trade who wants to fix time. As he strikes out – Huckleberry Finn style – with Paul (a stand-in for Saul), the young, mute son of his murdered upstairs neighbor – the novel takes a turn. Spiriting his war-learned skills, Sheldon is able to hide both of them in plain sight, eluding his worried family, the police, and the rather one-dimensional Albanian war criminal who started this mess going in the first place.Much of the ensuing chapters are a combination of merged real and fantasy-driven memories, fueled by flashbacks to the Korean and Vietnam War. For this particular reader – who tends to shun war tales – the result was less than satisfying, yet this is – admittedly – subjective. Interspersed with these tales are some gems and a true journey of discovery. For example, here is Sheldon reflecting: “He begins to sense that silence itself is a kind of language. There is more there than death and memory. More than the voices of the lost.”In short, this is a genre-crossing book that will not appeal to every reader. For those who are open to an original story that highlights Norwegian life and tackles broad themes of making amends with the past and journeying to a sense of self, this is well worth the read. For those who prefer plot-driven books as evidenced by many current Scandinavian thrillers, it may not be. It’s not a perfect book. But it’s well worth the read....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"May 22, 2013","May 24, 2013","May 22, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15775210-norwegian-by-night

Originally from Liberia, Jacqueline’s father’s fate was twinned with the warlord Charles Taylor as the country dissolved into chaos.Once elegant and well-educated like her namesake, Jacqueline no longer can “read” people and she slinks, like an animal, in the shadows. Alexander Maksik does not flinch as he describes the torment of hunger, dehydration, mistrust and alienation. Here, for example, he describes how eating displaces memory…“Already she could feel herself returning. Or memory returning to her. Of her mind. Or whatever it was that came rushing back. Call it memory, she thought. And or a time the act of eating displaced memory. It was like a solid thing in a pool of water and the second you removed it, the water returned it.”The questions at the core of the book are this: how does a person keep fighting to live after witnessing the most inhuman acts of barbarism? How can a person recollect – and take ownership – of the past when to do so would likely reduce her to madness? And where is the line between recollection and madness drawn?As we drift with Jacqueline toward the inevitable revelations of what has reduced her to her present state – surviving on sips of water, shunning others, coping with horrific dreams of her mother’s eyes and voice, yearning for emotional and physical shelter – we want to avert our eyes to what is coming. But we can’t.This is, indeed, a haunting book, a book that will unsettle and daze you, and one that you will not easily shake after you close the last page.

I read it with mIf David Vann never writes another book – and hopefully, that will not be the case – his reputation will be secured by Goat Mountain. I read it with mounting excitement and horror; although this book may be the darkest book I have ever read, I am convinced it is a masterpiece.The bare-bones plot is deceptively simple: three men (a father, a son, and a grandfather – a very unholy ghost) and the father’s best friend Tom (the only character who is named) go on their annual deer hunt. The son – who is the narrator – sees a poacher on their land through the scope of his father’s rifle and without any forethought, kills him. This is all set up in the first few pages of the book.The rest of the book is, at turns, a suspenseful, theological, and philosophical treatise on the very nature of what it means to be human and the consequences of our actions. There is an atavistic quality to the hunt: “This was where we owned and where we belonged and where our history was kept, all who had come before and all that had happened and all would be told again during this hunt, and for the first time, my own story would be added if I could find a buck.”But is killing wired into us as humans? What if we were never told that killing a man was bad? “Why is it that we hunt? Isn’t it to return to something older? And isn’t it Cain what waits for us in every older time?” The son considers the own members of his hunting party: his father who was made weak by wrestling with right vs. wrong, his grandfather who had become “an obesity pumped full of insulin and pills and unable to walk through a forest for miles. A thousand generations, ended by him.” And Tom, a man who is given the name of everyman, who professes horror for the deed but like millions of others, does nothing to correct it.Every word is carefully chosen in this book, which is overlaid with biblical themes. After the kill, the boy slinks across the ground like a serpent; he knows he can never go back to the innocence of his one-time Garden of Eden. The story of Cain (“Cain killed what was available. The story had nothing to do with brothers”), the near-re-enactment of Abraham and Isaac, the drinking of blood after the hunt (a clear reference to the blood of Christ), the nature of hell, which is seen as solitary and meaningless…it’s all culled to great effect. Vann writes, ‘The Bible has nothing to do with god. The Bible is an account o our waking up, an atavistically dreamed recovery of how we first learned shame in the garden and first considered ourselves different from animals, and Cain was the first to discover that part of us will never wake up. Part of us will act according to instinct, and that will never change.”The answer to “why do we kill” appears to be this simple: because we can. Or more correctly, because it is in our primal DNA to do so. We can strive to differentiate a man from an animal, honoring him and doing whatever we need to do to make it right. Or we can determine that a man who is shot is nothing and put the clan first. Ultimately, though, any kill goes back to the first kill – Cain and Abel. This devastating book shines with a rare sort of dark beauty. At one point, a character says, “You’re going to carry that body the rest of your life. It will never leave you.” I doubt this book will ever leave me either....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jul 04, 2013","Jul 06, 2013","May 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17349136-goat-mountain

Incredibly, nothing in Paul’s life is touched – not his family, not his home, and not his thriving lumber business…which, in fact, is even more in demand as townsfolk order coffins for the burials of their loved ones.As the townspeople are forced to bear up under nearly unbearable grief, their envy of Paul’s “unfair” providence reaches a fever pitch and they begin to turn on him – and against him – in droves. Paul, meanwhile, labors under extreme survivor’s guilt as Mae increasingly falls into a dark depression.Kate Southwood writes, “A tornado is a ravenous thing, untroubled by the distinction in tearing one man apart and gently setting another down a little distance away. It is resolute and makes its unheeding progress until, bloated and replete, it dissipates. A tornado is a dead thing and cannot acknowledge blame.. If a tornado smashes your house or takes your child, it does no good to blame it…Even after you’ve yanked up another house in the place the old one stood and planted flowers in the dirt where you laid your child, your fury remains as well your desire to lay blame.”A parable of sorts, this magnificent novel strives to answer questions that have haunted humankind since early times: how do we comprehend the forces of nature and our own fates? How do we manage the extreme hostility and envy that result from nature’s unfairness? How do we break the cycles of revenge, vengeance, retribution and reprisal? These questions transcend this book and can easily be asked of modern tragedies – Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Sandy, for example.The themes are universal: love and loss, family, jealousy and suspicion, guilt and survival. I will not spoil the ending but I will say this – it is masterly and seamlessly brought together all the themes of the book and literally let me gasping.

Karen Joy Fowler’s latest book tackles this crucial theme and by doing so, captured my heart and reduced me to tears.There is no getting around that this is an agenda book. Ms. Fowler’s purpose is to show us—through fiction—that the most complicated animal – the human animal can be disastrous to the rest of the animal kingdom through sheer arrogance.Typically, I avoid authorial intrusion like the plague. But this book was so compulsively readable, so original, and so psychologically nuanced that I couldn’t help but turn the pages compulsively.Rosemary Cooke, our narrator, is the daughter of a family of scientists. It takes her 77 pages to reveal a central truism of her life (which, inexplicably, is revealed by the publisher on every book blurb about this novel): she spent the first eighteen years of her life defined by the fact that she was raised as “twins” with a chimpanzee named Fern.“I tell you Fern is a chimp and already, you aren’t thinking of her as my sister,” Ms. Fowler writes. “You’re thinking instead that we loved her as if she were some kind of pet.” But that just wasn’t so. Rosemary astutely realized that her father was not really studying whether chimps could communicate as humans. Rather, he is asking, “can Rosemary learn to speak to chimpanzees.”Fern is sent away when Rosemary turns five, for reasons that remain obscure through most of the book. But her absence affects Rosemary the way the sudden disappearance of a sister would. By the time she goes to kindergarten, her mother must work with her to stand up straight, not put her fingers into anyone’s mouth or hair, not jump on tables and desks when she is playing, not bite anyone. Her whole life is impacted by the “experiment” of being raised with her sister Fern. “What a scam I pulled off!” Rosemary reflects. “What a triumph. Apparently, I’d finally erased all those little cues, those maters of personal space, focal distance, facial expression, vocabulary. Apparently all you needed to be considered normal was no evidence to the contrary.”I believed in the connection between Rosemary and Fern. This emotionally devastating book – which folds back on itself to reveal more and more of the story through false and real memories – confirms what I have long believed: that the rest of the animal kingdom has much to teach us in being human....more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Apr 30, 2013","May 03, 2013","Apr 30, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16176440-we-are-all-completely-beside-ourselves

It is also one of the most harrowing books I’ve read lately on institutional racism and it deserves a wide readership.Ojibway author Richard Wagamese creates an entirely believable and sympathetic character in Saul Indian Horse, an Ojibway child who has undergone far more in his young life than any child ever had a right to. His mother “turned so far inward she sometimes ceased to exist in the outside world” as a result of abusive practices in a sadistic church-run school system. After fleeing to the bush country, Saul’s parents disappear, leaving him with his grandmother who eventually freezes to death.The eight-year-old Saul is captured and sent to the St. Jerome’s Indian Residential School, where depraved nuns and priests work to break the students’ spirit and severe their ties with their Ojibway life. Resistance leads to fast reprisal: beatings, isolation, torture, incessant labor, nighttime invasions A fast web search affirms that these types of schools did exist and constituted arguably the most racist act in Canadian history.Saul though, has a talent: he is a naturally outstanding hockey player. Richard Wagamese’s language soars into the lyrical as he describes the salvation of hockey: the exuberance, freedom, speed, and camaraderie. Saul plays not to win, but to live. For instance, the author writes: “Hockey’s grace and poetry make men beautiful. The thrill of it lifts people out of their seats. Dreams unfold right before your eyes, conured by a stick and a puck on a hundred and eighty feet of ice. The players? The good ones? The great ones? They’re the ones who can harness that lighting. They’re the conjurers. They become one with the game and it lifts them up and out of their lives too.”Certainly it lifts Saul out of his life. It’s his ticket from the sadistic school and it transforms him. At least, until he begins to realize that “white ice white players” is the true reality and that there are those who wish to break his spirit all over again.Written in the first person by an author who is clearly in command of his craft, Saul is a totally engaging character but also a symbol. As he eventually twins with his deceased ancestors and the Ojibway people in general, he represents a transformative journey or metamorphosis from alienation and trauma to inclusiveness and self-acceptance. This is a stunning book, combining a dose of education about the horrors of Canada’s church-run schools with a compelling story the centers on Canada’s national game in language that even a non-sports fan can embrace. I cannot recommend it highly enough....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 28, 2013","Apr 30, 2013","Apr 28, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11994903-indian-horse

The problem is, all too often, she detours too widely or elseCurtis Sittenfeld is a natural-born storyteller and she has a fascinating story to tell. The problem is, all too often, she detours too widely or else bogs it down with too much back-story.The story is this: identical twins Violet and Daisy (later redubbed as Kate) are as different as twins can be. Kate is a St. Louis suburban stay-at-home mom with two young children; Vi is coming out as gay, eccentric, and very much her own person. But one thing they have in common is the ability to sense; in other words, to discern future events. Vi has built her life and career around this gift and Kate has fled from it. Early on in the book, Vi predicts a gigantic earthquake in St. Louis and begins receiving a lot of media attention. Kate, who is married to a scientist, finds herself at odds wit her sister but also curiously empathetic. That plot alone makes for a great story: paranormal vs. established science, family loyalty vs. social acceptance, truth vs. belief.When the story stays on this theme, it sparkles. But too often, it wavers into not all that enlightening back-story, which, by now, has become predicable: two very different sisters who navigate the thorny path of high school and college years in different ways and the many people who influence them along the way (the high school bully, the too-uptight boyfriend, and pages and pages establishing Kate as an anxious and harried mother who barely has time for herself). Don’t get me wrong: back-story is an important part of storytelling. Here, there is simply too much of it; once a point is established, it gets re-established and re-established again. In addition, the author throws a curve ball in the last third of the book. This final third is compulsively readable and kept me quickly turning pages. But afterwards, I asked myself: Did I see it coming? Was there any hint of one of the sub-plots beforehand? Given what I knew about the characters, did it seem in keeping with their actions? I had to reluctantly admit that it did not seem organic.The biggest nut for me to swallow, which is established rather early on, was this: would an overly anxious mother agree to stay alone in St. Louis to potentially risk a tragedy that could be of epic proportion? And especially because she felt it would be “too difficult” to take a baby and toddler on a plane and watch over them herself in a hotel? Yet this same mother thought she COULD watch over them if the tragedy actually came to pass? This was just too much of a stretch.So here you have my dilemma. I never seriously considered abandoning this 400+ page book, based on Curtis Sittenfeld’s considerable talents. Yet I saw too many flaws in it, including the need for tighter editing.

So first, a big thanks to Goodreads.When did I surrender to this book? Perhaps it was when Emily, a socially awkward and unpopular middle school student with a crush on the most charismatic boy in the class, is pelted with food during a cruel cafeteria food fight…reminiscent, in certain ways, of Stephen King’s Carrie. Or maybe it was when Wyatt, an overweight and equally out-of-touch aging factory worker and the butt of his co-workers jokes, is taken over the state line, plied with drinks, and then left behind, incapacitated and left holding the bill.My point is this: The Next Time You See Me is not your typical mystery, not really. At its core, there IS a mystery: Ronnie Eastman, an unconventional “party girl” in a small Southern town goes missing, setting alarm bells ringing for no one but her more traditional sister, a teacher named Susanna. Susanna and a man she once liked but felt forced to reject – a black detective named Tony – battle their own demons as they strive to find out what happened.Most mystery readers will know early on “who dunnit”, and the psychologically astute will also glean the motivation. So for those who are seeking a mystery with a wallop at the end or a feel-good book need to know: this isn’t the book.This IS, however, the book for those who enjoy a character-driven analysis of how life can get off track in a small town. It has a lot to say about “pack mentality”, about bullying, about how one feels to not be “normal” in an environment that thrives on “doing the right thing” and “not rocking the boat.”In many ways, Emily and Wyatt are mirror images of each other. She is a young girl who still may have a chance and he is an older man whose chances have long come and gone. Both are pathetically and poignantly seeking love and human connection. As the lives of these two – and indeed, the other characters – begin to connect, Ms. Goddard paints a palette of the selves we keep secret and how one life can impact many others.I thought this book lived up to Gillian Flynn’s blurb of being “simply mesmerizing.” Once I got started, I couldn’t stop.

Both would-be writers identify each other as worthy competitors. And to complicate things, our narrator begins to develop feelings for a mesmerizing stage actress – a friend of his competitor – who has ambitions of her own.So far so good. Been there, done that. But now the story begins shifting. The talented classmate becomes, in turn, Julian, Jeffrey or Anton. The actress? In any given part of the novel, she may be married to a famous Indian geologist (whom she exchanges vows with at the rim of the Grand Canyon!), a Japanese royal, or a Luxembourg prince in line for the throne.The narrator, too, shifts identities. At one point, he is a debutante’s escort…in another, he’s a professor of journalism, teaching under an assumed name…in still another, he’s Outis – a Greek name from The Odyssey – who writes false term papers for spoiled Dubai scions. His personal odyssey follows a path from North Carolina to a city college in New York City…from Dubai to Sri Lana and Ghana…and finally, to an obscure writer’s colony in Iceland. This is a writer’s book and a reader’s book as well. We see the narrator struggling with his creative muse and even peek over his shoulder as he writes stories within stories. There’s subtle humor (one of his earlier rejected stories gives a nod to Dorothy Allison, with the title Just Another Bastard Out Of Carolina.) As the novel progresses, it begins to tilt towards zaniness as it lets loose its moorings. The effect is a sort o gimmicky distancing, which makes this novel – for me – a 4.5.

This book, in his own words, is a “larger story woven from memories, journeys, portraits, observations – all the stray psychic material that had been drawn into orbit around the drama that had monopolized my consciousness for more than three years now.”It’s important, I believe, for the reader to keep this in mind when approaching this book. If someone is looking for a linear story about the victim of a stalker, Give Me Everything You Have likely won’t satisfy.The problem, as I see it, is that the stalking story IS so very powerful that it dwarfs all the “stray psychic material” and engages the reader in a far more visceral way. Here are the facts: Mr. Lasdun, the fine writer of The Horned Man, a happily married family man, and a British-born Jew, is also a teacher in an MFA program. Among his students is a woman he calls Nasreen – a talented Iranian student who Mr. Lasdun begins to mentor.James Lasdun seems more “sold” on her talent than her classmates and his agent, whom he eventually recommends. Gradually, though, Nasreen – likely a borderline personality – becomes obsessed with Mr. Lasdun, emailing him obsessively, posting heinous accusations of plagiarism and sexual abuse on Amazon, GoodReads and Wiki, sending him anti-Semitic rants and threats of injury, and contacting his employers, agent, publisher, and other influential people from his professional life, even demanding his apartment keys.The effect on James Lasdun is profound. He writes, “There was the private self, still, but for anyone who interacted with the world there was this strange new emanation of yourself, your Internet presence, and it was by this, increasingly, that others knew you and judged you. And again: “Even the (emails) that just consisted of abuse left a bruised, unclean feeling, and there was never time to purge this, so than an accumulation of unprocessed disgust, pain, and bewilderment seemed to be piling up inside me.”James Lasdun candidly admits that he decided to write the book as a way to spare himself the unpleasantness of continuing to defend himself and also to release the large psychic energies that continued to poison him. Writers, after all, write: it is their way of making sense of the world.The book takes two rather lengthy detours and both are external journeys. Mr. Lasdun, at one point, takes a cross-country train ride, where he ruminates about how his own stalking is connected to Sir Gawain’s trial-by-fire. In the last 50 pages or so, James Lasdun – a distinctly non-religious Jew – visits Israel, and gets in touch with his his father Denys’ famed architectural masterpiece, the Hurva synagogue. Both trips were spurred by the craziness swirling around him and, while both are intellectually interesting, the gut level reader involvement ebbs nonetheless. Ultimately, James Lasdun focuses squarely on how to maintain honor and reputation during the Internet age – a topic worthy of an entire book....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 15, 2013","Apr 18, 2013","Apr 15, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15793858-give-me-everything-you-have

Suzanne Rindell introduces a particularly mystifying narrator to the forefront in the person of Rose – a typist in the New York City Police Department during the time of the speakeasies.Here are the facts, and just the facts, ma’am: Rose Baker, a young woman with a very fluid sense of self, is working in a particularly seedy police precinct as a stenographer and typist. Raised as an orphan in a convent, Rose prides herself on her extreme control of her emotions and her sense of uptight morality. Yet soon enough, a particularly intoxicating new typist named Odalie is hired and Rose – just like her much-admired and morally upright Sargeant and more forgiving Lieutenant Detective – falls under her spell. Rose in particular is captivated by Odalie and flattered that this lovely creature has taken an interest in her. Before too long, they are the best of friends, navigating a dual life of police work during the day and speakeasies when the day winds down.To go any further would be to create spoilers. Let me say this: this book will have you guessing until the very last line – and I do mean the very last line. It’s a psychological study that evokes Zoe Heller’s Notes From A Scandal and Patricia Ripley’s The Incredible Mr. Ripley, with a touch of The Great Gatsby thrown in for good measure.It’s a book that focuses on obsession, the search for one’s authentic self, the shifting nature of the truth, the nature of love and temptation, and how easy it is to break our own moral boundaries and codes. As readers, we never quite have a handle on who the mysterious Odalie is but even more troubling, we’re not sure who Rose is, either. We can easily see how our “truths” are not all so self-evident.The details of the 1920s – the bobbed hair, the speakeasies with their magical code words, the more hidden lives of women in a man’s world – are all beautifully rendered here as well. This is one of those books – like Gone Girl – that will have you second-guessing everything you believed and rushing out to share your interpretation of what has occurred with other avid readers.

Her focus is on two best friends – Sarah Zuckerman, our narrator, whose older sister died before she was born, and Jennifer Jones, her poised, all-American best friends. Jennifer becomes her “sister of choice” and the two are inseparable.The 10-year-olds decide one day to write letters to Soviet premier Yuri Andropov asking for peace. In a great surprise, Jenny’s letter is answered and she is invited by the premier to visit the USSR and see that it, too, is a peace-loving nation. For a brief time, Jenny becomes a media sensation, causing a rift between the girls. But when her plane goes down – killing her and her parents – Sarah is left to wonder: did Jenny really die or was there more to the story than meets the eye?All of this is established quickly (so no spoilers). The meat of the story concentrates on Sarah as a young adult, now temporarily living in Moscow and trying to make sense out of Jenny’s death. It is very evident that Elliott Holt has done her research. She writes “Going to Moscow was like stepping through a magic portal to a very different world. A world of superstition and shadows, of poetry and deadly icicles. Defectors and spies. Secret messages and invisible ink...”Indeed, this reader felt as if she had been given a magical passport to the USSR. Who knew, for example, that most Soviets were avid readers, that they loved ice cream even in winter, that the main ingredient in salads was mayonnaise, that babushkas (older Russian women) scolded people readily on the streets? These are all minute details, true, but when added up, they present a strong sense of place.I should also add that Elliott Holt writes like a dream, creating entirely believable characters and locations. My only reservation is that this author seemed to be torn between creating two books. One is the story of Sarah and Jenny, an autopsy-of-sorts of a lost friendship, abandonment issues, and the shifting meanings of truth. That story, with its psychological underpinnings, is beautifully created.Equally beautifully created is a story of the friend-left-behind who is navigating the alien world of the USSR, where truth and propaganda constantly shift boundaries, where the boundaries sometimes overlap with our own battles with truth and propaganda, and where no one can ever be sure that what they believe is what truly has happened. The author is so comfortable in her knowledge of the USSR that she sometimes drops the threads of the first story, instead of seamlessly interweaving those threads.This is a 4-star book that is very close to being a 5-star book. In a broader sense, it is about the stories we tell ourselves to grow, and even to survive....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 09, 2013","Apr 12, 2013","Apr 09, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16158564-you-are-one-of-them

Jim Gavin’s eNo one aspires to be a “middle man” – a low-paid assistant, a traveling salesman, a boy who lingers on the cusp of basketball greatness. Jim Gavin’s eight stories all focus on a man who knows, deep down inside, that he will not exit the world in a blaze of glory but gamely takes what life has to offer.The term is defined in – predictably – one of the middle stories entitled Elephant doors. Jim Gavin writes, “He imagined the two versions of himself – the young fraud and the old pro—standing on either side of a dark chasm. If there was some blessed third version of himself, the middle man who could bridge the gap, Adam saw no trace of him in the darkness.”So the question becomes: how does one bridge the gap? Sometimes, the answer is just to get into the game. Sixteen-year-old Pat Linehan – whose family is desperate for him to win a college basketball scholarship – ends up playing for a ragtag second-string team in high school. When the school is predictably defeated, Pat “felt a miraculous sense of relief because I knew it was all over, my future.” Yet at the same time he “felt something rising in me, a sense of life, maybe.”In one of my favorites, Bermuda, a young penniless man named Brian chases a flawed older woman, Karen, to Bermuda to somehow get some closure or arrange some resolution. Despite the fact that Karen signals strongly to Brian that the romance is now over, he reflects, “I wanted her to disappear around a corner, so it would be too late. I’d have an excuse for not doing what I wanted.”And, in the aforementioned Elephant Doors, lowly assistant Adam panders to the studio mogul, Max, only to discover that the whole game is really meaningless and empty. By the end, “his plan was to sit there all night, drinking and cheering and listening to all the other souls who, like him, depended on the incorruptible spirit of El Goof.”In the excellent eponymously titled story, we meet Matt – who spends some years nursing his dying mother. Gavin writes, “After she died, Matt, for his pain and loss, felt entitled to many rewards. He secretly anticipated, in no particular order, a moment of spiritual transcendence, the touch of a beautiful and understanding woman, and some kind of financial windfall. Instead, at thirty, he was broke and living at home.”These are men who are frozen in their inertia, yearning for something in life but resistant to actually taking hold of it. They are unwilling to bow down to the future of their fathers, yet they are way too tentative to map out an alternative future of their own. In ways, they are stuck, but curiously, not unhappy.Some of these stories are stronger than others and the same theme framework reverberates through the majority of the stories. It’s a good – but not great – collection that bodes well for this debut author. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Apr 09, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15014933-middle-men

Through a feat of investigative reporting, Mr. Moss painstakingly revealed how companies use salt, sugar and fat to addict us and linked his findings to the emerging obesity epidemic.So here is Lionel Shriver, putting a face on the back-stories and statistics. The face is that of the once handsome and charismatic Emerson Appaloosa, the musically talented big brother of our narrator, Pandora – who is now edging up to 400 pounds. Pandora and Emerson are the offspring of a serial T.V. star and are also, as adults, navigating the fallout from a dysfunctional childhood.When Emerson travels from New York to Iowa, he interrupts the rhythm of Pandora’s carefully crafted life: she is the founder of a high-profile niche business, the wife of a self-employed one-of-a-kind cabinetmaker and the stepmom of two teenagers. To save her brother, Pandora makes a bold choice: to find an apartment, move in with Emerson, and act as his coach for a year while he loses weight. And the novel goes on from there.Lionel Shriver makes some profound observations about food in our lives and all the ways it can distort us. Pandora’s husband, for example, is a rigidly disciplined, self-satisfied man who eats food only as fuel for his body – not for enjoyment. At one point, a character teeters on anorexia in a foray of self-denial. Lionel Shriver writes, “No meal, no matter how nicely prepared would resolve what to do with your life on either side of chow.”In another instance, Pandora reflects, “I believed – and could not understand why I believed this, since I didn’t believe it – that the number on the dial was a verdict of my very character. It appraised whether I was strong, whether I was self-possessed, whether I was someone anyone else would conceivably wish to be.” The book is strongest when it explores the issues that surround the simple act of eating: how it becomes part and parcel with one’s sense of self and how it takes on an overinflated importance that has nothing to do with hunger.But ultimately, the novel has to function as a novel, and here is where the book fails for me. Lionel Shriver is a strong writer – no doubt about that. But all too often, I sensed authorial intrusion: it was as if I were being educated as to what to think about this issue. The characters, in other words, became mouthpieces for Lionel Shriver’s own beliefs.More problematically, it was a stretch to accept that Pandora would risk her marriage and livelihood to move in with her brother. Her husband, Fletcher, reasonably suggests that she rent him a place nearby; that is unacceptable to her. Her decision—choosing between her birth family and her created family—needed, in my opinion, needed a bit more fleshing out. The ending has been alluded to by ers, yet not revealed. Suffice to say that it will either work for you or it won’t. I cannot get into the debate without spoilers and so I won’t. But it was another factor for me in determining my rating.

For all its brevity, it is a most passionate and complete novella.Bjarni, a hay farmer in an isolated village, lives with his infertile wife whose botched uterine operation has made her unable to take physical or emotional pleasure in lovemaking. Into his life comes Helga, a richly sensuous married woman who makes him feel alive in ways he never has.A turning point is reached and Bjarni must make a choice: leave his home of birth with Helga and start anew or allow her to exit his life. But is a choice ever that simple? Bjarni feels another type of love – a deep pull – from the land that he feels akin to. In one striking passage, he writes, “I would have dug a ditch for you and filled it back up again, the same ditch all my life. I would have walked miles for you every single day…But to abandon myself, the countryside and farming, which were who I am; that I couldn’t do.”The lure of the land is seen in the ordinary and the extraordinary – the annual sheep round-ups, on men going over the same fundamentals and politics at the local co-op, of neighborly communions in the nearby Reading Club. Bjarni reflects, “I’ve heard my stomach grumble back at the thunder, a little man beneath a big sky; heard the stream whisper that it’s eternal. Made the earth my beloved. Held a powerful salmon. Let a fox teach me what it is to be clever.”Man’s existential dilemma, Bjarni believes, “consists of having to choose everything in this world, which is the root of his unhappiness.” So he lives his days “with the rediscovery of love as my embers of hope”, accepting that even the deepest love is not enough if it means losing one’s connection with his very nature. This is a thinking person’s book that is infused with feelings, a tale of love, regret, passion, and ultimately, acceptance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Apr 01, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15954548-reply-to-a-letter-from-helga

Philipp Meyer weaves back and forth among their stories and each one is compelling in its own way. Eli’s is sheer adrenalin, a boy-man who is only slightly bothered by the constraints of society or conscience. Jeanne is a girl-woman with a head for the family business in a time and place where women are considered secondary to men.And Peter, ah, Peter. He is “The Son”, the diarist who sees the moral shadings, who realizes that not all life is a matter of economics, that the strong should not be encouraged while the weak perish, and that we do have choices in our actions. He notes “that the entire history of humanity is marked by a single inexorable movement – from animal instinct toward rational thought, from inbred behavior toward learned behavior and acquired knowledge.” He is the heart and soul of Texas.This American epic focuses on many themes. One is generational change and the progression from an agrarian and cattle-based economy to an oil-based economy. (Take these lines: “Of course there is no doubt that the Indian lives closer to the earth and the natural gods…Unfortunately, there is no more room or that kind of living, Eli. You and my ancestors departed from it the moment they buried a seed in the ground and ceased to wander like other creatures.” Another is man’s inhumanity to man: the brutal land grab and the dehumanization of those who are considered “not belonging” by every single segment: the Comanches, the Mexicans, and above all, the whites who fight tooth and nail to take more of what’s theirs. And lastly, and most importantly, it is about the blood that runs through human history with Texas as a microcosm. Mr. Meyer writes, “The land was thirsty. Something primitive still in it, the land and people both; the only place like it she’d ever seen was Africa: savannah, perpetual heat and sun, thorns and blinding heat. A place without mercy. The birthplace of humanity.” I’m predicting this book will be one of the most widely-read and talked-about this summer....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"May 24, 2013","Jun 02, 2013","Mar 29, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16240761-the-son

The question raised is this: “Why does apparently senseless tragedy strike good people?”There has never, to my mind, been a satisfactory answer to this question, which continues to exude a grim fascination for the very reason of its senselessness. In reading this tragic and haunting memoir, WAVE, I once again consider the effects of unimaginable loss.Sonali Deraniyagla is a good person: the mother of two spirited young boys, the wife of an English-born economics professor, the daughter of two loving parents, and a successful economics professional in her own right. Then, in a heartbeat, it is all taken from her. While in Sri Lanka—the home of her birth – with her family, a tsunami occurs…and when the wave finally recedes, only Sonali remains alive.The real waves that occur are of the psychic kind – waves of pain, despair, and memory. Sonali is unflinching in her description of these waves, which take her to the brink of insanity. “They are my world,” she writes. “How do I make them dead?”In incomprehension, she describes the aftermaths of that pain, in excruciatingly accurate detail. Her body is so clenched that she has to keep all the taps running simply to void herself. And she tells us, almost matter-of-factly, “The first time I saw a photo of my boys, I was unprepared. I was searching the Internet for ways of killing myself, as I often did then, when one click let to another…” When a Dutch family innocently moves into her parents’ former home, Sonali harasses them. Told without artifice but not without artfulness, the reader is toppled by Sonali’s despair, much as she was toppled by the wave. After undergoing numbness, grief, fear, shame and anguish, Sonali eventually discovers, “I can only recover myself when I keep them near. If I distance myself from them and their absence, I am fractured. I am left feeling I’ve blundered into a stranger’s life.” And as she gradually accepts that discovery, she slowly deliberately opens up the world she lost to the reader – the English husband at Cambridge, the birth of their two young sons, their charmed life that was seamlessly balanced between England and Sri Lanka. Sonali Deraniyagala does the impossible: she rebirths her family for the reader.I have read other memoirs on loss, most notably Joan Didion’s excellent The Year of Living Dangerously. I have never read a memoir that is this achingly honest and raw and non-manipulative and real.

The bravery of these men and women extends beyond placing themselves in harm’s way to confronting terrible and hard-won truths…about themselves, their private battles, their basest instincts, their buried dreams.As Jacob Siegel writes in the very first story: “War stories were almost never about war unless they’re told by someone who was never there.” And indeed, the most successful of these stories focus not so much on war, but on the aftermath of war and what it does to the psyche.Take the story Redeployment by Phil Klay, a Marine Corps veteran. It starts, “We shot dogs. Not by accident. We did it on purpose and we called it “Operation Scooby.” Or New Me, by infantryman Andrew Slater: “I joined the Army after my girlfriend Renee drowned because I felt that some people in my hometown would be unable to not blame me.” Or Tips for a Smooth Transition by military spouse Siobhan Fallon, who captivated me with her book, “You Know When The Men Are Gone”: “A week after his return from Afghanistan, they are already on a plane to Hawaii. This trip is a surprise anniversary gift, and Evie is a girl who hates surprises.”This is prose that is honest and raw and gritty and haunting. One person’s story becomes every veteran’s story. And the story goes something like this: at the prime of your life, you’re deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan where IEDs are ubiquitous, life is trivialized, and you – or a close friend -- can be blown to smithereens in a heartbeat. After being on adrenalin overload for months – years! – you’re suddenly listening to Muzak piped in at your local mall far away from the violence and terror.Whether it’s exploring the fishing trip of a 21-year-old boy who has “already been denied in so many ways – cuckolded, mutilated”, showcasing the limited choices of an infantry veteran who can’t find a meaningful job in a recessionary America, or zeroing in on an act of violence against the favorite rooster of a little girl, these stories unflinchingly take on the war that everyone wants to forget.

Living in North Carolina during the tail end of World War II, Helen is devastated by losses – the early death of her mother, the sudden death of her beloved grandmother Nonie, a friend’s diagnosis of polio,another friend's move, and her father’s decision to go to Oak Ridge to engage in secret war work.In this compulsively readable book, Helen’s 22-year-old cousin Flora – her mother’s first cousin, once removed – moves in from Alabama to care for her during the summer of her fathers absence. The reader learns early on that Helen possesses an attitude of haughty superiority. She reflects, Most days my feelings fell somewhere on the scale between bored/protected and bored/superior. But there were also times when I felt I had to fight to keep from losing the little I had been left with.”The narrative is written as a reflection from Helen – now an older woman – trying to make sense of that poignant summer. An aura of menace hangs over each chapter; as readers, we know that something really bad happened but we don’t know exactly what. We do know that Helen is a fiercely imaginative child who feels an extraordinary kinship with her deceased (and also haughty) grandmother, who listens to radio shows about the occult, and who has a special relationship with the cleaning woman, who believes in messages from the beyond.Gail Godwin is a master crafter in revealing the push-pull that Helen experiences – a disdain for all that Flora represents (the overabundance of emotion, the simple-hearted ability to willingly let others in) versus the “hope and promise and mutual development” that sustains them in their best moments together. When another character, Finn, who has suffered both physically and mentally from his part in the War enters this isolated scenario, fate intervenes in unforeseen ways.The novel lingers on the broad themes of loss, regret, illusions, and how one impromptu decision can undo our lives. Ms. Godwin trusts her readers to know where all this is going (for example, with the benefit of history, we know what occurs in Oak Ridge; we also have a pretty good idea where the book will end up). It’s the journey, not the destination, that makes this wonderful reading. I’m torn between a high 4 star and a low 5 star.

ISeveral years ago I developed a candida infection; my doctor urged me to give up all sugar products for at least three months.Easier said than done. It didn’t take me long to realize that nearly everything in the grocery aisles contained sugar. And now I know why.Michael Moss, a Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter, has written a brilliant book that doesn’t scold, lecture, or patronize. Rather, it reveals the reasons why one out of four American children are at risk for diabetes and why high blood pressure and obesity is soaring out of control. The average adult today is 24 pounds heavier than in 1960.He brings us inside the industry game at companies such as Kraft, Kellogg, General Mill, Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay and Nestle. Surprisingly, John Ruff from Kraft gave up sweet drinks and fatty snacks; Luis Cantarell from Nestle eats fish for dinner, Bob Lin from Frito-Lay avoids potato chips like the plague and so on. Many of the executives of the most highly profiled companies go out of their way to avoid their own products.They are, of course, more “in the know” than the average consumer, who swallows whole the marketing ploys and behind-the-scenes science that turns us into their unwitting pawns. As one executive said at Kraft: “We don’t create demand. We excavate it. We prospect for it. We dig until we find it.”How? First, the companies locate the “bliss point” – that crucial point that identifies when consumers fall in love with a product without the need for the company to pay a penny more. Then, they follow the “better for you” formulation. It works like this: when people clamor loudly enough for healthier products, the companies provide a better-for-you-formulation: lower-fat potato chips or sugar-free ice cream, for example. If done right, they can boost sales or the original full-calorie and full-fat version by drawing more shoppers to the brand.To play it fair, Mr. Moss shows that it’s hard to really get the consumer on board for change. When the “big three” – sugar, salt and fat – are removed, “Corn Flakes taste like metal fillings, the Eggo rozen waffes like straw. Cheez-Its lost their golden yellow hue, turning a sickly yellow, and they went all gummy when chewed. The buttery flavor of the Keeber Town House Light Buttery Crackers, which contained no actual butter to begin with, simply disappeared.”Small wonder, then, that companies would not give these three up in any real way, without a major fight. Salt, sugar and fat are the foundation of processed foods and the American public clamors for convenience and taste, not health benefits. In a particularly unsettling chapter, Mr. Moss shows how the Department of Agriculture and the FDA are really looking out for the interests of the food industry, not the consumer. With a slew of bench chemists, behavioral scientists, package designers, food technicians, lobbyists, Wall Street executives and the government on its side, one can empathize when one executive tells Mr. Moss, “I feel sorry for the public.”This is an important book for any one who is concerned about obesity or diseases – any one who cares about the future of their children – to read. As Mr. Moss concludes, “We, ultimately, have the power to make choices…we decide what to buy. We decide how much to eat.” Becoming informed – and in an engaging manner – is a vital first step....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Mar 15, 2013","Mar 17, 2013","Mar 15, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15797397-salt-sugar-fat

Based very loosely on the real life correspondence of Flannery O’Connor and Robert Lowell, Ms. Bauer creates two characters that are sort of stand-ins for the more famous writing pair…but not.The first thing the reader has to decide is, “How much should the real O’Connor-Lowell story influence my reading?” My personal answer was, “Not much.” Sure, O’Connor was a fervent but non-didactic Catholic with a flair for the ironic and allegorical, and yes, Lowell came from a Boston Brahmin family, went to Harvard, converted to Catholicism and wrote confessional poetry. But there’s where the similarities begin and end.Frances is from a working class Philadelphia family and is awarded the gift of good health here. She meets Bernard, who has a far greater zest for life, and off they go. Frances notes to a friend that maybe she was “jealous of his ability to charm and be gracious and make it seem effortless, make it seem an extension of his intelligence. While I tend to silently judge, or make an untimely crack.” Their powerful intellectualism rules the day and some of the more meaty parts focus on their conversations about Catholic theology. Curiously, neither start at square one, questioning the very existence of Christ or accepted dogma; rather, they dutifully accept it and start at square two, mulling over how to be a person of faith. Frances, by far the bigger believer, writes, “I don’t want to forget to say that it’s a common mistake to confuse severity for spiritual radiance. I think many religious folk mistakenly champion the importance of being ramrod.” Bernard, on the other hand, states, “I did not like church but I wanted an absolute and I wanted its demands.” His fervor, he admits, was likely self-adornment.The two bond over their communication on their writing, religion, their inabilities to strongly adhere to preconceived roles, their families, and their growing feelings for each other. (In real life, O’Connor and Lowell were not lovers). The book is almost a five star, but not quite. Interestingly, as Frances and Bernard stray into less intellectual and more emotionally wrought areas, they become – to this reader – slightly inorganic. Perhaps it’s the overlay of their famous real-life counterparts that sets up certain expectations. In any event, the “holy friendship” they might have been subconsciously enacting becomes more of a run of the mill narrative.

Ruth Ozeki’s imaginative and delightful book has easily taken its place as one of my very favoritTime has come today…and so it was and so it will be. Ruth Ozeki’s imaginative and delightful book has easily taken its place as one of my very favorite books of the year.The narrative interweaves two stories: that of teenage Nao, whose family turn-of-fortunes has forced her to return from Silicon Valley to a cramped Tokyo apartment and an unforgiving school setting where she is bullied and tortured by classmates. Gradually sinking into depression, Nao’s only respite is a summer stay with her great-grandmother Jiko, a Zen Buddhist who encourages her to develop her own “supapawa” (superpower). Her father’s suffering is equally pronounced yet more hidden, as his feeble attempts at suicide rock her world.The other narrative is from Ruth; she and her husband Oliver live in an ecologically beautiful and isolated islet called Desolation Sound and one day, she comes across Nao’s Hello Kitty lunchbox with her diary and other mementos…swept onto shore. Ruth and Oliver not so coincidentally happen to possess the same names as the author and her real-life husband.As the teenager’s world increasingly impinges on Ruth’s, the author delves into the real meaning of time and the thin barrier of separation that peels away as we get to know each other. How much agency do we have over another person’s narrative? How do we connect with that shining single moment that we need to establish our human will and attain truth? In the words of Nao’s uncle, a World War II kamikaze pilot, “Both life and earth manifest in every moment of existence. Our human body appears and disappears moment by moment, without cease, and this ceaseless arising and passing away is what we experience as time and being. They are not separate.” Ultimately, the theme of this book is the life force of imagination and creation: how we weave mythical stories and authentic stories, how we create stories about others, how we eventually – if we concentrate – get to own our own stories, and how we put those stories to paper. If this all sounds too “heavy”, it’s not. The voice of Nao is that of a genuine irreverent teenager; it’s fresh, authentic, and delightful. And Ruth and Oliver – half-created, half-real – are engaging and searching characters/personages who are as large as life itself.I loved this book – how it introduces philosophical ideas in a very accessible way, how it combines insight and some humor with inventiveness, memory and myth and how ultimately it focuses on our shared humanity.

In this – and in subsequent – stories, she manages to capture an essential and universal truth of humankind, wrapped in an unique and unusual package.The best of the collection –in my opinion – is the spectacular second story, Reeling for the Empire. Ms. Russell imagines a 19th century Japan where girls are contracted as silkworm factory workers with one audacious twist: the girls themselves have transformed into silkworms, spinning thread from their own bellies. This highly descriptive story conjures up visions of today’s third world countries, where mass production trumps humanity and where humans eventually become cogs in the wheel. Ms. Russell writes, ‘We have no mirrors in Nowhere Mill, and I’ve spent the past few months convinced that we were still identifiable as girls women…it’s only now, watching the Agent’s reaction, that I realize what we’ve become in his absence. I see us as he must: white aces with sunken noses that look partially erased. Eyes inset-huge. Spines and elbows incubating lace for wings.”Another standout is The Seagull Army Descends on Strong Beach, 1979. In this one, a teenager Nal, who plays second fiddle to his far more charismatic older brother, begins to believe that seagulls are communicating with him through talismanic articles, left in their nest. “If fate was just a tapestry with a shifting design – some fraying skein that the gulls were tearing right this second—than Nal didn’t see why he couldn’t also find a loose thread, and pull.”Every one of these tales has lessons to offer. The New Veterans, slightly evocative of Jane Mendelssohn’s excellent American Music, focuses on a massage therapist who believes she can take away a tattooed war veteran’s pain by manipulating the image on his body. Proving Up is a haunting Gothic tale about an 11-year-old boy who discovers what occurs when the land owns you and the window becomes a mirror to your soul. The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis is a sort of horrific mortality tale about bullying. And so on.I closed this book in awe of this young writer’s talent.

The book centers on Gwen-Laura, a widow of a certain age who has been unable to move on since her husband’s unexpected death two years ago. She ends up moving in with her sister Margot, is a victim twice: her husband, an infertility doctor, was sent to the Big House after the discovery that he was “doing the horizontal dance” with his patients…and she also lost most of her savings to Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme.Add in a few other characters: their third boarder Anthony, a young, gay unemployed charmer who makes to-die-for cupcakes, his sister Olivia, a nanny who has fallen in love with her employer, and a third sister Betsy who dispenses advice from the wings, and there are some great twists and turns ahead.Far be it from me to spoil any of them! Suffice to say that the novel is surprisingly touching, with much to say about moving forward through grief and bad times, experiencing forgiveness, getting in touch with one’s authentic self, and discovering that “family” can mean more than just next-of-kin. And, for anyone who has been through the online dating wars, there are hilarious “tales from the front.”For those who are seeking deeper insights into the characters, you won’t find a whole lot of that here.

This one says, ""I exist! I exist again! And again!"" Life After LifKate Atkinson's first novel, Scenes at the Museum, began with two words: ""I exist!"" This one says, ""I exist! I exist again! And again!"" Life After Life is a marvel. It's one of the most inventive novels I've ever read, rich with details, beautifully crafted, and filled with metaphysical questions about the nature of time, reality, and the ability of one person to make a dramatic difference based on one small twist of fate. In short, it's amazing.On a cold and snowy night in 1910, Ursula Todd arrives early, a cord wrapped around her neck, already dead. Scratch that. On a cold and snowy night in 1910, Ursula Todd arrives early, lets out a lusty wail, and makes a safe transition into this world. Ursula Todd will die many times in this mesmerizing and compelling novel and in many different ways. But each time, she will gain some innate foresight to help her avoid the traps that have occurred before.It's not as if writing about living again and making other choices hasn't been done before by contemporary writers. Lionel Shriver writes about parallel lives in Post-Birthday World; Stephen King delves right into it in 11-23-63 and so on. What makes this novel extraordinary is that this novel is a layered and nuance exploration on the very nature of time and reality. As Ursula's doctor says to her, ""Time is a construct, in reality everything flows, no past or present, only the now.""In Ms. Atkinson's world, one character - Ursula - can be the embodiment of many different people, often as a result of one small alteration. Look - here is Ursula, a fiercely protective mother. But look again - now she is a mistress, an alcoholic, even a killer. Each Ursula rings authentic. And each life could just as easily have happened.This is a unique and highly exciting way of storytelling, spanning the monumental history of two world wars and complicated family dynamics. Ursula's memory is like a ""cascade of echoes"" as Ms. Atkinson returns again and again to a core question: ""What I there was no demonstrable reality? What if there was nothing beyond the mind?""As the choices and consequences grow, the scenes often turn on small details. What book is Ursula reading - a French classic or a Pitman shorthand manual? What is her reaction to a lost dog that crosses her path? In other books, details like these could be easily glanced over; in Life After Life, they become crucial. Everything can turn on the drop of a dime - a simple push or an impromptu decision. ""She had been here before. She had never been here before...There was always something just out of sight, just around the corner, something she could never chase down - something that was chasing her down.""At one point, Ursula briskly states, ""No point in thinking. You just have to get on with life. We only have one after all, we should try and do our best. We can never get it right, but we must try."" But what if we DID have more than one? Ay, there's the question... ...more",Notes are private!,1,36,1,"Feb 26, 2013","Mar 03, 2013","Feb 21, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790842-life-after-life

I read a lot – maybe 75 books a year – and I have rarely fallen under the spell of a book the way I did with Interpreter of Maladies. Her follow-up collection of short stories, Unaccustomed Earth, was also an unqualified 5-star success.So I was dying to get my hands on her new novel, The Lowland. I read through it eagerly but I closed the last page with mixed feelings.Let’s start with the good: Ms. Lahiri is a natural-born storyteller. In this book, she introduces two brothers, close in age who are poles apart – Udayan, the revolutionary brother who gets caught up in the Mao-inspired Naxalite movement to wipe out poverty in India and his more reserved and dutiful brother, Subhash, who leaves home to pursue an academic and scientific life in Rhode Island. When Udayan inevitably gets swept into a revolutionary movement that turns out badly, Subhash returns home –briefly – and picks up the pieces, including an attempt to heal the emotional scars of his brother’s young wife.As the plot goes on – and it is not my desire to encapsulate the plot or to create spoilers – about 70 years of family history is condensed into a mere 340 pages. Themes play out and then they play out again: the connections that make and break us, the intertwining to people we cannot truly see or know, the way we are defined by the place we call “home”, the quiet differences we make in the world. It’s all wound up in the history of India and indeed, Ms. Lahiri is at her very finest when she’s describing Indian customs or lifestyles as only an insider can.There’s some lovely craftsmanship here, not bells and whistles, but quiet and contemplative -- even shimmering – moments. The problem is, I never found it to be very compelling. Because of all the years and generations (four of them) that Ms. Lahiri has to cover, she can only provide sketches of her characters. And they never truly come alive.Yes, Udayan is the fiery revolutionary…but what made him so and why was he willing to sacrifice so much (the headiness of youth and a sense of fairness should only be the beginning). His wife, Guari, who eventually bonds with Subhash, was an enigma to be throughout. She is a distanced character, and her actions begin to feel somewhat predictable; the reader is never treated to her resonance and depth. And Bela, her daughter, is only revealed in limited emotional scope.A novel, unlike a short story, demands a considerable emotional tension, a multi-textured richness that makes characters leap off the page. I never really sensed the two-dimensionality, possibly because the story line was multi-generational and ambitious. The litmus test of whether or not you will love this book is this: if you loved Namesake, this is definitely a book for you, since stylistically, there are similarities. If you are, instead, a fan of her short stories, you may or may not be engaged.

There is “you” (as in “You are a smart kid who grows up in a poor South Asian country, working the corrupt systems to your advantage”), determined to make a fortune in the bottled water business. And there is the “pretty girl” who is his just out of reach soulmate who shares his ambition. “You” could be everyman in a Pakistan that is going through seismic changes.

The overriding question is, “Does all this work?” That’s a question that every reader must answer for herself or himself. For me, the conceits – the self-help framework and the second-person voice – distanced me from the characters in ways that Mr. Hamid’s first two books did not. I’ll reveal my hand here: I loved Mr. Hamid’s first book, Moth Smoke, a seductive and fast-paced tale of a man fired from his banking job in Lahore, whose lack of connections, combined with the allure of drugs and easy money, doom him. This page-turning book revealed an insider’s look of trying to make it in Pakistan. Ditto for his better-known book, The Reluctant Fundamentalist, narrated by the complex character of Changez, a character who begins to smolder with resentment.This time, I felt that I was mostly admiring the mastery of an excellent writer – and I do acknowledge that Mr. Hamid is very talented – without the immersion into the character’s lives.

The fact is, REVENGE claims a unique territory through the juxtaposition of horror and understated elegance. I have never read anything quite like it before.The eleven stories in this slim collection comprise a tapestry, interwoven with the appearance of the same characters, themes, and props. In the very first story – the most poignant – a pathologically grieving mother fulfills a yearly ritual of purchasing two strawberry shortcakes for her young dead son’s birthday. The last story, Poison Plants, concludes with another woman finding the body of that mother’s son.Strawberry shortcakes…an overabundance of kiwis…flawless tomatoes rolling on a bridge after a deadly accident. Ms. Ogawa uses the most innocent images to portray lives that are destroyed or turned upside down and these images show up again and again. The boundaries between what is beautiful and what is messy…what is pure and what is tainted…even the delineation between writers and readers begins to blur until the reader finds herself inhabiting the world that Ms. Ogawa so skillfully creates.In one of her most powerful stories, Sewing for the Heart, a skilled craftsman is asked to craft a leather case that will hold a cabaret singer’s heart; the heart resides outside o her body. Boundaries once again fade – interior and exterior, anatomical and metaphorical, reality and fantasy – as the bag maker does as he is charged with eventually macabre results.And in “Welcome to the Museum of Torture”, a young woman stumbles upon a Museum of Torture, manned by an ancient curator, as she flees from an argument with her boyfriend. After a lengthy conversation, the reader can just feel the wheels spinning.“The desires of the human heart know no reason or rules.

And indeed, Kim Thuy’s RU is a form of lullaby, evocative, lyrical, beautifully composed.This is not a novel, at least in the conventional form. In non-chronological order, Kim Thuy offers up memories and musings at a distance – some stunningly rendered (“My parents often remind my brothers and me that they won’t have any money for us to inherit, but I think they’ve already passed on to us the wealth of their memories, allowing us to grasp the beauty o a flowering wisteria, the delicacy of a word, the power of wonder”) and some beyond painful.Translated to perfection by Sheila Fischman, the quiet prose belies the whirlwind of emotion that lies right beneath the surface. Kim Thuy -- a self-described deaf mute for a period of time – finds her voice in her words as she relays poignant images: her one-time upper class childhood in Saigon, her time in the Malaysia refugee camps, her embracing of the American dream in Quebec, and her return “home” to Vietnam.The prose is – simultaneously – luscious and sketchy. Kim Thuy relies on her reader to fill in the blanks of imagination with the outline of stories she provides. This reader craved more; at the same time, I admired what was given. When she writes, “I moved forward in the trace of their footsteps in a waking dream…where a country is no longer a place but a lullaby”, she reveals her purpose: to imaginatively recreate history and sorrow to memory and art....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Feb 10, 2013","Feb 11, 2013","Feb 10, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7574245-ru

Written in a minimalistic style, the writing style might be described as “ala prima” – quickly sketching the scenario with rapid and broad brushstrokes, at the same time creating lines to establish the form.The story centers loosely around Yohan, a solitary man who chooses to restart life on the coast of Brazil rather than submit to repatriation at the end of the Korean War. There, he works for a tailor named Kiyoshi, who symbolically, creates new clothes for him, one each year. The others – Peixe, the groundskeeper at the two church and two orphaned children named Santi and Bia – represent his entire world.Hidden in this simplicity are some complex and poignant revelations: “He thought of these years as another life within the one he had. As though it were a thing he was able to carry. A small box. A handkerchief. A stone. He did not understand how a life could vanish. How that was even possible.” Much as he wants to connect, he cannot.  He is unable to mine his inner life or embrace the one that is in front of him. As Mr. Yoon writes, “He understood that he would never be able to hold all the years that had gone in their entirety. That those years would begin to loosen, break apart, slip away. That there would come a time when there was just a corner, a window, a smell, a gesture, a voice to gather and assemble.”Here is where the book rating system gets challenging. Does Paul Yoon succeed in elegantly creating a meditation to second chances, a poetic and lucid ode to shedding one’s old skin and moving quietly and steadfastly to connection and joy? Yes he does. This is a confident author who is in control of his material.But did I find it particularly satisfying? Aye, there’s the question…and it’s a question that will no doubt be answered differently by each reader. I felt curiously distanced and disconnected; I admired, rather than loved. While I appreciated and understood what Paul Yoon was doing, I was seeking a more visceral interaction with Yohan that eluded me. In short, I wanted more.But that’s just me.

Each of them is a loser, living in a “frontier of stale and unfulfilled dreams”: careless fathers, scam artists, ex-cons, gamblers, incestuous brothers, drug abusers.These aren’t people you’d want as your neighbors or your friends. They are, however, people you want to spend some hours with – and it’s all because of Jess Walter’s great skill as a words craftman and his incisive ability to create a wave of emotions with a few well-placed descriptions.The short-shorts – and there are a few in this collection – didn’t work for this reader half as well as some of the longer stories, which pack a wallop. A few of these stories are true stand-outs.Take the Wolf and the Wild, which begins this way: “They fanned out in the brown grass along Highway 2 like geese in a loose V, eight men in white coveralls and orange vests picking up trash.” One of these men, Wade, is in prison for white-collar theft; when he emerges, he is assigned to a pilot program tutoring elementary schoolers. One of the little ones, Drew, requests the same book every time until Wade brings along a sequel. The last five pages contain no words and these are the pages Drew likes the best. This poignant scene – a young boy snuggled into the lap of a stranger, feeling safe through the power of storytelling, is beautifully rendered.Another, Helpless Little Things, is a page-turning story of a scammer and drug dealer with a small network of teens whom he uses to solicit funds through fake Greenpeace offerings. But who is really the scammer and the helpless thing? This “turn-about is fair play” story is another winner.The lead-off story, Anything Helps, focusing on a panhandling dad named Bit who goes to great lengths to buy his son the latest Harry Potter book and the eponymous story We Live In Water – about an adult son who attempts to learn what happened to his down-and-out father – are also noteworthy. In the latter, Mr. Walter writes, “The fish just swam in its circles, as if he believed that, one of these times, the glass wouldn’t be there and he could just sail off, into the open.”No one can sail off, of course; most of these characters are, indeed, swimming in circles, no matter how hard these men strive for acceptance or redemption. And, for this reader, a couple of the stories didn’t work; Wheelbarrow Kings, for example, strives too hard for “attitude” and lost me along the way. A possibly personal story – Statistical Abstract for My Hometown, Spokane, Washington” may well be the factually-based key to a couple of the stories.

You never know what you’re going to get.As a reader, what I expected to get was a relatively well-written light-hearted story set in glamorous late 1980s Paris with rather predictable lessons of what it means to come of age.What I DID get was far more rewarding and far more nuanced for many reasons. Yes, there are the Paris scenes and Hilary Reyl knows the scene well; those who have been to Paris will delight in the many references to sites, cuisine, restaurants, and shops and those who haven’t will want to race out and get a ticket. And yes, there are lessons to be learned – hard-won lessons that are a bit more complicated than one would expect.But something more is going on in this book. Kate is a porous and attractive young woman – a would-be artist – who is not yet sketched in. She is somewhat of a pleaser, adapting to her environment. When she receives a job offer to work as the assistant to Lydia, a famous American photographer in Paris, she grabs it. She speaks French like a native, thanks to the two years she spent in Paris with cousins while her father was dying…to fulfill a wish to him. It’s a heady time for a young innocent. Lydia frequently entertains the international crème de la crème – Salman Rushdie, Umberto Eco. But Lydia is a complicated boss, demanding total allegiance, not unlike the Anne Winokur character in The Devil Wears Prada. Her relationship with her husband Clarence, an academic, is fraught with landmines and has become – for both of them – a bloodbath sport with Kate often in the middle. Add in the fact that Kate quickly develops a strong and mutual infatuation with Olivier, the soon-to-be ex-boyfriend of their mercurial daughter Portia, and the seeds of a fall from grace are set.As Kate assists Lydia with an important Berlin photographic project, the realization occurs that Berlin is, indeed, a metaphor for Lydia and Clarence. “”The West Germans are condescending and the East Germans are self-conscious. They feel incompetent and are on the verge of feeling very bitter about it. So, after that initial moment of unity between the countries, there is this total lack of recognition, right?”There are many developments – some expected, some not – in this page-turning novel. The lessons Kate must learn focus around the concept of allegiance and loyalty to others, but mostly to her authentic sense of self. When Kate says, “Did you ever feel like moments of growing up are sometimes weirdly about remembering who you used to be?”, the reader gives an “aha” of recognition.

Upon arriving there, he is quickly “adopted” by a skinny white dog. Fate brings him – and the dog -- to the home of Alice Mendelssohn, who works for the Botswana government and whose marriage is quickly disintegrating, where he assumes the role of her gardener.The characters, who fall into an unlikely friendship, are superbly drawn: Isaac, a serious man who never relinquishes his dignity and Alice, who falls deeply in love with a hard-to-tame man named Ian who opens the door to emotions she felt she no longer possessed. When Alice returns from an intense weekend with Ian, she finds that Isaac is missing… and the story develops into unchartered territory.The theme, again and again, circles back to our place in the universe and how little we know. “We are doorways, openings into something greater than ourselves, something that we don’t understand and will never understand. We have nothing precious in and of ourselves. We are only precious in that we are part of something that is too big to know,” Isaac reflects, early on.And Ian, Alice’s soul-mate, later reflects on the same thing when he view paintings from the !KungSan: “Whether you believe in God or not, the artists understood that they weren’t at the center of the universe, that humans are a small part, surrounded by the power and beauty of the whole.”All of these imperfect individuals – all in the process of growth – are connected to each other and to White Dog, who represents – I believe – a spiritual guardian who watches over them. “White Dog would not leave his side. She knew his grief, this dog, who was more than a dog, this dog who had fallen from the sky.” This book succeeds in the best of ways: revealing what it means to be human, how the power of love and loyalty triumphs over hatred and discord. It also succeeds as a window into Botswana and as a revelation of our broader connection to the entire animal universe, and the fences we build (literally and figuratively) to keep others at a distance.

Keep us alive. Don’t ever let us disappear.”), the tattooed and pierced C.J. who “claims to have lots of secrets, lots of ghosts”, and little Abby, the child of a troubled marriage who finds solstice at Pine Haven, and you have the makings of a character-focused book.There’s a lot of poignancy and quirkiness within these pages, instantly recognizable to adult children who have watched their parents implode into eternity. Jill McCorkle paints many of her characters with fine strokes, detailing the uniqueness of the lives…and the deaths. As these individuals hold onto vestiges of their lives and their hard-won illusions, they become almost heroic in their dignity.Where Jill McCorkle stumbles is when she robs some of her characters of their individual humanity. A pretentious, rank-striving wife…a bigoted older woman who spews her venom…a self-involved man who has a late-life epiphany and now tries to be unselfish for his son’s sake…all of these start to become caricatures. The message the author imparts is cheapened by new-age lines like, “The longest and most expensive journey you will ever make is the one to yourself.”At times, Life After Life will have the reader examining his/her own life and need for connection. At other times, this loftier goal is sacrificed for pure entertainment.

Andre Brink tackles a harrowing time in our world history: slavery in South Africa in the 1830s,From exquisite pain sometimes comes exquisite beauty. Andre Brink tackles a harrowing time in our world history: slavery in South Africa in the 1830s, when brutal thrashings from those who held a Bible in one hand and a whip in the other were commonplace. Yet he tells the tale with such eloquence and lyricism that the reader is caught between loving the words and yet condemning the subject matter.Philida – the eponymous slave woman – actually worked as a knitting girl on the arm from 1824-1832; her “master” Cornelius Brink is one of Andre Brink’s own direct ancestors. That knowledge pervades the tale and grounds it even more in reality. “What happens to me is what others want to happen. I am a piece of knitting that is knitted by somebody else,” Philida muses early on.In this novel though, she is well on her way to becoming her authentic self. The master’s son, Frans – a weak-spirited young man – takes a shine to her and they indulge in semi-consensual copulation. Four children are born from this union; one has died under mysterious circumstances and another when she was an infant. When Philada takes steps to demand her promised freedom, Frans publicly disowns their relationship and Philada is sold to another slave-owner in retaliation. And so the story takes off.Andre Brink is a superb writer. Through shifts of narrative voice and Victorian headings leading into each chapter, he beautifully tells the story of Philida and those who surround her. Man’s inhumanity to fellow man – floggings, rape, and most of all, the constant dehumanizing – is rendered so intensely that it brings tears to one’s eyes. He writes, “Each one goes on looking for his own shadow that lies trampled into the dust and left to lie there. We have more than enough lost shadows among us.”My biggest quibble – and it’s not enough to take my rating under 5 stars – is that the story starts to run out of steam in the end. Brink inexplicably seems to shift the focus from the personal to the universal. Philida almost functions as a symbol: “Soon there must come a day when I can say for myself: This and that I shall do, this and that I shall not.” In the second half, the tone begins to become uneven: from powerful realism to out-of-place satire in some instances. A sub-theme of religious growth is – in my mind – unnecessarily exploited.But oh, the prose. Oh, that luscious prose.

Yehoshua names his key character Yair Moses, the spiritual father of the Jews, and the prophet who delivered the nation of Israel out of slavery and into the light.Moses - an aging and prolific film director whom we first meet during a retrospective of his works in the Spanish pilgrim city of Santiago de Compostela - has spent years in his own creative wilderness after an estrangement from his brilliant and highly creative and unorthodox scriptwriter, Trigano. He has come to Santiago de Compostela for a personal retrospective - to revisit the highly original films that he did with his mercurial collaborator.While there with Ruth - his leading actress and the one-time lover of Trigano - he notes a painting over his hotel bed, Caritas Romana. This painting will become pivotal in the novel; it represents a prisoner sentenced to starvation who nurses at the breast of his lactating daughter. The painting has long enthralled viewers; the old man who is turned simultaneously into an infant. Indeed, Moses is starving too, and with the exile of Trigano from his life, he is in search of a Muse.The highly revered ""spiritual father"" of film is hungry for creative nourishment. His latest films, ironically, employ cameras linger at food feasts and spend many minutes taking in on the details, as if mocking his own creative starvation.This is an excellent novel with many levels. The most obvious is the plot: Moses, upon receiving his award, wishes to atone and reconcile with Trigano and also to employ him to save their joint creation: the ""character"" of Ruth. But at its core, it is about the creative process and the reuniting one's creative self with the wellspring of creativity.A.B. Yohoshua appears fascinated with duality and there are many examples throughout the book: imagination versus reality. Youth versus age. Sephardic versus Askenazi. Religious versus secular. Risk-taking versus playing it safe. Realism versus mysticism. And of course, the most obvious: past versus present.I wish I were more familiar with A.B. Yehoshua's earlier work: he describes in some detail the films that Moses collaborated on, and I wonder if there are wisps of Yehoshua's own works within them. In any event, it is a joy to read the ""stories within stories."" As the scrutinizing of duality demands, the first half of the book is grounded in realism; the reader feels right there with Moses, every step of the way. The second half, although anchored in the ""real world"", shifts into a different kind of more symbolic retrospective, a search for atonement and reconciliation.This is a mature and confident work by a well-respected Israeli novelist. After reading it, I can well understand why he has earned such a devoted following. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Feb 02, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15814404-the-retrospective

It’s that town you might have driven through – on your way from here to there -- where “the neighbors wanted nothing more from life than they already had: steady work, a new Chevy each year, weekends in front o the television drinking beer and watching ball.” It’s that town with a church and a bar on every corner. It’s been immortalized in classics like Our Town and Winesburg, Ohio. Jennifer Haigh’s genius is to cast her laser spotlight on the seemingly ordinary people of Bakerton to cull extraordinary stories of hope, regret, yearning, restlessness, and at times, fulfillment. In her series of interconnected stories, characters that might have lurked forever in the shadows reveal depth, pathos, and surprises.In the very first story, a teenage girl takes a position as a live-in maid for an upper-class Jewish family on New York’s tony upper West Side; it feels like a cultural displacement. An act of kindness is misinterpreted and her stay there is short. In another, Broken Star, another young girl meets her not-much-older Aunt Melanie whom she instantly connects with; later on, she inadvertently learns a shocking family secret that will forever change how she views herself.In yet another, A Place In The Sun, a 30-ish year old man named Sandy escapes the town but not the gravitating pull of going home: “The town he’d fled, where mines had killed has father; the bleak small-town life worse than jail, a prison from which no one escaped. And yet he had considered it: driving back east with his bride beside him…”Each portrait is lovingly rendered: a middle-age spinster who trusts her instincts against all odds and experiences love for the first time in her life…a one-time high-school football star who tastes the glory but harbors a secret that dooms him to eventual failure…a successful brother – dubbed “J.R” by the town after J.R.

Yehoshua names his key character Yair Moses, the spiritual father of the Jews, and the prophet who delivered the nation of Israel out of slavery and into the light.Moses – an aging and prolific film director whom we first meet during his retrospective in the Spanish pilgrim city of Santiago de Compostela – has spent years in his own creative wilderness after an estrangement from his brilliant and highly creative and unorthodox scriptwriter, Trigano. He has come to Santiago de Compostela for a reconciliation of sorts – to revisit the highly original films that he did with his mercurial collaborator.While there with Ruth – his leading actress and the one-time lover of Trigano – he notes a painting over his hotel bed, Caritas Romana. This painting will become pivotal in the novel; it represents a prisoner sentenced to starvation who nurses at the breast of his lactating daughter. The painting has long enthralled viewers; the old man who is turned simultaneously into an infant. Indeed, Moses is starving too, and with the exile of Trigano from his life, he is in search of a Muse. The highly revered “spiritual father” of film is hungry for creative nourishment. His latest films, ironically, employ cameras linger at food feasts and spend many minutes taking in on the details, as if mocking his own creative starvation.This is an excellent novel with many levels. The most obvious is the plot: Moses, upon receiving his award, wishes to atone and reconcile with Trigano and also to employ him to save their joint creation: the “character” of Ruth. But at its core, it is about the creative process and the reuniting of one’s creative self with the wellspring of creativity.A.B. Yohoshua appears fascinated with duality and there are many examples throughout the book: imagination versus reality. Youth versus age. Sephardic versus Askenazi. Religious versus secular. Risk-taking versus playing it safe. Realism versus mysticism. And of course, the most obvious: past versus present.I wish I were more familiar with A.B. Yehoshua’s earlier work: he describes in some detail the films that Moses collaborated on, and I wonder if there are wisps of Yehoshua’s own works within them. In any event, it is a joy to read the “stories within stories.” As the scrutinizing of duality demands, the first half of the book is grounded in realism; the reader feels right there with Moses, every step of the way. The second half, also anchored in reality shifts into a different kind of symbolic retrospective, a deeper search for atonement and reconciliation. This is a mature and confident work by a well-respected Israeli novelist. After reading it, I can well understand why he has earned such a devoted following....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 29, 2013","Feb 02, 2013","Jan 22, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/16439779-the-retrospective

A Constellation of Vital Phenomena is such a Every now and then, a book comes along that restores my faith in the future of the novel all over again. A Constellation of Vital Phenomena is such a book.How can a debut novelist write like this lyrically and searingly? Anthony Marra has “the gift” and his work is more assured than writers who have toiled for years.I’d like to say I was immediately captured by his novel, but alas, that wouldn’t be true. My lack of familiarity with war-torn Chechnya – indeed, with Russian history – distanced me at first. A number of original and whimsical characters were woven into his rich tapestry of words, and for many pages, I wondered just why such-and-such character was being portrayed in great detail.But then it all started coming together, and – wow oh wow. The title comes from a description of life in a medical book: Life is a constellation of vital phenomena – organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation. A careful reading reveals that for this community of characters, the description is quite apt.The novel primarily takes place throughout a decade – from 1996 to 2004 – and a line graph at the top of each chapter centers the reader in the timeline. There are three key characters – Akhmed, an incompetent doctor with a good heart…Sonja, a bone-weary surgeon who labors each day at a bombed-out hospital that serves as the only respite for those who have been injured…and Havaa, an eight-year-old girl who has already been forced to endure and lose too much.Many other secondary characters populate this epic tale, including a beautifully-detailed portrait of a damaged man who has turned informer: Ramzan. All of these characters will become tied in an intricate web of connections that reveal how human fate is not just in our own hands, but in the hands of all humanity.The result is a haunting and original look into many universal themes. Ramzan says, “We’re beyond obligation. We wear clothes and speak, and create civilizations, and believe we are more than wolves. But inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are.” Or is it? Rather than embrace Ramzan’s view of the world, this book shines a spotlight on the true meanings of love and sacrifice, and the lengths we will go to connect and endure. While heartbreaking at times, the book, at its core, is hopeful and proves that an “immense, spinning joy” can occur even when one’s very humanity is threatened. I view this Constellation as a potential classic.

Her father – Paul Watkins – was Charlie Manson’s second in command and ultimately testified against him. But to consider this very talented author from that perspective would be reductive. She is a force to be reckoned with and writes so exquisitely and metaphorically that it is hard not to be riveted to the page.Wisely, she ties in her own mythology with that of the West in her magnificent opening story, Ghosts, Cowboys. The pitiless landscape of the Mojave Desert and Death Valley Region is peopled with ghosts – visionaries and maniacs, movie stars and millionaires, gold diggers and tourists, and yes, Claire herself and her “twin”, Razor Blade Baby, delivered by Charles Manson with a razor blade when labor became stalled…who may or may not be her half sister. This story is about as flawless as I have seen.And then, again wisely, Ms. Watkins moves away from her personal anthology and focuses on those others who are striving for connection…those haunted souls who inhabit the West and who strive to make sense of their loneliness and their pain. The vast majority of stories pack a wallop in their telling.Take Rondine al Nino, for example. In this compelling tale, “our girl” attempts to offer a piece of herself to a so-called sensible man in a game of emotional stakes: he must tell her something he did that was terrible and then she’ll reveal her own story. Her story is mesmerizing and disturbing: a one-night stand in nearby Las Vegas, where she heads with her best friend Lena. Reading about her manipulation of Lena and debasement of herself – and her friend – is like watching a car wreck that you can’t quite pull away from.Another favorite, The Past Perfect, The Past Continuous, centers on a young Italian tourist and begins, “This happens every summer. A tourist hikes into the desert outside Las Vegas without enough water and gets lost. Most of them die.” Michele’s friend Renzo is that tourist; afterwards, he ends up a frequent patron at a brothel, where he shakes up the jaded inhabitants in ways that are unexpected.The longest story, The Diggings, is set in the 1840s Gold Rush as two brothers seek to claim their fortune. One spirals into madness; the other, a visionary, grows more content as his brother grows more wretched. “A promise unkept will take a man’s mind,” Ms. Watkins writes. “It does not matter whether the promise is made by a woman or a territory or a future foretold.” The story is page-turning and unputdownable.

The house is rather isolated, except for a seemingly predatory shepherd who tends to his flock, a not-so-friendly badger, and ten white geese who refuse to be corralled to safety even as they slowly disappear. And into this world, a visiting stranger – a young man – shows up.Gradually, the book reveals its secrets: who is Emilie and what is she fleeing? Why are the geese vanishing? How does the young man fall into the picture? To even hint at the answers would create spoilers.So I am left with saying this: the themes of the book, the wavering line between isolation and intimacy, the coming to terms with mortality, the connection between nature and humankind, the complexity that is present even in simplicity, are all delivered with a tranquility that belies the dramatic tension. There is often sheer poetry in the prose, understated revelations, sidelong glimpses into lives that prefer to remain enigmatic. Ten White Geese touched me deeply and has haunted me ever since I reached the end. It’s tender, surprisingly sensuous, and compelling al at once.

Lomba – a writer – is one of many political prisoners, whose life has been upended and whose humanity is on the way to being extinguished by a corrupt system. But who is Lomba, really, and what brought him to the prison?The answer isn’t revealed until the last story. In the interim, we learn much about him through narratives: the love of his life married a benefactor to pay for her dying mother’s care, his close friend lost his entire family and went mad with grief as the army moved in on student protests. In the longest of the stories, Poverty Street, Lomba lives among others who are struggling to get by: a young boy who was exiled to his aunt’s because of a misdemeanor and his teacher Joshua who loves a former pupil – Hagar – who was forced to turn to prostitution.It’s a bleak picture of the “despair, the frenzy, the stubborn hope, but above all the airless prison-like atmosphere” of Nigeria, a land gone mad during the Babangida and Abacha years and most readers – me among them – will likely not know the background history and repressive military regimes that rocked Nigeria to its core.But this book is not about historicity; Habila states, “My concern was for the story, that above everything else.” In this, the author succeeds brilliantly. When Lomba visits a slave museum at Badagry, his mentor tells him that two slaves who spoke the same language were never kept together. He ends the tale by saying,“…every oppressor knows wherever one word is joined to another to form a sentence, there’ll be revolt.” At another point, he considers, “…there is so much more we can’t understand because we are only characters in a story and our horizon is so narrow and so dark.”It will be words, Habila suggests, that offer the power to set us free, whether it’s within a prison or in the chaos of a brutal military coup. The eponymous “angel” that Lomba awaits is the angel of death but Habila celebrates not death but life: hope, the possibility of love, the beauty of connections, the power of journalism and other writing. In the end, the sentence of imprisonment pales next to the sentence that can offer liberty.

This panoramic saga focuses on a group of Baby Boomers from the time they meet at a camp for the creatively gifted as teenagers through middle age. The bond that draws these divergent characters together is powerful and special; they dub themselves “The Interestings.” And the bond, for the most part, is stretched, sustained, and redefined as they age.There is Jules, the key character, an aspiring comic actress-turned-therapist who attended the camp on scholarship . Her best friend is Ash – she and her twin Goodman have lived a charmed and fortunate life – and eventually marries their mutual friend Ethan. Ethan, the creator of an animated series called Figland, becomes successful beyond their wildest dreams. And then there is Jonah, the son of a Judy Collins type songwriter, who must navigate the boundaries of attachment at the start of the AIDS era.At the core of this novel, there is an exploration of what it means to be special. As one character ultimately says about the camp that brought them together, “It made you feel special. What do I know – maybe it actually made you special. And specialness – everyone wants it. But Jesus, is it the most essential thing there is? Most people aren’t talented. So what are they supposed to do – kill themselves?”The spotlight is squarely on two couples – Jules and her ultrasound technician husband Dennis and their friends Ash and Ethan – as the lure of money and fame threaten to place them in different stratospheres. The themes center on longing and envy and self-hatred and grandiosity and failure and success…and how the definition of what it means to be “interesting” changes as life goes on. Jules says to Dennis, “…meeting in childhood can seem like it’s the best thing – everyone’s equal, and you form bonds based only on how much you like each other. But later on, having met in childhood can turn out to have been the worst thing, because you and your friends might have nothing to say to each other anymore…”The Interestings is squarely cemented in a transformative time, touching on many of the milestones of a unique generation: the rise of feminism, the confusion and terror of being gay at the cusp of the AIDS era, and perhaps most of all, being alive during that tipping point when “portfolios” shifted meaning from art portfolios to financial portfolios.

Some may call it a dystopian sci-fi fable; others may believe it is a psychological cautionary tale; still others may view it as an anthropological-based literary thriller. In fact, it is all of these and none of these. It is a truly original piece of work.The main character, Hesketh Lock, is a handsome, intelligent anthropologist with Asperger’s syndrome. He excels at this work because he can eliminate all the messy emotional debris and focus squarely on the facts. Called “a robot made of meat” by his former significant other, he specializes in corporate sabotage troubleshooting. Yet soon, the consistently rational Hesketh is floored by a pattern of deaths involving indigenous superstitions. Formerly conscientious workers in three different countries – Taiwan, Sweden and Dubai – are involved in sabotage and self-destruction. A collective subconscious seems to be at play, through the evocation of ghostly ancestors, trolls and djinns. The question is: “If it’s a shared narrative, are they collectively re-enacting an old myth, or creating a new one?”There is something else amiss in the world as well. Young children are suddenly turning feral; a seven-year-old girl puts a nail gun to her grandmother’s neck and fires…other children are murdering their families ruthlessly. Hesketh has a personal stake in these atrocities. He has a strong bond with his young stepson, Freddy, which brings these events home to a personal level.Men attacking institutions they love…children turning on families…two overlapping circles, with irrational violence at the intersection. What connects them? And how will Lock, a logic-based narrator with an obsession for origami and compulsion to match skin tones and clothes to a Dulux paint chart, unravel what is at the core of all this?This is a thinking person’s book that’s not afraid to tackle the multiple explanations humans give to ascribe meaning to existence with wisps of the legacy we are leaving behind.

In ways, he embodies The American Tragedy written by Dreiser over a century ago; he has come to the land of opportunity and reinvention to find a new self.In so many ways, Erik is a product of wherever he is in time. Born in divided East Berlin, he experienced first-hand the desperation that comes from a physical division. Now, years later, he finds himself in the midst of an acrimonious custody battle for the one person he truly loves: his six-year-old daughter, Meadow. The problem – or one of the problems – is that in the interim, Erik has reinvented himself. He took on the identity of a distant Kennedy cousin (yes, THOSE Kennedys!) to apply to a prestigious camp and later, to earn a Pell Grant that allowed him to gain access to a college education.It is here – and only here – that the novel slips into inauthenticity. It is difficult to accept that Eric could so seamlessly change identities, even in 1984. He manages to keep his father from visiting him at college and lies to his wife Laura without any detection.The beauty of this book is that as readers, we slide over that obstacle and accept Eric Kennedy, who is – to put it mildly – an unreliable narrator. His first-person account of the unplanned kidnapping of his daughter is recounted from the start in epistolary form to Laura, while he is in the correctional facility. As readers, we know how this journey will end from the start.Yet there is so much to keep us going. Amity Gaige deal with heartfelt and complex issues: what happens when powerful parental love crosses the line? Can anyone truly reinvent himself or does the dissonance produce a fragmented identity? Is it possible for a deeply flawed person who hurts those who love him still be a “good” person? What makes a “good” person anyway?Schroder should not be a sympathetic character. As readers, we quickly see the holes in his reasoning and understand how he is placing his daughter in perilous situations – both physically and emotionally.

AmbitiousAmericanah is a breathtaking mosaic on all-things-racial – the candid and often painful conversation Obama promised, and failed, to deliver. Ambitious in scope and often devastating and disturbing, Ms. Adichie creates the indelible characters of Ifemelu and Obinze, a pair of Nigerian lovers whose paths take them in different directions before reuniting once again. In what must be a tongue-in-cheek tweak, Ms. Adichie writes, “So if you’re going to write about race, you have to make sure it’s so lyrical and subtle that the reader who doesn’t read between the lines won’t even know it’s about race. You know, a Proustian meditation, all watery and fuzzy…”No reader can accuse her of taking that easy path. There is a great deal to chew on here. The grand theme, if such a theme can be identified, is the “ominous legacy of choicelessness available. The author writes of Obinze: “They would not understand why people like him, who were raised well-fed and watered but mired in dissatisfaction, conditioned from birth to look towards somewhere else, eternally convinced that real lives happen in that somewhere else, were now resolved to do dangerous things, illegal things, so as to leave, none of them starving, or raped, or from burned villages, but merely hungry for choice and certainty.”It is this desire that motivates both Ifemelu and Obinze and which leads them to various feelings that range from despair to eventual empowerment. The various forms of relationships – non-American black to American black, non-American black to English black, American blacks to each other, blacks to whites, class divides, educational divides and more are used to good effect. Moreover, Ms. Adichie beautifully captures the worlds of America and Nigeria (of Nigeria, one character says, “One of the things I’ve learned is that everybody in this country has the mentality of scarcity. We imagine that even the things that are not scarce are scare. And it breeds a kind of desperation in everybody. Even the wealthy.”)The one problem with this superbly written book is that Chimamanda Negozi Adichie has two conflicting goals. The first is to describe the internal journeys of two fully-fleshed characters who struggle with issues of identity, belonging, and always, race, in a so-called post-racial world. The second goal is an educational agenda, to raise the consciousness of her readers. Certainly, she succeeds. Ms. Adichie devotes pages upon pages to the physical/psychic dangers of relaxed black hair, a metaphor for the “Americanah-izing” of blacks. Certainly, this reader will never again look at relaxed black hair and think it’s “beautiful.” The question is: who is leading the reader, Ifemelu or Chimamanda? To add to the complexity, Ifemelu is a blogger who writes articles such as Understanding America for the Non-American Black: American Tribalism. Or: To my Fellow Non-American Blacks: In America, You Are Black, Baby. Or: A Michelle Obama Shout-Out Plus Hair as Race Metaphor. Each blog – without exception – is marvelously written and provoking. But again, I couldn’t help think that the blogs were Ifemelu/Chimamanda creations and not organically from Ifemelu.The title, Americanah – fourth syllable extended -- is a derogatory term that refers to those who come back and act like “serious Americans”, and who, in effect, shed their identities. Certainly, Ms. Adhichie has much to say and virtually all of it is thoughtful and important. So how do I rate this? The writing is wonderful, the content will linger, yet there is definitely authorial intrusion and blurring of the line between character and author. Most importantly, though, it’s a stunning book that will stay with me and not recede easily.

Four years ago, I fell under the spell of Let The Great World Spin; in fact, the first few pages, describing the extraordinary real-life feat of Philippe Petit showcases some of the finest contemporary writing I’ve been privileged to read.The magic, sadly, is missing for me in his latest book, Transatlantic.The premise is audacious and fascinating. Mr. McCann, who proved himself as a master in the art of the interwoven story, borrows from history. The first three stories focus on Jack Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown (the inspiration for Charles Lindbergh) who flew a modified bomber on the first non-stop transatlantic flight in 1919…the famous Frederick Douglass during his trip to Ireland in 1846…and the former Senate Majority Whip George Mitchell who spearheaded the North Ireland peace talks just 15 years ago. In the second half, he shifts the focus to the women who played a minor role in the first half – Lily, Emily, Lottie, and Hannah – four generations who weave the narrative tapestry together and showcase their own contributions to history. The ambitious book spans a century and a half and makes unexpected and integral connections. But. Here’s. The Sticking Point. Much of the novel relies on truncated sentence fragments that reduce the conversation to a stutter. Here, in a scene of George Mitchell’s meeting with Tony Blair, is a typical paragraph: “There is a swerve to Blair. The neat suit, the tie. A dishevelment to Ahern. A busy grief. Both of them sweeping in, taking over their offices. Second floor. Third floor. Meeting after meeting. Phone call after phone call.” Or here is one that focuses on Douglass: “The room drew in behind him. A gust of air. A wake of light. As if it were all being funneled down to follow him.”Instead of involving me in the story, the prose becomes surprisingly lifeless. I wanted the story to take flight as I lost myself in the glorious prose I had come to expect from Mr. McCann’s last book. Instead, I found myself grounded, waiting for take-off, unable to truly lose myself in the world that the author created. Oh, sure, Mr. McCann can turn a phrase. His words are meticulously chosen but the reliance on this curious sentence structure kept me from the very necessary connection and empathy that readers (or at least THIS reader) must have with the characters.Throughout, I marveled at Colum McCann’s ability to take historical characters – including Frederick Douglass, who was widely respected for his own eloquence – and work within the restrictive structure of “the known”. As Mr. McCann himself says, “There is no real anonymity in history.” And I continued to admire the sheer poetry of some of his descriptions. I freely admit that others may admire – even love – the staccato sentences composed of intense, carefully chosen words.

In some important ways, it contains wisps of J.M. Coetzee’s Disgrace, a book that similarly centers around the break-in of a home,The theme is, indeed, Absolution, the freeing from blame, guilt and consequences. Nearly every key character in Absolution is seeking forgiveness, either from the living or the dead, and as such, they are microcosms for their nation – a place that is in true need of absolution.Patrick Flanery masterfully layers his story in patchwork style. The conflicting points of view come from four different perspectives: that of Clare, an aging, reclusive and celebrated Cape Town author…Sam, her young chosen biographer who holds a mysterious connection to Clare…Clare’s semi-fictional memoir – appropriately titled Absolution – which imagines what might have happened…and a fourth thread, which reveals what may, indeed, be the truth.In brief, Clare is re-examining her past, which includes two pivotal deaths. Her hated sister, Nora, who held a pro-apartheid view, was gunned down years ago in what was likely a political reprisal. Clare’s own daughter, Laura, an anti-apartheid activist, also disappeared without a trace. What culpability – if any – did Clare have in either of these deaths? Can Sam be the key to the absolution she seeks? And when Clare’s home is senselessly broken into and an object of little monetary – but great personal – significance is taken, another question is raised: can a flawed memory hold its own kind of truth?Absolution is but one of this book’s riveting themes. Another is the falsity of the stories we tell ourselves. “It is possible, through a sense of vanity, either conscious or unconscious, to attribute crimes wholly to oneself in which one has only had a partial hand,” Flanery writes. A little earlier: “History is not always correct, because it cannot tell all the stories that have been, cannot account or everything that has happened.”Like in many powerful books, definitive answers remain elusive. The truth of memory, Flanery implies, is no less accurate than literal truth. This was the last book I read in 2012, but it soars to the top of my personal “Best of 2012” list. It has everything I look for: complex characters, important themes, arresting and often lyrical prose, and stunning craftsmanship....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Dec 28, 2012",Jan 2013,"Dec 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13073575-absolution

This is one of the most confidently-written, tender, and triumphant short story collections I have read since Alice Munro. And that is saying a whole lot.Most short story collections are linked by a theme, character, or plot point, and so it is here. In each of these stories, a character receives “news from Spain” – real news or metaphorical news. In the first story, old friends receive their news on the beach: “…my father would hand me a shell and say, “Want to listen to the news from Spain?” In another later story, the widow of a charismatic race car driver learns that her young husband has died while she is in Madrid, waiting to join him. And so on.Some of the characters in these stories are meticulously-crafted figments of the author’s imagination. Others are based on real people: the real marriage of George Balanchine and his paralyzed ballerina wife, Tanaquil Le Clercq, for example, or a fact-combined-with fiction story of a triangle love affair consisting of Eleanor Roosevelt, Martha Gellhorn and David Gurewitsch. That story begins with this line: “Some of this is fiction, and some isn’t.”There are breathtakingly good stories in this collection, each of which is entitled The News From Spain. Perhaps my favorite is the one focused on the race car driver’s widow, who is being interviewed by a young journalist and his younger wife. Eventually, it is the person on the sidelines – Lisa, the young wife who is along for the ride – who will reveal the greatest secret. Another favorite is the paralyzed ballerina story; she is cared for by a tentative gay man who is pining for a member of her husband’s company. The parallelism of the two stories – both Tanaquil and her caregiver, Malcolm, fear being deserted – is beautifully accomplished.In another favorite, a middle-aged daughter balances relationships with her dying mother (who was “always the one who wanted to talk about the news from Spain, or from the Vatican, or from some uncertain city where everything had collapsed…”) and a compelling new man in her life. In a few short sentences, Ms. Wickersham nails the relationship: “You’re so sad,” he keeps saying It starts as sympathy. A week or two later it’s cool, a diagnosis. Then it becomes a criticism.”All seven of these narratives are, in the end, love stories. “A love story – your own or anyone else’s – is interior, hidden. It can never be accurately reported, only imagined,” Ms. Wickersham writes. “It is all dreams and inventions. It’s guesswork.” It will end well or it will end badly. It will be witnessed be significant others who will view it from different angles. It will cause searing heartache or exhilarating joy. And, it will echo through the seas of time, like the news in Spain that comes through a seashell.With astonishing psychological insights and deep compassion for her characters, Ms. Wickersham has written a lovely book reflecting human complexity.

Dublinesque should have a big banner on its cover stating, “Serious readers only.” Because this is, at its core, a book about literature and readers. Take this comment by Mr. Vila-Matas’ key character (and perhaps in some sense, alter ego): “The same skills needed for writing are needed or reading. Writers fail readers, but it also happens the other way around and readers fail writers when all they ask of them is confirmation that the world is how they see it…”Well, Mr. Vila-Matas does not fail his reader. This is an ambitious book, on its surface about a retired and ailing Barcelona publisher named Samuel Riba, who decides to journey with three friends to Dublin during Bloomsday on June sixteenth, where he can retrace the path of James Joyce’s Bloom (from Ulysses). While there, he wishes to say a requiem for the culture of the Gutenberg age (that has now morphed into the Google age) and at the same time, say a requiem for himself, a literary publisher very much in decline.It helps to have at least a familiarity with Ulysses; Riba (and by extension, his creator) provide fascinating interpretative snippets as the book propels forward. It also helps to know Philip Larkin, who wrote the poem Dublinesque, about an old Dublin prostitute who, in her last hour, is accompanied by a few co-workers along city streets. And if the reader happens to know Samuel Beckett, Paul Auster, John Banville, David Cronenberg (cinema’s last real director, according to Riba), William Yeats, and other artistic luminaries, so much the better.There are many golden nuggets about the craft and purpose of writing (Riba kept striving to find a writer “truly able to dream in spite of the world: to structure the world in a different way. A great writer: at once anarchist and architect.”) There are also great insights into our collective journey through mortality: going “from the existence of the sacred (Joyce) to the somber era of the disappearance of God (Beckett).” It’s about holding on to enthusiasm and doing what we need to do. (“You haven’t made us come to Dublin so you can turn yourself into a metaphor, have you?” queries one of Riba’s friends.) It’s about the unlived past and our continued existence.Mostly, though, it is a book of ideas, beautifully translated from the Spanish by Anne McLean and Rosalind Harvey. It’s not a book to love – Riba keeps us at arm’s distance and we get to know his musings and philosophies, not his heart – but it is a book that makes us think and stand up and take notice.

A hologram is a three-dimensional photographic image that appears to have A hint of Dave Egger’s ambitious theme can be gleaned right from the title. A hologram is a three-dimensional photographic image that appears to have depth; in reality, it is only an illusion.Alan Clay – his very name suggests an unformed man – is illusionary in many ways himself. A quintessential American salesman, with wisps of Willy Loman, Alan has “sold actual objects to actual people”, at Fuller Brush and later at Schwinn. When we meet up with him, he is deeply in debt, a divorced middle-aged man with a daughter who may need to drop out of college, and a scary golf-ball-sized lump on the back of his neck. He works for a company with the ironic name of Reliant and he is betting on one last chance: spearheading a sophisticated holographic presentation to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and, hopefully, netting a lucrative technological contract.All is, indeed, illusionary. The parallels to Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot are strong: each day, Alan Clay and three interchangeable IT assistants show up at a sweltering tent in King Abdullah Economic City – itself a dream – to wait for the King’s arrival. Each day, the King does not show up, and no one seems to know exactly when and if he WILL show up. And so they persevere.What is real is Alan Clay’s relationship with his daughter, Kit, and the most poignant parts of this novel are the repeated, unsent letters to his daughter; the communications in those letters are poignantly, achingly authentic. During those times, alone in his hotel room and trying to reach out, Alan Clay achieves three-dimensional status. In all other relationships, he presents just a shell, unable to experience the joy of living.A major theme that’s developed in Hologram is the global winds of change; the outsourcing of our future and it is here that Dave Eggers overreaches. Schwinn’s problems, for example, offer a textbook sample of an internal combustion; their president cut back on research, including valuable customer demographics and competitor analyses, ignored vital trends, and closed down internal dissent. The outsourcing to Taiwan and China was a result, more than a cause. Too often, Mr. Eggers tweaks with facts to support his themes and goals.That being said, A Hologram for the King is a very good book about a vanishing America and an increasingly obsolete American worker. Fittingly, the once hands-on Alan Clay is now that deadliest of vocations, a “consultant”, parched in a desert, dependent on “fixers”, and holding on to a dream that can vanish – like a hologram – when the plug is pulled....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 03, 2012","Dec 09, 2012","Dec 03, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13722902-a-hologram-for-the-king

Kevin Powers, in this debut book, is certainly one of them. The Yellow Birds is breathtaking good, profoundly insightful and written with an incredible amount of emotional precision.Some might compare it to other war-themed books: The Naked and the Dead, All Quiet on the Western Front, The Things They Carried, or even A Separate Peace. They would, in my opinion, be misguided.This is not the quintessential book about the Iraqi War, even though the settings are mainly the battlefield of Iraq and “home”, in this case, Richmond, Virginia. Rather, it is a book about all wars and all situations that force us to live with becoming less than human.What happens, Kevin Powers postulates, when youngsters – barely out of their teens – must go against everything they’ve been taught as moral? Is there “any making up for killing women or even watching women get killed, or for that matter killing men and shooting them in the back and shooting them more times than necessary to kill everything you saw sometimes because it felt like there was acid seeping down into your soul and then your soul is gone…”This is a book about those who became unaware “of even our own savagery now: the beatings and the kicked dogs, the searches and the sheer brutality of our presence.” It is about the promise that one boy – John Bartle -- makes to another boy’s mother that he cannot possibly keep. It is about someone who cannot return to the ordinary despite his most fervent wishes: “If I could not forget, then I’d hope to be forgotten.”And most of all, it’s about young men who should be in the height of life who are forced to be on intimate knowledge with death: “It seems absurd now that we saw each death as an affirmation of our lives. That each one of those deaths belonged to a time and that therefore that time was not ours. We didn’t know the list was limitless.”None of the quotes I used reflect the pure elegiac beauty of the prose, beginning with the first line: ‘The war tried to kill us in the spring.” The war could be any war or anything that creates detachment and devalues human life. “The world makes liars of us all,” Kevin Powers writes at one point.

There are only two kinds of short stories here: the extremely good ones and the excellent ones.Most of these are set in Munro’s native home in Ontario and are filled with perceptive young women who are at the cusp of a life’s transition. One of the best, for my money, is Admundsen. A young teacher named Vivien is hired to teach children with tuberculosis in a residential home; while there, she catches the fancy of the head doctor, Dr. Fox. Although hints to his cold character and selfishness are given in abundance, Vivien believes that marriage is in the offering until the inevitable betrayal occurs.Haven is another one I particularly liked. A growing girl is forced to stay with her aunt and uncle while her parents perform missionary work in Africa. Her aunt lives for her uncle; he, on the other hand, is self-contained and distant. Eventually, his irrational hatred for his musically-inclined estranged sister brings realizations to a head.Or take this one: Dolly. An elderly man – aged 83 – and his 71 year old wife contemplate a double suicide to be “gone when the going is good.” Yet when a woman from his distant past appears unexpectedly, all perspectives start to shift. “I had forgotten how old we were, forgotten everything. Thinking there was all the time in the world to suffer and complain,” the wife reflects.The stories start with younger characters and segue into the lives of older characters and then at the end, everything changes. Ms. Munro writes, “The final our works in this book are not quite stories. They form a separate unit, one that is autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, equally so in fact. I believe they are the first and last – and the closest – things I have to say about my own life.”And what does the normally reticent Ms. Munro have to say about that life? “We say of some things that they can’t be forgiven, or that we will never forgive ourselves. But we do – we do it all the time.” The reader is treated to insights on identities in the making, lives that become recreated or reinvigorated only later in life, and the growing into a sense of who we’ve been all along. Hopefully, Alice Munro – who is now an octogenarian – will have much to add to her own story and those of the wonderful characters that continue to live on....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Nov 27, 2012",Dec 2012,"Nov 27, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13530981-dear-life

Yet another story is about young Alice, an orphaned girl who must adapt to life with her grandmother, and an older mother and daughter who take her under their wing.There are no ground-shaking assertions or twists of plot; this book is a slice of life. As Lyle says at one point, “What I’ve seen is the sweet kindness of one person to another. Just time passing on a summer’s night. This ordinary life.” In another author’s hands, all this might degenerate into sappiness or preachiness. Kent Haruf is better than that. His characters are flawed: teenage boys who can’t live up to their father’s expectations, women who take married lovers rather than deal with the wide gap of loneliness, fathers who fail their sons by not accepting their authenticity. They are also brave: marriages that survive decades, parents who strive to be better, people who lose their way but still attempt to do good in the end.

Stephen King may not win the biggest literary awards, but when it comes to mesmerizing storytelling, he truly is the KING. The plot centers around an English teacher named Jake Epping, who is shown a fissure in time that allows him to travel to 1958 and back. He can stay in the past as long as he wants yet the elapsed time when he returns is only two minutes. In his first two journeys, he attempts to change history by taking out the ruthless father of one of his students, a man who killed his wife and other children with a sledgehammer years ago. In his third trip, he takes on a much more far-reaching mission: to prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from murdering JFK. While doing so, an unexpected complication arises: Jake falls deeply in love with a woman named Sadie Dunhill.To embrace this story, the reader must buy into several of King’s truths. The first: always keep it simple. Stephen King wastes no time in describing the physics of time travel. Jake’s friend’s storeroom is a portal to the past and you either buy in – or not. Smart move, Mr. King.The second is that the past is obdurate. The past totally resists change and the bigger the change, the more obdurate the past will be. It’s also harmonious and filled with parallels and coincidences. Again, Stephen King offers a take-it-or-leave-it choice: you must believe in the harmony of the “Land of Ago” -- or not.And third, you must believe in the chaos theory (if a butterfly flaps its wings, there may be a storm in the Amazon many years later). In other words, small actions may have extremely complex and far-reaching effects. Stephen King takes his time developing this one; in fact, it almost seems as if he is going to advance the theory and then ignore it entirely. But wait. He isn’t the KING for nothing.It’s important to note that although the title is 11/22/63, the Kennedy-Oswald story does not take center stage until about half-way through the book. Up until then, the reader gets to enjoy Stephen King’s massive research into the 50s – the simpler, friendlier lives interspersed with deep and hurtful prejudices. Everything from the songs on the radio to household products and budding technology are brought into play, and Mr. King does a masterful job of making the past come alive.At that point, Mr. King switches to the Oswald story. The only disappointment is that he (unlike his wife Tabitha) believes in the single assassin theory; my own reading informs me that CIA renegades were likely involved. Personal beliefs aside, Stephen King does an extremely credible job of bringing Lee Oswald and Jake Epping together. The ending may not be everybody’s cup of tea but it was mine; I found it to be creative and unexpected and it gave me new respect for this author. Although this is not a perfect novel – some of the beat-the-clock action and melodramatic touches occasionally were over the top – this is an absolutely page-turning book. Once I started, time stood still and all I wanted to do was find out what happens next. “The multiple choices and possibilities of daily life are the music we dance to,” writes Mr. King. Indeed, the music lingers even after the last page....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 21, 2012","Nov 27, 2012","Nov 21, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10644930-11-22-63

Whether you like his latest book or not, you can’t help but feel in awe of his power of meticulous and ravishing wordsmithing.This book focuses on a theme – “the doing of a thing and the recollection of what was done”, otherwise known as faulty memory. The entire novel is filtered through the thoughts of Alex Cleave, an aging actor, who is admittedly a not very good listener. There are two stories that yearn for attention: one in the past, one in the present.“Billy Gray was my best friend and I fell in love with his mother,” Alex recollects in the very first line of Ancient Light. Celia Gray – called Mrs. Gray throughout these recollections – is 35 years old to Alex’s 15. “Looking back now I am surprised at how little I learned about her and her life,” Alex reflects. Indeed, all these recollections are filtered through his own experiences and feelings. We know early on that this doomed affair will end through a humiliating discovery, but these sections are so powerful, so poignant, that they bedazzle and mesmerize the reader.In fact, for THIS reader, they overshadow the present (which is likely what Mr. Banville intended). Alex has grown up, married to a woman he seems to know only sketchily, and lost a daughter to suicide (all of this is revealed very early on). He is asked to take on a role starring as Axel Vander (almost an anagram of his own name) in a role called, fittingly, The Invention of the Past. Axel Vander was, also fittingly, a deconstructionist critic who adapted the name of the original Axel Vander when that man died. The role, played opposite a fragile and young actress -- will force him to confront his memories of his own daughter’s death.“So often the past seems a puzzle from which the most vital pieces are missing,” thinks Alex and indeed, there are key pieces missing of both puzzles from the past. This is a ravishing book that demands close attention throughout, and rewards the reader with g glimpse of the ancient light. (“…the sky must be visible at the top of a window viewed from the base of the opposite wall, if memory serves”). From the opposite wall – the wall of the present – important pieces are gradually illuminated....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 17, 2012","Nov 21, 2012","Nov 17, 2012",,Audio,view (with text),/book/show/13414604-ancient-light

This is just a fabulous novel, a subtle comic satire of a world that’s grown just a teensy bit “complicated.” The key narrator is Bee – a 15-year old who tests off the charts for grit and poise. She is the daughter of the eponymous Bernadette, the winner of the MacArthur genius grant for architecture, and her husband Elgie, a Microsoft company man who achieved his moment of fame with a rousing TED talk on robotics.Poor Bernadette. She’s stuck in Seattle “where women are ‘gals’, people are ‘folks,’ a little bit is a ‘skosh’, if you’re tired you’re ‘logo’. Here in the tech capital of the world, she rails against four-way intersections that inevitably turn into five-way intersections, gauche-looking Craftsman homes, homeless people and fake compassion and the “gnats” – mothers of her daughter Bee’s schoolmates.Nothing escape Maria Semple’s clever eye. The author delightfully skewers a bunch of sacred cows: politically correct private schools, overly protective mothers, Microsoft culture and domination, architectural narcissism, born-agains, the psychiatric establishment, self-help groups like Victims against Victimhood, and a whole lot more.Through several devices – letters, e-mails, correspondence with a psychiatrist, FBI memos and more – Maria Semple provides a window into one family – Elgie, Bernadette and Bee – who are striving to maintain their own individuality while connecting together. The novel never sacrifices its characters in its bulls-eye satire. There are parts of the book that are downright poignant and others that make us turn a mirror back onto ourselves.

There is far more to it than meets the eye.Mr. Crace is particularly interested in pairings: everything comes in twos, right from the opening pages.. Two signals of smoke rise up: one signaling the arrival of new neighbors who are announcing their right to stay…the second, a blaze that indicates the master Kent’s dovecote is gone and his doves taken. Both subplots radiate from these two twinned smoke signals. The stories, narrated by Walter – the manservant of Kent who was paired with him from the start by sharing the same milk – is both an insider and an outsider (yet another pairing). He is not of the village although he has become part of it.Yet the kind Kent is soon paired with someone else: his pragmatic and heartless cousin, who has come to declare his right to the farm. He has plans for the peaceful agrarian village: *’’’this village, far from everywhere, which has always been a place for horn, corn and trotter and little else, is destined to become a provisioner of wool.” The cousin arrives at a particularly fortuitous time: despite evidence to the contrary, the town has wrongly blamed and pillored the outsiders, an older and younger man, and has placed them in gruesome confinement. The woman who was with them has had her head shorn – much like the sheep to come – and is now in hiding, ready for revenge.Mr. Crace writes like a dream. His prose is rich and rhapsodic. One example: “The glinting spider’s thread will turn in a little while to glinting frost. It’s time for you to fill your pieces with fruit, because quite soon the winds will strip the livings from the trees and the thunder through the orchards to give the plums and apples there a rough and ready pruning, and you will have to wait indoors throughout the season of suspense while the weather roars and bends inside. “ Pure poetry.And he pairs THAT – the beauty of his prose – with some substantial themes that resonate for today’s times our close-minded distrust and demonization of outsiders. Our disregard for the true “tillers of the land” in the pursuit of the almighty profit motivation. Our fall from innocence into mistrust and exile. A munificent harvest that reaps nothing but dollars.“The plowing’s done. The seed is spread. The weather is reminding me that rain or shine, the earth abides, the land endures, the soil will persevere forever and a day. Its seed is pungent and high-seasoned. This is happiness,” Walter reflects. Magnificently evoked, unsettling, and at times painful to read as the village life implodes, HARVEST is yet another testimony to Mr. Crace’s vast talents.

Brazzaville Beach is, to some degree, about tasting the fruits of knowledge and losing one’s innocence. The main character, Hope Clearwater, will be told later on, “…the pursuit of knowledge is the road to hell…You think that if you know everything you can escape from the world.”There are two Hopes in this book; the long ago Hope who lived in England (written in third person) and the more current Hope, who lived within an African country (written in the immediate first person). Both Hopes are quite literally dashed as she pursues elusive and forbidden knowledge.Here’s the plot in a nutshell: Hope, a brilliant scientist in her own right, marries a mercurial and highly intellectual mathematician, who increasingly begins to go insane as he pursues an elusive game theory on turbulence. Intertwined with that story is the African Hope, who goes to work for another brilliant man named Mallabar, who is about to publish a renowned book on the peaceful chimps. Her observations belie his premise; the chimps are cannibalizing each other. Yet Mallabar will not even entertain that idea; he, too, is losing it as he holds on to the tendrils of knowledge that he has accumulated.And Hope? Will she, too, be destroyed as she pursues knowledge or will Hope endure? That is the question that is at the core of this very clever book.William Boyd, in my opinion, is a brilliant writer who keeps getting better and better and this is one of his earlier books (published in 1990). As an allegory, it works beautifully. There are, however, some perceived flaws.For one thing, I never “bought” that a woman of Hope’s brilliance, single-mindedness and beauty would be attracted to her husband, John Clearwater. His character is somewhat underdeveloped; certainly, the attraction is not amply explored. Admittedly, I am not a “math person”, but the many explorations of game theory, turbulance, catastrophe theory, divergence syndromes and other chaos theory components sometimes left me shaking my head. They seemed just a little too clever.Secondly, there is a long subsection about the African freedom fighters and Hope’s unwilling adventure with them. As a reader, I get it: the brutish fighting among various human forces equates to the dissonance among the chimps; guerilla leaders and (a little stretch) gorilla leaders are not all that different. Yet I kept wanting the action to return to the ape colony, which (to me) was more fascinating.Those two caveats aside, I found Brazzaville Beach to be compelling. Hope reflects about herself: “She reshaped the haphazard explicable twists turns o her life into an order that she approved of, where the controlling hand o her authorship could be read clearly, like a signature.” Ultimately, she is the creator of her own destiny and her fall from Eden is preordained....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 13, 2012","Dec 18, 2012","Nov 02, 2012",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/77829.Brazzaville_Beach

Had I ed after reading the first tale – set in 1938 and focused on Geoffrey Talbot – I may have very well given this book just 3 stars. The story of a middling man who ends up veering from the career course his father had hoped for and eventually ends up being betrayed to the Gestapo while on a mission at first seemed archetypal and evocative. The unspeakable horrors of the concentration camp are powerfully told, but it almost seems as if the reader has read these descriptions before. It soon becomes clear, though, that this is Sebastian Faulks’ focal point: communal memory. As readers, we know these stories: the man who survives Gestapo atrocities and seeks to regain his ordinary life…the Dickensian orphan Billy in Victorian London who survives through sheer force of character…the brilliant scientist who struggles with the big questions of life and love…the simpleminded and devout orphan Jeanne in rural France… and the skinny, long-haired American singer who leverages her life for her art.All of these characters are intimately familiar to us. The joy of reading this book is unearthing the connections between such disparate characters. Over and over again, details resonate, pricking our minds with the question, “Where have I heard this before?” For example, Geoffrey Talbot will enter a French farmhouse where he is ultimately betrayed; a century earlier, the peasant Jeanne will also have confronted a betrayal. Orphaned Jeanne will be reduced to sleeping on a mat of straw; years later, Billy Webb, another orphan, will be forced to make his bed on a mat of straw at a workhouse. And that workhouse? The songwriter Anya King, in the 1970s, will consider purchasing a flat in that Victorian workhouse where Billy once lived. And so on.“I don’t think you ever understand your life – not till it’s finished and probably not then either,” Billy reflects. Later, the scientist Elena, thinks, “If not just the brain but the quirks that made the individual from uncomposed matter only, it was hard to be sure where the edges of one such being ended and another began.”Life, Sebastian Faulks suggest, is difficult to fathom without consideration of our shared memory, the way we interconnect with those who came before and will come after us, and how all our lives fit into some vast unknowable puzzle. This is, I believe, truly a brilliant book. Jack – who narrates the songwriter Anya’s section – may have said it best: “The events and sensations, the stories and the things that make me what I am in the eyes of other people, the list of facts that make my life…They could be mine, they might be yours.”...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Oct 28, 2012","Oct 30, 2012","Oct 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13722330-a-possible-life

And when is a life truly worthwhile?”In attempting to arrive at the answers, it takes the reader on a joyride of many of the hypocracies and peccadillos of our modern life: a frenzied media that creates instantly celebrities in all fields, only to take rapid pleasure in tearing them down…a hapless and hopeless quest for eternal life…a “moral majority” that takes distinct immoral pleasure in forcing others into its own narrow definitions of “being moral”…and the constant, pervasive presence of family dynamics in the mix.I haven’t had this much fun with an epic since Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections… which is likely a litmus test of whether you will enjoy The Heart Is Broke or not.The book’s central character are Ritchie Shepherd, one-time frontman for the famous rock group “Lazygods” and now the producer of a reality show called Teen Makeover. The only problem – as we learn in the opening pages – is that this family man is now sleeping with a shrewd 15-year-old contestant, which has the power to bring down his marriage and his professional endeavor.His sister, Bec Shepherd, as no such problems. Single, intelligent, and beautiful to boot, she is closing in on finding a vaccine for malaria. A disgruntled lover describes her as, “an atheist prattling about love, a hedonist bragging about her good among the poor, an arrogant intellectual who thinks science has all the answers…” Bec’s “goodness” is anathema for those who aspire to it, think they have it, but really don’t.Surrounding Ritchie and Bec are a bunch of other flawed and memorable characters: Alex Comrie, a gene therapist who once was the drummer in Ritchie’s band, his brilliant uncle who wants to forestall impending death, the uncle’s son Matt, a fundamentalist Christian who forces his family to embrace a “loving savior” while filling them with the terrors of hell if the don’t, and Colum Donobhan, the Northern Irish guerrilla who executed Ritchie and Bec’s father and is now giving poetry readings and latching on to his second chance at life.This big-hearted epic – filled with shrewd and stunning writing – will make my personal list of Ten Best Books of 2012.

There is, indeed, something seductive about traveling in a literary time machine back to the Upper East Side of New York in the late 1930s, peopled by characters named Tinker and Bitsy and Dicky and Mason Tate. Our narrator is Katey Kontent, a plucky, bright, adventurous presumably beautiful young woman who hails from the plebian class. She is a rising star in Miss Markham’s secretarial pool in a leading downtown law firm and is the boardinghouse roommate of the stunningly attractive Eve. While at The Hotspot in Greenwich Village, they chance upon a refined cashmere-clad socialite named Tinker Grey, who intrigues both of them with his sophisticated manners and obvious wealth and good looks.Amor Towles is spot-on with his depiction of the glitter and promise of New York. The 21 Club, the Cotton Club, the spacious apartments of Central Park, the bustle of the Wall Street area, the speakeasy Chernoff, the little diners with soda pop clocks, the snobbishness of Bergdorf’s – all come alive with the master stroke of the writer’s pen. The first few sections were positively spellbinding. The dynamics between the trio – Katey, Eve and Tinker – was magnificently sketched out. But then, through certain plot twists, we get to meet Katey on her own as she secures her position in the rarefied air of upper New York society. And here, for me, is when things began crashing down to earth.We never get much of Katey’s back story, or fully understand why both men and women – including a patron who is well ahead of her time – are so irresistibly drawn to her. In many ways, she is a contradiction in terms: a genuine bookworm and an extroverted party girl…an ambitious go-getter and arm candy for privileged men…a self-aware narrator who doesn’t much engage in introspection…and someone who always seems to be in the right place at the right time.In short, she is a bit larger than life and there is a distancing between Katey and the reader. Katey is defined by her situations and the characters around her more than self-defined. It is a testimony to the excellent skills of Amor Towles that I wanted to keep reading on despite what might have been a major flaw from a lesser writer.The book is, after all, about the ethereal. Mr. Towles writes, “Most of us shell our days like peanuts. One in a thousand can look at the world with amazement. I don’t mean gawking at the Chrysler Building. I’m talking about the wing of a dragonfly. The tale of the shoeshine. Walking through an unsullied hour with an unsullied heart.” More than the characters, New York itself takes front and center stage.

The Nora Eldridge – I suspect, not so coincidentally sharing a first name with Nora Helmer of Ibsen’s A Doll House – is the eponymous Woman Upstairs. The theme that was identified by an Ibsen biographer works for Ms. Messud’s novel as well: “the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and strive to be that person.”A self-described 37-year-old “good girl”, Nora is self-loathing with barely concealed rage: she’s been a compliant and obedient daughter, a great friend, a very competent teacher, and a frustrated artist. Fittingly, Nora’s art-of-choice is creating dioramas, little doll houses as it were, peopled with other invisible, isolated yet talented women such as Emily Dickinson. Frustrated by her constraints, she experiences herself as living a life of quiet desperation…”the quiet woman at the end of the third-floor hallway whose trash is always tidy, who smiles rightly in the stairwell with a cheerful greeting, and who, from behind closed doors, never makes a sound.”Into this invisible life comes the Shahids – Reza, an enchanting child who walks into her classroom one day and his dashing parents, Sirena, an exotic Italian artist and Skandar, a brilliant Lebanese professor. Suddenly, Nora’s life transforms from black-and-white to full-color as she falls for each of them, separately and together.

She reflects: “I wanted a full and independent engagement with each of them, unrelated to the others. I needed their family-ness.” She begins to believe that she is every bit as integral to them as they are to her and she depends on them to provide her with a sense of worth and desire. Together, the three of them hold the key to everything that is important to Nora: life, art, motherhood, love.From time to time, the extremely angry and self-hating tone becomes grating and there are far too many references to “the Woman Upstairs”, as if Ms. Messud wants to be absolutely certain that the reader “gets it.” The forward momentum sometimes stalls as well; in particular, Nora’s thorny relationship with her own mother seems a bit too pat. Yet this tale of obsession – and the betrayal that the reader senses is just around the corner – is addictive.

How odd, then,For those of us who read for character – and I am one of them – the complexities of a strongly drawn narrator is typically what reigns. How odd, then, that I was so captivated by Garden of the Evening Mist, which is in many ways about the impermanence of individuals – the subjugation of self to become in closer alignment with nature and the flow of life – and the dominance of memory.Our narrator is retired Supreme Court Judge Teoh Yun Ling, the physically maimed sole survivor of a brutal wartime camp where she served, euphemistically, as a “guest of the emperor” during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia. When we meet her, she has developed a particular type of aphasia that will soon affect her ability to communicate. “Once I lose all ability to communicate with the world outside myself, nothing will be left but what I remember. My memories will be like a sandbar, cut off from the shore by the incoming tide. For what is a person without memories? A ghost, trapped between worlds, without an identity, with no future, no past.”It is that past, that future, and that identity that she is working to reclaim before the curtain lowers. And so we travel back with her to her past.We learn that in the camp, she and her sister were able to withstand the mind-numbing horrors by remembering an exquisite Japanese garden in Kyoto. After the war, in tribute to her sister, Yun Ling seeks out Yugiri (the Garden of Forgetfulness), created by Nakamura Aritomo, the exiled gardener of the Emperor of Japan. He denies her request to design a tribute garden for her but does agree to take her on as an apprentice. The kinship is almost immediate: “It was odd how Aritomo’s life seemed to glance off mine; we were like two leaves falling from a tree, touching each other now and again as they spiraled on the forest floor.”The slowly evolving plot is as contemplative as the garden itself. The discovery of how Yun Ling was able to survive and what she is hiding is for readers to discover for themselves, and that truth is hidden between the words that are spoken and the words that are kept inside of us. Or, as Yun Lang reflects, “Are all of us the same…navigating our lives by interpreting the silences between words spoken, analyzing the returning echoes of our memory in order to chart the terrain, in order to make sense of the world around us?”In exquisitely crafted prose, TanTwan Eng renders the garden as a place of memory and forgetfulness and ultimately, of self-healing. It is a metaphor for life itself: “The garden has to reach inside you. It should change your heart sadden it, uplift it. It has to make you appreciate the impermanence of everything in life. That point in time just as the last leaf is about to drop, as the remaining petal is about to fall; that moment captures everything beautiful and sorrowful about life.”This book – like the garden that is its subject – succeeds at capturing those elusive and impermanent truths....more",Notes are private!,2,51,1,"Oct 02, 2012","Oct 08, 2012","Oct 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13592384-the-garden-of-evening-mists

The beautiful and Somewhere in Ian McEwan’s brilliant and riveting new novel, Sweet Tooth, readers are treated to a game of mathematical probability. The beautiful and duplicitous Serena Frome – the book’s narrator and – walks her lover, a promising writer named Tom Healy, through a complex game of chance. He doesn’t truly grasp the context, yet soon after, he pens a story, donating her definition of probability to his key character. “At one level, it was obvious enough how these separate parts were tipped in and deployed. The mystery was in how they were blended into something cohesive and plausible, how the ingredients were cooked into something so delicious,” Serena reflects.Sweet Tooth is a reader’s book and a writer’s book. At its heart is invention; the logic that defines the outer world is sublimated into the author’s vision of that world. It works beautifully and is, in my opinion, perhaps the most satisfying book that Ian McEwan has ever written. With masterpieces to his credit like Enduring Love, Saturday, Atonement, Amsterdam and others, that says a whole lot.The plot incorporates elements of a classic spy story. Serena Frome is a beautiful and brilliant Cambridge student who is recruited to join the British M15 in the early 1970s during a jittery time in the country’s history. Her special mission is to infiltrate the literary circle of an up-and-coming writer and essayist, Tom Healy in a psych-ops mission. To say much more would be to spoil the pleasure of discovery.Suffice to say this: along the way, Mr. McEwan treats us to stories within stories. All of these dazzling stories carry within them the seeds of a future novel. Each is a polished little gem. The craft of the writer is similarly explored; as Serena states, “There was, in my view, an unwritten contract with the reader that the writer must honour. No single element of an imagined world or any of its characters should be allowed to dissolve on authorial whim.” Lastly, Ian McEwan is at the top of his form in getting into the mind of his female narrator – no easy feat. I completely understood the complex character of Serena and was half in love with Tom Healy myself. Mr. McEwan performs sleights of hand that show an intricate knowledge of the geography of a woman’s mind. Whether this book is read as a thriller, a glimpse into the writer’s craft, a psychological study, or just a darn good yarn, the themes are universal: love, betrayal, and yes, atonement. 6 stars!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 24, 2012","Oct 02, 2012","Sep 24, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13562049-sweet-tooth

It’s full of There is something – well, downright appetizing about The Dinner, although ultimately, you may wish for something just a bit more meaty. It’s full of totally unlikeable and morally bankrupt characters and told by an absolutely unreliable narrator but if you’re like me, you’ll want to linger with it through dessert and afterwards.The premise: two brothers, Paul and Serge, and their wives, Claire and Babette, meet for dinner one evening in an exorbitantly pricey and pretentious restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam. Serge and Babette are well known; in fact, Serge is just a breath away from becoming Holland’s next Prime Minister. Paul – our narrator and a former teacher who is now non-active – is simmering with bitterness and animosity at his far more successful brother.Each couple has a 15-year-old son; they are, of course, first cousins. Serge and Babette are also parents to another son whom they adopted in Africa. We know immediately that the boys have gotten into some kind of trouble, but the narrator withholds from us exactly what the nature of that trouble is. The unspoken question at the table becomes “how far would you go to protect the ones you love?” As the horrific teenage transgression is gradually revealed, the grotesqueness of each set of parents also begins to uncover. Apertif and appetizer make way to entrée and dessert, yet surrounded by the trappings of civilization, these two couples are anything but civilized. Frustrations, dissatisfactions, and resentments from the past are mixed in a cauldron that can easily bubble over. Yet Paul is so unreliable that we – the readers – must question what is true and what is not in his assessments of the situation.The Dinner is compulsively page-turning, touching on the nature versus nurture conundrum and the public masks we wear. There’s always a sense of menace that lurks right beneath the surface. The book has been compared to Christos Tsiolkas’s The Slap but also there’s a touch of Reza’s God of Carnage, Lindsay’s Defending Jacob and Shriver’s We Need To Talk About Kevin.

And eight decades haven’t much dampened his power or dulled his sharp power of observation. In his latest, he turns his focus to Miami, a unique American city that is composed of more than 50 percent immigrants.A melting pot? Hardly! As the fictional mayor Dio states to his Chief of Police: “We got to make Miami – not a melting pot, because that’s not going to happen, not in our lifetimes. We can’t melt ‘em down, but we can weld ‘em down…weld ‘em down…What do I mean by that I mean we can’t mix them together, but we can forge a secure place for each nationality, each ethnic group, each race, and make sure they’re all on the same level plane. You know what I mean?”The reader quickly finds out exactly what he means. No ethnic group escapes Tom Wolfe’s acid tongue or satirical wit. There’s Nestor Camacho, the muscular young Cuban cop who performs a near-legendary act of strength in rescuing a would-be Cuban immigrant from the top of a mast, earning kudos from leading newspaper and disdain from his own community.There’s the “schlocktor” Dr. Norman Lewis, who treats famous billionaires for pornography addiction and who actually intensifies their addiction to make himself indispensable to them. There’s the beautiful Magdalena, attached to both Nestor and Norman, who has one foot in her old culture and one in the glamorous Anglo world.And then there are the secondary characters a status-seeking Haitian professor and his lovely daughter Ghislaine, who is pale enough to “pass”, the powerful black police chief, Jewish ex-New Yorkers in their “Active Adult” community, shady Russian art dealers, privileged testosterone-driven WASPS and so much more.It all centers around a plot: a ruthless and handsome Russian named Sergei Korolyov has just endowed $70 million in forged paintings to Miami’s ritzy new art museum. This will be the lynchpin that eventually brings all these disparate worlds together.I was engaged during the entire book. Yet at times, the book seemed – well, almost a satire of Tom Wolfe himself. This time, the six set of colons that contain a character’s private thoughts, the screaming caps and other stylistic devices seem a little over the top. At other times, the scenes overstay their welcome: the orgies, reality TV parties and strip clubs are often overplayed. That being said, a Tom Wolfe novel is still a cause for celebration.

He’s a faded one-hit-wonder rock star, a careless one-time husband and father, now living on his laurels in an apartment building filled with failed ex-husbands like him. To make matters worse, his Princeton-bound daughter Casey just revealed that she is pregnant and his ex-wife, Denise, is marrying a surgeon, Rich, whom Silver wishes he could hate…but somehow, can’t.His self-definition: “He is a stepping-stone to a better life. No, that would imply that he somehow helped. He is the non-essential ballast that you toss out the plane to achieve flight.”Nothing happens in his life and then something does – he is diagnosed with an aortic problem that requires immediate life-saving surgery by – natch! – Denise’s soon-to-be-husband Rich. And he refuses.One Last Thing Before I Go is surprisingly poignant. Those who have enjoyed Jonathan Tropper’s other books – and I count myself among them – will find the same witty dialogue, the same laser insights into the Jewish American family, the same cinematic narratives and laugh-out-loud moments. But unlike Mr. Tropper’s previous works, his new book provides a sober assessment of a life in the crossroads.The husband-in-waiting, Rich, says to him, “You don’t want to die. You just want a free pass to forgiveness, to undo the fact that you left your wife and neglected your daughter. And you’re too self-absorbed to realize that you’re just screwing them up more in the process.” Later, Silver reflects, “They can go ahead and fix me. But when I wake up, I won’t be any better…I’ve been treating my life as this pit stop, just kind of regrouping before I move on. But it’s been seven years and I’ve never moved on.”The book – especially at the beginning – errs in relying a tad too much on clever rapid-fire dialogue that works better for the cinema than between the pages. And – as in previous Tropper books – there’s a little too much emphasis on the leering, testosterone-filled middle-age guy who ogles every younger woman who comes along. Still, with those minor problems, the book is quite insightful and page-turning read.How does it all work out? That’s for the reader to find out. It’s a great take on the messiness of male middle age angst…and a life that doesn’t go as planned....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 16, 2012","Sep 19, 2012","Sep 16, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13586743-one-last-thing-before-i-go

Joe’s position as the only child of tribal judge Bazil Coutts and tribal clerk Geraldine Coutts kept him feeling loved and secure until his mother is brutally and sadistically raped as she attempts to retrieve a potentially damning file. Although the rapist is rather quickly identified, the location of the rape—in the vicinity of a sacred round house – lies within that “no-man’s land” where tribal courts are in charge and by law cannot prosecute non-native people. Thrust into an adult world, Joe and his best friends Cappy, Zack and Angus are propelled to seek their own answers.This novel shines for many reasons, particularly because of the urgency and power of the descriptions. The aftermath of the rape is described in unflinching and dynamic prose – no manipulation, and no turning away. One of the ancillary yet important characters – the damaged and conflicted Father Travis, an Iraqi War veteran – is so beautifully and powerfully fleshed out that it is impossible to not be riveted to the page. Each character, in fact, is realistically drawn, complete with the ambiguities that reside in each of us.This is a finely nuanced novel in its exploration of what turns a person violent – and what society’s responsibility is when it happens. Ms. Erdrich ties in a tribal tale about a “wiindigoo”, or evil spirit, which makes a person “become an animal, and see fellow humans as prey meat.” In the lure of tribal tradition, there is one answer when the evil spirit emerges: it must be hunted down and killed.Throughout, Ms. Erdrich uses a type of symmetry as she contrasts one belief to the other. For example, on one side, there’s the Roman Catholic belief that every evil ultimately results in good. That varies from the United States legal system, which has oppressed the Indians through a stream of broken promises. There is more: the contrast of ideal justice versus best-we-can-do justice. Past beliefs versus contemporary realities. The dark and the light that reside in each of us. And perhaps most glaringly, the “bad twin” and his spiritually generous twin, named – appropriately – Linden and Linda, two sides of a coin.I have not read much of Louise Erdrich before, so I cannot contrast this book with those that came before it.

He is a Chinese ex-patriot, a self-described businessman, a wheeler and a dealer, and a notorious gambler and frequenter of prostitution houses. He is also a devoted father to his son, Dai Jai, who in a teenage pique of acting-out, catches the attention of the Vietnamese quiet police who are able to make him “disappear.” His father uses his connections to send him away to China at the height of the Cultural Revolution.The wager in the title initially refers to the lengths that Percival Chen will go to in order to get his son back to safety. But in even more important ways, Percival is a gambler with life. Throughout the book, Percival will resort to many high-stakes wagers as the rules change before his very eyes. In the words of his father, Chen Kai, whom we meet in flashbacks: “My son has excellent luck! Just remember, never wager more than you can afford to lose. Leave yourself room to recover. Have something for the next bet. That’s how you’ll come out ahead in the end.” Those words are increasingly prophetic as the stakes increase for Percival Chen and when love, safety, and life itself are at risk.Dr. Lam infuses power into this epic of the Vietnam War with Percival Chen’s unique outsider perspective and his ability to play all the forces against each other through this morally ambiguous war. The secondary characters – his fiercely loyal Teacher Mak, surely one of the most mysterious and exotic characters of any novel in recent years – and Jacqueline, his racially-mixed lover whom he wins in a high-stake game of mah-jong – are beautifully realized.The book explores complex themes: the complexity of allegiances and the limits of wealth, power and friendship. It is a tale of love and betrayal and corruption and bribery and provides a careful glimpse into the Vietnam War from the perspective of the Chinese and Vietnamese. It’s also an astonishingly good book that forced me to stay up way past my bedtime because I just had to know what was coming next.

We meet him as he’s on his way to deliver letters to his deceased friend’s sister in Norwich. There are hints that Will Bancroft – his friend – died under dishonorable circumstances and that, though the war is over, Tristan is still fighting his own private war. But it takes the entirety of the book for the reader to fully understand the circumstances.What we do know – early on – is this: Tristan is gay at a time (World War I) when being gay is considered aberrant. We know his father disowned him and he lied about his age to go overseas to fight the Germans. The thrust of the story, though, is how to remain true to oneself – how to maintain principles – in insane situations. Tristan and Will are part of a unit led by Clayton, a man may very well be out of his mind. The unit is nearly united in its hatred for “feather men”; conscientious objectors who will not take arms to fight and there is one in their midst.The Absolutist does a masterful job at defining the issues: what is cowardice? Is it refusing to bear arms or is it having the courage to stand up for one’s moral beliefs? Is there any principle worth dying for? What is the thin line between love and hate? What happens when that line is crossed? It helps that John Boyne is a strong and accessible writer who keeps readers wanting to turn the page and find out more. He is also masterful in creating suspense.The only reason I’m giving 4-stars instead of 5 is that the book intersperses the conversations between Tristan and Marian – Will’s sister – along with the propulsive action. From time to time, the conversations seem too exalted, a little too false.

Such iIt is a few hours since I turned the last pages of this haunting and powerful novel, and I am still trembling from its nearly unbearable power. Such is the power of Vaddey Ratner’s story telling.And it is story telling that is at the core of this book. At one point, Ms. Ratner reflects, “A story, I had learned, through my own constant knitting and re-knitting of remembered words, can lead us back to ourselves, to our lost innocence, and in the shadow it casts over our present world, we begin to understand it.”Her story is as universal as mankind, and yet uniquely her own. The story has been told – in varying ways – by Carolina De Robertis in Perla, by Naomi Benaron in Running the Rift, by Thomas E. Kennedy in In The Company of Angels, by William Styron in Sophie’s Choice. It is as old as the hills, man’s inhumanity to man, the brutishness, cruelty and sheer sadism of those who inflict damage in the name of an evil cause.In Ms. Ratner’s capable hands, this familiar story rises to sheer poetry as she not only survives, but also transcends. In it, she inhabits her younger muted self and gives her a voice. (In an epilogue, we learn that details have been changed but her character’s story is, in essence, her own). Raami – the little girl who speaks for Vaddey Ratner – is only seven when her world shatters; the infamous Khmer Rouge comes to power, destroying her innocence, her youth, and her family.What ensues is achingly real and beautifully realized. We follow Raami as she undergoes the ultimate in heartbreak, deprivation, loss, and sadness as the Khmer Rouge endeavors to destroy the last sparks of individuality and humanity. Yet even the worst humiliations cannot break her spirit; she clings to hope through the power of story telling and through small gestures of kindness. This impossibly brave author ended up in the United States after four years of forced labor and starvation and went on to graduate Cornell University, summa cum laude. Just as her father – a gentle poet – offered her wings, so she offers those wings to her readers.

If you have any doubt, just deconstruct his name: “Guy” and “Abel”. In Howard Jacobson’s new book, this everyman has plenty of problems: he wants to sleep with his mother-in-law and he also is determined to ensure that the priapic novel continues to reign.In short, Everyman is narcissistically obsessed by phallic matters. Decades ago, when Philip Roth focused on man and his phallic preoccupation, the world sat up and took notice. Today most readers are far quicker to recognize that phallus preoccupation is typically a metaphor for self-preoccupation.And so it is with our Everyman. He is self-absorbed: “A writer such as I am feels he’s been away from the first person for too long if a third-person narrative goes on for more than two paragraphs, never mind a chapter He, him, his…Why bother when such words as I, me, mine exist?”The problem with a narcissistic character is he can easily become tiresome. Abelman is not an “able man”; rather, he’s in the throes of forces bigger than himself. The pleasure of reading books such as he writes is disappearing; now, an app called “Unbooks” lets time-pressed readers breeze through an entire book at a bus stop and readers challenge him at readings (that is, if they show up). Is Zoo Time (named, in part, because of Abelman’s first novel, Who Gives a Monkey’s?) witty? For this reader, there was a certain pretentiousness in the prose that made it hard for me to break through and relate. Sure, there were beautifully-phrased insights that made me want to keep going – harbingers of what this book might have been – but not quite enough for me to want to have spent so many hours in Abelman’s navel-picking world.I couldn’t help but compare Zoo Time to Smut, by Alan Bennett. Although the comparison isn’t true apples to apples, Bennett tackled phallic topics with a light and deft hand. Humor, of course, is in the eye of the beholder and others may take to it more kindly....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 26, 2012","Aug 27, 2012","Aug 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13394634-zoo-time

On its surface, it’s a surprisingly old-fashioned adventure story (those who love Carlos Ruiz Zafon or a better-written Dan Brown will find much to enjoy in this book). The “hero” – Clay Jannon – is a 20-something who recently lost his job when the company he worked for, NewBagel, imploded. On a whim, he goes to work for a 24-hour bookstore, owned by Mr. Penumbra, a man as musty as the ancient books he sells. It doesn’t take him long to realize that the bookstore isn’t what it appears to be; in reality, it’s a secret society of old book readers who are striving to solve a puzzle as old as life itself. With his new girlfriend Kat, who works at Google, and his lifetime friend Neel, who owns a tech company called Anatomix, he attempts to solve the mystery.A divide is set up rather quickly. At one early point, the author describes a certain data visualization model and adds, “If this sounds impressive to you, you’re over thirty.” This reader has left thirty behind a while back, and I must admit to feeling a little overwhelmed at parts where the technology kicks in.The nested theme does have to do with technology, though. At one point, Kat says, “Each big idea…is an operating system upgrade. Writers are responsible for some o it. They say Shakespeare invented the internal monologue. But I think that writers had their turn and now it’s programmers who get to upgrade the human operating system.” In another instance, a fellow Googler refers to old books as “Old Knowledge”. “Imagine if we could make it so that OK/TK (traditional knowledge) was available all the time, to everyone All of it. On the web, on your phone. No question would ever go unanswered ever again.”This novel puts that theory to the test: can the new knowledge on Google co-exist with Old Knowledge and can it illuminate life issues that OK cannot? It’s an inventive and creative premise and the author, who writes very well, handles it beautifully. My ratings reflect my personal enjoyment with a book and since I’m not much of an adventure reader, I’m rating it 4 stars. I would not be surprised if most readers rate it even more highly. One more thing: I don’t think I’ll ever look at Google quite the same way again!...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Aug 24, 2012","Aug 26, 2012","Aug 24, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13538873-mr-penumbra-s-24-hour-bookstore

And so it is with The Devil in Silver.Pepper (so-called because he is ""spicy"") is committed to New Hyde Hospital in Queens for a period of 72 hours for assaulting three undercover police officers. Since this is a book that exceeds 400 pages, we can be relatively certain that his stay will exceed the minimal time...and it does. The theme is telegraphed here by one of Pepper's new-found friends: ""Everyone in New Hyde is trapped in some way. Patients and staff. You think they ever set foot in a place like this unit? Our lives are a clinical trial, Pepper. We're all being tested.""There is a special wrinkle to this novel: one of the inmates may be the devil himself. The horror element is gradually introduced and woven into the larger tale. There's just enough of the horror element to connect those who enjoy the genre (perhaps, books of Stephen King), yet it never transforms into a true horror novel because of the strong human element.The main strength of this novel is a very engaging tone by Victor LaValle. The man definitely knows how to write and from the very first page, I wanted to read on. The dialogue is crisp, the characters are compelling, and the novel successfully bridges the gap between literary mainstream and time-honored psychological horror. Mr. LaValle convincingly weaves in important themes of the numbing and moral incertitude of our lives (""Maybe out there is a lot like in here. The United States of New Hyde""), the way we handle those who are ""different"" including immigrants, the distancing bureaucracies, the ability of love to thrive in the most meager environments, and how we confront the demons that live within and around us.The weakness is a certain amount of authorial intrusion - leading the reader. Take these lines, for example: ""Some might doubt the mentally ill could pull off an orderly queue. Aren't they raving lunatics? Shouldn't they be wandering off or howling at the moon? That's more dramatic, admittedly, but inaccurate."" Passages like this show a certain lack of trust in the reader's ability to form his/her opinions.With a few reservations here and there, I recommend it. Think: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest combined with The Shining, and you'll have an idea of what's in store for you. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Aug 09, 2012","Aug 14, 2012","Aug 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13030260-the-devil-in-silver

Memoirs – the best of them – arThe first hint we have of what Paul Auster has in store for us is the title itself: Winter Journal, not Winter Memoir. Memoirs – the best of them – are not personal narratives, but rather plot lines or themes that bind moments together. Journals – or diaries – are far more intimate and, one might say, confessional.The second hint is the tense that Paul Auster uses: second person, not first. Throughout the journal, he consistently uses “you”; it is the author having a conversation with his younger self. The effect is mesmerizing and almost voyeuristic: it’s almost as if we, the readers, stumbled into Mr. Auster’s home and overheard some of his deepest fears and secrets.“We are all aliens to ourselves,” Mr. Auster writes, “And if we have any sense of who we are, it is only because we live inside the eyes of others.” Many moments of his existence come vividly to life. There are poignant moments: the death of Paul Auster’s mother, a time that begins with a numbing and ends in a visceral howl, as “the more you feel your body changing, the less you feel that you are made of flesh and blood.” There are beautiful moments, too: many pages are a love elegy to his wife of 30 years, Siri Hustvedt, an excellent and acclaimed writer in her own right. And there are funny moments: a huge fight with an obstreperous Parisian neighbor, ending only when Paul Auster pulls out a certain psychological trump card.This is an elegant retelling, a story of a life that has withstood 64 winters, at a time when a person begins to ask, “How much more is left?” It is an inventory of scars – both physical and mental – and an inventory of houses lived in and people encountered. For the lover of Paul Auster’s work – and I certainly am that – there are tantalizing hints throughout about themes and places that show up in his many fictional works: The Brooklyn Follies, Invisible Sunset Park, for example. Just as Paul Auster focuses on themes of absurdism and existentialism in his work, he now shows how it applies to life…along with the real, the mundane, the poignant. I have always admired Paul Auster as a writer. Through Winter Journal, I now feel as if I know him a little better – as a flawed, imperfect, but quite likeable and introspective man....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Jul 30, 2012","Aug 02, 2012","Jul 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13330466-winter-journal

I’ve marveled at the authenticity of his other books, particularly Out Stealing Horses and To Siberia. This one is newly translated and actually precedes the others; it was written in 1992.It’s a melancholy coming of age story and it helps to know that two years before he wrote it, Petterson’s parents and brother were killed in a Norwegian ferry tragedy. Likely, the author is channeling the sadness and alienation and he does it very well.As in other Petterson books, the story runs forward and back in time. We meet the 13-year-old narrator Auden Stetten on his first day in a new school. Despite the headmaster’s urging, he refuses to remove his sunglasses, claiming he does not want to show his scars. In that one simple scene, the reader learns a lot about Auden: that he is self-protective and secretive and that he may carry scars that make it impossible for him to reveal himself to others. Put another way, he’s sort of a “shady character.”Nothing all that much happens; this is not a book for fans of linear plots and action stories. Instead, it’s a deep look into the mind and heart of a boy growing up in Norway and as in previous books, the cold and sometimes unforgiving landscape is very much part of the story.The writing style goes from sparse to lyrical and back again as the story runs through some familiar Petterson themes: the yearning and rejection of connection, the need to make it on one’s own terms, the tough emotional road to growing up. Behind it all is the terror of an abusive father and the true scars that abuse leaves behind. Combined with the wrenching home scenes are poignant ones: at one point, Auden runs away and is taken in by a gentle farmer named Leif where he experiences tenderness. As readers, we know Auden can’t stay there forever but it’s an unsettling contrast about what could have been…and what is.For fans of Per Petterson, it’s worth mentioning that Arvid – who appears in later books – is cast here in a supporting role as Auden’s one true friend. For those who enjoy intricate portraits of characters who are evolving into maturity, this is a very worthwhile read....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jul 26, 2012","Jul 29, 2012","Jul 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12309835-it-s-fine-by-me

It’s a true stunner. The premise is telegraphed in an opening quote from Marilynne Robinson: “In destitution, even of feeling or purpose, a human being is more hauntingly human and vulnerable to kindness knowing there is a sense that things should be otherwise…”Claire is a literary woman who marries for love and finds herself enamored of her new husband’s farm – a place of connection and belonging and family. In the very first sentence, we learn that Claire will undergo “a small, domestic evil, as random as lightning, as devastating to those touched by it.” Very early on, we discover that that evil is a mother’s worst nightmare – the death of her only son near the orchard’s lemon tree.The novel meanders into back story – how Claire ended up at the farm, the difficulty in keeping it – in rather prosaic passages. But hold on tight, because the novel soon begins to gather steam with the introduction of Minna, an exotic and devastatingly beautiful woman who ends up becoming Claire’s caregiver. Minna claims to be the great-granddaughter of the Dominica-born author Jean Rhys, who wrote Wide Sargasso Sea – a a prequel to Charlotte Bronte’s famous Jane Eyre, focusing on the “crazy woman in the attic”, Antoinette (known as Rochester’s first wife, Berta Mason in Jane Eyre).Wide Sargasso Sea’s many themes – disintegrating relationships, precarious mental states, empty promises, and unwavering belief – are all integrated into The Forgetting Tree. Claire and Mina gradually twin to a point where Claire “could no longer tell the difference between her white and Minna’s black.” To say much more would be to give spoilers, but I found the relationship between these two damaged women to be as engrossing as I’ve read this year.Can one’s soul grow anew after a tragedy? Is it possible that a “forgetting tree” could provide solace? Or, as Minna’s mother tells her: “The tree is where you leave the bad memory behind so that it doesn’t poison your life.” Can a person realign with the natural world after unspeakable loss?

Carter’s new book, The Impeachment of Abraham Lincoln is so audacious – so fascinating – that it virtually begs to be read.In this reimaging of the Lincoln assassination, the bullet’s trajectory changes by just a fraction of an inch and Lincoln survives. After the country collectively exhales, the “fun” begins. The radical part of his own party presses for impeachment because he has chosen to not punish the south sufficiently in an effort to reunite the country. He is charged with actions that actually occurred under his presidency as a screen – suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, circumventing Congress while borrowing from the U.S. Treasury, placing portions of Maryland under martial law and trying to establish a military-run Department of the Atlantic.Heady and rich stuff! Mr. Carter is a professor of law at Yale University and his erudition is on full display. The political maneuverings, the impeachment and trial by House Managers, the nuances of removing a sitting president – all are done beautifully by this skilled author. And the key question – can noble ends ever justify ignoble means when the U.S. is under internal threat – is one that resonates today.However, the core of Impeachment is a mystery. Mr. Carter’s protagonist, Abigail Canner, is a brilliant and beautiful black woman and one of only a dozen black law clerks in the country at that time. Like Miss Marple or Nancy Drew, she is preternaturally able to detect conspiracies, patterns, and intrigues that reach the highest levels of government, even when far more seasoned lawyers can’t.The result is a rather convoluted subplot (or in many cases, primary plot) in which Abigail – along with another law clerk, Jonathan, the white scion of a northern family – single-handedly crack ciphers, deal with Abigail’s gangster brother, gain Lincoln’s ear (and even meet with him alone), capture the intrigue of high society, and unveil motives of shady politicians. Real people – such as Dan Sickles, one of Lincoln’s lawyers and a real-life scoundrel – and Salmon P. Chase, the Supreme Court Chief Justice and Edwin Stanton, Lincoln’s trusted secretary of war, are all part of this novel. Lincoln himself, a man given to spun homilies and a far more adept politician than is generally acknowledged – is also portrayed very credibly.

In that book, Captain Towers hears a faint Morse code signal, transmitting from far away, and heads off on a tour of a ruined world, seeking life.I suspect that Peter Heller is also familiar with On The Beach. His debut book, The Dog Stars, is simply masterful. Unlike other writers of this genre, who focus on the scientific or other-worldly reasons for the apocalyptic event, or move forward in a plot-driven manner, Mr. Heller writes beautifully and powerfully about how the events affect one person, a contractor, poet and pilot named Hig.It is Hig’s fate to watch the extinction of everything and everybody he once loved: his pregnant wife Melissa, the tigers, elephants, apes, baboons and cheetahs and eventually, the last trout – a heartache for this avid fisherman.The prose is fragmented, accurately mimicking how someone who has not needed to talk or communicate for many years and has “lost the touch.” Hig’s only companion is a gun nut named Bangley, who is fleshed out and given an affecting back story, and his loyal and aging dog Jasper. Hig reflects, “There is no one to tell this to and yet it seems very important to get this right. The reality and what it is like to escape it. That even now it is sometimes too beautiful to bear.” And a little later, “So I wonder what it is this need to tell. To animate somehow the deathly stillness of the profoundest beauty. Breathe life in the telling.”That is precisely what he does. Hig will eventually try to track down a static-broken voice he heard on the radio years ago in much the same way that Captain Towers follows the enigmatic Morse code signal. And like Captain Towers, he will find comfort in surprising places.Much of this book is surprisingly heartbreaking in its beauty. As Hig faces the toughest existential questions about life – and wonders why he is struggling so hard to survive in a world devoid of what and who he loves the most – he learns that hope and love and decency and humanity can come when you least expect it. And he discovers that life and death live inside each other “waiting for warmer nights, a compromised system, a beetle, as in the now dying black timber on the mountain.” Mr. Heller tackles nothing less than the reasons for living and the hopeless cycles that we all must go through. This is a book that showcases an author who already possesses a voice to follow....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jul 04, 2012","Jul 07, 2012","Jul 04, 2012",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/13330553-the-dog-stars

Kate is bequeathed the diaries of her close friend Elizabeth, who died in a plane crash that was overshadowed by 9/11. Upon reading them, she realizes that she never really knew her close friend and that Elizabeth, who seemed so perfect, had some very substantial secrets. Kate reflects that some people simply “don’t fit into a box. They grow to infiltrate everything and when they suddenly go missing, they are missing everywhere.” And Elizabeth – even the memories of her – are definitely missing.The book firmly falls into the genre of chick-lit (not a slur; in fact, there are many chick-lit books I have 5-starred and like a great deal). It’s about the decisions of motherhood and marriage and about friendship, parenting and identity…with a healthy dose of introspection.But for me, the author makes too many facile choices. I never got the feeling that the diary was written by a flesh-and-blood character; the easy intimacy was missing and the diary seemed too finessed. It just didn’t ring true enough. The use of 9/11 to represent an anxious, uneasy time when everything has changed has also become too much of a cliché; it is the rare writer who can handle that emotionally-charged event in a pitch-perfect way.While there were parts of the book and the plotting that I enjoyed, I never really gave myself over to it or found the reflections profound.

The opinions below are totally my own:I rarely start off a book  about what a book isn’t, but the blurbs on this book are so misleading that I felt compelled to do so. This book is not about teenage girls who “gossip about boys and whisper of an ever more violent world.” Nor is it likely to be ed as a political statement by anyone who doesn’t have an extreme one-sided view.What it is about are three teenage girls – Yael, Avishnag and Lea – who are on the cusp of girlhood-turned-adulthood, when they are already fighting: for self-image, independence, and acceptance. To all this, add a whole other dimension of uncertainty and potential danger as they mark this passage as soldiers in the Israeli Army. One reflects, “During her school years she had felt like every minute was part of a race. Get that grade. That boy. Buy that shirt…But the army was a numbing respite from that eighteen-year-long, breathless race.”There are some who will likely question the author’s blurring of these three girls. Indeed, there are many point-of-view shifts coupled with rapid-fire language, which can leave a reader feeling a little adrift. My belief is that this was a very deliberate choice; in Israel, there is no certainty and situations can rapidly shift from boring to life-threatening in one moment. During those times, individuality does blur and a greater sense of unity emerges. So it is with the girls.The stories – and these are, in effect, interwoven stories – are riveting and often horrifying. One of the young girls serves involuntarily in the Israeli military police; she creates an imaginary life for a Palestinian construction worker whom she sees daily, believing that he, too, is living a life that was foisted upon him. Her fantasies are interrupted by a grim reality. In another instance, one of the girls must bear witness to a forced prostitution ring, yet is unable to stand up to her superior. This is a searing, often disturbing book that does not shy away from some explosive issues: suicide, abortion, rape, and inhumanities. It also provides a totally unique perspective of young women in the Israeli military: girl-women who follow a complicated guidebook of rules, have emotionally complex interactions with the Palestinians they encounter at checkpoints, and receive harsh awakenings. As one girl states, “I just understood that there are people who live or the fight; for the moments before you lose or win. People for whom this world is not enough; they want ice water in their veins, beauty at any cost, climbing out of ditches under gunfire, exploding necklaces of grenades…And then I knew: those fascinating people – I was never one of them.” Perhaps…but these girls are fascinating in their own right....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jul 02, 2012","Jul 25, 2012","Jul 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13274154-the-people-of-forever-are-not-afraid

He tackles gritty, heart-breaking, raw and painful themes with sheer lyricism. In short, his writing never fails to astound me.This – DROWN – is his debut collection and Ysrael, the first of the 10 stories in this collection, makes no bones about declaring that Junot Diaz will be a writer to watch. Yunior (the narrator) and his brother Rafa become obsessed about viewing the terribly mutilated face of a boy who keeps it hidden behind a mask. The grotesque face can be interpreted as a symbol of life in the Dominican Republic; Diaz, like Yunior, is determined to reveal that life. Yunior and Rafa along with their mother and absent father (who lives in America) reappear in other stories: Fiesta 1980, Aguantando, Negocios – the final story, which displays the father’s perspective as his life in America fails. Other stories utilize unnamed characters who could be any young man who is searching for identity and meaning in a world that’s stacked against them with poverty, drugs, violence, unfulfilled longing, and discrimination. These stories are rife with alienation and dislocation –painstakingly so. In the eponymous title story, another of the parade of unnamed young men – a drug-dealer – must cope with ambiguous sexual feelings towards his best friend along with his own all-pervasive sense of failure. As his mother sits beside him, dreaming of the man who betrayed her, this young man also deals with his feelings of betrayal and entrapment by his dead-end life.An overall bleakness is transfigured with jolts of incredible poetic insights.

You know, too, that at some point, Ms. Kingsolver will cross the line into authorial intrusion based on her passion for the subject she is writing on.But you keep coming back for more. At least, I do. There is something mesmerizing about a Barbara Kingsolver novel, and something refreshing about a writer who combines a solid scientific background with stunning prose.This book is entitled Flight Behavior, and for good reason. It opens with a young Appalachian woman – Dellarobia Turnbow – ready to take flight from her shotgun marriage and closed-in life with two young children. On her way up the mountain to engage in an affair, she views an astounding natural phenomenon that changes everything for her.The core of the novel focuses on that phenomenon,centering on the migratory patterns of the bright orange Monarch butterfly, usually viewed only in Mexico. The topic is climate change and Ms. Kingsolver slashes through the obtuse definitions with language anyone can understand. Dellarobia is paired thematically with a Harvard-educated scientist Ovid Byron, whose lifework is studying the butterflies. He says, “If you woke up one morning, Dellarobia, and one of your eyes had moved to the side of your head, how would you feel about that?” That, in effect, is the same as the butterflies migrating to Appalachia.There is much to love about this novel. Dellarobia is authentically portrayed: a woman who is confined in a life she has outgrown, complete with two very genuinely created toddlers and a best friend who is not similarly constrained. The duality of science and religion is also tackled. While Barbara Kingsolver makes no secret of how she feels about those who piously say, “Weather is the Lord’s business” while polluting our environment, she also concedes to the majesty and mystery of nature, culling in parallels from Job and Noah.Ultimately, Ms. Kingsolver leaves us with the most important question of all: “what was the use of saving a world that had no soul left in it. Continents without butterflies, seas without coral reef…What if all human effort amounted basically to saving a place for ourselves to park?” The interconnectedness of all nature’s creatures – and our true place in our own lives and in the lives of the universe – is a message that lives on in this reader’s mind long after the last page is closed....more",Notes are private!,1,113,1,"Jul 29, 2012","Aug 09, 2012","Jun 21, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13438524-flight-behavior

He focuses on a cross-section of residents and workers on a fictional and prestigious London treat including a well-heeled banker and his shopaholic wife and Hungarian nanny, an elderly widow dying of a brain tumor and her middle-aged daughter and alternative-arts grandson, a talented Senegalese young soccer player on the cusp of stardom, three Pakistani brothers with varying degrees of political involvement, a Polish builder, and a political refugee from Zimbabwe who is supporting herself on forged work permit.Each has his or her own ambivalent relationship with money. One reflects, “It was brash and horrible and vulgar, but also exciting and energetic and shameless and new…If the city was one huge shop window, she was on the outside on the pavement, looking in.” Indeed, “having a house in Pepys Road was like being in a casino in which you were guaranteed to be rich.” The haves and have-nots are clearly delineated and to muddy the waters, someone is sending creepy postcards to all of them, stating, “We want what you have.”Those of foreign origin – the Polish builder, the Zimbabwe refugee, the Hungarian nanny, the Pakistanis – appear to have a stronger moral compass than those for whom wealth is a given. They are the fiber of the story, a direct contrast to those who enjoy ease and comfort. This is, perhaps, my biggest gripe: the all-too-often stereotypical portrayals of the characters. Arabella, the shopaholic wife, has virtually no redeeming characteristics, for example. The Pakistanis – well, we know what’s going to happen to at least one of them because it is highly telegraphed.That being said, this is a good London saga, with interwoven characters who hold your attention.

It must have a strong sense of place wiA great mystery novel – Scandinavian or otherwise – must be more than just an intriguing page-turning mystery. It must have a strong sense of place with angst-driven characters capable of introspection and depth. The dialogue must be credible and plausible and the denouement must be believable yet powerful.So by these criteria, does Keeper of Lost Causes succeed? My answer is both yes. And no.Danish stateswoman Merete Lynggaard vanishes under mysterious circumstances on a ferry after receiving an enigmatic telegram. The Copenhagen police have long given up; the only potential witness was Merete’s younger brother, Uffe, who was brain-damaged in a childhood car accident that was inadvertently caused by Merete’s childish antics.The case is taken up again by the churlish Carl Morck – banished to Department Q, the cold-case unit – and tortured by survivor’s guilt after not drawing his gun quickly enough to protect his partners. He is assisted by a civilian, Hafez al-Assad, one of the more original characters: cagey, highly intuitive and intelligent, drawn to his prayer rug, strong coffee, and savory-smelling food.What they don’t know – but we readers do, almost right away – is that Merete is very much alive, caged in a bizarre hellhole by unknown assailants. Every year, on her birthday, she is asked: “Have you thought about this question? Why we’re keeping you in a cage like an animal? Why you have to be put through all of this?” When she comes up with a blank, the atmospheric pressure is raised…and raised…and raised again, each year.So, on the plus side, we have intriguing characters with Danish politics in the background (which appear to be as complicated and frustrating as some of our own). So what doesn’t work?The translation, for one. In too many places, the prose is clunky and over-the-top. Take this line, for example: “And the whole time I see you before me. You and your lovely, irresponsible eyes that annihilated everything I ever loved.” For another, the villains. I guessed the ending and the motive less than half-way through and I suspect many other readers will as well. The depravity and sadism of the villains is not tempered at any point with any mollifying characteristics. They were evil personified, which made me believe in them less; their psychosis would likely have been genetic and not event-driven.But perhaps most disturbing – and I admit, this is an individual reading preference – the torture aspect was anything but subtle. In a time when real torture is worse than anything we can imagine (the Argentinean Dirty Wars, the genocide in Rwanda and more), the torture must be an organic and necessary part of the plotting. I couldn’t help but feel that the torture in this book was largely for shock value.At the end of the day, I thought that Carl and particularly Assad were original characters that could carry over into sequels. I wish, though, that there were more subtlety and a better translation....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 09, 2012","Jun 14, 2012","Jun 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10822858-the-keeper-of-lost-causes

Any author It almost takes an act of courage to write about very rich characters these days – particularly when they’re not only rich but also vapid. Any author who tries runs the risk of having his or her characters labeled “unlikeable.”And indeed, these Tribeca neighbors – a sound engineer, a sculptor, a top chef and so on -- are not the most likeable characters in the world. In one of the stories, a group of friends twirls up “the best stoner munchie in the history of the world: pasta with caviar and truffles”, as one plaintively asks, “Something will (expletive) it up. The ozone layer or something. Something will ruin the fun.”Life does conspire to ruin the fun. A sound engineer bears an uncanny resemblance to a child molester whose face appears on a number of flyers. A memoirist is being pursued for fabricating stories. (He tries to explain, “Personal memoir had always been an impressionistic rather than factual genre.”) Affairs and accidents and betrayals occur and dreams are shattered occur over the course of one single school year. The headline of each story is a Tribeca address (such as 65 Hudson). And the writing is often strong and intriguing (“It had become a mounting disappointment to Brick that the woman he was having an affair with looked so much like his wife.”) As a reader, I wanted to see more linkage between the characters; they all stood alone and that may well be the point. But it would have been more satisfying had the individual stories been more closely connected.Interestingly, I read Triburbia directly after reading another book that focused on neighbors – Juliet in August – which delved deep into the hopes and disappointments of those in a small Canadian town.

So it’s no surprise that I reacted so positively to this debut book.Juliet is not a character (but it may as well be); it’s a small town in Saskatchewan filled with its own mythology and pathos. It’s peopled by individuals and families that intersect: an accidental rancher who inherited land from his much-older adoptive relatives; a couple with six children who are overwhelmed and facing bankruptcy; the henpecked banker who watches helplessly as their pregnant daughter is corralled into an unpromising marriage; and two middle-aged people (brother- and sister-in-law) who strive to communicate their growing love and dependence on each other.Dianne Warren expertly and confidently unearths their interior lives. Each character is alone but connected, longing for something more stable in their fragile interior and exterior landscape. About one character walking near the dunes, she writes“…she saw patterns as intricate and complicated as the veins in an insect’s wings.” The same could be said about what lies inside.In a quiet and assured tone, Ms. Warren describes a coterie of characters who only want to believe in their own abilities to change and in a future that is constantly under threat by lack of rain, shifting sands, and economic upheavals.For some readers – those who like action-based plots – this gentle portrayal of rural townspeople may not be enough. Yet these portraits are so pitch-perfect that I found myself missing them during the times I was not actively reading and aching for their trials. If you liked Olive Kitteridge, Plainsong, Emily Alone or perhaps some of the works of Elizabeth Hay, chances are, you will enjoy this book as much as I did.

One day he receives a letter from an old friend, a solitary woman named Queenie, revealing that she is in hospice and dying of cancer. He writes her back, goes outdoors to post the letter and impulsively, just keeps on walking. His goal is to walk hundreds of miles in his yacht shoes to Queenie’s side; by doing the seemingly impossible, he hopes to give her the strength to stay alive, at least until he gets there.Along the way, Harold meets many other damaged and wistful individuals, from a plain woman in a gas station who gives him hope to a female Slovakian doctor who is forced to clean houses to survive. And he learns “the inhumane effort to be normal, and a part of things that appeared both easy and everyday.” As he walks on – as he walks away from himself, or at least, the person he used to be – he gains clarity of what his life was and is meant to be.“It must be the same all over England,” Harold reflects. “ People were buying milk, or filling their cars with petrol, or even posting letters. And what no one else knew was the appalling weight of the thing they were carrying inside.”The theme of a pilgrimage – a journey of walking away from oneself to find oneself – has certainly been tackled before. Anne Tyler’s excellent Ladder of Years is one book that instantly comes to mind. What makes Rachel Joyce’s book unique is the care she takes to establish Harold and his estranged wife, Maureen, as complex characters coping with the twin emotions of suppressed grief and enduring love. We know early on that there have been problems with their son and that it has taken a toll on their marriage.There are times when the message is too trumpeted; for example, “I admit it’s an awfully long way to Berwick. I admit I am wearing the wrong clothes. And I also admit I have not the training or the physique, for my walk. I can’t explain why I think I can get there, when all the odds are against it. But I do.” A latter connection with a group of people who want to sponge off the publicity Harold begins receiving is the one misstep; they are portrayed too broadly.Yet still, at its core, this is a journey that doubles as a love story. There’s some uncommonly powerful and beautiful insights and the pilgrimage serves as an affirmation for humankind. “When I tell people what I’m doing, they seem to understand. They look at their own lives and they want me to get there.” We, the book’s readers, also understand. We root for Harold and want him to overcome his impossible odds… because by doing so, he reaffirms our own ability to create turnarounds in our lives. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 28, 2012","May 31, 2012","May 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13227454-the-unlikely-pilgrimage-of-harold-fry

He and his fellow Bravo Squad members decimated an insurgency – caught on film by an embedded Fox News crew -- and became overnight sensations in a nation starved for good news about Iraq. They are brought home for a media-intensive “Victory Tour” – in cities that happen to lie in an electoral swing state -- to reinvigorate support for the war. We meet them at the end of that tour, on a rainy Thanksgiving, hosted by America’s Team, The Dallas Cowboys.They are, in more ways than one, anonymous to an American public; their reinvented names are meant to erase their identity (Major Mac, Mango, Lodes, Billy, etc.) In the fabled Texas Stadium, their faces are interspersed on a JumboTron screen with ads for Chevy cars and Cowboy-brand toaster ovens and high-capacity ice-makers. Surrounded by so-called patriots, Billy and his friends are bombarded with words stripped of meaning: “rerrRist, currj, freedom, nina leven, Bush, values, support.” Billy reflects: “They hate our freedoms? Yo, they hate our actual guts! Billy suspects his fellow Americans secretly know better, but something in the land is stuck on teenage drama, on extravagant theatrics of ravaged innocence and soothing mud wallows of self-justifying pity.”The people that surround him are insatiably expecting Billy to impart wisdom in sound bites. Amid a world of plenty, multi-millionaires who have never put themselves in harm’s way let loose a stream of platitudes but Billy “truly envies these people, the luxury of terror as a talking point…” At another point, he reflects, “Never do Americans sound so much like a bunch of drunks as when they are celebrating at the end of their national anthem.”Nineteen-year-old Billy – still a virgin, with major lust going on for a Cowboys cheerleader who believes that cheerleading is a “spiritual calling” – has the necessary replies to inane questions down pat. He is as real as he can be, as American as he can be.And in this way, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk –marketed as a satire and blurbed as a new Catch-22 – is anything but. There is nothing surreal about it; in fact, it is an entirely apt portrayal of the times we live in. I thought this book was absolutely brilliant – well-crafted, filled with insight and wisdom, and heart-wrenching.

The vacation home is spotless and lovely, but traces of an active sex life are everywhere: a sex swing, nude photographs, and a book with a particularly erotic title. Worse, the town is shadier and not quite the way Yvonne remembers it. She also begins getting visits from the vacation home owner’s estranged wife Ozlem, who fills her with tales of her husband’s unfaithfulness and abuse…and tales of her own shaky morals.There is just one respite for Yvonne: a young 10-year-old Turkish boy – a shell collector, who metaphorically collects beautiful fossils, not unlike Yvonne herself. He awakens feelings of protectiveness in Yvonne and harkens her back to a more innocent time when her twins were young. Until tragedy strikes again…There is strong writing on display here. Yvonne – who relies on the company of strangers – finds out that strangers can hurt. There’s a searing flashback to leaving her husband’s memorial service only to find a note room a stranger instructing her to be “less selfish” because of her poor parking job. Time after time, people Yvonne meets end up hurting her – inadvertently and advertently. As a waiter who is witness to her budding friendship with Ahmed says, “Not all of us are so eager to be your friend.”The interweaving of grief, lies, and loss, and redemption is explored in a subtle yet satisfying manner, as Yvonne goes on her Joseph Campbell-style “heroine’s journey” to gain a truer sense of self and more honest memories. The metaphors can sometimes get too heavy-handed: an owl that appears in her room, for example, or entering into a cave and then not being able to find a path. And the ending is a tad too rushed and pat and, in this reader’s opinion, is the weakest part of the book.Yet despite these flaws, the Lovers is still a fascinating and atmospheric exploration into how we go away (sometimes even from our inner core) to find ourselves once again.

It is not meant to be. And that statement, in itself, is a testimony to its power.Debut author Edgardo David HolzmMalena is not an easy book to read. It is not meant to be. And that statement, in itself, is a testimony to its power.Debut author Edgardo David Holzman pens the book that he was born to write – a heartbreaking tale of unspeakable crimes-upon-humanity that takes place during the Argentina Dirty Wars in the late 1970s. This war against its own people was carried out with full complicity of the police, the courts, and some of the highest levels of the Catholic Church. The United States not only turned its back, it acquiesed. In fact, many of the torturers use the same techniques that were learned at the U.S. School of Assassins. The fact that this is all true is chilling.In many ways, the Dirty Wars mirror the very worst of the historical genocides: books are burned, innocent people disappear and are savagely tortured in the most unimaginable ways, the legal establishment and court system turn a jaded and blinded eye, babes are ripped from their mothers and are given to the government faithful, and property is transferred even after huge ransoms are paid. No Argentinean is safe if he or she is remotely suspected of not supporting the military government. And Jews, who comprise only one percent of the population, represent ten percent of the victims, in the worst slaughter since the Holocaust.Mr. Holzman – a human rights attorney and one-time interpreter who had access to the historical record behind Argentina’s 1975-1983 military dictatorship – writes with the ring of authenticity and his recounting, while painful, is also page-turning. His story revolves around a triangle: Kevin Solorzano, known as Solo, an American interpreter who travels “back home” with the OAS in the era of the Carter Administration. The story is interwoven with that of Diego Fioravanti, an Argentine army captain who has had a stomach full of the evilness that has engulfed his government and is striving to break free from the army. Both are in love with the same woman: Ines, who once loved Solo and now loves Diego.The most memorable portrayals are Solo and Diego. A fault of the novel is its reliance on certain contrivances, which tie in Solo’s personal and professional lives, defying coincidence. Although this would normally turn me off, the novel was so gripping and courageous that it was hard not to be swept into his larger messages and overall plotting.Mr. Holtzman says, “Fiction, paradoxically, is the closest thing we have to real life. It seeks to stir the heart as well as the head. It’s where readers can inhabit characters, feel what those characters feel, experience their world. My hope is that people who never look at a human rights report will nevertheless read Malena.” Indeed, this reader has been transformed through reading Malena and I suspect many others will as well.I received this book in exchange for an honest . I must add that when I first opened it, I did not anticipate that an unknown debut writer and a small and emerging press (Nortia Press) to publish a book with this kind of haunting power. If this is any example of what Nortia Press is intending to publish, it’s a reason for literary readers to rejoice....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 16, 2012","May 19, 2012","May 16, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13237074-malena

Not a word is wasted and nothing is dumbed down: it is, in turns, complex and subtle, psychologically astute, unsettling, and controlled.The language can only be described as spare: taut, minimalistic, precise. Take the opening lines: “It was an ordinary dark winter morning, and snow was still falling. No window in the village showed a light.” In a mere two sentences, Tove Jansson sets up an entire mood and introduces a sense of danger.The two key characters are “the wolf”, Katri Kling, a yellow-eyed, wolfish young woman who stands on the outskirts of her Finnish village due to her bluntness and lack of social amenities. Katri cares for her gentle and slow-witted brother, Mats, and a nameless dog who obeys her every command. She revels in her superiority to others: “My dog and I despise them. We’re hidden in our own secret life, concealed in our own innermost wilderness.”Her opponent – and that is what she becomes – is Anna Aemalin, an illustrator of children’s books, who has achieved a degree of fame with her charming bunnies. At first meeting, she is trusting, truthful, and, like Katri, very solitary. As Katri gains her trust – and breaks down her sense of security – many themes come into play. Among them: “How many different truths are there, and what justifies them? What a person believes? What a person accomplishes? Self-deception? Is it only the result that counts?” Is it indeed safe and reassuring to believe in only one thing? And ultimately…who is the wolf and who is the rabbit?As readers, we stand by rapt as we watch the caustic and subtle effects of deception on innocence and integrity. The “prize” may be nothing less than personal identity.

He reaches out to his estranged son Noah, who travels to Olaf’s Northern Minnesota cabin – not to reconcile but through a sense of duty. Noah has long held resentments about his father’s drinking and his inability to hold the family together after the tragedy.Peter Geye might have turned this into a cover-up saga, where long-time secrets of what happened on that tragic night are suddenly unveiled. But thankfully, Safe from the Sea is not that kind of book. As Olaf begins to narrate that horrific story (“We had the inferno blazing beneath us, the snow squall suffocating us, seas still washing the deck”), it becomes evident that people can do everything right and life can still go wrong. Sometimes, there just aren’t any answers.“The crew? They were just a bunch of anybodies,” Olaf tells his son. Noah counters: “Isn’t it more fantastic to think of the guys who died as little bit heroic, as swashbuckling sailors? As something more than a bunch of yokels from Great Lakes port towns?” Olaf answers, “It’s real life. In real lie, there’re boys from port towns.”As Noah comes to grip that “the old man’s crew of nobodies could take precedence over his mother and sister and himself” – how surviving can often mean “going under” again and again – he and Olaf begin to understand and appreciate each other for the first time. Peter Geye obviously knows the Northern Minnesota landscape, which comes alive every bit as much as his characters. Olaf’s dialogue and characteristics ring authentic. And Noah – a name associated with the biblical pre-flood patriarch who survived the flood – has spent his adult life procuring and selling ancient maps as a career.

At the startRoger King’s culture has always been sensible, secular, scientific, with a deep belief in the natural dominion of mind over circumstance. At the start of his courageous autobiographical novel, he’s about to embark on a new life: teaching at a college in Spokane, reconnecting with a girlfriend, crossing the ocean from Britain to get reacquainted with America once again.Until he experiences a fever and a bout of dizziness at the gym.The eventual diagnosis: myalgic encephalopathy, commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. It’s a little-known immune disease that incapacitates him, creates brain fog, and threatens to knock him low unless he carefully monitors his energy. Others don’t understand it; he is constantly subject to remarks like, “I think people who are sick for a a long time want to be sick.” Or: “Don’t you think it’s all in your head?” It’s a disease that engenders frustration and disbelief – not only in others, but in Roger King himself.Roger King takes his readers up front and personal with the devastating effects of myalgic encephalopathy. I will quote one paragraph at length: “Out of necessity, I take the illness for my company, something with its own intelligence. It has its personality and I have minr. As I try to train it, it sets about training me. If I walk too far or fast, it punishes me. If I attempt work, it makes my nervous system buzz and fizz with flaring short circuits. It wants me quiet and it wants me flat, and I would do well to obey. It wants slowness and routine. Excitement and ambition anger it. It is appalled by spontaneity, hates decisions, refuses responsibility. It tells me to be quiet and satisfied, it has no truck with upset…Powerful stuff! But fatigue is only one part of this equation. The other part is love. Roger King is a magnet for women who have had damaged lives, women who have been emotionally and/or physically abused. His enforced quietness attract them, including his love interest Mary, and her young daughter Zoe. There is a part of Mr. King that withdraws or sabotages love, and he is candid enough to display that.As the witness to hurts and hopes – as the nurturer of a irrepressible dog named Arthur – and as a seeker of his own truth, Roger King’s tone shifts from poignancy to irony to subtle humor. He also serves as a commentator on America’s broken health care and insurance system, and the irrationality of excluding those who need it most – potentially sick people – from health insurance coverage because it is “rational business practice.” We also meet several of his well-meaning (and not so well-meaning) doctors, who are baffled with his condition.This is a brave book, an intensely personal book, and one that is, in turns, surprising and original.

That leaves their two sons, Leo and Alexander (simply called “Popper”), the melancholy anti-hero who is the key to must sort out the shambles of family history, including his own.The three generations (and a fourth to come) are interwoven in short, fractured chapters – sometimes mere paragraphs – to simulate the fracturing of the family. We meet Seymour mostly through his letters, dated in the mid-1940s, which are very concise, optimistic, needy…and blind. As one generation moves into the next, the introspection becomes more pronounced.So what, in the end, is this book about? It’s about Chicago, for sure, and the alternate reality of life in north shore Highland Park. It’s about generational shift from World War II to the turbulent 1960s and 1970s, to the end-of-century years. It’s about distinctive Chicago politics (although Michael Dukakis and Walter Mondale make cameo appearances), and about what we love and what shames us.

So it was interesting that the one book that sprung to mind after closing the pages of completing Blooms of Darkness was Cervantes’ Don Quixote. The parallels between the two abound. Don Quixote—in the traditions of knights-errant of old – finds a love whom he names Dulcinea…or “sweetness.” She is not rich or famous or beautiful or well-born, but to him, she is his queen and his lady. She begins as someone with little self-worth but by the end, she blooms under Don Quixote’s love.In Blooms of Darkness, the person who blooms is Mariana, who works in a brothel that services German occupiers. She is entrusted with the care of Hugo – a pre-teen – by his mother, an old school friend, when the Jews are forced to go into hiding.Although the story is Hugo’s, the spotlight often shines on Mariana, a contradiction of piousness and looseness, self-centerness and unselfishness. Hidden in Mariana’s closet – literally and figuratively – Hugo craves her attention and views her as his personal Dulcinea. The majority of the novel is set within her bedroom…and in his imagination.Aharon Appelfeld – a 78-year-old Israeli writer – and his excellent translator Jeffrey M. Green – write the entire book in the present; the implication is that the present is the only time that exists, since the past and the future have been obliterated. The tone is understated and controlled, taut and haunting. Gradually, he creates a grafting of his two key characters – Hugo and Mariana. As a mocking townswoman says: “Whores and Jews are always persecuted. There’s nothing to be done.” Indeed, as life spirals downward for both Hugo and Mariana – as the world looks on without pity and defines each of them as less than human – the two look to each other for sustenance and love.At times, as a reader, I hoped for a little less reticence; still, there was no time where I didn’t admire and respect what Mr. Appelfeld was so intelligently creating. The universal themes of loss and loneliness are explored here, along with the optimism of the differences that one person can make in the life of another.

""Silence introduced in a society that worships noise is like the moon exposing the night.""

The goal is to reconnect after the death of Angela and Richard’s mother.What elevates this book above the standard dysfunctional family novel is a surprisingly amount of insight and an innovative narrative thread. It is, quite frankly, a bit confusing in the first 50 pages or so; points of view change frequently, characters jolt against each other to take their turn in the spotlight, and a sort of cacophony results. At first, I was fearful that the innovative format would overshadow the plot, themes, and character development.But as the “noise” clears, the composition takes the shape of a symphony, hitting all the right notes of a harmonious work that focuses on this theme: “All those presumptions you carry with you your while life about what a family should be. What a husband should be. What a father should be.” And, needless to say, what a mother and daughter should be as well.Gradually, we begin to know these characters and their private aches and pains. Angela is haunted by the death of her firstborn daughter on the eve of what would have been her 18th birthday. Her surviving daughter, Daisy, is involved with an unfeeling Christian sect, which is keeping her from discovering the truth of who she really is. Richard and Louisa are vying to understand each other and create more intimacy. And Angela and Richard? Like many “adult children”, both harbor resentments from the past.

His story – of Zoe, Kate and Jack, three sprint cyclists nearing the end of their careers who are driven to “go for the gold” – is tightly plotted with some tense plot-twists, both in and outside of the velodrome.

Sophie unselfishly battles the effects of chemo and tries hard to protect her parents from her fears, channeling them into an imaginative foray into Star Wars and the Jedi force. All well and good, but at times, the dialogue and the relationships seem a little false, including a decision made by a key character at a vital moment…or the suggestion that a particularly zealous Olympic contender doesn’t understand the implications of a pertinent rule about trial victory.

Suffice to say I’ve just discovered a new author who will definitely be explored.WANTING falls under the category that is now known as “faction” – fiction based on actual events. Three stories are interwoven: Sir John Franklin – the polar explorer who disappeared while attempting to find the Northwest Passage and his wife Lady Jane, in flashbacks to when they governed the penal colony of what is now Tasmania. Charles Dickens, who practically invented Christmas, the author – and actor – extraordinaire. And finally Mathinna, an enticing aboriginal girl, who is adopted by the Franklins in an attempt to “civilize” her.However, it would be a mistake to focus on the veracity of what is divulged about any of these real-life personages. In an author’s note, Mr. Flanagan states that only the barest details are known about Mathinna’s life and some of his more salacious additions are mere speculation. No, this is not an historical book, but instead, one that fulfills what its title is about: wanting. In a multitude of ways, it is a reckoning of “how we say no to love.” Lady Jane seems cold and calculating but crack the veneer and we view her misguided and horribly misplaced yearning to mother the young orphan girl. Middle-aged Charles Dickens – trapped in a stifling marriage – yearns to find love again and does so with the young actress Ellen Ternan, who indeed fulfilled that role in real life. And Mathinna? All she wants is to feel the earth under her bare toes and go back to an authentic time. The “wanting” takes a more universal scope as Mr. Flanagan also addresses the macrocosm: the connection between colony and home territory (Van Diemen’s Land, as Tasmania used to be called). In this, the dominant power to subjugate and civilize; the home territory’s people simply want to “come home.” It is ultimately about connection. As Dickens stages a play called The Frozen Deep – an astounding success in real life – about the Arctic explorer Franklin’s supposed death, he understands that the play is truly about his own life entrapment. “We have in our lives only a few good moments,” Dickens says to Ellen Ternan. “A moment of joy and wonder with another. Some might say beauty or transcendence.”Often heartbreaking – Mathinna’s descent, while likely not historically accurate, will create tears in even the staunchest reader – this novel is incredibly crafted. Written lyrically, with brio and its own sense of transcendence, this meditation on desire can best be summed up by Dickens himself “He a man who has spent a life believing that giving in to desire was the mark of a savage, realized he could no longer deny wanting.” Nor, it appears, can any of us....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 21, 2012","Apr 23, 2012","Apr 21, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5121221-wanting

So goes the chaos theory – a proposition that apparently random Somewhere in the Amazon, a butterfly flaps its wings and provokes a tornado in Texas. So goes the chaos theory – a proposition that apparently random phenomena have underlying order. It is the premise of Penelope Lively’s thoroughly engaging and delightful new book, where at least seven lives are derailed one day in mid-April.It all begins when Charlotte Rainsford – a 76-year-old woman – is accosted by an unknown teenage thief on the streets of London and breaks her hip. That one random event gives way to a slew of other related events: Charlotte must recuperate at the home of her daughter and son-in-law, Rose and Gerry. Bored out of her mind, she takes on an adult student – Anton, a European immigrant who is learning the English language – who fascinates Rose in a way that hasn’t happened in years.And, since Rose must tend to her mother, she cannot go to Manchester with her boss, an ancient historian named Henry, who takes his niece Marion instead. It’s during that trip that Marion meets a shyster and, at the same time, is forced to start reconsidering her affair with the very-married Jeremy, whose wife Stella finds out about the affair, and… well, the “chaos theory” goes on and on.None of this is particularly innovative but it’s done so exceedingly well and with such aplomb and good humor that the reader cannot help but be carried along. As the historian Henry notes, “Progress is forever skewed by circumstance – the unforeseen event, an untimely death, the unpredicted circumstance, and the course of history would be one of seamless advance.” History and life are,the author suggests, subject to interpretation and random fate.I cannot help but end this  by quoting Ms. Lively’s key character, Charlotte, on her love of reading. “She has read not just for distraction, sustenance, to pass the time, but she has read in a state of primal innocence, reading for enlightenment, for instruction, even. She has read to discover what it is to be good or bad; she has read to find out if things are the same for others as they are for her – then, discovering frequently they are not, she has read to find out what it is that other people experience that she is missing.” I have read Once We Belong for many of these same reasons – and I’ve been rewarded....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 19, 2012","Apr 20, 2012","Apr 19, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11797374-how-it-all-began

Set at the turn of the twentieth century, the book initially focuses on a solitary man named Talmadge: a man who nurtures apples, apricots, and plums from the land and mourns the death of his mother and disappearance of his sister who vanished with barely a trace. His life is very predictable until one day, two barefoot, filthy, and visibly pregnant teenage sisters appear.The description of the runaways – and Talmadge’s steady attempt to earn their trust – is, in a word, mesmerizing. I rescued an abused dog a couple of years ago, and I couldn’t help but make the comparison: the girls are wild and feral and untrusting and gradually creep closer and closer to the sustenance and humanity that Talmadge offers. But soon, an event that is out of Talmadge’s control take a dark turn.Talmadge “had moved slowly all his life. He was used to seeing things drawn out by themselves, by temperature and light, not by harsh action. But this was something different. This was how people lived, now.” The rest of the book deals with the aftermath of that event: Talmadge’s striving to preserve and support his nontraditional family including an extraordinary daughter of one of the sisters. There is a distinctive narrative voice and pacing here that mirrors nature itself: at first, it feels like you are running the perilous rapids as the characters test themselves against the maelstrom of danger. It is literally impossible to tear away. Then, the tone shifts and it’s almost as if you’re meandering down clear and calm waters; nothing much happens except for the passage of time and internal growth. And then, you’re thrust again into the swirling waters.That is a mixed metaphor, of course. At its core, the book is about reaping what you sow, about the stalwartness of the land as the capricious inhabitants struggle to make sense of life, about picking and preparing and harvesting the seeds that you plant, and perhaps most rewardingly, about the goodness of one man in the face of a sometimes non-caring world. It is also about how the land nurtures us every bit as much as we nurture it; every character is shaped in some way by the physical landscape. And if, from time to time, the characters seem inconsequential, it is because they are mere players on its stage.

There are nearly three dozen stories that span just 188 pages, yet many are simply brilliant.The eponymous and first story starts with a directive: “Tell me a story.” Under gunpoint, the narrator – Etgar – is ordered to make up a story. He is interrupted early on: “That’s not a story…That’s an eyewitness report. It’s exactly what’s happening here and now. Exactly what we’re trying to run away from. Don’t you go and dump reality on us like a garbage truck. Use your imagination, man, create, invent, take it all the way.”I quoted that passage at length because it’s really the raison d’etre of the collection. Etgar, an Israeli writer, leaves the politics and the moral quandaries to others such as David Grossman, Amos Oz and Nathan Englander. His stories focus on the escape from reality through stories that stretch and define us.Some – as would be the case with any collection – are better than others. I’ll call out a few: Lieland, where the subjects of lies become real, is one of my favorites. The protagonist, Robbie, learns that his lies live and thrive in another dimension and he meets his “lies come alive” simply by turning a handle.Teamwork, another fine story, starts like this: “My son wants me to kill her. He’s still young and doesn’t express this perfectly yet, but I know exactly what he’s after.” The “her” refers to his maternal grandmother; he is the product of divorce and a brutal plan is soon imagined by his obsequious father. Or take another story: Unzipping; in it, the narrator finds a small zipper under her lover’s tongue; when she pulls it, he opens up “like an oyster” with a second man revealed. One more: Mourner’s Meal. a very recent widow opens up her failing restaurant the morning after his funeral, and gains connection with a group of strangers.Not all the stories succeed as well; it makes me wish there were a way I could rate this a 4.5. But the ones that DO shine are so luminous that it is hard for me not to rate upward. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Apr 15, 2012","Apr 17, 2012","Apr 15, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8441779

This is a character-driven story and we’ve met iterations of these characters before – in Zoe Heller’s The Believers, in Jennifer Vanderbes’s Strangers at the Feast, Eleanor Brown’s The Weird Sisters, and in others that center upon a disparate family of adults coming together after months or years apart.Some of the scenes will resonate with those who navigate the thorny side of family relationships – the sister who arrives late, the tense afternoon of driving to mom and dad’s with a sibling whose very presence conjures up family history, the stomping out in the midst of a family game of charades.But ultimately, the family members take on somewhat tired roles that define them rather than illuminate them. Noelle – the youngest daughter – is a free spirit, a libertine, who goes way to the other side, embracing Orthodox Judaism. In the ultimate control scene, she refuses to eat anything in her parents’ house, after they’ve twisted themselves into knots making sure everything was Kosher for her. Cassandra is facing the big 4-0, desperate to conceive a child after years of forestalling the possibility of motherhood. Lily has lived with her brilliant significant other for years does not plan to marry; she harbors resentments against her siblings. And finally, Marilyn and David, the parents, are planning a separation after the death of their grown married son, a journalist who was killed during the Iraq War.I felt the themes were ultimately familiar, not much of a stretch from this author’s first book, Matrimony.

It tells an apocalyptic and ancient tale but its topic is fresh and timely. It is told without any pretensions yet it’s lyrical and bracing. It focuses on the microcosm of a family under pressure yet its theme is universal and its messages integrate age-old mythologies.As the book opens, China – the pure white pit bull – is turning on herself, trying to eat her paws. The winds of Hurricane Katrina are gathering force. And the narrator, a young precocious and sensitive teenager named Esch, is realizing that she is pregnant. These forces and situations add up to classic tragedy, but Jesmyn Ward has other things in mind. Esch and her brothers – Skeetah, whose life and passions revolve around his prized dog and her puppies…Randall, whose dream is to get a basketball camp scholarship…and Junior, the youngest – are a unit who support each other.As Katrina closes in…as the internal storms play out…we view a world that is steeped with violence and tenderness. Nothing is as expected. Let me interject that I share my home with two dogs and every cell of my body abhors pit bull fighting. Yet when the inevitable scene arrived, it shattered every single one of my expectations. Skeetah massages and speaks to China like a lover; his rival coaches Kilo, the other dog, calling him “son.” Some of it is written in love language: “China flings her head back into the air as if eating oxygen, gaining strength, and burns back down to Kilo and takes his neck in her teeth. She bears down, curling to him, a loving flame, and licks.” This is a book that dares you to confront yourself at an elemental level.As an added level, Jesmyn Ward weaves in the Medea and Jason story and other Greek myths. Esch is young in years, but old in wisdom: she already knows that “There is never a meeting in the middle. There is only a body in the ditch, and one person walking toward or away from it.” While she is tethered to earth – her father’s hands are “like gravel”, her brother’s blood “smells like wet hot earth”, her mind is unleashed and floats to the sky.The tenderness – yes, tenderness! – between Skeetah and China, the bond between China and Esch (“China will bark and call me sister. In the star-suffocated sky, there is a waiting silence”), and the desperation and love of this family elevates it far beyond most other contemporary books I have read.

There’s always a balancing act: how much “play” to give each of the many characters, what events to spotlight, how to believably depict the changing of time.Peter Behrens, fortunately, is a word craftsman and, in elegant and cinematic language, captures the agony and the ecstasy, the fortune of loss of the O’Brien family. We meet eventual patriarch Joe O’Brien early on, in Pontiac County, Quebec. His father has died at war, his mother is on her deathbed, and a lecherous and drunken stepfather torments his sisters. With the assistance of a priest, three of the five siblings are claimed and cloistered by the church. One brother, Grattan, moves to California; on a visit there, Joe meets his wife Iseult, a strong-willed and independent woman with her own gritty back-story.Moving seamlessly between Canada and Venice Beach, California, from 1880 to two world wars to right before Kennedy’s emergence, we travel with the author from Santa Barbara to coastal Maine to Montreal, as children and then grandchildren arrive on the scene. We explore the raw and often rocky marriage of Joe and Iseult – its separation, longing, desires, and coldness and its temptations from outside forces. To get more precise about the developments that follow would be to create spoilers. Suffice to say that Behrens – who previously wrote screenplays in California – is a master at rich descriptions, lyrical rhythms, and clean, vibrant sentences.But it is precisely this exactitude that left me feeling unsatisfied. I can easily see The O’Briens become a compulsively-watch ministry; it’s filled with historical relevance, often bigger-than-life characters, and sheer human emotion. I often felt, though, that the characters and dialogue were too scripted. Here, for example, is Joe speaking to Iseult during one marital crisis: “I want to get away, Iseult. The two of us. I was thinking we might go back up to those mountains. We left some happiness up there, Iseult, did we not?” Or another, between the two brothers: “Perhaps I’m one of the fianna…Old Irish for the warrior race. You can’t put a square peg in a round hole. The fact is, there’s a war on and I’m going back across to take up the fight.”Despite often searing images, I tend to default to authentic characters and dialogue.

The insights into a unique generation of women who grew up with one set of expectations and then lived through a societal bait-and-switch is often pitch perfect. For those who are not Boomers, the book is an excellent guide to the road ahead. About marriage: “I was never one of those women who tell you that their spouse is their best friend, that they are always on the same page. I feel like you’re ahead of the game if you’re even in the same book.”About the need for girlfriends: “Real friends offer both hard truths and soft landings and realize that it’s sometimes more important to be nice than to be honest.”About aging: “A smile is nature’s face-lift, I like to say brightly, now that everything is sliding south.”About truths: “There are a few eternal verities, and many of them are rock songs: love is often all you need, you cant always get what you want, and the new boss is indeed the same as the old boss.”About mortality: “It’s not only death that terrifies us when we think about passing through the decades that come next. Maybe it’s not even mainly death. It’s the diminution of choices.”With a few well-chosen words, Anna Quindlen nails what many of us are feeling and thinking.

It’s his most ambitious work so far…far more ambitious than his very good Financial Life of Poets.The theme: impossible goals and what we do to reach them. Most of the key characters meet at an Italian beach near the cold Liguarian Sea in Italy at a pensione called The Hotel Adequate View at the time when the movie Cleopatra is being filmed. They will end up at an equally unlikely destination of Sandpoint, Idaho, many decades later, but first, there is a stop at a Hollywood movie studio back lot.The cast of characters include the young Italian innkeeper who dreams of turning his rocky cliff into the newest desirable tourist destination; the slender blonde American starlet who shows up at his pensione; an overly Botoxed-and-lifted cynical film producer; his attractive young assistant who is starting to believe that life must hold more for her; and others who will later appear. In his or her own way, none of them is willing to settle for the ordinary; each has his or her own vision of making a dream come true.Into this mix is added Richard Burton – yes, THE Richard Burton – with a surprisingly important fictional role. He looms larger than life, his foibles (drinking and womanizing) readily on display. This is NOT Dick Jenkins, the real flesh-and-blood man (Burton’s birth name); it’s the superstar we all believe we “know” from the tabloids.If there’s a flaw, it’s one of the major characters who shows up in the second half (no spoilers); the portrait seems too derivative. The book is also not for anyone who prefers linear progressions. This one swings back and forth between past and future, various character perspectives, and is punctuated with snippets from memoirs, screen pitches, and the first chapter of one character’s book. The ending may feel rushed to some; actually, I believe it’s quite intentional to show the compression of time and the integration of the characters. Ultimately, it’s a hopeful book about flawed, ordinary people who somehow find their way to a type of redemption. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,Apr 2012,"Apr 05, 2012","Apr 01, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11447921-beautiful-ruins

Right from the start, he grabs the reader’s attention: “I’m not a bad guy. I know how that sounds – defensive, unscrupulous – but it’s true. I’m like everyone else – weak, full of mistakes, but basically good.”By the end of the book, the reader is inclined to agree. Yunior is pitiful but never deigns to be self-pitying. He is highly sexually charged but impotent in emotional consistency. He is incredibly self-aware yet at the end of the day, always falls victim to his “lying cheater’s heart.”Take this passage, when Yunior’s girlfriend reads his journal and finds visible proof of his cheating: “Instead of lowering your head and copping to it like a man, you pick up the journal as one might hold a baby’s beshatted diaper, as one might pinch a recently benutted condom. You glance at the offending passages. Then you look at her and smile a smile your dissembling face will remember until he day you die. Baby, you say, baby, this is part of my novel.

There are more curves than a rollercoaster and the plot never neatly goes where you think it’s heading. So it’s important to  gingerly, without giving spoilers.Suffice to say this: Gone Girl is the most mature and compelling of Gillian Flynn’s works so far. Through this book, she elevates herself from somewhat superior suspense writing to prose that is steeped in psychodynamics and onrushing tension.Parts of it are downright brilliant. The protagonists are Amy Elliott Dunne – the prototype for the Amazing Amy child book series – and her husband of five years, Nick Dunne. They are the perfect couple, attractive, charming, clever, and in love. And then Amy goes missing.The toxicity of their marriage – and how they complete each other in the ugliest possible way – is only gradually revealed. Just when you think you “get it”, you find out that you don’t, not really. The narrative goes back and forth from Amy’s oh-so-happy diary entries to Nick’s evasiveness. But what is true and what is lies? The reader is soon sucked into their toxic game and the suspense kept me turning pages late into the night.Gillian Flynn rounds out this danse-a-deux with some incredibly realistic police officers, a Nancy Grace clone, and a celebrity lawyer named Tanner. She has much to say bout the twenty-four-hour news cycle and media vultures, the cultural messages that women are subjected to (“bleed-and-clean”), and the biases we harbor after watching too much CSI and Law And Order. The ending may be too contrived for some. It was for me. There will likely be discussion about whether it works or not. As a result, the book fell into the 4.5 category and it was my choice whether to bump the rating up or down. ...more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,"Mar 30, 2012",Apr 2012,"Mar 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8442457-gone-girl

In fact, the last time I went to a Cubs game at Wrigley Field, I showed up with a novel in hand, which I read through most of the game (much to the chagrin of my husband).So for me to like – really like! – a baseball book says a whole lot. It says that Joseph Schuster has a great voice and a wonderful story to tell. And baseball is only a backdrop; in many ways, this story is about life itself and how sometimes, our lifelong dreams keep us from really living.Edward Everett Yates (“double E”) is a dreamer; some might call him a Peter Pan character. The sport has taken a hold of him and he hangs on to it for dear life, creating emotional havoc as he woos – and then jilts – two women of real substance. His lack of emotional regard should have been enough to turn him into a very unsympathetic character; however, Mr. Schuster redeems him by portraying him as a man caught in the grip of an addictive love of a game, despite his best intentions.We view Edward Everett in the mid-70s, when he really has a chance to recognize his dream. But the title is, after all, The Might-Have-Been, so it’s no surprise that he is sidelined just as he’s poised to make it big. The next two-thirds of the book catch up with Edward Everett when he’s 60 years old and toiling away as the bit manager of a so-so team in one of the lower rungs of the minor league. Like the Robert Frost poem The Road Not Taken, Edward Everett often finds himself on the crossroads, where one road can lead to love, money and opportunity, and the other to the fulfillment of a lifelong dream…a boy’s dream. As his friends and past girlfriends move on and “get a life”, EE realizes “they had seen the open door to the world outside the locker room as an invitation and not banishment; baseball was just an interesting visa stamp in the passport of their lives, while he had gotten stuck at the border, unable to cross.”At times during the second half of this book, Mr. Schuster gets more detailed about the game itself; he was a journalist who covered sports. Those who are intrigued by the game will find those passages to resonate with authenticity; others, like me, who are not huge baseball fans may get a little bogged down. Despite that “flaw” (definitely in the eyes of the beholder), this is a stunning debut, which has much to say about hanging on to a quixotic dream and hanging into the game long after it’s even warranted. I should add that Mr. Schuster excels in writing crisp, believable dialogue and creating multi-dimensional characters.

I expect a work that’s rich in character and brimming with the realities of a woman who leaves her native land at the height of the 9/11 terror and who strives to bridge her own cultural adherences and biases to her new husband and her new land.Yet that isn’t quite what I got. I understand the theme of this novel, which is outlined here: “Was there a person who existed between languages? …She had thought that she’d been born with a soul whose thoughts were in a particular dialect, and she’d imagined that, when she married, her husband would be able to recognize this deep part of herself…In a way, George had created her American self, and so it made sense that it was the only one he would see.”But as I read this book, though, I couldn’t help but think that it wasn’t George who created Amina’s American self…it was the author herself. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Amina was, at her core, American. I didn’t quite believe that a Muslim woman with little experience would quickly sleep with her fiancé, disregard her mother’s teachings, and not honor her parent’s wishes about an Islam wedding. I didn’t believe that George’s traditional family would so quickly embrace a “foreign” woman into their fold. But most of all, I didn’t believe in the relationship between Amina and George. Although explanations are given, it was hard to fathom how this 34-year-old man decided to marry – sight nearly unseen – a woman from another culture because she “didn’t play games.” George’s character is just never sufficiently fleshed out.There are some big pluses about this book. The prose is confident and seamless; Ms. Freudenberger knows how to tell a story and to hold suspense. The story of how two virtual strangers hide a big part of themselves from the other is quite enticing. The quintessential journey homeward – when Amina must determine if there’s a distinction between the Bangladeshi Amina and the American one and confront her left-behind self – is nicely realized.In one knowing sentence, Amina says to George, “At first we were puzzle pieces. Now we’re the puzzle.” Surrounded by somewhat stereotypical supporting players (her cousin who has a religious awakening, his free-living cousin who spurts anything on her mind and is a yoga instructor), both characters remain puzzle pieces because they never become two independent pieces of a whole.

In many of his past novels, his characters are transplanted into a new culture and struggle to survive against environmental, cultural and psychological pressures.For those who enjoy Theroux, his latest novel does not disappoint. In fact, it soars. Once again, we are treated to an anti-hero who is forced to meet his overblown expectations head-on. And once again there are tendrils of Theroux’s own life: Ellis Hock, like Theroux himself, hails from Medford, Massachusetts and spent time in the backwaters of Malawi as a teacher during a tender age.(Theroux was actually dismissed from the Peace Corps for becoming involved in Malawi’s politics).Now, forty years later, Hock’s business and marriage have failed, his daughter has revealed her avarice, and he decides to return to The Lower River – the poorest part of a poor country and home of the superstitious Sena people. The ensuing tale – a tale of salvation and damnation, evocative of Heart of Darkness or Lord of the Flies – is downright hypnotic. Hock is known as the man who handles snakes in a village that fears them; this tale, too, grips around the reader, holding tight, not letting go. Hock “did not want to think that Africa was hopeless.” But in reality, “the school would remain a roofless shell, a nest of snake, the office a hideout for the orphan boys, the clinic a ruin.”The plot twists are so intriguing that I don’t even want to allude to them; suffice to say that Theroux delves deeply into whether a healthy interest in a different culture can coincide with the arrogance and egotism that we bring to that culture. “What do you want? I’m from America. I can get food, I can find money for you,” Hock says, when placed in a potentially dangerous situation. Yet as he later discovers, “You come with money to the poor, and they are so frenzied by hunger that all they see is the money. They never see your face, and so when the money is gone, you are revealed as mere flesh: a surprise. They don’t know you.”The most riveting parts of the story are the power plays between Hock and Manyenga, the cynical and sniveling village chief, who oppresses him with meaningless gestures of honor, baring to the core what he believes the mzungo “divinity” – the white man – is all about. There is much to mull over: “This looks such a simple place. But no, everyone lies, so you can’t know it all…If you’re hungry, you will do everything, you will agree to anything, you will say anything.” Once more, Theroux has masterfully displayed a clash of the cultures and their false expectations....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Mar 22, 2012","Mar 25, 2012","Mar 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13202128-the-lower-river

Dylan Landis captures one such person - Leah Levinson, a spirited and obsessive teenager growing up in 1970s New York City - in full detail, at pivotal points in her evolution from insecure teen to an increasingly adventurous but still risk-adverse college-age student.In ten beautifully-written portraits - which, like Elizabeth Strout's Olive Kitteridge, can each be read as a standalone story or chronological snapshots - Ms. Landis reveals truths about Leah, her widowed and anorexic mother Helen, and the way they navigate their lives. The observations are so finely-honed and compassionately-rendered that these characters could easily walk off the pages.We meet Leah as a young teen, engaging in uneasy relationships with tormenting girls who are far more savvy and popular. The next time we catch up with her, she has stood up to those girls and has survived trials in life - the death of her father and her mother's food disorders. When her science partner says, ""What's weird about frogs is they only recognize food when it moves. You set a dead fly in front of a frog, he'll starve"", she responds, ""My mother's like that. She only recognizes food when it has no calories.""Leah is shown in contrast to the many girls in her life, including Angeline Yost, the strong, unhappy girl with a silvery voice who is labeled the school slut. Ms. Landis writes,""The Gospel of Angeline is graven into desks with housekeys and the blood of Bics; it is written in the glances of girls -- low arcs of knowing that span the hallways and ping off the metal lockers.""Her next friendship is with two defiant sisters who live with their careless mother and who spur her on to shoplifting. As her decorator mother tries to restore order, she speaks to THEIR mother In luminous prose, trying to convince her of the beauty of a well-decorated home. ""What do you hate? Helen asks. In this scene, the schism between them is revealed: ""Hate is so much more interesting than love, isn't it? I hate a room without books. I hate a desk without papers. I hate not having a cat, but I'm allergic. I hate the way laundry piles up around here. We all share clothes so nobody feels that the laundry is exactly theirs, do you know?""The obsessive daughter of an obsessive compulsive mother, Leah will need to break free from her boundaries of ""how normal people live"" and take emotional risks. And, in their own way, both Leah and Helen do. When Leah's would-be boyfriend says to her, ""You've been pretending, too. About a lot of stuff, if you ask me"", we agree - and at the same time, know in our hearts that Leah is going to turn out alright. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 19, 2012","Mar 22, 2012","Mar 19, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6139011-normal-people-don-t-live-like-this

We know that Grace survived on a lifeboat after her ship - like the Titanic two years prior - goes down. We also know that she is now on trial for a murder that took place during the ensuing ordeal. But here's what we don't know: how reliable is Grace as the tale-teller? Is she coldly capable of taking whatever actions are necessary to survive? Or is she simply a shell-shocked bystander, susceptible to the slightest suggestion?In flashbacks, we learn about the harsh reality of lifeboat passenger survival, under the direction of one of the sea fellows named Hardie. The name is likely no accident: like Thomas Hardy's characters, Hardie and the rest of the survivors are overwhelmingly and overpoweringly in the grip of fate and chance. ""None of us are worth a spit,"" Grace ruminates. ""We were stripped of all decency. I couldn't see that there was anything good or noble left once food and shelter were taken away.""Indeed, as the characters are forced to endure worse and worse conditions - decreasing rations of food and water, the unexpected squall, the weakening of body and spirit, the emotional horrors of wondering about loved ones - they also form alliances that are crucial in determining who will live and who will die. It quickly becomes evident that some must be sacrificed for the majority to live since the lifeboat bears more people than it can safely carry.There is an elegiac overlay in this tale: Hardie is at first regarded as all-knowing and godlike. In a Bible parable, he is able to come up with a feast of raw fish and water to feed the hungry. But as hope fades and order falls apart, the one-time prayers become ""decidedly pagan, a prayer of appeasement to the sea..."" And the sea becomes ""as murky and cold as Satan's heart."" Not unlike Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, the journey is not just into the deepest waters but into the deepest recesses of one's own mind; knowledge of the human condition is hard-earned and sobering.Once I began this page-turner, it was virtually impossible to put it down. The theme weaves around that crucial question: during the worst of ordeals, is it possible for a person to be both alive and innocent? Are those who are left standing survivors...or murderers? Or put another way, what would each of us do to stay alive?

Or for that matter, it's great for anyone facing an adversity.My star rating, as always, is based on ""apples to apples"": comparing one book to others in its genre.

The key characters – Arthur Opp, the reclusive and obese professor who has not left his home in over a decade and Kel Keller, the son of the student that charmed Arthur many years ago, are quirky, engaging, and so human they will touch your heart.Arthur’s epistolary confessional comes first: “My house has grown so familiar to me that I don’t see it…I roam from room to room, a ghost, a large redfaced ghost.” He is hyper-aware of his abnormalcy and doesn’t ask for our compassion, although we cannot help but give it to him. Through the use of the ampersand (&) instead of “and”, Ms. Moore displays a character who is conserving energy. When his former student, Charlene, a troubled and not very attractive woman reaches out to him after two decades, revealing the existence of her athletically-gifted son, Arthur Opp is compelled to take action. He hires a slight housekeeper named Yolanda, a pregnant and feisty 19-year-old, who is his first connection to the outside world. Her character, too, is beautifully developed.Juxtaposed with this narrative is the story of Kel Keller, Charlene’s handsome and popular son, who is navigating the pitfalls of adolescence along with problems no teenager should have to bear – the alcoholism and deterioration of his mother. As the situation deteriorates, Kel becomes “everybody’s son”, a boy belonging to everyone and no one, least of all himself.The book presents optimism and hope for the outsider without ever falling into the YA genre.

Hadley is the idealized Hemingway woman – stoic, smart, unpretentious, intelligent, devoted, romantic, and wounded.Many of us received a tantalizing glimpse of her in Paula McLain’s fictional book, The Paris Wife. Ms. Diliberto takes the portrait much further through her exhaustive research into their thrilling and doomed relationship. In a finely-detailed depiction – to borrow Hemingway’s phrase, one of the “truest” deconstructions of Hadley around, focusing strongly on “innocence lost” – Hadley emerges from the shadows of her far more famous ex-husband and reveals herself to be a fascinating person in her own right.Ms. Diliberto reveals Hadley’s dysfunctional upbringing, living with her anti-male, strong-willed, manipulative mother and sister, and exploring the commonalities that “twinned” Ernest and Hadley together – the desire to break free of domineering mothers, the fraternal suicides that haunted them, the bouts with depression, the lack of sexual experience, and the overriding love of art.The author had access to more than one thousand pages of Hadley’s letters to Ernest – as she reveals in her preface – and it shows. This book is not just interpretative but also a revelation of Hadley in her own words – from their separated courtship, their adventures in Paris at the center of the literary expatriates, their baby Bumby, and ultimately, the dissolution of their union as a result of Hemingway’s self-destructive cheating. “I would never have written any of them In Our Time, Torrents, or The Sun if I had not married you and had your loyal and self sacrificing and always stimulating and loving,” Ernest wrote to Hadley after he left, calling her “the best and truest and loveliest person that I have ever known.” The mind boggles in thinking what he could have created if he had remained with her. Hemingway himself realized it: ‘I wish I had died before I ever loved anyone but her.”As fascinating as fiction – but so much more powerful because it’s fact – Paris Without End is riveting reading for anyone who wants true insight into Hemingway’s psychodynamics and the female characters he creates.

The Snow Child is a fairy tale with a twist: innovative, gritty, ambiguous, stunning, and filled with striking contrasts. In a way, it’s a hymn to the human spirit: “We are allowed to do this, are we not…? To invent our own endings and choose joy over sorrow?”Mabel and Jack have already reinvented their life together when the tale begins. When we meet them, they are facing their second winter as homesteaders in Alaska, a stunningly beautiful yet pitiless place: “Alaska gave up nothing easily. It was lean and wild and indifferent to a man’s struggles.” Shaped by grief as a result of a stillborn baby years ago and teetering on insolvency, exhaustion and depression, one day they put aside their troubles and go out to the newly fallen snow and create a little “snow-girl” with a tiny, perfect face.Soon afterwards, they spot an exquisite snow maiden, who appears to have come alive from the snow and birch boughs and frosty wild grass, mittens and a scarf. “Not only was the child a miracle, but she was their own creation.” Or is she? The beauty of Ms. Ivey’s story is that we, the readers, are never quite sure. There are just enough details to convince us she must be real and, simultaneously, just enough to persuade us that this Faina – the snow child – is magical.And while we don’t know the truth about Faina, we do know this: the book itself is true magic. It combines the lure of a traditional Russian folk story with the grim realities of 1920s Alaska. It’s filled with the harsh details of pioneer life – the trappings and killings of moose, silver foxes, sea otters, pine martens, even swans – yet it’s also a testimony to true natural beauty – Alaska’s icy lakes, majestic mountains and the joy of simple pleasures with good friends. Juxtaposed with all this is the overlay of Faina herself, the little girl who comes bearing gifts, from ripe-red cranberries to love and acceptance.At one point, one of the key characters says, “I guess maybe I don’t want to be warm and safe. I want to live.” At the end of the day, Snow Child is an ode to taking chances, trusting our imagination choosing love in all its iterations. and knowing, as Mabel’s sister writes, “that life itself is more fantastic and terrible than the stories we believed as children and that perhaps there is no harm in finding magic among the trees.” This remarkable and brave novel begs to be read and savored....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 05, 2012","Mar 09, 2012","Mar 05, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11250053-the-snow-child

That master restorer, Marshall, a man of dubious ethics, says: “No canvas lasts more than two centuries. If left alone, they all turn into dust. Those who think that art restoration is simply dusting and cleaning exhibit incredible naivete. Interpreters, Kristin. That’s what we are.”So the stage is set: restoration is interpretation. Which brings me to the second and presumably more important thread of the story: a tale of Alice, a wealthy British ex-pat who moves with her new Italian husband to a villa in Tuscany that also needs massive restoration. Alice, according to the epilogue, is based on Iris Origo, a real-life Marchesa of Val d’Orcia, who kept diaries during the war years (the book is set in the early 1940s.)The lives of these two remarkable women intersect in an unexpected way, keeping them in close contact during the encroaching fighting of Germans and Allied troops. Each has taken on a massive project -- the painting and the villa – and interpreted it in ways that suit her unique needs. And Olaf Olaffson himself surely must be aware that he, too, is the interpreter of the real-life diaries, bringing Marchesa Origo’s fictional conterpart to life.All this begs the question: does it work? For the most part, it does. This is a plot-driven story, albeit one that requires close attention at the beginning because of constant jumps back and forth in time and hints of future action. Mr. Olaffson, like a fine painter, creates beautiful brushstrokes that bring Tuscany of the war years to life and recreate the sounds, sights, and scents.From this reader’s perspective, the Kristin thread was far more compelling than the Alice thread; I suspect it wasn’t meant to be that way. Kristin’s story is written in the third-person and offers up suspense and raw emotions. Alice’s story, written in the more immediate first-person, is more detached. I never fully “felt” the love conflicts that she experienced and the push-pull of her marriage with Claudio seemed bland.

Where do I even begin? Perhaps with the title: Perla is a college-aged young woman whose father, a Navy Officer, was on the wrong side of the heinous Argentina Dirty Wars. During those wars, many innocent people simply disappeared; they were drugged and thrown out of airplanes, never to be seen again. At the book’s beginning, Perla discovers that one of those disp – a ghost, quite literally – has somehow found his way into her home.There are plot twists to this coupling, surely, but it is not those twists that make this novel stand out. Ms. De Robertis explores something far more vital: what happens when a person we love has been the instrument of pain and suffering? How do we reconcile his heinous acts with the person who loves and nurtures us? What responsibilities do we have to him, to society in general, and most of all, to ourselves? Or, in Perla’s own words, how can one move forward when “the crimes of my father-the crimes of the nation, also, crimes to which I had not given words –settled on me, rode my back drooped my shoulders, stuck to me and refused to wipe away.”Perla is forced into a delicate dance of trying to understand her father, extricate herself, potentially be his salvation as her father demands “absolution or amnesia or, at the very least, for continued love.” Her inner journey to claim her place in the world – her very identity – leads to birth and a rebirth and connects her with who she is meant to be and who she will become.In confident prose that reads like elegiac poetry, Ms. De Robertis creates word images that are downright exquisite. I often went back and read lines twice or three times, marveling at their beauty. And when I reached the end, I broke down in sobs, not because of a manufactured sad ending but because the story was so very powerful. I haven’t had that reaction since reading Toni Morrison’s Beloved. This masterpiece tackles all the big parts of life: love, suffering, redemption, identity, the need of belonging, and how we connect to each other.

Like his prior characters, tensions simmer and bubble and explode; however, this time, there is a degree of humor to mollify the building tensions. David Vann pokes fun at the transcendental practices and the rigid adherence to philosophical ideals that just cannot exist in the real world.  Of course, the language is beautifully and ruthlessly crafted; I would expect nothing less from this author. But by creating such extraordinarily damaged characters – and by satirizing those characters – there is a certain detachment that I inevitably experienced. Put another way, I found myself more entranced with the writing than the characters themselves, and as a character-based reader, something was missing for me.It’s intriguing, for example, to watch the action constrict and expand – from transcendental liberation of the world’s constraints to the Sacramento walnut farm and ultimately, to a tiny locked-in shed and the voices within Galen’s head. The land, the stacks of walnut racks, the dirt floor play a part in this novel right along with the key characters.

AnSome authors are comfort authors; we return to them again and again for their piercing insights and penetrating looks at what it means to be human. And so it is with me and Anne Tyler. Through books such as Breathing Lessons and Ladder of Years, I have fallen in love with her quirky characters and their well-meaning efforts to muddle through their lives and reach some sort of transcendence.The Beginner’s Goodbye is a wonderful addition to her works. It’s deceptively simple: a 30-something man named Aaron is mildly disabled and is clucked over by his well-meaning and overbearing older sister. He eventually meets and marries an outspoken and plain doctor named Dorothy. When she dies (and we know she dies from page one), he is thrust into the unfamiliar world of grieving and lives primarily for the glimpses he catches of Dorothy…glimpses that he believes are authentic. The title is derived from the series that his publishing house prints – the “Beginner’s Series.”There is a poignancy to this story that from time to time, brought tears to my eyes. For instance, here is Aaron’s exploration of grief: “It’s like the grief has been covered over with some kind of blanket. It’s still there, but the sharpest edges are…muffled sort of. Then, every now and then, I lift a corner of the blanket , just to check, and – whoa! Like a knife!”Like Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, the tone is consistently gentle and compassionate. Has Dorothy really come back to complete their unfinished business together…or not? Take this passage: “Call to mind a person you’ve lost that you will miss to the end of your days, and then imagine happening upon that person out in pubic. You see your long-dead father sauntering ahead with his hands in his pocket. Or you hear your mother behind you calling, “Honey?”…You wouldn’t question your sanity, because you couldn’t bear to think this wasn’t real…You would hold your breath. You would keep as still as possible. You would will your loved one not to go away again.”Anne Tyler fans can expect whimsical and likeable secondary characters, and there are many of them in this novel: his sister Nandina, the contractor, Gil, and a host of well-meaning friends and acquaintances that rarely get it right. This book is about our shared human experience of loss, grief and recovery and the dynamics of a not always perfect marriage.

After pulling himself up from an impoverished background, he quickly distinguished himself as a Civil War brigadier general, a respected Senator, a university president at only 26, and a passionate abolitionist. Much to his own amazement, he emerged the winner of the deadlocked 1880 Republican convention. His ego was so in check that he did not view this as a good thing; his belief was that Washington corrupted, and he much preferred to remain in Ohio, where he worked the fields and together with his wife Lucretia, raised four sons and a daughter.Yet the politics – which is in itself fascinating – is not the crux of Ms. Millard’s book. Garfield, as we learn from history, was the victim of an assassination contempt by Charles Guiteau, a mentally unbalanced man who thought he would be rewarded with an ambassadorship by this insane act.Had Garfield been a Civil War soldier, he would have survived quite nicely; the bullet missed his vital organs. But since he was the president, he fell under the care of the misnamed Dr. Bliss, who administered to Abraham Lincoln on his deathbed. The result was appalling. As was common in his day, Dr. Bliss did not want to go through the trouble of washing hands and instruments, nor did he believe in the benefit of antisepsis. With non-sterilized hands, he probed Garfield’s wound many times a day, stuffed him with heavy meals and alcohol, and deprived him of natural air and company. The president took this narcissist’s commands with good nature, eventually dying because of the treatment, not the bullet hole.Also interwoven in this ambitious book are the attempts of Alexander Graham Bell to determine where the bullet was located through induction balance and Joseph Lister’s dismissed urgings to use antisepsis to ward off infection. The political intrigue – two warring factions of the Republican party, not unlike today’s Tea Party and the more mainstream side and the close-minded dismissal of science is also explored and provides a window into the 1880s. “Do you think my name will have a place in human history?” the barely 50-year-old president asked during his last days. “Yes,” his friend replied, “a grand one, but a grander place in human hearts.” For every American – particularly those who are fans of Erik Larson’s works – this is indispensable reading and a rare education into a president who has fallen through the crevices in history.

Those who prefer linear plots with clearly-delineated story arcs and concrete plots are likely to be disappointed; this is a book where themes, not plot lines, reign supreme. And what themes they are! A young Nigerian psychiatric resident named Julius walks the New York city streets aimlessly at night, criss-crossing both territory and social strata, meeting some of the anonymous masses, discovering more and more about the human condition and his own tenuous connection to it.“How petty seemed to me the human condition, that we were subject to this constant struggle to modulate the internal environment, this endless being tosses about like a cloud,” he thinks. “Predictably, the mind noted that judgment, too, and assigned it its place: a little sadness.”As Julius – whose professional mission is to save the mind from madness and chaos – navigates his past and present, he recognizes that life is not, in actuality, a continuity but “mostly open space, great expanses of nothing, in which significant persons and events float.” In accessible and beautifully-wrought stream-of-consciousness, he revisits the Nigeria of his youth, his lost (to him) girlfriend, his old oma – a German refugee – who may be alive in Brussels, a favored and dying professor. This fiercely intelligent book touches briefly on so many topics: the final symphony of Mahler, the Mideast conflict, the alienation of the outsiders, the bedbug epidemic, the roots of psychiatry, the city of Heliopolis, the slave burying ground in NYC, the nature of violence, and so much more.Indeed, Teju Cole achieves his promise of allowing significant persons and events to float to the surface, arresting the attention of the reader, and then relinquishing the spotlight.

It deserves to win Richard Ford another Pulitzer.The oft-quoted first lines (First, I’ll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later) set the stage for the duality that is showcased heavily throughout CANADA: the robberies, then the murder (reflecting two deceptions)…the past, then the now. Our narrator, Dell Parsons, is a twin; his sister Berner is an emotional opposite. His parents also, are two sides of a coin: tall, charming and Southern Bev Parsons and tiny, exotic, northern Neeva. The structure also reflects duality: Part I and Part II (there is a 20-page Part III, which serves as an epilogue). The first part takes place in Montana; Dell’s parents rob a bank to settle a meagerly debt, instantly propelling him into an uncertain future. Dell was “to young and too far outside the boundaries of the little I knew.” He is spirited across the border by a family friend and taken in by an enigmatic man named Arthur Remlinger, who hides many dark secrets of his own. And so lays the groundwork for Part II.Crossing this boundary – from the United States to Canada – is far more than geographic. CANADA is not so much about the country as it is a state of mind. “Why the change of weather and light produced a change in me and made me more accepting – more than the awareness of time passing – I can’t say,” reflects Dell. Canada is an interior landscape where internal growth is realized. This is reinforced when Remlinger’s shady associate gives him this guidance: “Charley Quarters had told me you crossed borders to escape things and possibly to hide, and Canada in his view was a good place or that…But it also meant you became someone different in the process…’As in previous works, Richard Ford is most intrigued by the “what used to be” and the “now. What happens when you cross that boundary from the past to the present or, more precisely, the boundary of what you were to what you are becoming? What is the moment when you become different in the process? Does crossing an interior frontier change anything and does it give us the right to a second chance? Can we, indeed, develop from a way of living that doesn’t work toward one that does?CANADA keeps circling back onto itself and eventually, we the readers come to identify the lines that are crossed that disallow us from ever coming back.

And like all short story compilations, readers are bound to gravitate to their own favorites.For me, a few of them really sang. In the first, A Temporary Marriage, Mrs. Shin has been forced to endure an abusive relationship and enters a sham marriage with another Korean named Mr. Rhee. As a result of her divorce, she loses custody of her daughter, whom she is determined to see again. But has she courted her own abuse? Phrases such as “her wounded body continued its ancient song” sum up, in a few sparse words, what the theme of the story is really about.Then there’s The Goose Father – the traditional name for a father who faithfully sends money to his family overseas. The father – a one-time poet – takes in a young boarder who carries an actual goose with a wounded wing. In powerful prose, the father – Gilho – must come to terms with his true inclinations and his lifetime loneliness and alienation.The Salaryman is stunning in its understated, naturalistic prose. In this story – told in second person – we watch a solid Korean businessman lose his job, his family, his confidence, and ultimately, his very humanity. It’s like watching a train wreck; it’s hard to look away.There are many other good ones as well – the eponymous Drifting House, the most surreal of the lot, where two brothers and their very young sister try to escape North Korea’s countryside famine by fleeing to China. Yet they cannot escape their ghosts. And in The Believer, a mentally deranged Korean American woman commits a heinous crime; her daughter tries to comfort her father by performing an unspeakable act.Ms. Lee is a young writer who is willing to take risks as she focuses her talent on those who are damaged, lonely, yearning. It’s not uplifting – marriages fail, men lose their sense of masculinity, women lose their sense of value, and most everyone feels displaced. Yet it offers amazing insights into the hopelessness and frustration that define a Korea that’s been through war, financial draught, and instabilities. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 11, 2012","Feb 14, 2012","Feb 11, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11909375-drifting-house

Laurence seizes the moment: it is his chance to make a difference in a changing country. But, as Frank soon realizes, Laurence can be simplistic: “all the complexities and contradictions reduced to a single moral needle-point.”Frank is the more interesting of the two, morally more complex. Unlike Laurence, who has a black American activist girlfriend whom he keeps at arm’s length, (“behind the brave aspirations, what did these two have in common? Their relationship was just another idea – dry and sensible” (Frank has been windswept by life. His wife left him for a man he considered a friend; additionally, he faced his own moral test with apartheid and failed through inaction. A morally ambiguous relationship with a local woman adds to Frank’s inability to act decisively.Yet the two – who end up roommates at the hospital – end up in a danse a deux. Frank muses, “We were twined together in a tension that united us; we were different to each other, though it was to our nature to be joined and woven in this way. As for the points that we were spanned between – a rope doesn’t know what its own purpose is.” One gets a sense of South Africa on the cusp: dedicated to “change and innovation” of the future but condemned to move forward inch by inch, if at all, and twined from the past to the future.This is a poignant book, a lethal one, with echoes of JM Coetzee or perhaps Graham Greene. It is a linear story that belies the powerful themes that lie close to the surface: idealism versus reality, trust versus betrayal, blinding faith versus nihilism, action versus inaction.

It’s unexpected and it shines.I expected something else: a quirky book about a woman who is driven over the edge by a cheating husband and an impending divorce. Instead, this book is about two good people who are no longer good together and it authentically mines the emotions that ensue from that decisionEvvie is an emotionally fragile woman, the victim of a wounded childhood, who marries a man named Ben, who is similarly mining his childhood issues. Together, they form a life that is based on passionate idealism. But eventually, Ben grows up; he takes a “real job” and begins to stake out a different kind of destiny. He is convinced he has to “go it alone.”Since Ben was Evvie’s “everything”, she is unable to cope with his decision. As one of Evvie’s friends says, “It affects everyone. I mean, how are you supposed to have a community?” In a particularly poignant passage, Evvie reflects, “Ben had been her skin. Ben had understood that the house of childhood cast a spell, gave her a form of multiple personality disorder, rendered her all the ages she had ever been inside of its wall. Without him, how was she to navigate the collision of selves?”The insights that Jane McCafferty renders are stunning in their authenticity. Evvie and Ben are flawed but sympathetic people, who must cope with the fall-out of leaving someone who has salvaged them from childhood dysfunction and who holds the key to their past and present lives. Ben wonders, “This girl in her twenties, the person she’d been – did she survive inside of the woman who’d broken into his place and said his heart was black ice?” As readers, we understand that these two are not meant to be together at this juncture in life but we wish they could find a way, all the same. That’s a difficult feat for an author to pull off. I am very close to giving this book five stars because I loved most of it. However, Jane McCafferty doesn’t seem to trust in her own instincts. Evvie eventually gambles on an off-the-wall scheme to get Ben back once and for all and the first note of inauthenticity appears. One of the minor characters, Ranjeev – the only one who is awarded his own chapter other than the two of them – also doesn’t seem fleshed out enough. Don’t let these minor flaws stop you.

In that movie, the character uses his fertile imagination to provide alternate stories for his son, interned in a concentration camp. In this debut novel by Ramona Ausubel, a remote Jewish village in Romania erases the approaching danger by reinventing their world and starting from scratch.It’s an intriguing premise; time and history are forgotten, and relationships are reassigned. All the villagers try hard to believe and their belief is not in a force above but in their own abilities to reinvent their personal destinies. In passages that parallel Genesis, seven days of creation are revealed and the villagers offer up this: “Dear God, We did not start again because it wasn’t beautiful enough. The world we make will be much smaller and less glorious than the one you made….We are content to accept this small circle of land as our entire universe, so long as we are safe here.”From here, we hear the narrative from Lena – an 11-year-old who is reassigned to other parents. She must go back and relive her life on the fast track, starting with infancy and then racing past her real age. And through this process, she buys into the new world. Here she is, talking to her young husband during the third year of peace: “Let’s say the world is beautiful and safe. Let’s say that the new world we are all making together is a fair one, and that everything turns out all right. Let’s believe that you are a good father and I am a good mother, and this baby is a healthy boy who will live long enough to tell the story again and again that he was the first baby I a brand-new world where there was always enough food, always enough warmth, and always enough love.”Does this psalm to storytelling work? To a degree. There is sheer ambitious and poetry in this writer’s work and strong muted themes as well: How much power does our imagination have in how we shape the stories of our life? Is God present or absent in the worst of times? Can we create effective stories to be carried down from one generation to the other so that the world will not forget?The greatest strength of this book may be its greatest weakness. The same stories that sustain Lena and the villagers also distance us – the readers – from the full horror of the events leading up to the Holocaust, and indeed, from the characters themselves. At the end of the day, I admired, more than loved, what Ramona Ausubel was accomplishing, which, in her own words in an afterword, are “about the bigness of being alive as an individual, a family member, a resident, a member of the tribe, and a participant in history.”...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Feb 04, 2012","Feb 09, 2012","Feb 04, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12040405-no-one-is-here-except-all-of-us

The majesty of Katherine Boo’s novel is that she does not deal with symbols. In Behind the Beautiful Forevers, she brings the Annawadian slum to life in such a powerful way that fictional writers will want to sit up and learn from her craft.Her self-professed mission, is “How do ordinary low-income people – particularly women and children – negotiate the age of global markets?” The slum-dwellers she introduces us to are neither mythic nor pathetic and they certainly are not passive. They are not particularly “likeable” and they would probably spurn your pity. Certainly, they believe their lives – no matter how meager they are – are valuable.Brilliantly written, the book focuses on the lives of those who reside in a small settlement within the shadows of deluxe five-star hotels. As the narrative unfolds, we meet Abdul – an enterprising garbage picker who lives with his tubercular father, sharp-tongued mother and siblings in Annawadi. Unlike most of his neighbors, they are barely making it, and things get a whole lot worse when an off-balance one-legged neighbor immolates herself, blaming the family for her suicidal actions. We meet spirited Asha who will do whatever it takes to survive and give her “most-everything” daughter a chance to thrive…and we meet Sunil and Kalu, imaginative young friends who use finely-honed ingenuity to keep on…keeping on.All of them exist in a society where life is cheap and justice is cheaper. With little to spare, just the basics of life are subject to extortion as the poor turn against the poor. This is a place where a bleeding waste-picker’s life bleeds out of him as people step over him to go about their workday; where a once-lively teenager drinks rat poison to liberate herself from her daily misery while her mother just shrugs; where a one-legged woman sets herself on fire and the craven justice system tries to finger Abdul and destroy his family. Yet, incredibly, some degree of hope still remains. Abdul thinks, “He wanted to be better than what he was made of. In Mumbai’s dirty water he wanted to be ice. He wanted to have ideals.” And later: “or some time I tried to keep the ice inside me from melting…But now I’m just becoming dirty water, like everyone else.”His – and the others – live in ways that most of us find unimaginable. But as Abdul says, “Even the person who lives like a dog still has a kind of life.” It’s a world where the poor take one another down and the world’s great, unequal cities soldier on in relative peace. Katherine Boo goes a long way in tearing away the curtain to place us face to face with these invisible lives.

By that definition, is Alan Bennett’s latest novel truly about smut?The ambiguous answer: yes but not really. Smut really tackles the theme of how those of us, living within narrow boundaries of social convention, break free from conforming to appearances. The result is entertaining, amusingly quirky British humor at its best.The first of the novellas is The Greening of Mrs. Donaldson, the story of a 50-something middle-class woman “beached on the shores of widowhood” who takes in a young medical student couple as a way of supplementing her pension. At the same time, she decides to make some money as a “part-time demonstrator” for the medical school; in essence, playing the part of a person with an illness so that the student doctors can refine their diagnostic skills. In lieu of rent, her young borders offer to let her view their nightly sexual escapades. And so she begins her thrilled Walter Mitty life: actor/pretender by day and voyeur by night.The second, The Shielding of Mrs. Forbes (there is a certain symmetry in the titles), focuses on the priggish middle-aged woman who appears blind to the fact that her handsome and narcissistic son is gay. Graham – the son – soon marries a rather dowdy but highly intelligent woman named Betty for her money and begins to enjoy her company as well. What emerges is a parlor game of misadventures as Bennett explores the ramifications of the family secret…with everyone sleeping with everyone else.So what is Alan Bennett – the fine author and playwright of The Uncommon Reader and The History Boys, among others – trying to accomplish? For one thing, in both novellas, he shows that appearances are not as they seem at first glance Mrs. Donaldson is hardly the repressed and conventional widow nor is Mrs. Forbes the unsuspecting mother. As the two eponymous women – and the characters close to them – strive to “perform” for all those around them, the performances are ultimately semi-comical and definitely false.This slender and compulsively page-turning book offers plenty of the trademark pleasures that those familiar with Bennett’s oeuvre will readily detect. It’s filled with witty plot twists and turns of phrases and sometimes befuddled, often repressed characters that are also sympathetic. I can think of far worse ways to pass a few hours than in the company of such fascinating characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Feb 2012,"Feb 02, 2012","Feb 01, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10589860-smut

We meet him in Vienna where he is “taking the talking cure” with a disciple of Sigmund Freud’s as a result of a personal problem. While in his psychotherapist’s antechamber, he meets up with two others who will ultimately have a profound effect on his life. He falls under a magical love spell of sorts with the woman, Hettie (think: Hermia from the Shakespeare play). And, as Shakespeare’s own Lysander famously said, “The course of true love never did run smooth.”As in the play, Lysander will be forced to literally and figuratively enter a forest, a place of confusion, passion, heartache. And he will ultimately realize that “We’re all acting, aren’t we? Almost all the time—each and every one of us.”All of this is ensconced within a gripping espionage story as Rief, back in London during war time, is thrust into the world of underground intelligence, where his superiors are eager to use him to flesh out a traitor who is undermining the war efforts. Rief will be forced to rely on his improvisational acting skills to reveal that traitor’s identity. He will not know whom to trust and who will betray him. Gradually, he begins to inhabit a world “where it’s hard to make things out clearly, hard to tell exactly what is what and who is whom.” If all this sounds intriguing – it is. I am not typically a fan of the espionage story, but this one had me compulsively turning pages. The characterizations are well fleshed-out, the sense of place is finely-drawn, and the depiction of what is real and what can be trusted is palpable.

Many people use it to describe feelings of emotional conflict and upset that may arise when someone does something he or she shouldn’t do. Ferdinand von Schirach – a leading German defense attorney and the grandson of Baldur von Schirach, head of the Hitler Youth and convicted at Nuremberg – has no doubt pondered the nature of guilt in all its manifestations more than most of us. “Defense is war, a war for the rights of the accused,” Mr. von Schirach quotes at the beginning. It’s a particular type of war where being innocent doesn’t always mean being vindicated and guilty doesn’t always mean being wrong.Here, he showcases 15 stories based on real cases, exploring the gray and not-so-gray meanings of guilt.His vignettes are written in a sparse, straightforward, sometimes clinical tone – think Ray Carver, for example. The simplicity of the style belies the emotional power that hides behind it. Whether it’s the inadvertent manslaughter death of a beloved art teacher by a pack of cult followers, the justified murder of a wickedly abusive husband in Comparison, the comeuppance of a drug dealer in Snow, the post traumatic stress of a very young would-be mother in Lonely. One senses there are two von Schirachs: the dispassionate and professional defense attorney who has learned to carefully cull the facts and another one, who might be shaking his head in amazement. The author presents a diversity of cases, which could have been mere file cases in the hands of a lesser author, and presents what guilt and its impact mean to the perpetrator and those who are closest to him or her. I’ve never quite read anything like this and it’s difficult to assign a star rating.

Fortunately, Defending Jacob is no ordinary lawyer-and-courtroom book. It’s smart, suspenseThese days, lawyer-and-courtroom books are a dime a dozen. Fortunately, Defending Jacob is no ordinary lawyer-and-courtroom book. It’s smart, suspenseful, and a downright insightful look into an ordinary family that is on the road to implosion. Along the way, it has much to say about teenage angst, psychology, the latest genetic techniques, social media, family dynamics and more. Put another way, it’s a work of literary fiction as well as a page-turning thriller.Andy Barber is the first assistant district attorney with a attractive and empathetic wife, Laurie, and a typically moody teenage son, Jacob. He is also the holder of a secret: his father and grandfather were both arrested for violent murder. Suddenly, he is forced to face a parent’s worst nightmare. His son’s classmate is stabbed to death and gradually, the circumstantial evidence against his own son is overwhelming. This master of self-control and self-delusion is forced to consider whether the son he loves to distraction is capable of a heinous murder.Is Jacob simply a teenager going through the usual throes of angst and alienation or is he the cold-blooded killer that the prosecutor portrays? How far will Andy go and what will he sacrifice to protect his beloved son? Some of the plot twists are a bit reminiscent of The Bad Seed, a 1954 novel by William March that was turned into an Academy-Award-nominated film with a “nature versus nurture” examination. But will the story end up the way that The Bad Seed did? Linday is smart enough to keep a kernel of doubt in his readers’ minds.This author excels in creating “teenspeak” dialogue. His teenagers – from Jacob himself to Derek Yoo, his best friend who turns to the prosecution, to Jacob’s schoolmates – are so real they could step off the pages. This is some of the most believable teen dialogue I’ve ever seen. The only misstep is Landay’s creation of Andy’s father, who comes off as cartoonish, particularly in contrast to his other gripping characters.While reading this, I could barely come up for air; the turns and twists, the family revelations, the emotional depth were all done with sophistication and aplomb. All the while, Linday educates the reader about the courtroom without crossing the line into authorial intrustion.

Elegies for the Brokenhearted is such a novel.Not unlike Spoon River Anthology – the Edgar Lee Masters collection of short free-form poems that collectively describe the lives and losses of deceased members of a small town – Elegies focuses on five characters in a nameless postindustrial city located in New England and narrated by Mary Murphy. It is organized into five elegies of those who have touched Mary’s life: her hapless young uncle (“every family had one and you were ours: the chump, the slouch, the drunk, the bum, the forever-newly-employed…), an unfortunate neighbor (“Your lot in life, it seemed, was to go through it unawares, your folly a perpetual amusement to others”), her first-year college roommate (“Fat and black, fat and black, did I have any idea you asked, what it meant…”), a gay failed music prodigy (“You believed there would come a day, your turn would come at the head of the line”), and her five-time-married mother (“You were born beautiful in an ailing industrial city, and you learn soon enough that to be a thing of beauty in a place like this is to bear a burden…”)Ms. Hodgen seamlessly blends second person voice and first person voice – the dead are addressed as “you” and the book is narrated in the “I” voice. Each portrait is perfectly realized, poignantly rendered, sympathetically told, in prose that is nothing less than incantatory. All of these vignettes – particularly of Carson Washington, the narrator’s memorable college roommate who bears a heavy burden and is deliberately flunking out of school as a result – are heartbreaking and incredibly portrayed.At the end of the day, Ms. Hodgen implies, it is really all about connections: “What impressed me most was how similar our lives were – yours, mine, and everyone we knew—and how little we’d noticed the connections. We had all known joy and then lost it had blindly sought after it again; we had taken up burdens and carried them for a time, then stumbled beneath them; we had made strides and then lapsed; we had taken strange paths that sometimes delivered us to safety and sometimes led us astray…”This is a book about how family and friends can tear us down and build us up, how losses can diminish us and yet add to our realization of life, and how we find “purpose” in the most unlikely places. For those who crave character-driven novels with shades of gray, where answers are hard-won, and where every one has a chance at redemption, this is the book for you....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 22, 2012","Jan 23, 2012","Jan 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7107180-elegies-for-the-brokenhearted

Luis Alberto Urrea, in an astounding feat of alchemy, does both. Within the novel’s sprawling 499 pages, his depiction of Teresita Urrea – his real-life great-aunt, anointed the “Saint of Cabora” – becomes increasingly intoxicating and unputdownable.In a sprawling yet controlled epic, we meet Teresita – the illegitimate daughter of a teen mother called “hummingbird” and the patron Tomas– right after she is deserted and left in the so-called care of a mean-hearted aunt. She is “adopted” by Huila, an old curaranda, who takes her under her wing and teaches her about desert herbs and plant medicine and the power of the unconscious. It is not long before she comes to the attention of Tomas, who accepts her as his daughter.In a sensuous whirlwind of description, the land comes alive and our senses are besotted the noxious smells of pig sties the sharp smell of sweat, and the mouth-watering smells of Mexican foods, the bursting beauty of desert flowers and plants, the braying burros and squabbling crows. You feel as if you could step into the scene; that’s how perfectly it’s depicted. When the novel levitates into magical realism, we’ve already signed on for the ride and put ourselves into Mr. Urrea’s very capable hands. The power of his words is that we do not merely escape from the world by entering this new one; rather, we gain a greater grasp of what it is to be human. As Teresita begins to heal with her hands and her father’s ranch is overrun by pilgrims, we stand in amazement with the People – the Greek chorus that is indelibly embedded into the pages of this book.All of the narrative plays against the backdrop of a changing Mexico: approaching revolution, removal of Indians from their ancestral lands, southwestern border disputes, the Diaz government’s darkening suspicions and paranoia, the controlling hand of organized religion – all contrasted against one uneducated but wise girl’s healing message of love and healing.The Hummingbird’s Daughter has it all – facts and legends that Mr. Urrea, a reporter, gathered from 20 years of research into his childhood, Western mythology, Catholic hagiography, Mexican folklore and more, interwoven with down-to-earth descriptions of poverty, warfare, torture, and grittiness.

Such is the case with Half-Blood Sometimes two stories vie for attention: the story the author could have written and the one she actually did write. Such is the case with Half-Blood Blues.If you come into this book expecting the promises of the publicist – in essence, the black German experience under the tyrannical rule of the Third Reich – you will find this book to be wanting. However, if you are looking for a book that delivers on what the author fully intends – an exploration of a one-time tight-knit jazz band with striving for fame, inter-band jealousies, and betrayals – set in the late 1930s, then this book shines. It is not, perhaps, the more interesting topic, but it is the one this author tackled, and her prose positively sings and vibrates.We know early on that Hiero – the eponymous “half blood”, half German, half black -- is arrested in a Paris café and we know that the narrator Sid feels as if he bears some responsibility. In flashbacks from a vantage point of half a century later, Sid Griffiths and Chip Jones, two African-American members of the Hot Time Swingers band, travel back again to Europe where it all began…and the path to redemption. So what is Half Blood Blues really about? It’s an electrifying story about following a passion (“Listen, jazz, it ain’t just music. It life.”) It’s about what we ask of ourselves and what we demand of others in the name of friendship and art. It’s about the times when pretty good is not good enough.. and how we berate ourselves for our lacking. And it’s about finally being able to ask forgiveness and to forgive ourselves for our failing, because only in forgiveness can we ever really be free. In other words, it’s about life itself and how we define it for ourselves.From the first sentence – “Chip told us not to go out. Said, don’t you boys tempt the devil”, written in a near-musical patois, to the band’s meeting with Louis Armstrong, the man all of them worshipped, the story will hold you in its thrall. Like any musical composition, there are times when the narrative slows down – perhaps more than I would have liked – and times with a note or two is out of place. Yet many of its images are searing and the ending darn near broke my heart and not in a manipulative or predictable way.This book has been awarded the Scotibank Giller prize and was a finalist for the Man Booker prize.

Disturbingly, the western world stood by and did nothing as the borders were closed and innocent people – even young babies -- were savagely killed by hate-mongrels for…what? Naomi Benaron’s Bellweather Prize novel brings us up close and personal to this episode in history through Jean Patrick Nkuba, a Tutsi teenager who is gifted through his running ability. The president of Rwanda quickly seizes upon Jean Patrick as a way to show the west that Rwanda is a tolerant country. Jean Patrick is given the life-saving Hutu ID card (“Today you are Tutsi. When you go to Butare to train with your coach this weekend, you will be Hutu. What a marvelous power you have now!”) In the first half of the book, Benaron establishes Jean Patrick’s life. He loses his father at a tender age, is embraced – with his siblings – into the home of his uncle, and trains passionately and intensely for a shot at the Olympics. Benaron has obviously done her homework and the sounds, sights, and smells of Rwanda pervade these early chapters. By skillfully rendering the bonds of family and the tenderness of community, we get to know Jean Patrick and “buy into” his desire to achieve his goal of winning the gold and providing esteem again for the Tutsi people. And we root for him as he falls in love with a journalism student, Bea, who captivates him at first sight.But then the Hutus and Tutsi situation erupts into sheer hell. In almost unbearable-to-read prose, we – the readers – see what happens when “no safe or sane place exists within the country.” Borders are sealed off, Tutsis are hunted down in churches and schools, one-time neighbors dismiss Tutsi friends as “cockroaches” and always, always, the voice of Radio Rwanda is in the background: “All Tutsi will perish. They will disappear from the earth. We will kill them like rats.” Those who live in the west – the same people who react passionately (and rightfully) when gorillas are exterminated do next-to-nothing. This book is very difficult for me to rate. There are the traditional problems of the debut writer in the first half: authorial intrusion as the author tries to educate the reader about Rwanda, placing words inappropriately in the mouths of certain characters. There are some traces of young adult writing and times when the metaphors become too standard. If you asked me half-way through, I might have rated the book in the 3.5 to 4 star level.The last half was so searing, though, that the images will be indelibly imprinted in my mind and the writing soars to 6 stars. I felt I was “twinned” with Jean Patrick as he races with terror for his very life. One of the most amazing parts of this book is that it offers love, friendship, and individual hope at the same time it explores inhumanity on an unimaginable scale. Benaron writes, “In the darkness, men and women lay together and created new life. This was the dance of Rwanda. Jean Patrick could not let himself believe that this dance, as familiar as the beat of his heart, could suddenly end.” One wishes – futilely – that the killing will never begin again…anywhere....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 06, 2012","Jan 10, 2012","Dec 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11092210-running-the-rift

I thought I had exhaustively read just about anything that could be said about Watergate. I was wrong.Thomas Mallon’s new book is absolutely brilliant and unlike anything I’ve ever read about those dark days in the early 1970s. His real theme is what Stephen Colbert calls “truthiness.” In a locale where political life is a gaudy composition of intrigue, farce, and pathos -- in a liquor-soaked insular community where everyone is sleeping with everyone else and the object is to win the game, not serve the people—what is truth anyway? Do the gravest lies have an element of truth? Does truth contain its share of lies? And what does it all matter?Mr. Mallon subtlety suggests that with all the rumors, recreations, and complexities of political life, it almost doesn’t matter what is true and what isn’t. Did Pat Nixon really have a lover through the Watergate years, a retired trust-and-estates widower? Did money man Fred LaRue kill his father accidentally or by design during a duck hunting expedition? Did Rose Woods erase the infamous tapes because she was ordered to or because – just maybe – she was a little inebriated and a whole lot angry? What was behind Nixon’s maudlin final speech as he departed the presidency? These are just some of the more interesting questions that Mr. Mallon poses.If you’re like me, you’ll run to the Internet to google all these – and more. The mastery of his prose is that you will not be able to detect what is fact and what is not. And curiously, the more you read, the more it won’t matter.You’ll meet a Nixon who is genuinely perplexed by the turn of events. “The actual globe could fall apart at any time, but moments ago this throng in front of him had no doubt whistled and hollered for the Post boys, all for saving the world from what was –truthfully – a third-rate burglary.” Unlike the “good versus evil” that most of us regard Watergate to be, we read that LBJ had commanded the bugging of Nixon’s campaign plane (Or did he? That’s part of the fun of this book. Nixon regarded the burglary as business as usual and sadly, it probably was.Throughout, Alice Longworth, the octogenarian first-born of Teddy Roosevelt, stands at a distance and also in the center of things, clearly noting the farce that D.C. continually acts out. All the ""characters"" you know are here – Nixon, Agnew, the elusive E. Howard Hunt, John Mitchell and his out-of-control wife Martha, Elliot Richardson (the Boy Scout who loves to throw back a drink or two), Rose Woods, and Nixon’s family.

In the first few pages of the novel, he is getting ready to share his life story to a young Jewish woman with these words: “You may not like me very much if I tell you what happened…”But we do. As readers we do like Hayat as he reveals the good, the bad, and the ugly of his story, which begins when his mother’s best friend Mina departs from Pakistan and her controlling ex-husband with her small son. Hayat – at the cusp of adolescence – develops a serious crush on Mina, who encourages him to immerse himself in the Qur’an. Pretty soon, Mina falls for a Jewish doctor – the partner of Hayat’s father and his new sense of purpose merges with his growing sense of “love” and confused feelings of betrayal.It’s not only an intriguing but also a timely premise, as thoughtful Americans strive to gain greater understanding of “what it means to be Muslim.” And I believe the book has much to offer a young adult or mass market audience who likes a linear story with an educational twist. The story has an interesting protagonist, a story arc, and has much to say about the push and pull of secular, mystical, and religious Islam, the evolving role of women, and the confusion that accompanies growing up Muslim in America.However, like many plot-driven made-for-TV movies, American Dervish doesn’t dig nearly enough, not providing its characters with enough of an inner life, and sacrificing depth for a fluid story line. The result is often platitudes and melodrama, with messages strongly telegraphed. Here is Hayat’s mother, speaking to him: “Listen to me and never forget what I’m telling you. If you give yourself to filth and garbage, you will become filth and garbage. You will become the sum of what you desire…Promise me behta. Promise me you won’t end up like him. That you won’t live your life like him.” And here is Mina’s Jewish suitor, Nathan: “The way he has those people beholden to him. It’s revolting and immortal. And it has nothing to do with real Islam. Nothing at all.” Or mother talking about her friend Mina: “I keep telling her the fact that Nathan’s Jewish is a good thing. They understand how to respect women, behta. They understand how to let a woman be a woman, to let her take care of them.”Ayad Akhtar – an actor, playwright and novelist – is obviously striving to contribute to Muslim-Jewish (and Muslim-American) understanding, which is a very worthy goal and a good thing. But by leading the reader to conclusions and by simplifying premises, the book just doesn’t rise to high literary standards. In a world where “unhappiness hovers” and “nerve ends teem”, the novel is ultimately lacking.

Her book ViLet me state my point of view right from the start: I think Jenny Erpenbeck may just well be one of the very finest writers at work today. Her book Visitation has lingered for months after reading it, and her earlier book, The Book of Words is spellbinding in its spareness and power.The narrator, an unnamed little girl, relates the world around her in a prism of innocence. She attends school, goes on idyllic trip with her wet nurse although she’s way past the age of breastfeeding, and lives in an unnamed country – presumably Argentina – where the sun seems to be eternally shining.But read the words carefully and just about every single paragraph in this short 90-page book is underpinned with menace. “A ball is a thing that rolls and sometimes bounces. A father is a man who stays taller than you for a long time…If a person wants to play ball with someone’s head, only the nose would get in the way.”As readers, we know that there are dark incidents happening right out of the periphery of the little girl’s sight. Her wet nurse receives a “gift” of a box of hands. The gardener goes on a “vacation.” And, when her father, a high-ranking government official, calmly reveals the secrets to his daughter, the effect is so chilling that it’s almost hard to read the words…but at this point, the emotional investment in the book is so complete that it’s equally difficult to draw away.From the unnamed narrator: “Why does mankind have so many languages? I ask my father as we are walking back to his parent’s house hand in hand after the service. So now can anyone just come and take a word away from the thing it belongs to…” Words – innocent, simple words – become fraught with sinister meaning: heat, cold, wet…hands, eyes, nose, mouth. People disappear and words no longer mean what they say. The girl who has been meticulously instructed by her father to use words actually uses them in her own way to tell a different story: “Those who. Then their friends. Those who remember. Who are afraid. And finally everyone. Everyone everyone.” Words are dropped, commas disappear, people vanish as well.

How often do we adjust, embellish, make sly cuts?This is the core question that Tony Webster, the narrator of Julian Barnes latest novel, poses. In some ways, Tony mirrors John Marcher, the protagonist of Henry James’s Beast in the Jungle – a man who lived with the “essential loneliness” of his own life. He describes himself, aptly, as the man who “paid his bills, stayed on good terms with everyone as far as possible, for whom ecstasy and despair soon became just words once read in novels.”We first meet Tony in his school years; he is one of four young and intelligent men who fancy themselves as “being kept in some kind of holding pen waiting to be released into our lives.” One of his more enigmatic friends, Adrian Finn, is brainy and complicated, and eventually connects with Tony’s college girlfriend, Veronica, who, for a brief time, held him in her sway.Now a cautious, divorced man in his 60s, headed towards a secure retirement and still friendly with his ex-wife, Tony receives an unexpected bequest from Veronica’s mother. But why the mysterious legacy? Are his earlier memories accurate? And how reliable a narrator is Tony, anyway? Can a man who is himself a puzzle decode the past?There are two interwoven threads here: the first is Tony’s ruminations on the nature of memory and “what ifs” (“if Tony had seen more clearly, acted more decisively, held to truer moral values, settled less easily for a passive peacefulness which he first called happiness and then contentment”…what then?) And the second is Barnes’ compilation of an old-fashioned almost Hitchcockian suspense story: a bequest out of the blue, curious emails, an impending sense of menace, an elusive past love who continues to remain a mystery.In many ways, this is a brilliant book. On some core level, it is also an unsatisfying one. There are wisps here of other authors – notably, Ian McEwan, Alan Bennett (The History Boys) and possibly Kazuo Ishiguro – deliberate or not. There are subtle clues, which we, the readers, mold to fit our own perceptions of what we believe Tony to be. And, to mime Barnes at the end: “There is unrest. There is great unrest.” I suspect I will want to read this again – maybe even a third time – to catch all the nuances and to sort out why (I’m still not quite sure) I couldn’t quite give this a fifth star....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 19, 2011","Dec 21, 2011","Dec 16, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10746542-the-sense-of-an-ending

Ray Carver’s characters revealed how what we don’t say is more important than what we do, and in this pitch-perfect take-off, the same dynamics apply. Only this time, two old friends from yeshiva school unite years later and find themselves grappling with the question after a recreational drug-induced evening. They have taken different paths: one has married a secular Jew and lives in Florida with their teenaged son; the other has become ultra-Orthodox and has moved to Israel, where she has borne ten daughters.Eventually, the couples end up playing the “Anne Frank game”, a devastating parlor game where each must ask a piercing question: “Who would hide her if another Holocaust occurred? Would you?” The story is exquisitely rendered without a false not, and rips back the curtain on the anxieties that hide behind the vast majority of contemporary Jews todayIt is, in this reader’s opinion, the strongest of the stories. Others that are noteworthy are Camp Sundown, a black comedy of a group of eight geriatric and possibly – but not definitely – demented survivors who take vengeance into their own hands when they suspect that one of their own was at the very least a witness to war atrocities and isn’t as he appears. Another, Sister Hills, chronicles the advancing of Israeli settlements with a King Solomon type of bargain that two young mothers make to save one of their children. And in the last story, Free Fruit for Young widows, the theme is clearly about the choices we make in a world that isn’t always rational.Others are slightly less engrossing: Peep Show and How We Avenged the Blums, which tackle – at their core – the theme of how to be a courageous Jew, with two very different outcomes. Another, Everything I Know About My Family On My Mother’s Side may or may not be autobiographical, but is suffused with emotion and tenderness. Each of the stories focuses on a pivotal question of what it means to be Jewish, the role that religion (secular or otherwise) plays in the character’s life, and how to trust oneself and others in the face of contemporary temptations and atavistic fears.

In this intelligently rendered novel, Dana Spiotta, a meditation-of-sorts on the quest for stardom, she carefully deconstructs the concept of what is valuable and how we strip down to reveal our true identities.Outside artist Nik Worth – appropriately named – is an aging non-starter rock ‘n’ roller, a legend in his own mind, who has spent his lifetime pursuing art for art’s sake. “I grew up to like not having an audience,” he reveals. “Imagine being freed from sense and only having to pursue pure sound. Imagine letting go of explanations, of misinterpretations, of commerce and receptions.” At another point, he muses, “Do you need an audience to crate work, or does not having an audience liberate you and make you a truer artist?” Nik has spent his so-called career pursing that question and creating a sometimes true, sometimes false history in his written work, The Chronicles, filled with self-written s and interviews.Denise, his sister, has remained faithful to Nik; indeed, she is his number one fan. While she is his cheerleader, he is her alter ego. In important ways, they channel the other; she reconstructs his last year and he takes on her voice in certain entries in The Chronicles. In ways, they each rely on each other to provide structure for the other’s sense of self.In many ways, Denise remains disengaged from day-to-day feelings; instead, she is consumed by salacious stories – murders and other human misfortunes – that she views on the nightly news. “Let’s call them breaking events. I don’t mean breaking news. I mean breaking of boundaries.” She is the keeper of her brother and also of her aging mother, whose memory seems to be unraveling more and more each day. Some of the most poignant passages of this book appear in the reinterpreting of the relationship between mother and daughter as the mother’s own grasp of reality.This intrepid novel – about inventing and reinventing ourselves, adjusting our memories to passing time, and creating real and faux windows into our lives through journals, computers, and the ceaseless onslaught of TV news-entertainment, raises deep and provocative questions.

We Need To Talk About Kevin is about motherhood gone wrong, a worthy successor to The Bad Seed, focusing on trials of maternity when a child is “born bad.”Eva Khatchadourian is a highly successful CEO of A Wing and A Prayer, a travel guide series that competes with the likes of Fodor’s or Frommer’s. She marries her polar opposite, a good-looking, layback man named Franklin who has bought into the American Dream hook, line and sinker. Somewhat reluctantly, she agrees to bear a child, the eponymous Kevin.Sullen and unlikeable almost from the start, Kevin is the true “kid from hell.” At four, he destroys his mother’s painstakingly assembled refuge, a study in which she displays maps of her travels. At six, he is still in “poopy diapers”, refusing to be toilet-trained. He taunt his mother constantly by mimicking her with “nyeh nyeh NYEH nyeh” language, he spurns any of her love offerings, and he emotionally terrorizes the kids in his kindergarten. Yet when daddy comes home, he’s the good little boy, creating a wedge in Eva and Franklin’s marriage. “Kevin was a shell game,” Eva reflects,”in which all three cups were empty.” Written in an epistolary form – letters from Eva to her absent husband, Franklin – she bears her soul and does not shy from her own failings as a mother, after Kevin commits a particularly horrendous act. “I didn’t want to “talk to somebody,” she confesses in her letters. “But I’d give given my eye teeth to be able to talk to you.”Brilliant and original with racheting horror, the book is a reflection on the life and consequences of Kevin, and it invites much reflection: “Who is to blame when a child goes bad? Is it conceivable that a child can be innately evil? Is motherhood as glorious as it is billed to be…for all women? What if we are unable to love our offspring? Has our country gone off track with our child worshipping, materialistic focus?”It’s a dark book, a book of psychological scrutiny, a provocative tale of insights and destruction. Ms. Shriver writes, “What drew Kevin’s contempt was not, as I had seemed to imply, our patent incapacity to protect him from the Big Bad World. No, to Kevin, it was the substance and not the ineffectuality of our taboos that was a joke.” By drawing the reader in with flashbacks – by presenting Eva’s failings as well as Kevin’s strange behaviors – Lionel Shriver has created a suspenseful accomplishment....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,Dec 2011,"Dec 08, 2011","Dec 01, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80660.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin

I can’t see it yet, though…”The “something” is a strange place in the road: the place between traditional ways of life and modernity, between nature and the insidious effects of the drug culture, between life and death. There are two stories that are expertly interwoven here: the story of Will, deep in a coma, who reflects on the adventures and tribulations of his life and what has led him to this hospital bed. And the story of Annie, his niece, who is on a quest to find her missing sister, a one-time top fashion model in New York City who has lived the high life in every sense of the word.Joseph Boyden captures the Cree language and sensibility and there are truly gorgeous and memorable moments in this book such as Will’s connection with an aging bear sow, who, like Will, is experiencing “a world of loss”. Boyden breathes fresh air into the life of this aging hunter who is losing his designation as the “bush man in this town” and who deplores the blood feuds and drug dealing that have taken hold of his community.Annie, too, is lost in the foreign world of high stakes modeling in New York – where she ends up in her search for her sister – a high-octane world where human connections mean little and the drug Ecstasy rules the day. After being summoned back home, she and Will strive to rescue each other through the bracing honesty of confessing their experiences.This gripping novel – taking us from a sterile hospital room to the primordial edges of the secluded James Bay, from the northern backwoods of Ontario to the glittering high-rises of the Big Apple – only falters at the end, with a “tie it all together” ending that is unworthy of the rest of the book.

I was absolutely mesmerized by two of his novels: You Remind Me of Me and Await Your Reply. Needless to say, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on his new collection of short stories.Yet somehow, some way, something is missing this time. The stories, all focusing on ordinary men and women who have found themselves in dire or haunting situations, have a “sameness” about them and a certain voice that – at least for me – permeates each one. It is almost as if this time, instead of crafting the stories from the outside, Mr. Chaon is channeling the stories through his psyche, letting them speak through him.The characters – who exist in a sort of twilight realm – include a father who harbors a secret – the emotional abuse of the first wife and child he deserted – who is becoming unglued by his second son’s night terrors. There is a young widower named Critter who believes he is receiving secret messages from the psychic underworld. There is a young man who kidnaps his ex-girlfriend’s son and starts discovering the darkness within him. Characters work their way through their parents’ suicide, through the death of siblings at their mother’s hands, through brotherly road trips that turn out to gruesome.In the eponymous title story, one of the finest of this collection, a couple must cope after hearing that their newborn was born with a rare condition called craniopagus parasiticus…which means that their baby had two heads. Throughout this and the other stories, there is a mood of loss and dread of what comes next, that sense on the part of the characters that things are not going to work out the way they had planned. I should add that I am able to handle dark material better than most. I was blown away by Donald Ray Pollock’s Knockemstiff and Bonnie Campbell’s American Salvage for example.

In Emily, Alone, he took an ordinary old woman – the kind of person you pass by without a glance nearly every day – and revealed the extraordinary life that lies right beneath the surface. Now again, he lasers in on an ordinary couple, heavily in debt – Art and Marion Fowler – who retreat to Niagara Fall as a last-ditch effort to save their marriage and save themselves from smashing over the rocks into insolvency.Married 30 years, the couple arrives at the Niagara Falls bridal suite with different expectations. Art is a romantic at heart; Marion has “a genius for self-pity that defeated even his” and views the trip as a sort of farewell gift to him He is betting the proverbial ranch that he can beat the odds in the roulette parlor and “win back the girl” with an opulent second engagement win. Both are high-stake bets.As in his previous books, Mr. O’Nan is not about flaunting dazzling prose or displaying sleights of hand that will astound and amaze his readers. Rather, he slowly and painstakingly peels the layers back on the marriage that has lost its bearings, both financially and emotionally. As the two navigate the tacky Niagara tourist attractions and the kitschy roulette tables, they begin to join together “on a mission to recapture, by one dashing reckless gesture, everything they’d lost.” Slowly but surely, the reader begins to lose objectivity and root for them to win although it’s anything but a sure bet that they will.The situations that contribute to their estrangement – Art’s long-past affair with a younger woman Marion’s indiscretions with a female colleague from work – can feel a little forced, particularly Marion’s. I never quite believed it. Mr. O’Nan does far better with the couple’s “ballet of accommodation”, which rings far truer.Still, this is a novel that once again establishes Stewart O’Nan as an oracle for the so-called ordinary person, a novel that holds out the hope of exhilarating possibilities when we think all is lost.

In it, your father asks for guidance on what to do when the enormous certainty is upon you that you are playing a losing match? You have nothing left to lose, so you travel to Russia to unearth the answer and eventually realize that both you and Alexsandr are searching for some of the same answers, for different reasons. This is, perhaps, one of the freshest and most imaginative debuts I’ve read lately, and Jennifer DuBois approaches it with grace and thoughtfulness. Some of her prose – truisms, really, stated in the most eloquent ways – tackle that all-important question of why we live at all if we know we cannot win. She writes with a hard-won maturity that most people who are twice her age have not yet gleaned.Take this observation for example: “Personality is continuity. Personality is the myth of continuity. And the person is lost when nothing an be old to him, when nothing can be familiar, when all parallels, all symbols, all analogs are lost; when the world is perpetually stunning; when we are all newborns again, at last.” Or this one: “I thought about what Aleksandr had said about chess, about the paralyzing effects of imagination. I knew that to be true. Any time I let my mind wander more than three steps into the future, it reached the limits of comprehension and fell off the edge.”If prose like this appeals to you, then you must read this book. Narrated in the first person by Irina, the young woman with Huntington’s, and by the one-time chess prodigy Alexsandr, Partial History is rich with description of the USSR in the 1980s; the dreariness, the poverty, the paranoia, the overriding political considerations. There are some missteps that keep Partial History from quite reaching a 5-star rating (although it’s close enough that I am rating it that way). The novel soars when the questions are the most lofty: how to move forward when the odds are stacked against you. When tackling the Soviet bureaucracy, the narrative tends to slow and the sinister and illegal activities seem to be drawn with too fine a point.Still, from start to finish, the book is beautifully plotted with an organic ending, the writing is luscious in many instances, and the themes manage to be universal and original at the same time.

If you asked me why, my stock answer was that “Apple makes it simple.” But, of course, there’s a lot more to the equation than that.Most of it could be summed up in two words: Steve Jobs. He was not an easy person for the public to know or understand, full of complexities and driven by demons despite his Zen studies. Walter Isaacson has come a long way in revealing Jobs: the good, the bad, and the ugly.“His passions, perfectionism, demons, desires, artistry, devilry, and obsession or control were integrally connected to his approach to business and the products that resulted,” Mr. Isaacson concludes. “The unified field theory that ties together Jobs’ personality and products begins with his most salient trait: his intensity. His silences could be as searing as his rants; he had taught himself to stare without blinking.”This intensity led Steve Jobs to adapt a binary vision of the world. Everything was “either/or”: either the best thing ever or totally awful. “The finish on a piece of metal, the curve of a head of a crew, the shade of blue on a box, he intuitiveness of a navigation screen – he would declare them to “completely suck” until that moment when he suddenly pronounced them “absolutely perfect.” He was such a perfectionist that he found it nearly impossible to buy furniture for his home. His quest for perfectionism and ferocious drive totally redefined everything from personal computers to animated movies, music, phones, content creation, tablet computing, brand-defined retail stores, and more. As Arthur Miller once wrote, “Attention must be paid.”I am in awe of the research Mr. Issacson did and the portrait of Steve Jobs that emerges. This is a man who was a creative and intuitive genius, who brutalized those under him with his harsh assessments, who nevertheless got people to achieve flights of imagination that they never believed could be possible. This is a man who could be narcissistic and self-obsessed – who initially abandoned his first daughter Lisa but ended up being quite the father to Reed, his son. This is a man who set priorities and focused with laser attention on every detail, but who suffered from reality distortion and was in total denial of his potentially curable cancer until it was too late. And finally, this is a man who produced some of the simplest-to-use technological innovations on the planet and transformed total industries but who did so without focus groups, onerous meetings, and bloated committees.Finally, this is a man with a fierce dedication to privacy, who toward the end of his life, agreed to this book with no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. What emerges is a definitive and eye-opening book about a man who was motivated not by money nor by philanthropic impulses nor even competitive urges, but the desire to “seek fulfillment by creating a legacy that would awe people.” For all innovators, it is a must-read....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 26, 2011","Nov 27, 2011","Nov 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs

Paul – who deep down is a good guy – will soon be asked to choose between saving his own hide and protecting the family.

The financial world is complicated and she refuses to dumb it down…which is not to say the book is inaccessible.

All of them are quite good and some of them are downright exceptional. She writes about the truest things in life – fragility, loss, and the secrets we keep from each other.Her characters could walk off the pages – that’s how authentic they are. Take Jack Snyder in the opening story, The Guide. He is taking his college-bound daughter, who was blinded as a child, to get her first guide dog. As he struggles to let her go so she can forge her own identity, he is also wrestling with a secret: his marriage to her mother is a sham and he intends to leave her after she departs. The story is beautifully written.Or another story, Immortalizing John Parker, Clara Feinberg, a woman of a certain age, is mourning the loss of her romance. An artist, she is asked to paint the portrait of an elderly man by his wife, and she soon intuits that he is dying. She considers, “It won’t be the same picture, of course, not the one that so interested her. She’ll have to give up on the notion of depicting time itself – as a kindness.”Or, perhaps my very favorite, Tableau Vivant. Jean, who is keeping the secret that she recently had a mild stroke from her husband of many years, is visited by her adult daughter, Brooke. She is forced to come to terms with her daughter’s secret – Brooke’s infidelity. The author writes, “As Brooke opened the door, Jean had the impulse to ask her if she loved him, as though hearing her daughter say it out loud would make it any clearer than it was. As though she herself needed it stated, made official somehow, to justify all that had gone on.”For fans of the short story, and I am one of them, these are beautifully measured, lovingly composed, and intelligently offered to the reader.

As most readers know, Ms. Didion had to endure the cruelest kind of one-two punch: the death of her husband John Gregory Dunne followed by the death of Quintana Roo at age 39. And now, years after writing The Year of Magical Thinking, she revisits this dark year in Blue Nights: “This book is called “Blue Nights” because at the time I began it I found my mind turning increasingly to illness, to the end of promise, the dwindling of the days, the inevitability of fading, the dying of the brightness. Blue nights are the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but they are also its warning.”I quoted this prologue at length because the book is less about Quintana than it is about her mother, the author. Ms. Didion eventually states, “The actual subject was not children after all…the actual subject…was this failure to confront the certainties of aging, illness, death.” Or, in other words, “it’s now about me.”The author eschews the word “privilege” (“Privilege remains an area to which – when I think of what she endured, when I consider what came later – I will not easily cop.”) But it is hard for the reader to NOT think of Quintana Roo as privileged, at least from a material sense. A streak of narcissism definitely exists: Joan Didion asked for – and received – a beautiful baby girl from St. John’s Hospital in Santa Monica (the girl HAD to be “beautiful”), purchased miniature wooden hangers and expensive dresses. Quintana, at the age of five, had stayed at the St. Regis and the Regency, The Dorchester in London, and so on.We learn that Quintana was not a happy child or adult who was terrified of an imaginary “Broken Man” and lived with a fear of abandonment. But more than that, we learn that Didion needed her daughter and that her own vulnerability may have trumped Quintana’s overriding need for protection. Whether Joan Didion was a good – or at least a good enough – mother is for her to judge, although there is evidence that she loved Quintana to the best of her abilities.The more important question in this book is whether memories – or art – can save us from life’s worst tragedies. There is deliberate repetition here – a lot of it – as the author strives to create order from chaos, presumably to answer that question in the affirmative. Yet at the end of the day, there is an elusive, even insubstantial quality about the book as it gradually shifts to the diminishing sense of her own possibilities. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 13, 2011","Nov 14, 2011","Nov 13, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10252302-blue-nights

In Anita Desai’s own words: “We are all in this together, this world of loss and defeat. All of us, every one of us, has had a moment when a window opened, when we caught a glimpse of the open, sunlit world beyond, but all of us, on this bus, have had that window close and remain closed.”In the first, The Museum of Final Journeys, a minor civil servant is approached by an elderly curator and allowed a glimpse of a mysterious museum filled with priceless treasures, and beseeched to save it. Yet he cannot or more accurately, will not: he must forever live with the question: Could he have done more?The middle novella focuses on a bland English teacher, Prema, who is given the opportunity to rise from her humdrum life and serve as the esteemed translator for an obscure literary author she has worshipped from afar. She must come to grips with the reality: “I had been writing under her influence, with her voice; it was not mine. In adopting hers, I had lost mine.”Both the civil servant and the English teacher disappear back into their fates. In the last novella, the key character quite literally disappears: Ravi, the neglected adopted son of careless parents. For a brief period of time, he achieves his dream of withdrawing from the world and creating art out of nature’s materials, only to be “discovered” by a documentary TV crew. To maintain his anonymity, he must pull a sleight of hand and – for all intents and purposes – not exist.Each of the three novellas is lusciously written, illustrating the futility of coming face-to-face with unexpected hopes and possibilities…only to have them dashed.

It’s not a pretty picture yet conversely, the prose shines beautifully in these 14 finely-tuned short stories. In a sentence – or a phrase—Bonnie Jo Campbell captures the thought process of a character and brings him or her to life. Take, for example, Family Reunion, a dark story about an adept girl – a hunter-- who is raped by her drunken uncle and has been rendered mute, as she dresses down a deer: “She hates that first slice that turns the deer from a creature into meat.” Or take a dysfunctional couple – Belle, a meth addict who cannot be saved and Thomssen, the man who tries to save her by offering her shelter in his home: “She would take what easy comfort she could, but she would not look for the roll of plastic or the staple gun, never in a million years would she fix the plastic over the broken window to keep the snow and cold from rushing in after her.”Some of the prose is deceptively simple, as in The Solutions to Brian’s Problem. Here’s Solution #2: Wait until Connie comes back from the “store,” distract her with the baby and then cut her meth with Drano, so that when she shoots it up, she dies. And some is downright elegiac: “The universe seemed darker than he realized, and larger, which made each thing in it, including him, smaller.”In these stories set in the declining Rust Belt economy, people do what they need to in order to survive. In King Cole’s American Salvage, an ex-con beats an auto salvage yard owner to inches of death, and then presents his girlfriend with a wad of blood-spattered cash so she can score some meth. The grotesqueries, violence, and addictions of small-town life are captured in ways that cause the reader to gasp with recognition…even if he or she has never set foot in rural towns like these.These are raw, energetic, unsettling tales, vividly depicted, masterfully told. Bonnie Jo Campbell has earned her place among the very best of story tellers. Readers of American Salvage might also want to check out Donald Ray Pollock’s Knockemstiff, which mines some of the same territory in a fresh way....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Nov 01, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5751707-american-salvage

Told in alternating perspectives, the book chronicles a three week period in two lives that are separated by a millennium: Jeremy, a young engineer who is charged with overseeing the construction of a railroad in East Africa in 1899, and Max, the female ethnobotonist, who travels to Rwanda’s gorilla country searching for a potentially life-saving vine that can be used in the development of a pharmaceutical.Both are self-defined misfits. Jeremy is “different” in a way that eventually becomes apparent; Max leverages the unique qualities of her Aspergers become an expert in plants. “Most people didn’t understand; they consider plants as static as a bureau or a shoe,” she thought. “When she looked at a tree, she saw not a stationary object, but a photo of a dancer in mid-motion, the gesture of its branches describing the battle for food or love.”Gradually, the arcs of the two distinct stories come together. As in Campbell’s The Hero’s Journey, both Jeremy and Max will need to surmount their inner challenges and their worst fears. For Jeremy, he must confront two killer lions who, starved and desperate, are mounting increasingly bold attacks on the camp. Max must confront equally desperate Kutus – a fictional group made up from the details of child soldiers, who are drug-addicted and ruthless in their need to survive. In each case, Jeremy and Max must glean how and why they are connected to the larger world they live in, where humans are not the only force on the planet.Audrey Schulman, in her afterword, states that she has not only visited Africa but read over 70 books to write this novel. It shows. There is plenty to learn from this book: why coltan (the material that cell phones need in order to work) is becoming the downfall of the Congo…why mosquitoes, not lions, are the most feared…why so-called “progress” is gradually destroying the dwindling habitat of the gorillas who are unlikely to survive in the wild. “The gorillas aren’t meant to live this far up the mountains,” Max is told. “At this altitude, there are fewer of the plants they eat and the temps are colder. They’re at their limit.”I read the last 100 pages on an adrenalin high, as the arcs were woven tighter and tighter and the themes began to take center stage. Audrey Schulman does an outstanding job in integrating high-wire suspense with self-discovery. Read this book.

That seems to be the question that’s at the core of Eli Gottlieb’s page-turning psychological suspense novel.Three characters dominate the book: Margot, the narcissistic chameleon who wrecks havoc with the lives of the men she becomes involved with. At the start of the novel, she has taken a dangerous fall down a long staircase and is in the process of recapturing her memories. Who pushed her? It could be Lawrence Billings, a charismatic teacher of “face reading”, the art of the unfair advantage. Or it might be John Potash, recently and happily married in mid-life, who has just been bilked out of his life’s savings by her.The “who done it” matters far less than the “whys” in this story. And the “whys” are not explored nearly enough. The novel alternates between focusing on Margot, Lawrence, and John. The sections on Lawrence and John are scintillating; the reader discovers complex characters that are dealing with the aftermath of Margot’s manipulations, and the pages turn quickly. When Lawrence states, “I thought everyone heard the secret sound track. I thought that everyone saw how people form a little mask to protect themselves, and a little story of which they’re the hero, and how the masks rides the story like a horse into the sunset of their own minds,” Gottlieb is at his best. It’s fascinating to see the masks slip and the anxiety-ridden people underneath emerge.The problem is the character of Margot. She is not nearly as interesting as she could be. Although some back story is provided, I found myself reading quickly to get back to the sections on Lawrence and Potash. We’ve seen iterations of Margot before: the cold, heartless, self-absorbed, beautiful woman who is motivated by human greed and unmoved by human suffering. My conclusion: at least two-thirds of this novel is mesmerizing and well done, but not all of it. Do I rate this 3-stars? Or 4-stars?

VirIf you thought you knew the Columbine story – and who doesn’t, after weeks and months of intense media coverage – prepare yourself for a surprise. Virtually everything you believe about the Columbine killers – Eric and Dylan – is dead wrong.“We remember Columbine as a pair of outcast Goths from the Trench Coat Mafia snapping and tearing through their high school hunting down jocks to settle a long-running feud,” Dave Cullen writers. “Almost none of that happens. No Goths, no outcasts, nobody snapping. No targets, no feud, and no Trench Coat Mafia. Most of those elements existed at Columbine—which is what gave them such currency. They just had nothing to do with the murders.”In truth, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were more popular than many high school kids. They were not bullied; on the contrary, it was they who did the bullying. They did not “snap”; they plotted carefully for months. Days before the shooting, they went to their high school prom. They were not “targeting” anyone. In a perfect world, Dave Cullen suggests, Eric would extinguish the species. “Eric was a practical kid, though. The planet was beyond him; even a block of Denver highrises was out of reach. But he could pull off a high school.”So why DID they kill? Eric – who charmed, manipulated, and cajoled Dylan to join in – was a classic psychopath, a mental illness that allows someone to “torture and mutilate their victims with about the same sense of concern that we feel when we carve a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner.” Psychopaths generally turn to murder only when their callousness combines with a powerful sadistic streak, and Eric fit perfectly into that rare breed that kills to feel superior.Little by little, Dave Cullen builds a masterful case about how the Columbine murders really took place. We learn that the media bought into the first rumors and neglected the true story. And we find out how the evangelist Christians used the Columbine tragedy to their own ends; for instance, the story of Cassie confirming her faith before being shot (immortalized in the book “She Said Yes”) was absolutely false; in fact, she never had a chance to say a word before getting shot.This is a strong investigative book, way up there with other non-fiction books such as In Cold Blood and Helter Skelter. It was 10 years in the making, and Dave Cullen has obviously done exhaustive research, examining police files, interviewing survivors, and checking over the boys’ tapes and journals. It is as much a testimony to hope as it is an autopsy of evil. One of the victims, Patrick Ireland, who is seriously wounded, in giving the valedictory address, says, “When I feel out the window, I knew somebody would catch me. That’s what I need to tell you: that I knew the loving world was there all the time.”...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 20, 2011","Oct 25, 2011","Oct 20, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5632446-columbine

The Krasnanskys – Sometimes freedom is another word for nothing left to lose but often, it’s the act of rediscovering what it means to truly be free. The Krasnanskys – a family of Latvian Jews– have chosen to give up a complex and familiar past to strike out for an uncertain future and, like other Soviet immigrants, must spend months in Rome waiting to secure their visas. At the book’s opening, they are in limbo: abandoned by their sponsor, waiting to break free from bureaucratic red tape so they can continue their journey to the United States or Canada.Tethered by their past, the uncertainty of their future, and their complicated bonds to each other, they are anything but free. Samuil, the patriarch, is a doctrinaire Communist, a Red Army decorated war hero, who witnessed the murder of his father by the White Army and who cares little where his family winds up. He and his wife Emma are there with two sons: Karl, a born capitalist and pragmatist who in many ways repudiates his father’s philosophies and Alec, the somewhat clueless and womanizing younger brother who travels with his new wife, Polina, who left her first husband and her beloved sister for him.This could be played for madcap comedy and it could be played for dry dissertation, but Mr. Bezmozgis finds a middle ground. Little by little, the back story of each of these characters is revealed: Samuil’s initiation and disenchantment with the Red Guards (He muses, “The race was never lost or won. All that happened was that, in the interim, men died. The trick was to die at the right moment, consoled by the perception of victory.”) Polina’s former marriage and the own compromises she had to make, in breaking with her own family to join this new one, and so on.There are beautifully-rendered scenes, such as when Alec assumes his caseworker is making a play for him and leading him to her apartment; instead, she is taking him to the briefing department of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS). Mr. Bezmozgis takes great care to avoid the clichés of the immigrant experience; the characters he creates are mostly self-interested, not all that admirable, and – for that matter – not particularly interested in joining fellow Jews in Israel. Alec says, “Getting killed or maimed in Lebanon, or Egypt, or wherever the bullets were flying, seemed to defeat the whole point of leaving the Soviet Union.” The immigrant stereotypes are similarly given short shrift. Upon attending a community center production of “Fiddler on the Roof”, Samuil groans, “Somewhere in America, Sholem Aleichem was spinning in his grave.”The heart of the book is about family allegiance of disparate family members who seem, on the surface, to have little in common. “What does it matter to them where they were?” muses Samuil. “How were they different from the birds who landed in one place or another, unmoored by allegiances or souls.” In this land of limbo, the only true connection is not to homeland – past or present – but to each other. At one point, Alec says, “The same borders you crossed to get here, you can cross in reverse. It needn’t be hard. For all we know, it might even be easier in reverse.” In reality, there is no moving back…only moving towards each other....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 14, 2011","Oct 19, 2011","Oct 14, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8801805-the-free-world

He and his brother Charlie comprise the infamous Sisters brothers, guns-for-hire who embark on a thrills-and-spills adventure to follow the commands of an enigmatic character called the Commodore, to kill a man named Hermann Kermit Warm.The thing is, Eli Sisters has a moral complexity that his older brother lacks. He’s a tubby man who romanticizes the whores and cleaning women he runs into, in a sort of Don Quixote-ish way. He’s obsessed with his oral health after an unanticipated run-in with a would-be dentist educates him on the joys of the toothbrush. He loves his rundown one-eyed horse named Tub and goes to great lengths to make sure he doesn’t end up in the horse farm. And he’s determined that the killing of Kermit Warm will be his very last.He muses, “It came over me all at once, then: I was not an efficient killer. I was not and had never been and would never be. Charlie had been able to make use of my temper was all; he had manipulated me, exploited my personality, just as a man prods a rooster before a cockfight.” Yet before a would-be murder, he observes, “My flesh and scalp started to ring and tingle and I became someone other than myself, or I became my second self, and this person was highly pleased to be stepping from the murk and into the living world where he might do just as he wished. I felt at once both lust and disgrace and wondered, Why do I relish this reversal to animal?”As in any journey – and this one is a journey to redefine brotherhood and to define self – there are many adventures along the way. The Sisters Brothers encounter a hotel maven named Mayfield who treats them to a Dante’s inferno type of experience, and an entire gaggle of ne’er-do-wells and lusty women who play for our sympathy as well as our disgust.Even though there are many comedic moments, The Brothers Sisters is not a comedy. For one thing, Patrick DeWitt never holds his characters up to ridicule; we end up really liking Eli Sisters for all his faults. In some ways, he rises to Every Man status – a man exploring an unpredictable terrain where danger lurks at every corner.And while the novel pays homage to the Old West, the gold rush, and other legends of western America, it also stakes out its own territory.

In reality, the answer is far more nuanced, and Ursula Hegi captures how a surge of national unity goes so very wrong and how the absence of complexity or doubt can lead even good people astray.Set in Burgdorf, Germany, a teacher, Thekla Jansen, is entrusted with teaching a classroom of boys the year after the parliament building is burned. Like so many, she is not enamoured of Hitler and believes that his time will be limited and things will soon go back to normal. She even rationalizes that her charges may benefit from joining the Hitler-Jugend, with its unity and songs and bonfires.As books get burned and the country becomes enraptured over a new savior, Thekla teaches a Schiller poem, about a young diver’s courage and death. But the last stanza – the one that focuses on his hubris, as the young diver steps toward the mad king and leaps into the rough waters, is left out. For now, she thinks, “let them believe that the young page gets to keep the golden cup. Let them believe he gets the princess and the fairy-tale ending…”The problem is, it’s difficult to separate propaganda from truth and, as Thekla discovers “being true to yourself doesn’t necessarily mean you are truthful…After all, she has felt that reverence as child in church, the emotional pitch that proves your transformation. Easy enough to use that reverence in politics.”Thekla’s awakening is gradual as she begins to realize that individual freedom is different from national freedom, and that it’s become too easy to rationalize giving up those freedoms to live. In this, Children and Fire is a cautionary tale, not only to understand the Hitler era but for our times.I wanted to award this book its fifth star except for a few flaws. The author tries too hard – in my opinion – to weave in other books of the Burgdorf Cycle, most notably Stones from the River; it doesn’t quite feel organic. More troubling, she relies on a rather tired plot device about parentage to demonstrate how vulnerable we all are. Despite these flaws, this is a worthy, thoughtful, and important book that dares to ask the question: “What would YOU do in Thekla’s place?” Most of us, I’m afraid, would come up wanting....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 06, 2011","Oct 09, 2011","Oct 06, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9815786-children-and-fire

It’s been minutes since I finished We The Animals and my heartbeat has not returned to normal yet. This book, in its raw animalistic energy and sheer lyricism, had the same effect on me as David Vann’s Legends of A Suicide. And from me, that’s a high compliment.The book is a slim one – a novella, really --- which spans less than a decade. The first two-thirds makes ample use of the “we” tense; for example, “We wanted more. We knocked the butt ends of our forks against the table, tapped our spoons against our empty bowls; we were hungry. We wanted more volume, more riots. We turned the knob on the TV until our ears ached with the shouts of angry men.” The “we” are three brothers, the unnamed narrator and his slightly older siblings Manny and Joel, offspring of a very young white mother and an equally young Puerto Rican father who are barely getting by.Suddenly – in a very subtle way – the reader becomes aware that the “we” has been replaced by “I” and “they.” “See me there,” the author writes. “See me there with them in the snow – both inside and outside their understanding. See how I made them uneasy…Look at us, our last night together, when we were brothers still.”There are searing scenes that will remain imprinted forever in my mind; for instance, a father who is bathing his young boys and becomes distracted by his wife’s entrance. Suddenly, their parents begin making love as they huddle in confusion. “We hit and we kept on hitting; we were allowed to be what we were, frightened and vengeful – little animals, clawing at what we needed.”Scenes vibrate with potential violence and then dissolve into tender love. Others start with tender love and then burst into violence. A turbulent, yet in its own way, caring marriage is darkly explored and its effects on the three brothers. This magical work – of brothers smashing tomatoes and toothpaste on each other, tiptoeing around while their mother works a graveyard shift in the brewery, and watching each other’s backs, is incredibly rendered.

That it was so mesmerizing that I read 200 pages at one clip, skipping dinner, not coming up for air? That it was so brilliantly done that even now, I am mulling over some key scenes? That it combines very real characters with themes such as existentialism and myth-making and how we learn and why we learn?Let’s start at the beginning. Will Silver is a charismatic and damaged English teacher who teaches at the International School of Paris, where his teaching methods run to the unorthodox. At a graduation party, he hooks up with a buxom and troubled student, Marie de Clery, who seduces him and tells her best friend Ariel, who is used to being idolized and is envious and jealous. Another member of the class is Galad Fisher, who idolizes Mr. Silver, and who is feeling impotent in his own life against his bullying father. In a simple prose style, reminiscent of Camus’s L’Etranger, the key characters – Will, Marie, and Gilad – recite the events that unfold during that significant time. The book is a bain for those of us who love literature; Will Silver urges his students to confront their existential freedom and choices based on the readings they do from Camus, Sartre, Faulkner, Shakespeare and others. Needless to say, moral choices aren’t always as neatly acted upon in real life and Silver sets himself up for a big fall in the eyes of his students.The give-and-take in the classroom is so realistic that it had me on the edge of my seat with crisp dialogue, intellectual discussions, and real-world dilemmas. I have not yet read a book that explores the experience of reading so well. Alexander Maksik writes, “Every text is understood by each of us differently. Wee cannot separate our experience from the way we read. Our experience informs our reading in the same way that it informs our lives, what we see on the street, how we interact with people and so on...” In other words, there is no single truth.You Deserve Nothing is unafraid of tackling some of the most important questions in life: does God even exist? Without God, how do we own our choices and find meaning in our lives? Can we ever go back to safer times and what happens when we can’t connect? (As Will’s colleague says, “Cowards spend their lives alone. Either with people who can’t hurt them or with no one at all.”) What if everything we have isn’t enough?A tribute to the most dynamic teachers, a tale about the bridge between desire and action, a cautionary reminder of what happens when idealism fails, this is a stunning book. It will haunt your days....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 05, 2011","Oct 05, 2011","Oct 05, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9777374-you-deserve-nothing

Julie Otsuka adroitly uses the tense to great effect in her latest bookA chorus of narrators – the “we” tense – is not the easiest voice to pull off. Julie Otsuka adroitly uses the tense to great effect in her latest book, The Buddha in the Attic. It’s a searing insight into an entire community of innocent and naïve Japanese women who arrived in California after World War I, with dreams of their new American life that would soon be cruelly shattered.Each of these women – whatever fate decrees for her – is also connected to the larger body of the sisterhood, women who move from the ship to the farms, the Japanese laundries, and the servants quarters in fine houses…women who obey and often secretly (and not so secretly) hate their husbands, are forced into becoming lovers to their employers, bear children, watch the children die or shun them because of their foreign habits.The style is poetic and haunting. Take the description of the men who will become their husbands: “Some of them asked us to speak a few words in Japanese for them just to hear the sound of our voice. It doesn’t matter what you say. Some of them asked us to put on our finest silk kimonos for them and walk slowly up and down their spines. Some of them asked us to tie them up with our flowered silk sashes and call them whatever names came to mind, and we were surprised a what those names were, and how easily they came to us, for we had never before said them out loud. Some of them asked us to tell them our real names, which they then whispered again and again until we no longer knew who we were.”The novella shifts from poignancy to heartbreak when the Japanese are rounded up and interned during World War II. “Curtains ripped. Glass shattered. Wedding dishes smashed to the floor. And we knew it would only be a matter of time until all traces of us were gone.” It’s a cautionary tale of how easy it is for us to dehumanize the latest immigrants and not recognize the individuality that shines through each of them.Of course, all traces of “them” were not and will never be gone. Julie Otsuka sees to that.

Yet when everything is opened, what remains is a mystThe Grief of Others reminds me of an elegant package, with layers and layers of exquisite paper. Yet when everything is opened, what remains is a mystery box, something that entices and at the same time, disappoints.The writing is, indeed, beautiful. The story opens with Ricky Ryrie in a hospital bed, holding her newborn son who is fated to die within the next few hours. “The whorls of his ears were as marvelously convoluted as any Echer drawing, the symmetry precise, the lobs little as teardrops, soft as peaches,” Ms. Cohen writes.The aftermath of the newborns death will cause a vortex of emotions in each member of the family: Ricky, her husband John, their two children Paul and Biscuit, and John’s grown daughter from a former dalliance, Jess. The children begin to act out in their own ways; Biscuit becomes obsessed with farewell rituals, Paul overeats and rails against his classmates’ assessment of him. And Jess reflects, “What she remembers of the Ryries, the memory she cherished above all of her time with them on that single summer holiday eight years ago, was how shiny she had appeared in their eyes, how good and honorable and clean.” She yearns for that feeling of being prized, at a time when the Ryries have nothing left to give.All of this centers around accepting that Ricky, who finds out in her fifth month that she is pregnant with an anencephalic child – a child that is missing the major portion of his brain and also the top of his skull and scalp – chooses to go forward with her pregnancy, not telling anyone, even John, and pulling off a pretense that everything is fine for the next four months. Were she a religious person – or perhaps a woman who had striven long and hard to bear a child – one could understand her decision. (She is told that the vast majority of women do not go through with the pregnancy). But the reader is given no insight into Ricky and why it is so important for her to carry this baby to term, knowing the heartache ahead, risking her marriage. I felt somewhat distanced from these characters, wanting to understand and relate to them more than I did. Ms. Cohen does a masterful job at portraying a family falling apart, isolated by grief, isolated from each other. If only the pivotal plot point had been developed a little more.

We learn quickly that Walter Cousins – an actuary who weighs risk for a living has just taken an enormous risk of his own while his wife is temporarily institutionalized. He sleeps with the Barbie-doll-like Diane, his young au pair, resulting in her pregnancy. She leaves the baby on the doorstep in an affluent neighborhood, and he is eventually adopted by a well-to-do and loving Jewish family, and given the name Ed King.This darkly humorous and inventive novel follows the arc of Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex. Those who are familiar with Oedipus Rex will know precisely where the novel is going; those who don’t will be in for some jolting surprises. With the second audience in mind, I will not reveal the complicated and ultimately tragic plot twists.I will say that the reimaging of Oedipus Rex and placing it in modern times is extraordinarily clever. Take this exchange from Walter Cousins and his daughter Tina, when she asks about his job: “People in business want hard information about the past and present so they can make predictions about the future.” Her retort: “Why don’t they just live?”Living in the moment is indeed what occurs in Ed King, as he indulges in more and more dalliances with older girls/women. Sophocles mixes with Freud as Ed King’s massive Oedipus complex is explored. Ed is on track to rise to the “king” of a highly successful Internet company called Pythia, but always in the background, his fate is determined, ready to be revealed.This novel could easily have earned 5 stars were it not for some unevenness. Sometimes, Mr. Guterson gets in his own way, with copious detail that derails the reader from the riveting action. Interestingly, the least interesting character is Ed King himself, who seems to be a one-dimensional character who is propelled through life to meet his fate. Contrasted with Diane, his birth mother – a fascinating depiction of a scheming woman determined to survive at any cost – he comes up short.

But in the past, there has been a cool detachment to his work that has made me admire, but not love, his novels. Not this time. I love The Cat’s Table – for its stunning word-images, for its submerged concepts, and for its ability to take a metaphorical journey and turn it into the most universal, but paradoxically, the most unique of themes. It starts with a young boy -- with the same first name as the author – who boards the ocean liner Oronsay on his way from Ceylon to England to go to school in England. Like other authors before him – notably, J.M. Coetzee in Summertime, or perhaps John Irving in Last Night in Twisted River -- Michael Ondaatje launches off from a true event; he, indeed, did take this journey.  Aboard the ship, Michael is relegated to the Cat’s Table, the least privileged place…far from the Captain’s Table.” There he meets two other boys, the quiet and somewhat sickly Ramadhin and the exuberant and boisterous Cassius. “On the Oronsay,” he reflects, “there was the chance to escape all order. So I reinvented myself in this seemingly imaginary world.”The number three is usually significant – the Trinity, of course, and also the psychological id, ego, and superego. And considering that this is a metaphorical journey, I don’t believe it is a stretch to see the three boys as part of one greater whole, a whole named Mynah. Later, Ondaatje will write, “Mynah. Almost my name but with a step into the air and a glimpse of some extra thing, like the slight swivel in their walk all birds have when they travel by land. Also it is an unofficial bird, and unreliable, its voice not fully trustworthy in spite of the range…” Never before or since is Michael referred to as Mynah; only on the three weeks in which he is journeying with his newfound friends.A ship is typically a claustrophobic image, but in The Cat’s Table, it is an expansive one. They meet many solitary people at the table and indeed, throughout the ship at large. There is Miss Lasqueti, who appears to be an eccentric spinster with pigeons, and Mr. Mazappa, a musician with the ship’s orchestra. There is Hector de Silva, who is dying from rabies after a Buddhist monk lays a curse on him, Mr. Daniels with his plant, and a mysterious prisoner who is being transported to England. But most of all, there is Emily, Michael’s slightly older cousin, whom he is entranced by as only a young boy can be.During this rite of passage, seemingly disconnected moments come together and people are revealed to be more than what they are. Mynah – or Michael – is indeed not always the most reliable narrator and, with wisps of Joseph Campell’s The Hero’s Journey, he must understand and integrate the Ramadhin and Cassius parts into his psyche, face down his memories, and become a more unified person.This is an amazing book, a coming-of-age chronicle about boyhood and its loss, the illusions in our lives that persist, the veering of a “voyage whose clear map and sure destination would suggest nothing to fear or unravel”, which turns out to be something quite different.

Such is the power of the remarkable A Blessing On The Moon.Not since D. M. Thomas’s amazing The White Hotel have I read a book that tackles one of the darkest moments of the twentieth century – indeed, of any century – so originally and audaciously. Written in a sort of realist surrealism style, the novel successfully combines fantasy and realism to create an astounding reading experience.The protagonist is a dead Jewish man – Chaim Skibelski, which just happens to be the same name as the author’s great-grandfather, according to the dedication. We learn from the first page that Chaim has been rounded up with other Jews, taken to the forest, and shot. He is dead…but he continues to exist, paradoxically able to think, feel, and experience the life around him.In the course of the book, he will chance upon his Rebbe, transformed into a talking crow, his two deceased wives (one died in childbirth), his many children and grandchildren, his old friends and neighbors. He will meet up with a young dying girl named Ola, who now inhabits his old house with his family and deplores that her father was complicit. He will debate man’s obligation to his fellow man with the decapitated head of a German solider. And he will cross the river to the elegant Hotel Amforta, where nefarious things are happening despite the luxuries offered to the ragtag group of Jews who arrive there.Most of all, he will eventually become a part of a mission to restore the moon, which has fallen, to its rightful place in the sky. This is based on a tale of two pious Jews, who find a boat that takes them to the moon. They discover pots of silver there but when they load the boat, they have piled so much onto their frail craft, that their tethered boat sinks, pulling the moon out of the sky and leaving the earth in darkness. Chaim reflects on the mottled, “Forever now, the moon will appear this way, no longer the smooth and gleaming pearl I remember from my youth.”“A German head talking, a little Polish girl’s bedtime tale, or was it one of the Rebbe’s cryptic allegories, the sort of story he relished telling after the Third Meal, the sun sinking, with its light, from the sky.” This is a story of the pilgrimage to The World To Come, and what a story it is!

The narrator – a fellow professor – is besotted by Oliver, who, at the start of the book, has disappeared over the side of a luxury cruise ship, presumably, a suicide. He muses, “Oliver didn’t despise himself. His problem was more acute and exemplary; he despised being himself.”In flashbacks, as he becomes more and more obsessed with his friend, he becomes enmeshed in his family life. Oliver’s mother Francizka is a glamorous, secret-hoarding matriarch with various accoutrements that may or not be forgeries; she is engaged in a rather suspect relationship with his fraternal twin, Bartholomew. Oliver’s absent BF (birth father) may or not be trading in art from Jewish victims and his stepfather, Jacob Epstein, is slowly dying of Pick’s disease. The narrator sets himself up as the chronicler, the witness.The book veers into more exotic territory: the very meaning of identity. The questions become: Does Oliver understand Oliver? Does the narrator understand himself? Is personal identity a matter of finding the right evidence and drawing the proper inferences? The narrator – a novelist – convinces himself that he is following the Vice family to unearth a story. His wife, Melissa, dispels that notion: “You’re obsessed with him. Him and his extraordinariness. You dress like him, you follow his interests, you even wear the same cologne…Oliver doesn’t appeal to you because you’re a novelist. You’re a novelist so you can dream about wealth and titles and exclusive bloodlines.” Perhaps, he reasons, it is a compensatory mechanism to make him larger, grander, possibly more worthy of love.In this fascinating hall of mirrors, nothing is quite what it seems and the curtains are pulled back to reveal more and more ghosts. Erudite and suspenseful at once, the book questions the shibboleth of self-help gurus: does “myth and invention deliver a means of reconciliation, accommodation and perseverance?” Does The Truth ever really set any of us free?...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 08, 2011","Sep 12, 2011","Sep 08, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10765811-the-vices

The author might cringe at these comparisons, since one of the key themes is finding one’s own voice. So let me reassure: although there are hints of these other authors, the voice is clearly Matthew Norman’s.Tom Violet, the first-person narrator of Domestic Violets, is having a heck of a time. His famous and philandering father, Curtis Violet, has just nabbed the Pulitzer in literature, the latest of a string of prestigious awards. His wife, Anna, may be having an affair, possibly due to his battle with erectile dysfunction. And Tom is languishing as a copywriter at a company he calls the “Death Star”, which he also calls a “daycare for adults”, where too many people “dress more formally than necessary and sit in a constant state of alert, waiting or an opportunity to use a word like “leverage” or “facilitate.” He agrees, “Sure, we may be able to buy iPhones, but we’re handling over our souls and our happiness in the process.”Pushed to the brink by a life that’s becoming rapidly untenable, Tom Violet sets a chain of events into motion that shake up his life and his beliefs of where he belongs in it. At the end of the day, he will need to evaluate his key roles as husband, son, father, friend, and mentor, and will come to some poignant conclusions.All this could be very formulaic and “pat” in a lesser writer’s hands. But these are two-dimensional characters and the issues explored in Domestic Violets are very real. Among the themes explored are: “How does one live authentically? What happens when the ‘men upstairs’ – perhaps known as the muses – desert you? What price does one pay to fit into a stullifying corporate culture? Does one ever outgrow the heartaches of parents’ early divorce? And how does one find peace with oneself – and others – in an imperfect world?”I came into this book skeptically (“another Jonathan Tropper copycat?”) and emerged a believer. I fell in love with this book, which takes the reader on an unexpected journey and doesn’t fall back on easy answers or expected solutions. Oh, and the title? The author writes, at one point that “…domestic violets are nice, too. The Greeks believed they symbolized fertility and potency…” And indeed, the potency is all here!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 31, 2011","Sep 03, 2011","Aug 31, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10790819-domestic-violets

Tor Baz is the orphan son of a Romeo-and-Juliet pair of lovers who defied the tribal code and as a result, were stoned to death by their tribesmen. He becomes a nomad in an unforgiving environment, where the harsh climate, rough terrain, and often brutal tribe justice reigns supreme. To add to the hardships, government officials enforce fixed boundary lines between countries for the first time, ensuring chaos and consternation.After being passed from one “caregiver” to another, Tor Baz grows up to be a confident nomadic wanderer, striving to live peacefully but always the ubiquitous outsider. As readers, we go along for the journey, viewing how these tribes gradually evolve to adapt their cultural practices as borders become more strictly controlled.Although restricted in its scope, this slight book is really universal in its emotions, exploring loyalty and treachery, honesty and bravery, and the support of being part of a clan larger than oneself. After a lifetime of service as a bureaucrat in these terrains, Jamil Ahmad focuses his laser eye on a complex location with its fierce tribal identities. The prose isn’t often magical or haunting; rather, it’s simple and effective and some of the stories shine above others. I recommend this mainly as a way to gain insight into the customs and traditions and tribal anecdotes of a place where little remains secret but much is misunderstood....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 30, 2011","Sep 08, 2011","Aug 30, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11297377-the-wandering-falcon

It’s that kiClosing the last page of Lamb – Bonnie Nadzam’s psychological thriller – I realized I had been holding my breath for the final half-hour. It’s that kind of book…similar to a one-act play where the narrative keeps getting racheted up and screwed tighter, and the audience can never, ever even conceive of an intermission.David Lamb – an innocuous and gentle name if I’ve ever heard one – is a seductive, narcissistic, and damaged man on the sunny side of 50, who is experiencing a heck of an existential crisis. He turns his attention to a young barely adolescent girl named Tommie, “a pale little freckled pig with eyelashes”, who is awkward and socially inept. He advises her and questions her and “the girl answered all of his inquiries as if Tommie were some other person in whom they were both extraordinarily interested in.”By weaving mind-pictures of a fantasy life in the Rockies, he manipulates her into taking a road trip to the Rockies with him. “And there was nothing wrong with that, was there? It was good for her. It was just a little tonic for his poisonous heart. Right?”The book never crosses over to the physical dark side. David Lamb is not your traditional pedophile; he wants something far more dangerous from Tommie. He wants her to absolve him, to testify to his goodness, to give him back some of the innocence of his lost adolescence. He says to her, haven’t always had nice people in my life. It makes me behave a little erratically, right?” In the Rockies, David (calling himself Gary) continues his manipulation and mental seduction of the young Tommie. Bonnie Nadzam wisely makes a plot choice of briefly interjecting David’s girlfriend, Linnie, into the scene. The reader can then contrast how the mental seduction plays out with an adult – and with a child. One of the very creepiest scenes in the entire book is one in which the three come together, Linnie and Tommie intertwined far more than either of them know. “I;m afraid everyone’s in on something really wonderful, Linnie,” David says to her. “…and I don’t know what it is and I can’t be in on it.”Another bold choice Ms. Nadzam makes it to “get out of voice” – increasingly more as the novel progresses. Whose voice is it? The author’s? David’s? Or the grown-up Tommie’s? There is evidence that points to the last theory, especially when we briefly learn what grown-up Tommie thinks about her transformational experience.Once the story takes hold, this book is unputdownable. Anyone who has ever had experience with a narcissist will immediately understand the self-centered, self-focused seduction techniques. “You’re my twin,” David says to Tommie. “Your heart is hewn to mine. Isn’t it. Don’t you see?” And that’s the scariest line of all....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Aug 29, 2011","Aug 30, 2011","Aug 29, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10155571-lamb

Boyle or Don DeLillo – novel without some of the more tempered nuances. The Barbarian Nurseries is a social noImagine a Tom Wolfe – or perhaps a T.C. Boyle or Don DeLillo – novel without some of the more tempered nuances. The Barbarian Nurseries is a social novel, focusing largely on the schisms between the wealthy and the immigrant population in Southern California and it’s good – at times, really good – before dissolving into a disappointing ending.Scott Torres is a programmer, a Mexican American with the emphasis on the American, who has fulfilled the American dream: he lives with his lovely blond wife Maureen Thompson-, his two sensitive and precocious young sons Brandon and Keenan and his baby daughter Samantha in wealthy gated L.A. community he can ill-afford. The Spanish-style house – Paseo Linda Bonita, a redundancy – is an immediate clue that this is not a community that is primed to understand those who toil in its households.After falling on hard times, he dismisses all the servants go with one exception: Araceli, his illegal Mexican maid. One night, Scott and Maureen get into a particularly vicious fight about Maureen’s plan to replace the “petite forest” tropical garden with a very pricey desert landscape. Each separately decides to take a little break from home, leaving the two boys with Araceli. Unwilling and ill-equipped to handle her two charges, Araceli takes off on an ill-advised adventure to downtown Los Angeles, where she hopes to deposit the boys with their grandfather. When the parents return home four days later (each thinking the other is already there) they reach the absurd conclusion that Araceli has absconded with their sons and the result is the predictable media circus.Hector Tobar is at heart, a journalist, and his writing reflects his careful journalist’s eye for detail. That is both the good news and the bad news. On one hand, we – as readers – receive full details on each scene, straight to the freshly dusted living rooms, tautly made beds, and photographs form places south with KODAK imprinted anachronistically on the back. On the other hand, all the work is done for us: Tobar tells us what we are viewing and how we should relate to it, not empowering us to come to our own conclusions.Yet, for about three-quarters on the book, I was swept away with the contrasting worlds, the isolation of those who live affluent lifestyles in gated communities versus those who exist in a “shadow world”. Araceli is portrayed as the strange one, the Mexicana they couldn’t comprehend, but it would fall to her to bring the Torres-Thompson household by restoring the broken routines…” There are truths that Tobar reveals, such as when Arceli divulges the cost of the boys’ private school to her aspirational friends, which “strips them of some of their own moderately elevated sense of accomplishment by revealing just how small their achievements were relative to true American success and affluence.” The two distinct camps – those who live in gleaming white homes in a neighborhood most often described with the adjectives “exclusive, “ “hillside,” and “gated,” – and those who they know only in the most superficial manner, are very well portrayed. Where Tobar falls is in the last quarter of the novel, where the novel becomes obvious and heavy-handed. At one point, when Maureen meets the aggressive prosecutor, she reflects, “This man is telling me what to feel as much as he’s telling me what to think.” I felt the same way about the author. The camps were too finely drawn – the rich and irresponsible parents, the befuddled but blameless Mexican maid. The book becomes more pedestrian and predictable, losing some of its magic.My conclusion: this is a good book that could easily have been a great book. Tobar does capture the complexity of one of our most unique cities – as well as the biases and assumptions that may end up toppling us. For that alone, the book is well worth the read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 10, 2011","Aug 15, 2011","Aug 10, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10898140-the-barbarian-nurseries

You need to pull characters out of a hat, breathe life into them, and weave a spell around the willing reader. Maile Meloy has that gift. Her 11 transfixing short stories are the only way you’d want them – effortless, genuine, and sometimes unpredictable.In all these stories, the characters are faced with a choice (not unlike Robert Frost’s “Two Roads Diverged”). One choice usually takes them in a stable direction; the other freedom and risk. These ordinary people – parents, children, doctors, lawyers, ranchers, wives, plant workers – get to the cusp of their moral quandary and then choose one way – or other.Take her short story The Children. A man facing a midlife crisis is about to tell his eminently intelligent wife that he is about to leave her for a younger woman. With great suspense, we wait for the revelation to come. But he ultimately realizes that he was “doomed to ambivalence and desire. A braver man, or a more cowardly one, would simply flee. A happier or more complacent man would stay and revel in the familiar, wrap it around him like an old bathrobe. He seemed to be none of these things and could only deceive the people he loved…”Or take the first story, Travis, B. A shy Logan, Montana rancher with a limp from childhood polio meets a young teacher – Beth Travis – who is reluctantly traveling miles twice a week to teach an adult education class. He drives miles to pursue her and then goes home unfulfilled with just the ghost of his yearning.Then there’s The Girlfriend: a mourning father confronts the girlfriend of the man who raped and killed his young daughter. “He had thought his faith in order was gone, but it wasn’t true. He had sought consolation in knowing and arranging the facts.” But in the end, he really doesn’t want to know.One more: the ending story, O Tannenbaum. A Montana family – Everett, Pam, and their young daughter – are driving home with a Douglas fir tree on Christmas eve and stops to pick up two stranded skiers with the fortuitous names of Bonnie and Clyde. The push-pull of the threat of “disorder and the steady” thrums a promise of having everything Everett wanted, all at once.Taut, disciplined, and filled with moral force, this collection deserves its designation from The New York Times Book Review as one of the 10 Best Books of 2009....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 10, 2011","Aug 10, 2011","Aug 10, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5948644-both-ways-is-the-only-way-i-want-it

Fate has not been kind to them: Gerd’s husband, a crane operator, divorced her and then died in an accident, leaving the family in a financially precarious position. To make ends meet, she works in a shoe store and runs an ad for a lodger for extra money.  To complicate the situation, Finn’s father’s second wife – a now-widowed drug addict – views the ad and unloads on the family Finn’s half-sister, Linda – a young girl who appears to have mysterious problems that are only gradually revealed. Figuratively, this “poor mite got off the Grorud bus one dark November day with an atomic bomb in a small light blue suitcase and turned our lives upside down.”Linda becomes the mirror in which Gerd, Finn, and others (including the lodger Kristian) eventually define themselves. Gerd, who identifies strongly with Linda, is transported back to an abusive childhood and views herself in the little girl. Finn battles jealousy, bewilderment, and eventually, stirrings of love as he defends Linda from the Norwegian educational system and the school bullies. He reminisces: “Linda was not of this world, one day I would come to understand this – she was a Martian come down to earth to speak in tongues to heathens, to speak French to Norwegians and Russian to Americans. She was destiny, beauty and a catastrophe. A bit of everything. Mother’s mirror and Mother’s childhood. All over again.”Not unlike his regional compatriot, Per Petterson, Roy Jacobsen is (as one publication stated about the latter), “a master at writing the spaces between people.” He succinctly and beautifully captures the incomprehension of a young boy who is trying to make sense of the adult world and his place within it. The increasing bond between the boy and his accidental sister is explored painstakingly and is exquisitely poignant. The portrayal of Linda’s evolution to her new family is genuinely heartrendering.A pedestrian if not downright awkward translation does not serve the stream of consciousness sections well. In the best translations (such as the talented Ann Born’s translation of Per Petterson’s Out Stealing Horses), the reader loses sight that the book is a translation. It takes a little while to get into the cadence and the rhythm. But the authenticity of Roy Jacobsen’s vision wins out with its universal themes: how others become gifts in our lives, unveiling us, and the lengths we go to preserve relationships with those we love. Or, in the words of the author, Something happens to you when someone spots you – you see yourself from the outside, your own peculiar strangeness, that which is only you and moves in only you, but which nonetheless you have not known…” This quiet book is a hopeful testimony to transformative change....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 28, 2011",Aug 2011,"Jul 28, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11403586-child-wonder

Indeed, most fictional books that are set in postOnly those who fully venerate war can think of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as a glorified event. Indeed, most fictional books that are set in post-Hiroshima reconstruction are filled with vivid, colorful and poignant descriptions.So it comes as a surprise that Michael Knight’s The Typist is such a gentle book. It is devoid of precisely what one might expect in a book set in the wake of World War II: no brow-beating, no heart-wrenching, no intrusive authorial political statements.At its heart, The Typist is a coming-of-age book. The protagonist, Pfc. Francis Vancleave (Van) has one claim to fame: he types an astounding 95 words a minute. That skill keeps him off the battlefield, where his days are filled with mind-numbing letters of dictation and paperwork. That is, until he comes to the attention of General MacArthur, nicknamed “Bunny.” Bunny conscripts him to keep company with his young son, Arthur, an isolated boy, who enjoys staging figurine battles with his large assortment of toys.Van is a man who is marginalized by life. As a married man – and we initially know little about his marriage – he does not enter into the “sport” of bedding the panpan girls who “smoked and teased and sent young boys over with indecent propositions.” Unlike his roommate, Clifford, he is a straight arrow, freshly minted from Alabama, more of an observer than a participant. He is able to lose himself in the games of his young charge (would Hannibel outfox Napolean?) and fits in beautifully in Arthur’s isolated world.There is an authentic simplicity in Michael Knight’s sparse writing, a puissance that might elude a less gifted writer. As Van searches for his own legitimacy, Mr. Knight provides him with the luxury of reaching it at his own pace. This is slow, effortless, luxuriant prose, prose that casts a spell, prose that doesn’t waste a word and refuses to erect artificial roadblocks to the story. As far as comparisons, one work that comes instantly to mind is Walker Percy’s The Moviegoer. There is as much power in what is not stated as what is.There is a subtle theme of football that runs through the book – and also in the magnificent story that precedes The Typist, called The Atom Bowl. MacArthur, in shocking disregard of sensibilities, holds a football game to rally spirit in what he dubs the Atom Bowl; “the players trotted out and suddenly the ball was in the air, the Giants kicking to the Bears in the city of Hiroshima, on the island of Honshu, in the occupied nation of Japan.” If there is any doubt of how Michael Knight expects us to read this scene, it is dispelled by the opening story. In it, a young boy interviews his “pawpaw” – the last surviving participant of the Atom Bowl. As his pawpaw relives these “gory days”, the boy asks him, “What about you? Did you ever feel guilty or anything?” The response: “For what?”This small, quiet novel centering on a rootless man in search for something he only dimly understands packs a disproportionate wallop. By juxtaposing complex characters with an economy of language, Michael Knight has created a compelling meditation of a sliver of history....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 25, 2011","Jul 27, 2011","Jul 25, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8879152-the-typist

And indeed it has. As schoolchildren,“War…next to love, has captured the world’s imagination,” said the British lexicographer Eric Partridge in 1914. And indeed it has. As schoolchildren, we rapidly become acquainted with The Naked and the Dead, All Quiet on the Western Front, For Whom The Bell Tools, From Here to Eternity, Catch 22, Slaughterhouse Five…the list goes on and on.But here’s what we don’t read about: the personal battles that are fought on the home front. We don’t get an upfront-and-personal look about the women behind the men and what war means to them…and to the children they create together.Next To Love starts out very strong. We meet three childhood friends in Massachusetts – Babe, Millie, and Grace – whose men are on the cusp of going off to World War II. Ms. Feldman deftly juggles their stories and breathes life into their characters. Grace is the beauty who is married to the heir of one of the town’s most illustrious citizens and has a young daughter; Millie is married to Pete, the pharmacist’s son; and Babe is the feisty wrong-side-of-the-tracks gal who is in a committed relationship with an upstanding man who wants to become a teacher.The period details are handled beautifully. Ellen Feldman summons up an age where instant communication (cell phones, Internet, etc.) did not exist and when lovers wrote their heart out in letters. It’s an age where women were divided into “nice girls” and “tramps” and men kept a stiff upper lip and talked about “honor” and “duty.” And it’s an age when the telegram is feared and one town could suddenly lose several of its beloved American boys overnight. “The husbands speak the language of drills, marches, and officers who don’t know which end is up; the wives speak the dialect of carping landladies, dirty bathrooms and no hot water to wash their hair, and endless spirit-killing games of bridge. Since there is no common tongue between them, they communicate in sex,” writes Ms. Feldman. In this aspect, the book calls to mind another excellent one: Siobhan Fallon’s You Know When The Men Are Gone.Profound change comes after the war. The novel takes on a lot in a scant 300 pages and the characters I had come to love in the first half begin to feel a little bit like stand-ins as the forces of history flow past. Yet Ms. Feldman’s riveting style keeps the reader in a “what’s next?” mode.We are at their side as they try to understand the men who have been forever changed by the horrors of war; one of them has what would be called post-traumatic stress disorder today. We see the toll it takes on their young children who can only fantasize about the fathers they have never met. And we are on the sidelines of what is now familiar milestones: the way that black veterans are shuffled aside after the war, unable to participate in the new prosperity; the treatment of women as frivolous things, not worthy of jobs or deep thoughts; the bigotry against Jews, ironically, after a war where six million of them were callously murdered.Ultimately, the book is focused on female friendship – at turns, courageous, poignant, and fragile. The friendships are not idealized, but rather portrayed to be sustaining and enduring. At its core, it is about survival through life, love, children, war, grief, and resurgence, delivered with just the right amount of drama and intensity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 22, 2011","Jul 25, 2011","Jul 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10837217-next-to-love

That answer is reveaWho is Ines, an illegal African migrant who embarks on a hazardous sea crossing to Italy and Germany in search of her stolen son? That answer is revealed slowly and painstakingly in this haunting new book by Lloyd Jones, author of the acclaimed Mister Pip.When we first meet her, Ines is working as a maid in a tony Tunisian resort, where women routinely supplement their wages with “hotel sex.” In the first few pages, we learn that she is seduced and impregnated by a callous black German guest, Jermayne, who tricks her into signing adoption papers for him and his wife. What Jermayne does not expect is that Ines will put herself in the hands of people-traffickers who launch her on a journey to the Sicilian coast, where she is arrives “bitten as a sodden sea cucumber. From there, she makes her way to Berlin.This story is revealed in bits and dabs, through successive narrations of an unscrupulous truck driver, a group of mostly benevolent alpine hunters, a British film researcher, a selfless French poet, and finally, a blind German man whose father may have been complicit in the war horrors. It is only after the first 120 pages that we meet the three key narrators: Ralf (the blind man), Defoe (his other lodger) and finally, Ines herself. It’s an intriguing way to reveal Ines, a woman who is driven by motherly love and who will do anything and everything to spend time with her stolen son, Daniel, including betraying the trust of those who give her shelter and devotion. Like an old-fashioned detective story – in modern and sparse prose – we discover the contradictions between the narratives, what is real and what isn’t, and who Ines really is, deep down inside.There is a beautiful symmetry about this book. In the first few pages, Lloyd Jones reveals the stuff that Ines is made of. She buys a parrot, that she quickly tires of, and tries to sell it. When that proves impossible she places the parrot on a skiff as it “rolled its eye up to her, to look as though it possibly understood her decision and had decided it would choose dignity over fear.” Much later on, Ines’s constant harping to see her son is described as parrot-like; she, too, chooses dignity as the best way to go.The sparseness of the prose – the distance from Ines – places the reader at a bit of a distance. At times the narrative sags under the weight with a sense of inertia. Yet every time it slows down to a snail’s pace, something – some action, some decision, some revelation – creates more forward momentum. As a reader, I felt as if I were on a slow-moving train that suddenly picked up speed and oh, look at the view!Lloyd Jones reveals a sense of daring and experimentation that shows he has come quite a way since Mister Pip – a book I admired greatly. This subtle book is, in turn, riveting, disquieting, haunting, and at some points, boring, as we follow Ines’s odyssey to pursue her son. It reminded me a little bit of Chris Cleave’s Little Bee in its tautness and ability to summon up emotion.

The linked stories showcase down-and-out losers whose lives are a never-ending cycle of despair, brutality, and bleakness. Here are the drinkers, the speed freaks, the abusers, the borderline (and not so borderline) sociopaths, the profane.Just look at some of the opening lines: “My father showed me out to hurt a man one August night at the Torch Drive-in when I was seven years old.” Or this: “I was coming off the Mitchell Flats with three arrowheads in my pocket and a dead copperhead hung around my neck like an old woman’s scarf when I caught a boy named Truman Mackey fucking his own sister in the Dynamite Hole.”Get the picture? There are no intimate relationships here. A father pumps his son full of steroids so he will win him glory as a Mr. Ohio body builder. An aunt begs her motherless niece to procure a man for her nefarious purposes. A father saws off his son’s hair with a butcher knife after catching him “playing Romeo in the smokehouse with Lucy, Daniel’s little sister’s carnival doll.” Another father rejects his son because he’s not “bustin’ cherries”, forcing him to create a deflowering.At times there’s a grim humor at work, an almost primal tenderness. At other times, the reader is almost forced to look away from these stunted lives. If there’s a flaw in the book, it’s that the reader eventually becomes a bit numb to the grittiness, as the characters – one after the other – fall to low depths.

Those who cherry-pick the Bible – who ignore the parts that say “you can’t ever eat pork or shellfish, and women should cover their heads, and you can’t plant two crops in the same field”, yet laser in on two little verses that may or may not imply that God doesn’t like gays – will likely be offended.Certainly, the existence of those who believe not in absolute rights but in their particular absolute right offends the protagonist, Lucy Hull, a young children’s librarian. Her heart goes out to her favorite patron, a young 10-year-old boy named Ian Drake who is likely gay. His uptight mother, rather than accepting him as he is, promotes a strong anti-gay, evangelist agenda, wanting him only to read books with “the breath of God”. When Lucy finds him camped out in the library after hours, she makes a split-second decision: she spirits him away from his parents and finds herself on the lam on an improvised road trip to Chicago and points east.It is here that I felt the book goes temporarily off course. If this were not a parable but a story about flesh-and-blood people, surely Lucy would understand the ramifications of leaving abducting a young child. And certainly she would quake at the consequences of such an action and seriously consider what she was doing. Her motivation – or should I say, lack thereof -- for such a bold move nearly derailed my reading experience. Fortunately, I stuck with it and discovered the book was less about Ian’s own journey toward his coming-of-age intellectual awakening than Lucy’s. Lucy – the daughter of a Russian Mafia father – has lived with illusions her whole life. As she finds out, everything is not so black-and-white in one’s personal history.And along the way, she learns that there is also no happy ending in many cases. Lucy runs head on into her own sense of hubris when she reflects on her key goal in fleeing with Ian: “There was a picture from somewhere of a place I would take him, maybe a place from a book: a white-walled, sunny house where people took care of children…” Yet as she discovers, “I had failed to understand that the reason you can’t change who you are is that you can’t change where you’re from.”There are some delightful plot twists and some implausible ones. The characters can be engaging…at times, infuriating…and in at least one case, superfluous. The theme, though, remains constant: we cannot lazily rely on accepted platitudes or religious homilies. Instead, we need to be mindful of our journey of self-discovery… and sometimes, that journey takes us back to a place called home. I applaud the author for taking on such an emotionally charged topic.

Here is my :The most compelling dystopian fiction stems from a social and political structure that isn’t far off from the direction we’re already heading.So it is with Hillary Jordan’s sophomore novel, When She Woke. Not since Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale have I read a more disturbing vision of this country and its embracing of distorted religious absolutes. There is an immediacy here that seems not all that far from the truth.Imagine an America where Roe v. Wade has been overturned and where women who dare to have an abortion are now criminalized along with the worst murderers. Like Hester Pryne in The Scarlett Letter, Hannah Payne – who has been caught aborting her baby -- showcases her disgrace for all to see. She has been injected with a chroming virus, which has turned her skin bright red (other infractions are treated with viruses that turn the skin yellow, or green, or blue), and her image is being broadcast to millions of homes who monitor the new Chromes. Still, she refuses to betray the would-be father, a mega-church minister named Aidan who is about to ascend to the Secretary of Faith government opposition.The similarities with The Scarlett Letter – a charismatic cheating minister, a would-be daughter named Pearl, a recreation of the expulsion and suffering of Adam and Eve – propel this novel forward, but do not define it. This is, after all, a thoroughly modern novel: the scaffold is replaced by Reality TV, felons are tracked all the time (calling to mind 1984), he Trinity Party rules and the tenuous line between church and state is thoroughly eradicated.Hannah – a sheltered woman who has never had to fend for herself – must now see where her path leads her. In some of the most harrowing passages, she is forced to enter the Straight Path Center, where women are forced to relive their abortions and carry around dolls in the image of their unborn children. She is admonished to, “Imagine the precious life that you have extinguished: the eyes that will never see the wonder of God’s creation, the mouth that will never suckle your breast or sing God’s praises…” This is religious fundamentalism on steroids.Gradually, Hannah begins to take control of her destiny and understand the limitations of her relationship with God. As she takes another path – for freedom in Canada, a country that has broken off its relationship with the U.S. as a result of its repulsion of chroming – she encounters kidnappers, rapists, and the much-feared Fist, a conservative group that wants to annihilate those who have erred from religious tenets.Suffice to say that this is a page-turning book, very well plotted, and a timely one at that, as Hannah Payne moves along her path questioning the righteousness of a country that politicizes faith and uses it to dehumanize others. The reader is catapulted into Hannah’s reality from page one, experiencing the stigma and humiliation of “red.” When She Woke is, at its heart, about the consequences of letting fear and paranoia take over as a result of a religious fundamentalist agenda. And it’s about the path we need to take to become true to ourselves.In the last 75 pages, some characters will make decisions that did not seem quite organic to their nature. My interest never ebbed, but I did begin to see the author pulling some strings that were not intrinsic to some important personages. Still, I find this to be a very haunting book and I can imagine it becoming a book club favorite....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 14, 2011","Jul 18, 2011","Jul 02, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11045709-when-she-woke

From the first pages, the reader is required to make a pact with the author: to suspend all belief and enter her magical world. If one persists in holding on to vestiges of reality, it’s hard to truly immerse oneself. Like the one outsider in the book – Bailey – the reader is faced with a choice: surrender or go back to the everyday world. Fortunately, I chose to surrender.And ah, what luscious rewards awaited me! Le Cirque des Reves (The Circus of Dreams) is unlike any circus one has ever experienced, randomly appearing in one city or continent and then – poof – disappearing. Quickly, we come to realize that the circus is not what it appears; rather, it is a playing field in which two illusionists, Celia and Marco, compete against each other and manipulate the circus to play out an unstated game. Only one can emerge the victor; there are hints that the loser will not survive. Yet, in an unforeseen complication, Celia and Marco tumble into a magical love where winning ultimately becomes losing.Still the game must go on because these two hold the fates of everyone in their hands – and what a rich assortment of characters it is! There is Chandresh Leferve, the circus proprietor and host of exclusive midnight dinner parties, Widget and Poppet, fiery-haired twins with special powers born on the eve of the circus’s opening, Friedrick Thiessen, the talented clockmaker and chronicler, and many more. Each is bound with the others in a strange world that defies reality and sparks imagination.Not only is Night Circus a riveting and exquisitely written “read”, it also explores the very nature of magic and imagination. One of the characters, the architect Mr. Barris, states, “I have seen a great many things that I might once have considered impossible, or unbelievable. I find I no longer have clearly defined parameters in that matter.” Much later, another character echoes, “Magic…this is the way the world is, only very few people take the time to top and note it. Not a one of them even has an inking of the things that are possible in this world, and what’s worse is that none of them would listen if you attempted to enlighten them.”We have become a world, the author suggests, that is devoid of magic – the magic of possibility, the magic of transformation through love, the magic of believing that within each of us is the power to change our environment…and our futures. This is a poignant message that is right for our unsettled times. In Night Circus, the “victor is the one left standing after the other can no longer endure”. The author suggests that there may be a better way. This expanded message – and this magical world – is sublime and leads me to give this marvelous book my very highest recommendation.

And, like any alchemy, the combustion is magical…and it endures.There is a refreshing fairy tale quality about Vaclav & Lena, a lovely debut book by Haley Tanner. Slowly but surely, I fell under the spellbinding tale of this would-be magician and his girl. It’s an endearing tale that unfolds with gentle fireworks rather than major pyrotechnics – rather like the magic seen in the starlit sky on a summer’s night in Coney Island.Vaclav is a young boy hero: extremely bright, precocious, very loyal and good, and filled with innocent dreams of becoming a famous magician. Central to this goal is the assistance of Lena, a troubled and introverted girl who is imprisoned by her lack of an English vocabulary. In the midst of their grand plans, Vaclav’s caring mother, Rasia, unearths a tragic secret about Lena’s home life with her negligent, drug-addicted aunt. And overnight – for Vaclav – Lena vanishes into thin air, like a cruel magic trick.Fast-forward seven years. Vaclav is now a tall, handsome teenager, attending Brooklyn Tech, thoroughly assimilated into American culture, with a svelte American girlfriend. It’s all come together with him with one exception: he misses his childhood love. Eventually, the reader is reacquainted with Lena and we learn what has happened to her in the interceding years and who she has become in the interim.In a less capable writer’s hands, this book would simply be a boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-regains-girl formula book, with the Russian émigré theme as a major overlay. But Haley Tanner is more than “merely capable.” She writes a love story and like all real love stories, there’s a touch of magic that’s part-and-parcel with the theme. In one interview, she says, “Magicians are like story-tellers in that we know that the quarter does not disappear, that the woman is not sliced in half, but we suspend our disbelief for a time and allow ourselves to be carried away. It is the same thing we do when we read a novel about a character we know to be fictional, but we cry and laugh and love along with them anyway.”We believe in that magic. There is inevitability in this book, a strong belief that love will eventually find its way and what’s meant to be will be. “How did it happen,” Vaclav ponders, “that Lena went overnight from a yearning to an addiction? She seems to have planted herself into this life and sprouted, almost instantly, without his knowing, from a tiny seed into an entire jungle.” We become enchanted with the idea that Vaclav possesses the determination – and Lena possesses the will – to trick ordinary fate and prevail. As a result, we are able to strip away the minor flaws in the plot and pacing (such as repetition) and surrender to the overall ambiance.Vaclav & Lena crosses over to the YA category in the best way; as instruction on the distorted thinking of young and unaware children and the awkward diction and resulting problems of non-English-speaking immigrants. It has much to say about trauma and healing, the role of repressed memories, the assimilation of Russian immigrants, and the real magic we can perform through healing lies and unconditional love. And, as a one-time Brooklynite, I felt the sense of place was excellently depicted.

Erik Larson, in The Garden of the Beast, portrays an all-American family at the cusp of the horrendous Hitler years. And now Tom Perrotta one-ups him by introducing the Garveys…a suburban family who was left behind in the aftermath of a Rapture-like event.To his credit, Tom Perrotta drinks no Kool-aid. Before the event occurs, one character says this about the Rapture: “It felt like religious kitsch, as tacky as a black velvet painting, the kind of fantasy that appealed to people who ate too much fried food, spanked their kids, and had no problem with the theory that their loving God invented AIDS to punish the gays.” Yet suddenly – whoosh! – millions of people simply vanish, including John Mellencamp and J.Lo, Shaq and Adam Sandler Miss Texas and Greta Van Susteren, Vladmir Putin and the Pope. There seems to rhyme or reason as to who disappears. What has happened?No one knows and Tom Perrotta doesn’t even speculate. He wisely leaves it to the imagination of the reader. His focus is not on the “big event”, but rather how those who remain find the will to survive afterward. Some of them – Laurie Garvey, the mother, for example – join Guilty Remnant, a ragtag group that dress in white, continually smoke cancer sticks, and “stand before you as living reminders of God’s awesome power.” Others follow a self-proclaimed messiah, Holy Wayne, who promises to “take on their pain.”And the majority just struggles by – trying to find some meaning in college classes, council meetings, community dances. They try to move forward while grieving the departed and getting by in a world where consumerism, politics, conventional religion, and mindless entertainment have lost their meaning.Kevin Garvey – the father and also the mayor – thinks, “He’d seen this process before: It didn’t matter what happened in the world – genocidal wars, natural disasters, unspeakable crimes, mass disappearances, whatever – eventually people got tired of brooding about it. Time moved on, seasons changed, individuals withdrew into their private lives, turned their faces toward the sun. On balance, it was a good thing.”It’s an ambitious theme that Tom Perrotta takes on – how diminished we are when something vital is being subtracted from our lives, but how we somehow put one foot in front of the other. Perhaps a little too ambitious. The grandness of the apocalyptic event is always lurking in the background, making the players who strut and fret their last hours on stage seem rather ordinary. It seemed to me that the random mystery of a devastating event would have created a universal clamor to find out why; otherwise, how to go on? Tom Perrotta is an engaging writer but at the end of the day, I need to know more about “the end of the day.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Jun 24, 2011","Jun 28, 2011","Jun 24, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10762469-the-leftovers

You’re getting married in a few months to an all-around great guy, your adopted daughter is thriving, your career is more and more satisfying. Except or this large, hard lump in your abdomen, things are really looking up.But that lump does not go away. In fact, it gets bigger. You are anemic, depressed, and more than a little worried about cancer, since you’re a DES daughter. Your gynecologist assures you that everything is fine. And then you get the word that you are pregnant. Six months pregnant. Which, you think, is an impossibility since you were told you were infertile and likely in menopause.This is the scenario that Alice Eve Cohen faced. By profession, Alice is a solo story performer, and she does what comes naturally – she tells a story. And what a story it is.Her insurance plan, predictably, sucks. No high-risk obstetrician wants to take her on since Oxford Liberty pays so little and so late. Since she IS a DES daughter, her cervix is likely to dilate early… plus, at her age, 75% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Oh yes, and she has a deformed uterus, no prenatal care (in fact, she was on heavy hormones) and a definitely ambivalent attitude about carrying to term. At six months, termination of the pregnancy is challenging and yet there’s a good chance the baby might have major issues. Urggghhh!Alice Eve Cohen’s story veers from a black comedy to a Kafka-type nightmare. She doesn’t try to pretty it up. Even those of us who are pro-choice will wince at her desire to end her pregnancy so late in the game, and precisely what that entails. Her inability to feel love for the fetus – soon-to-be baby – is in direct contrast to the love she feels for her adopted daughter, and is fueled, the reader suspects, by her high-adrenalin fear of facing the unknown.She’s besieged with doubts about what is loving and what is right. And she is forced to explore what it truly means to be a mother. It is biology? Unconditional love? Can a real mother’s love by conditional? Is she a real mother…if she doesn’t yet feel love, hopes it will awaken in her, and in the meantime gives us everything to protect the child?Alice can be selfish. Temporarily insane. Infuriating! Yet her voice is authentic and candid and she doesn’t shy from describing exactly how it was – and is. As we take the journey through doubt and a broken medical assistance, we ultimately arrive with her at renewal. While not a literary masterpiece, I give it 5 stars because once started, it’s hard to tear oneself away from the trek....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 23, 2011","Jun 24, 2011","Jun 23, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6390349-what-i-thought-i-knew

In just 180 slim pages, Yoko Ogawa covers a lot of ground and she does it seamlessly: the nature of memory, the poetry of mathematics, the meaning of family and connections, the core of our profoundest relationships. Or, in a phrase: what it means to be human.There are only three main characters within these pages and none of them are named, suggesting the universal aspect of each. There is the Professor, a one-time prominent math teacher who cannot hold memories long due to an accident (his brain is like a tape, erasing itself every 80 minutes). There is the Housekeeper, a single mother who is his new cook and cleaner after many failed attempts with other housekeepers. And there is her 10-year-old son, called Root by the professor, because his flat head reminds him of the mathematical sign for a square root.Each morning, the Housekeeper must introduce herself – and later, her son – to the Professor all over again. He is likely to ask her shoe size or telephone number, as a means of connecting to her mathematically. For example, her birthday, February 20 (or 220) turns out to be “amicable” with the number 284, engraved on his prize watch…a way for him to assert a connection between them. Although he can’t remember from one 80-minute sequence to the next, he remains as paternal, protective, and caring as before. In a fascinating dynamic, the Professor remains constant through most of the book; after all, he is only capable of living in the present. But the Housekeeper and her son also have a future, and through the Professor they learn and grow. The caring connections transcend the Professor’s disability or his forced immersion in the present, making it a story about love in its deepest sense.A dominant subplot is the baseball game and the Professor (and Root’s) love of the Tigers. The Professor, of course, is a fan of the OLD Tigers when Yutaka Enatsu ruled (he can retain nothing since his accident). And Root is looking toward the future of the Tigers, whom he hopes will win a pennant. Baseball – like mathematics – is rife with statistics and the laws of probability. For this math-challenged reader, Ms. Ogawa succeeds in making numbers exotic, alluring, and symbolic of ultimate truths. Just as prime numbers are distinctive, so is each individual. In the end, this is a book about discovery: the mother and son discover what matters in life and each other while the professor discovers them again and again, each time with delight. And through it all, the constant of mathematics and the crux of human nature remain....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jun 22, 2011","Jun 23, 2011","Jun 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3181564-the-housekeeper-and-the-professor

You. ABack in my dating years, I once heard some pop psychologist say something to this effect: in many early meeting situations, two people show up. You. And your representative.The point, of course, is that each of us wears masks, and it takes some time for those masks to come off and reveal whom we truly are underneath. Sue Miller – in what I believe is her most ambitious and boldly rendered novel to date – explores precisely this phenomenon, but raises the stakes. Her main character – Billy Gertz, is a female playwright whose lover, Gus, is on one of the ill-fated 9/11 planes. The problem is that she had determined that the relationship had to end…and had not told him yet. She is suddenly elevated to “grieving widow” status yet knows that her actions – and the responses she gets – are all false. As one character says, “Think if you’d been about to ask someone for a divorce, and they upped and died then. The ambivalent reaction to such an event, the complicated one, is shocking to people. It’s repulsive. It’s unpatriotic. It’s small. It’s personal. It’s unworthy. Such a truth needs to be suppressed.”Billy writes about the experience in a disguised play – the eponymous Lake Shore Limited. One character says to her, “Weren’t you intimidated, writing about Nine-Eleven?” Her answer, “Well of course, it’s not nine-eleven, it’s the Lake Shore Limited.” But is it? There are many themes in this book and one of them is how we transform our experiences – how we use what’s inside us – to create art and indeed, to get by. She and the other three main characters in the book – Gus’s older and devoted sister Leslie, the main actor Rafe, and Sam, who is Leslie’s friend and Billy’s pursuer, all are in the process of transforming their lives, and reluctantly going through their own performances. Rafe, for example, is living with a wife who is afflicted with ALS, and is forced to “act out” – to her – that nothing has changed between them, while using the conflict and pain he’s feeling to inform his art. His character, in particular, is a tour de force.In this “environmentally sound school of human interaction”, you use everything up to get by and move forward. It’s all gist for the proverbial mill. Sue Miller’s themes are both mature and complex: where is the line between performance and reality? How do we transfigure our grief and our joy into true art? How do we reshape ourselves? And what is the price of letting the mask slip and becoming vulnerable once again?This is an introspective novel, an analytical one, that sometimes distances readers from the characters as they struggle to make sense of their lives. But at the end of the day, it’s a novel about beginnings…the proverbial phoenix rising from the ashes and starting Act Two of life…or perhaps, fashioning a new play entirely. It elevates Sue Miller to a whole new stratosphere. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 20, 2011","Jun 22, 2011","Jun 20, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7624512-the-lake-shore-limited

Then, like turning over a tapestry when “For most of our lives the days pass waywardly, without meaning, without particular happiness or unhappiness. Then, like turning over a tapestry when you have only known the back of it, there is spread the pattern.”Elizabeth Hay quotes author Jane Gardham as a lead-in to one of the sections of her brilliant and nuanced novel, A Student of Weather. It is an apt quote, because Ms. Hay is fascinated with patterns…from the most ancient to the most contemporary, from natural patterns to patterns of the heart. The novel begins, as most fairy tales do, with two sisters – one innocent, virtuous and fair and the other dark, homely and inquiring. Both yearn for “Prince Charming” and right away, he appears: “His voice outside, her hand on the coin of frostbite on his cheek, his gift of an apple.” As readers of fairy tales, we are conditioned to know that the apple bodes badly, whether it’s from the Garden of Eden or from the Tale of Snow White. In this case, the apple is offered by a man named Maurice Dove, a handsome botanist, sought after by both sisters…by the beautiful Lucinda and Norma Joyce, her rambunctious younger sister. “There is always central to old fairy tales, the prince’s tendency to forget,” writes Ms. Hay. “But then maybe charm and forgetfulness always go together. Maybe forgetfulness allows you to be charming because people don’t register enough to be a burden.”As Norma Joyce obsessively pursues the much-older Maurice, the age-old patterns of unrequited love begin to appear with hints of Madame Bovary, Tess of the D’Urbevilles and yes, Snow White. Despite herself, Norma Joyce is drawn into a pattern as old as the hills: the spurned lover pursuing a man who is unavailable. Her sister Lucinda will eventually describe her as, “My devious sister who destroys everything she touches.” Whether she can be viewed that harshly – or whether she is a pawn in the pattern of her family life – is something for the reader to evaluate and judge.Ms. Hay is excellent in her description of the natural world, more so than just about any writer I have read. And so, the inevitable patterns of nature merge with the story, particularly two of the three settings (the third is New York): “Saskatchewan, so bitter, tenacious, aware. Ontario so careless and immune. An affair between two landscapes and two histories no less real, and no less ongoing, than are certain romances between people.”Is Ms. Hay suggesting that we are, in essence, a microcosm of the world we exist in? I think that’s precisely what she’s trying to say. We are all in the rhythm of life, which encompasses the outside world, the generations, and the roles we are consigned to play.The tempestuous storms mirror the first half of the novel, when the triangle of Norma Joyce, her sister Lucinda, and Maurice are blowing full force. It provokes an adrenalin rush in the reader, who sits safely, rapt and fascinated by the havoc. And after, when the consequences of this triangle are revealed, the winds get calmer and other patterns are explored – how our early life informs our later life, how the last generation informs the next one, and how life goes on, regardless. I cannot say I was quite as enchanted by the second half, which encapsulates thirty years rather quickly. But I am still in awe of a writer with the mastery of words and the splendor of vision to lovingly craft this world and to weave her tapestry so finely. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 15, 2011","Jun 20, 2011","Jun 15, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/507086.A_Student_of_Weather

But fortunately, Elizabeth Hay is among the best in writers. In fact, she may be one of the very finest writers at work in Canada today.Rich in imaginings, masterfully conceived, flawlessly executed, Alone in the Classroom is a nuanced book, told by the present day perspective of Anne who is researching her family history.It’s a book not easily defined – part murder mystery, part historical memoir, part travelogue, part character study. The characters in question are Connie Flood, Anne’s free-spirited and adventurous aunt…Parley Burns, the school’s shadowy and enigmatic principal whose actions set in force a tragedy…and Michael Graves, a secretly intelligent student who is struggling with what now would be labeled dyslexia. The triangle of these three – teacher, student, and principal – is no accident. Ms. Hay is no doubt aware of the symbolism of “three” in all major religions – the Trinity in the Christian faith, the male/female/uniting intelligence in the Kaballah, the Triple Gem in the Buddhist tradition and so on. The number three represents permanence, and so it is here. “The first triangle in one’s life is always the father, mother and child,” Anne muses. “It sets the troubled tone.” And later, when she walks barefoot down paths swims towards loons, she recognizes that “they went at it beak to beak. Three birds, and one of them an intruder.”These emotional triangles – and the intrusions of one person into an established pair – is a major sub-theme that plays out in all kinds of ways: mother, daughter, grandmother…aunt, niece, lover…husband, wife, love interest…father, son, sister…two dead girls and the potential murderer…and so on.Elizabeth Hay masterfully establishes these triangles and then explores the outer boundaries of their realities. “I’m reminded of what Michael said about memory: the facts don’t matter; everything you learn blurs and merges and contributes to a way of seeing the world.” Perceptions change as one reads on. Sympathetic characters become less sympathetic; obtuse characters become more understandable; connections become more tenuous, and the monsters among us become more nuanced. The author never takes the easy way out as she reveals how the past informs the present, and how the present influences the future.We are all, Elizabeth Hay suggests, alone in the classroom, carrying forth the scars (figuratively and literally) from tender youth. “You don’t get over it, failure in elementary school,” says Michael, who grows up to be a Peter Pan character. And for the reader, you don’t get over the riveting and meticulously drawn prose, that permeates this entire book.I would be remiss were I not to mention the glorious descriptions of the fictional Jewel, Saskatchewan. The ripening of the berries – raspberries (“the soft read fruit like gobbets of blood”), the blueberries (“abloom with ghostly light that erased itself in your fingers”), the jewelweed in blossom, the ripening tomatoes, the ruby-red chokeberries. As in her previous novels, the prose is at its richest in her descriptions of nature.

Alethea Black has taken her place as a short story writer who shows amazing promise.Some of the stories in I Knew You’d Be Lovely are very good and others are excellent. There are none that are bad. She writes like a dream, summing up the unpredictable human condition with insight and perceptive and more often than not, a subtle sense of humor.It took me two-thirds of the way until I had that “eureka” moment: “Aha, this is a book about beginnings.” Take her story That Of Which We Cannot Speak, for example. Bradley, a man who is struggling to find his way back to center after his marriage implodes, meets an attractive doctor with laryngitis at a noisy party. They communicate with a clipboard and, in an unspoken way, find a connection.Or take the story The Only Way Out Is Through. An accidental father takes his very emotionally disturbed son on a camping trip. An act of impending horror is the catalyst for him to reveal the magical time of the son’s birth, ending with, “Sometimes you don’t know what you want until you get it.” Or, one of my favorites, Good In A Crisis. Ginny, an aloof teacher, is resolved to avoid marriage at all costs, supporting her aversion with specific examples: a good friend’s husband taped The X-Files over their wedding videos. Eventually, she finds her way to her first crush, her older and still attractive and single high school teacher. The story of their meeting is real and poignant and fresh a Ginny starts “climbing the stairs – very slowly, like a woman sleepwalking, incapable of imaging the dream that awaits her when she wakes up.”The title story I Knew You’d Be Lovely, focuses on Hannah, a woman who is searching for the perfect gift for Tom, one this is “prescient, ingenious, unique, unforgettable.” I won’t spoil the fun in revealing what that “gift” turns out to be.At the end of the book, Alethea Black writes, “I love it when authors share the backstories to stories and snippets about their creative process.” And she proceeds to do just that, letting the reader know what inspired her to write each story.Except one.That story closes the collection and it’s called Someday is Today, a highly personal and poignant story about the death of her young brother-in-law and a potentially life-altering decision that her sister requests of her.

Mom Liz is fielding social calls and taking her young adopted daughter to sleepovers in a lush and decadent midtown hotel where “the central part of the suite looked exactly like the one Tony Soprano had once rented in a dream sequence…double sink, toilet, shower, and bidet in the size of a studio apartment”_. And their teenage son, Jake? He’s navigating adolescence without a roadmap. Like all too many teens, he feels like he “didn’t belong here, in the city, in this apartment, at this school, or in this family…”This is a family crusin’ for a bruisin’. And it all comes to a head when one morning, Jake received an explicit emailed video from a sexually precocious eighth-grade admirer named Daisy. Stunned and clueless, Jake is overcome by a cocktail of emotions: “He’d gotten hard. He’d gotten proud. He’d been appalled, scared; he’d wanted to show off.” And just like that, without forethought, he clicks and forwards to a close friend…who clicks and forwards to HIS close friends…and so on. Soon the video has gone viral all over the world and Jake – and his entire family – is in murky legal waters.Author and social observer Helen Schulman maps out this family’s spiraling journey to the top – and their ignoble withdrawal from favor. With cinematic pacing – reminding me somewhat of Zoe Heller’s What Was She Thinking?: Notes on a Scandal-- she moves her focus in and out, in a blistering look at a family on the crossroads Had this book remained tightly focused on the ensuing scandal, it would have been a page turning “read.” But Ms. Schulman is more ambitious. She takes on broader themes: how one two-second bad decision can change a teen’s whole future, when today’s technology in involved. How one’s sense of identity and security are all fragile conceits. that can disappear in a heartbeat. And perhaps most important, how wealth without grounding can turn individuals into careless people who use questionable tactics to get optimum results. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, it becomes all too easy. The Bergamots, too, are on the verge of those who “smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness.”With an abundance of psychological acuity, Helen Schulman tracks a family who is having difficulty managing “this beautiful life” – a life that shows cracks and fissures along its underbelly. Everyone is affected, even their young daughter Coco, who, with her overblown kindergarten graduation ceremony and over-the-top schedule, is primed (it is hinted) for a similar destiny to Daisy’s. The ending is wrapped up a little too quickly, but the fragility of the shattered sense of self – for Jake, for the young girl, for Liz and Richard – lingers. No one is insulated by privilege…not when the demands of life have become so complex. And no one, the author suggests – rich or not so rich – is immune to the sudden scandal in a digital age....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 04, 2011","Jun 06, 2011","Jun 04, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10161190-this-beautiful-life

It’s about as raw as it gets – a train wreck that’s careening out of control, but readers can’t help but keep their eyes glued to the catastrophes that unfold.

Henry is, indeed, a caged man – uptight, disconnected, and alienated. Throughout his life, he has amassed the trappings of success: a sterling career, a spirited and beautiful wife, a sensitive son, an elegant London townhome. Yet he has squandered his gifts, eventually losing his marriage, destroying his relationship with his son, and ending his partnership in his firm – not of his own accord.And then, on the eve of the millennium, a random act of violence occurs. Henry inadvertently pushes into a stranger on the crowded Westminster Bridge during a New Year’s Eve encounter. The stranger, Colin, is an angry and vindictive working-class man who strikes back in a disproportionate way and then begins to stalk Henry. A sense of menace ensues, a little reminiscent of the atmosphere in Enduring Love by Ian McEwan.Henry is a man on the edge, ready to “improve”, to re-engage with his family and the world around him. For the first time in years, he truly reaches out, flirting with the idea of a new romance, reconnecting with his ill ex-wife, striving to create a bond with his now-grown son and his grandson, Hal, whom he has only just met. Yet at the periphery of his life is the stalker who is threatening to destroy all that he is working to put together again.The reader knows, from the first 10 pages, that the ending will be heartbreaking and that another random incident will occur that will turn him into a man torn apart by grief. As a result, this is a particularly voyeuristic “read”; we know that none of Henry’s well-meaning actions will save him from a wrenching fate that no parent or grandparent should ever have to endure. We, as readers, maintain full awareness of where life is going for Henry, something that is denied to the protagonist himself. Henry remains blinded; for example, when views a barn owl with his grandson, he thinks, “It had seemed a gift. Like the sighting of a kingfisher, a singling our, a portent of favor. How wrong could a man be?”Throughout the arc of the book, we observe Henry from a distance. He is not a particularly introspective man, a trait that I often find unsatisfying. However, not here; David Abbott pulls it off, propelling us along on Henry’s journey. All the while, we know that Henry will be unable to sidestep his fate; despite his rediscovery of self, he will need to confront the loss and grief that is his destiny. This is, after all, a cautionary tale, a tale about whether “upright” motives can create harmony in lives that are tossed around by life’s circumstances. It asks provocative questions: how much of life results from past choices and how much is totally random?

The list is predictably exotic: skydiving, flying over the North Pole, eating dinner at Chevre d’Or in France.In Joy for Beginners, it’s the women’s turn to enact that list. On an uncharacteristically sunny day in Seattle, six women assemble to celebrate their friend Kate’s clean bill of health from breast cancer. Unbeknownst to them, right before arrival, Kate’s daughter had suggested an exhilarating white water rafting trip down the Grand Canyon. Her friends urge her on and she agrees to go on one condition: that she gets to choose a challenge for each of her friends to overcome.Unlike an adventurous male version, the challenges are far more targeted and subtle. For example, the recently divorced book store owner, Caroline, is asked to sort through her ex-husband’s library and dispose of all the books he left behind, clearing the decks (or the shelves!) for a new life. Daria, a gifted but restless potter, is directed to mold loaves of bread as a way of getting past emotional damage done by a hypercritical mother. Another friend, Ava, who was most reluctant to visit Kate at the hospital, as a result of flashbacks to her own mother’s battle with cancer, is asked to do the sixty mile breast cancer fundraising walk. And so on.If this sounds a little formulaic, it’s because it is. Each woman, in turn, must confront her deepest fears and ask herself: what is holding me back? What am I most afraid of? What obstacle must I overcome to grow and thrive? What does it truly mean to be alive? As each discovers, hidden terrors need not be physically demanding ones, such as whitewater rafting. Often the little things that seem simple on the surface (making bread, tackling an overgrown garden, getting a tattoo) are indicative of more daunting issues.Each chapter comes with its own back story; we get to meet each friend, one by one, learn the task that she has been assigned by Kate, and see how she is capable of accomplishing that task – whether it’s connecting with the right man, gaining a degree of added independence, or delving into herself to face her fears. Unlike real life, there is resolution for each and every woman. By the time Kate takes her own journey down the river – a metaphor, of course, for life – she is able to recognize her own cathartic role in the lives of her friends. “She had been a river, Kate thought, the thing that took them close to death made them suddenly, courageously, honest.”Joy for Beginners is a book for a select audience, primarily women who enjoy inspirational tales about how the power of sisterhood can help transform lives. Its message is a powerful one: by taking risks and opening up to joy, one can surmount any personal obstacle including dealing with divorce, accepting a mother’s failings, embracing independence, acknowledging hidden talents, and choosing to live with confidence. At the end, it’s likely that each woman will question, “What is the one thing in life that I need to deal with to live more fully?” And that, of course, is the point....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,not set,"May 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9851860-joy-for-beginners

The book was Reservation Road, a wrenching psychological study about how a single moment in time can shatter an orderly world into tiny little shards.Now, in a poignantly written sequel, Mr. Schwartz revisits the two families – the Arnos and the Lerners – years later, at the cusp of yet another crisis. But this time, Dwight Arno has served his time, moved from Connecticut to Santa Barbara in an attempt to redefine his life until his estranged son, Sam, shows up. And this time, it is Sam who is in trouble and struggling to come to grips with his anger and his pain.I’m glad to report that Northwest Corner is every bit as good as Reservation Road, if not better. It sings with love and pain and pathos and the beat of the human heart as it strives for connection. Told in multiple viewpoints from both male and female perspectives – including a first-person rendition by Dwight – this book is as powerful as it is moving.In clear, detailed images, John Burnham Schwartz defines the emotional state of his characters in just a few taut sentences. Take Dwight’s musings, for example: “We think we are solid and durable, only to find that, placed under a cruel and unexpected light, we are the opposite: only our thin, permeable skin holds us intact. Hemophiliacs walking through a forest of thorns.” Is that perfect or what?Early on in the book, Dwight and Sam come together for the first time in many years, Dwight is working for an ambitious “family man” in a sports shop. Sam is on the run from college after an impulsive deed that threatens to uproot his life. He has been living with his mother, Ruth, who remains in Connecticut, at a crossroads in her own life. And the other family? The Lerners are fragmented, searching, still unable to break away from the emptiness and reach out to each other for healing. The unbearable pain has been replaced by a type of functionality in each of them. But the hole in the center of their lives remain.The plot is woven slowly and deliberately, with just enough suspense to keep the reader turning pages but make no mistake: this is, at its core, a psychological novel and the “action” is mostly internal. The growth – the so-called “arc” – is an interior one, more than an external one. And therein lies the beauty of Northwest Corner.Is there a shot at redemption? As Dwight Arno reflects, “Wait too long to speak up and you might just miss your shot. You may do your time, but you will never really get out.” Redemption, the author suggests, is difficult and elusive, but possible with enough effort. And the title reinforces this fact. These families have traveled beyond the road where an accident cruelly transformed their lives (Reservation Road) to a wider territory with others (Northwest Territory). They may not have taken their places in the world quite yet, but they’re moving forward. In the end, this is a story of the emotional journeys that these families – and indeed, most of us -- must eventually take to reach a point of self-salvation and completion.

It is precisely that tenet of faith that is required from the McGann family when the eldest son, Art, a popular and compassionate priest, is charged with the heinous crime of pedophilia.But faith in one another doesn’t come easily to the McGanns. Their lives have been carefully constructed upon secret after secret. In fact, everything is so shrouded in secrecy that when Sheila – the narrator – performs an act of rebellion in cutting her hair in a buzz cut, she implies that her hair is short because she has cancer…anything to avoid being viewed as different.The revelation of Art’s pedophilia – if, indeed, he is guilty – strains the already tenuous connections this family has. Sheila is caught between her two brothers: Art, the mysterious and kind older brother and Mike, a former cop-turned-Realtor who has sons of his own and has perhaps already condemned Art deep inside. And then there’s their mother, a woman who is incapable of empathy or communication.This is a surprisingly nuanced look at the Catholic church in its darkest hour and the forces that threaten to tear it apart. At the same time, it is a subtle and psychological look at one family who has trusted that church and now must rely on its faith to go forward. Many who are not religious have questioned who would want to live in the unnatural state of celibacy. Certainly Sheila wonders. Art does not give the boilerplate answer; instead, he responds, “Love to marriage to home and family connect those dots, and you get the approximate shape of most people’s lives. Take them away, and you lose any hope for connection. You give up your place in the world.”Faith, then, is a theme that extends beyond the faith that is played out every Sunday. It is the doubt and redemption of ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinarily difficult circumstances and who must believe in one another…or not.

It is lyrical, poignant, astonishing, at times shocking, and ultimately, unforgettable. It is that rare book with a solid humanitarian plea at its center that never, ever slips into pedanticism or manipulation.The carefully constructed plot hinges on two prisoners – one who is behind the bars of a cage and the other who is constrained by his own spiritual bars. The first is Teza, a “songbird”, a man who has been wrongfully imprisoned by the Burmese government for singing songs that they deemed revolutionary. The other is his self-appointed “little brother”, a nameless boy who goes by the name of his faded t-shirt, which reads, “Free El Salvador.” Only 12 years old, the boy has taken refuge in the prison where he scrounges for food and is unable to leave.These two broken souls – Burmese political prisoner and broken orphan boy -- find each other within this place of horror. At times, their friendship is enabled by the senior jailer Chit Naing, one of the more complex characters in fiction, truly a duck out of water. The junior jailer, known as Handsome, is a sadist who thrives on working out his own childhood demons by the torture and abuse of others.There is much in this book about man’s inhumanity to man. Witness Teza’s musings: “When you make love, you begin the world with another person; two small gods build the first kingdom out of the body’s clay…But when a man beats you in the cage, he wants you to know he’s got the whole substance of you in his hands, your life and your death.” There is also much about how the spirit triumphs and kindness prevails even in the most brutal of places.And there’s much about how even the most physically run-down and broken person can achieve inner freedom when he is true to his core, in this case, the Buddhist principles. Again, Teza: “The Buddha taught us that things change over time…Even if people or things look the same, they’re always shifting or growing or dying. Nothing keeps the same for any of us. So we try to have upekkha, to live with upekkaha. That means to accept the change that comes and be calm in it.”But perhaps most, this is a book about how the power of the written or spoken word are both powerful weapons against oppression anywhere. There is a strong subplot about pen and paper contraband, and the lengths that the jailers go to eliminate it. The pen is, indeed, mightier than the sword.I love this book. I love its complex characters, its poetic language, its plots and themes, and particularly its faith in humanity at a time when that faith is waning.

Yet somehow, we think, “It won’t happen to OUR family.”Wrong! In Jane Gross’s important new book, she reveals that approximately 40 percent of Americans, generally past the age of 85 will follow this course – and that number will only grow with improvements and prevention and treatment of cancer, heart disease, and pulmonary disease.Those of us who are baby boomers – used to being in control – must stand by and (as one of Jane’s bloggers stated), “watch our mothers un-live.” Yet we are stuck in a medical world where old age is considered a disease with a cure…when in reality, precisely the opposite is true. There ARE no heroics and there IS no cure for aging.This one is PERSONAL for me. Like the author, I was thrust into an unanticipated role of moving my vibrant mother halfway across the country to a senior facility nearby. It upended my life, causing never-ending cycles of guilt, resentment, frustration, overriding terror and exhaustion – along with the days of feeling very blessed to have the chance to be a part of my mother’s world again. I trusted my intelligence and management skills and believed I was making all the right choices. I wish I had read this book two years ago! Among the insights that Jane Gross reveals:*The Medicare fee-for-service system is broken. To get paid, doctors must recommend a billable procedure; recommendations on lifestyle changes, for example, translate to no payment. Small wonder that few doctors are opting for gerontology or even internal medicine. Small wonder, too, that one-third of Medicare-age patients have difficulty in finding a new physician!*Researching the best specialist in the field isn’t always (or even usually) the answer. Sometimes, an operation can be performed and the elderly patient dies of the recovery. The question to really ask is, “Is the procedure worth it, given the waning number of years?”*Public policy has yet to keep up with the needs of a populace, inevitably adult daughters, who put their own jobs and marriages at risk. In a study, most respondents wanted caregiver tax credits and respite services – an unlikely scenario given the state of the economy.*There comes a time when the person you viewed as parent and protector begins receding into the past. “She never stopped caring about us, per se,” writes Jane Gross of her own mother, “only in our babble about a world she no longer lived in.”I could go on and on about this amazing book. I read parts of it with tears streaming down my eyes because I’ve been there, done that – the late night trips to the emergency room, the confrontations with a mother who held me initially responsible for her diminishing independence, the vacation guilt, the being labeled an “hysterical daughter” when I demanded certain care levels, the scramble to find quality care and a caregiver we can trust.I was luckier than most: my mother did save up for old age and we rather quickly found a senior facility that concentrated on living, not dying, in The Hallmark (Chicago). And I have a wonderful sister who is on the same page. But the fact that I’m interjecting myself into this  is the whole point: this is shared problem that demands shared answers.

Debut author Alice LaPlante takes an enormous creative risk by narrating her first book through the voice of a 64-year-old retired female surgeon who is in the throes of dementia, and her risk utterly pays off.This is a pulse-quickening, heart-wrenching tale, seen through the eyes of Dr. Jennifer White, who on any given day, may be lucid and competent, sly and untrusting, unsure and frustrated, or even catatonic. I have never felt as if I were inside the mind of a person with Altzheimer’s, and the insights and complexity of this portrayal alone is worth the read.The first line of the story is “Something has happened.” What has happened, we learn, is that Dr. White’s great friend, Amanda, has been found dead with four of her fingers surgically amputated. Dr. White is a person of interest, since her field of interest is surgery of the hand. (“Not for me the hearts, the lungs, or the esophagus…I want the hands, the fingers, the things that connect us to the things of the world.”) Interestingly, this is the part of the book that is showcased by the publicist and is possibly the only weak link of the story. The backstory of Amanda reveals an unpleasant, manipulative and possibly narcissistic woman; it is hard to understand why the friendship endured.Far more interesting – and fortunately, the bulk of the novel – is the story of Dr. White herself. We learn that she has endured an imperfect marriage, that she has not been the best of parents, that even now, she must deal with two adult children who – as they say – have “issues.”Turn of Mind constantly keeps the reader on edge, starting with the basic question: is Dr. White guilty of murder? Can either of her children be trusted? Can she be trusted? What is reality, anyway? Can the past and the present co-exist? What happens when a brilliant mind is compromised? The book centers on the question of identity, all right, but it is not the murderer’s identity as much as it is the protagonist’s identity, which is constantly shifting.At one point, the complex police detective – another well-fleshed character – observes, “People think it’s just forgetting the keys…or the words for things. But there are personality changes. The mood swings. The hostility and even violence. Even from the gentlest person in the world. You love the person you love. And you are left with the shell…”As Jennifer White moves relentlessly towards that shell-like state, as her mind disintegrates, she still clings to bits of reality with scalpel-like insights. It’s not a perfect book, but it’s an inventive one, filled with heart, focused on how insubstantial reality can be.

Two women – Anna and Louise – both beautiful, both married with children, both married to successful and trustworthy men, uproot their lives thorough unexpected yet passionate affairs with two unusual men. Anna, married to another respected physician, falls under the spell of Yves, a writer. In the meantime, Anna’s analyst, Thomas, has gotten into his own tryst with Louise, an attractive lawyer married to a much-renowned scientist named Romain.With a structure borrowed from a game of Abkhazian dominoes – discussed briefly in one section of the book – the various characters (Anna and Louise, their husbands, and their lovers) find themselves interacting in all kinds of combinations. We see, for example, Louise with Thomas (her lover), followed by a chapter with Louise and Romain (her husband), followed by another chapter of Thomas and Romain…and so on.There are a few chapters that stand out for their audacity and their elegance. In one of them, Yves (the author and lover of Anna) is conducting a public reading on the subject of “foreignness.” In the audience is Stan (the husband) who feels like the ultimate foreigner as he puzzles why his wife would be attracted to this man and castigates himself for letting the magic slip away. The juxtaposition of these two men is displayed in a two-column “split screen”, visually communicating the differences between them.In another, Yves is signing copies of his book when a man who he presumes is Anna’s husband enters the bookstore. He lectures Yves on one of the author’s former books, stating, “…he also suspects she loves him because he embodies unpredictability, a sense of adventure she always longed for, but he exploits her dreams to draw her in. It’s a woman thing, like Emma Bovary meeting her Rodolphe.” He forces Yves to hold a mirror to himself.In yet a third vignette, Yves presents Anna with a book he wrote about her – Forty Memories of Anna Stein – bursting with intimacy and immediacy. As readers, we become compliant in the affair, being titillated with the passionate details.And so, love in all its interactions is explored – married love, adulterous love, rejected love, mundane love, love that endures, love that dies out. There are many, many pithy lines and startling revelations from an author who is obviously confident and even playful in his craft.As someone who married late in life, with an understanding of the fragility of relationships and the false euphoria of “love” flirtations, the cavalier attitude of the characters was sometimes unsettling to me. It is a testament to the power and mastery of this work that I placed my own value system aside and read on, enchanted, with no doubt in my mind that this was an intelligently-crafted, beautifully rendered work.

In this extraordinary literary debut, Susi Wyss examines this question through the intersecting lives of five unforgettable women, whose lives intersect in unexpected ways.The opening and closing chapters bookmark these connected short stories – not unlike The Imperfectionists or Olive Kitteridge. We meet Adjoa, a Ghanaian woman living in the Ivory Coast. She is a trusted masseur to Madame Janice, a seemingly affluent American working in Africa for the health service. Adjoa reflects, ”Madame Janice had choices – she could live anywhere she wanted yet she didn’t seem to belong anywhere.” The desire for home is a theme that comes back, again and again.Adjoa has a dream: to return home to Ghana from the Ivory Coast and open a beauty parlor. That dream eventually sees the light of day when she opens the bustling Precious Brother Salon, the “cleanest, friendliest, and most welcoming in the city.” It’s a place where lives begin to intersect and where a feeling of camaraderie grows among the women. In important ways, it, too, is “home” in the deepest sense of the word.The Ghanian “auntie” Comfort comes there, a well-meaning busybody who has recently arrived back home after a disastrous visit to America to visit her son and his white American daughter-in-law, Linda. Linda has her own demons; she is hiding a secret from her past and she also is unable to navigate the cultural differences between her world and that of her husband.The feeling of vulnerability – the fearfulness that one must face and conquer – is something that affects each of these women, white or black. Each has been the victim of crime, loss or betrayal. Each has to make the journey to a psychic or physical place that is her own “home.” And each is seeking a form of self-forgiveness. The author implies that the intrinsic qualities that connect women to each other far outweighs the cultural distinctions that might set them apart.When Janice adopts an Ethiopian daughter, symbolically merging her American and African lives, she vows to help her daughter “grow into a fearless and self-assured woman, despite the reality of a world that could knock you off your feet when you least suspected it.” Hope and growth and fresh starts in life emerge victorious.

In many instances, it took my breath away with its perception and insights.The entire first half of the book is dominated by one story – Walk For Mankind, set on the Stanford campus during the Watergate era. Richard is a somewhat gawky coming-of-age boy, who is shifted between his aloof history father and his do-gooder mother. In contrast to this fragmented family is Sasha, the red-haired and impulsive daughter of the bohemian and exhilarating Horowitz family.With great acuity, Ann Packer explores this momentous year, the escapades into the heady world of drugs and sex, and the fissures that threaten the family and the relationship between the friends. Richard wonders, “How do people do it, pry themselves from their pasts?” Some of the answer will be revealed in the last novella, where we meet Sasha again, this time, at the midpoint of her life and in the unlikely role as caregiver to her hypochondriac and narcissistic father. She has pried herself from the past…or has she really checked out from the drama? Other stories are equally powerful. In Molten, we meet a mother with pathological grief, whose teenage son died an unexpected hero’s death. She reflects, “It was too fierce, the pain of having children. It hurt just to love them, let alone this. It hurt to be impatient, bored, entranced. Always knowing they were on their way away.” She defies the expectation of nobility and we fear for her by the end.Then there’s Jump, the story of distorted expectations – a thin, downcast, Latino youth is revealed to be something entirely different than he seems. And Dwell Time, one of my favorites: a portrait of a seemingly perfect blended second marriage that comes with unrealized demons that have not been shed. Laura, the protagonist, learns the hard way that “dwell time” is the time that the soldiers in us have between deployments. Firstborn, another fine story, is a tender story about a soon-to-be-father whose wife is affected by the crib death of the young son she had had with her first husband.

The author says, “Things don’t go away. They become you. There is no end, as T.S. Eliot somewhere says, but addition: the trailing consequence of further days and hours.”The enormity and suddenness of the accident – and it is a random accident – initially causes Darin Strauss, the teenager, to shut down, to feel over-aestheticized. What do you do, after all, when you’ve become the unwilling instrument for another’s death? How do you incorporate it into your teenage life? You can’t die along with her…so maybe, just maybe, you go to a movie. You try to put one foot in front of the other and strive to feel something that you don’t. It only hits you much later.And hit him it does. Darin Strauss must learn how to decipher the “forming pattern of accusations and consequences.” He must face Celine’s friends – who try hard not to hold him responsible – and even worse, her parents, who eventually turn on him and hit him with a multi-million-dollar court case, which never sees the light of day. Darin goes to college – which he views as a witness-protection program, where he can form a new identity. He takes great pains to make sure that none of his new friends meet any of his old friends; what if someone were to find out? He goes through stomach surgery as the acids literally eat him up from the inside out. He cozies up to people, hoping that when they learn the story, they’ll think, “But he’s so decent and kind.” And he chooses to become a fiction writer, choosing themes (such as with his excellent Chang and Eng), in which one twin lives and the other dies. Truly, he is “twinned” with Celine.This is not a “pity me” book in any way, shape or form. It’s a book about a man who, at a very young age, is cast in a role he had no intention of playing, and who eventually realizes that what he hates about himself most is “feeling lucky for being alive.” This is a nakedly honest and fearless book, and one gleans that the author is writing it because he must, not because he particularly wants to.

Is it truly possible to make those crossings without relinquishing one’s very identity?Geraldine Brooks poignantly explores these questions in her latest novel, Caleb’s Crossing. The story is based on sketchy knowledge of the life of Caleb Cheeshahteaumauk – the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College -- and a member of the Wampanoag tribe in what is now Martha’s Vineyard.This is truly a work of imagination since the sources on Caleb’s brief, tragic, and remarkable life are scant. The voice belongs to the fictional Bethia Mayfield, a minister’s quick-minded daughter who gently (and sometimes, not so gently) defies the rigid expectations of a Calvinistic society that demand silence and obedience from its womenfolk.As outsiders, both Bethia and Caleb – who meet on the cusp of adolescence – quickly bond and form a lifelong friendship. On the sly, Bethia absorbs the language and the cultures of the Wopanaak tribe while out in the field; at home, she secretly absorbs lessons that are meant for her brother Makepeace. Eventually, both serendipitously find themselves at Cambridge. Caleb’s Harvard education – conducted in the classical languages of Latin, Greek and Hebrew – is funded by rich English patrons as an experiment as to whether “salvages” can be indoctrinated into Christian culture alongside the dismissive colonial elite. Bethia goes along with Caleb and Makepeace as indentured help, striving to remain in close proximity to scholars and avoid her fate as yet another small settlement farm wife.There are plenty of twists and turns, trauma and heartbreak, celebrations and sadness along the way; after all, Geraldine Brooks already has a reputation as an absorbing story teller who is able to imaginatively use history to fictional ends. And it would be unfair to even allude to some of these page-turning plot developments.The themes, though, are fair game. This novel particularly shines when it touches upon matters of faith, which rely heavily upon John Cotton, Jr.’s account of his conversations with native islanders in the 1660s missionary journals (according to the author in her epilogue). The pantheistic view of the medicine men is placed in a high-stakes battle against strict and judgmental Calvinism time and again. Bethia muses, “It galls me, when I catch a stray remark from the master, or between the older English pupils, to the effect that the Indians are uncommonly fortunate to be here. I have come to think it is a fault in us, to credit what we give in such a case, and never to consider what must be given up in order to receive it.”Ms. Brooks drums that point home – sometimes a bit too firmly, not relying enough on the reader to form his or her own conclusions. Still, there is intense observation in the “civilizing” of Caleb’s crossing to the world inhabited uneasily by Bethia. She reflects, “In that shimmering, golden light I saw the wild boy I had met here four summers past, no longer wild, nor boy. The hair was cut short and plain, the fringed deer hide leggings replaced with sensible black serge. The wampum ornaments were gone, the bare mahogany arms sheathed now in billowing linen. Yet neither was the youth who stood before me some replica of a young Englishman…” The story of Caleb and Bethia is part of an age-old battle of repressive and misguided individuals who callously use religion to assert dominancy, superiority, and control over others. As a result, destiny and preordination wrestle as the boundaries of both cultures are movingly explored in a voice that may be described as “period language.” From the natural beauty of an early Martha’s Vineyard to the drafty dormitories of Harvard College, this fictional work includes a wallop of historical fact. Those who have thrilled to other Geraldine Brooks’ absorbingly told novels – March, Year of Wonders, People of the Book—will find yet one more reason to rejoice....more",Notes are private!,0,80,1,"Apr 19, 2011","Apr 24, 2011","Apr 19, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9684523-caleb-s-crossing

How does it change between the heady times of first love and the more mundane times of adulthood? Can a relationship sustain itself when desire flees?The book unfolds around the classic and comic play Lysistrata, written by Aristophanes – a tale of women of Greece who determined to withhold sex as a way to end the lengthy Peloponnesian War. Around the same time that the new drama teacher at Eleanor Roosevelt High School chooses the play, the women of Stellar Plains, New Jersey mysteriously and suddenly turn from their husbands, boyfriends, and lovers, no longer wanting to engage in sex.The “stunning bolt of cold air” -- which is the harbinger for the lack of desire – the enchantment and spell – is somewhat evocative of Alice Hoffman’s writing. One by one, the women succumb to it – Dory Lang, who suddenly begins making excuses to her cherished spouse…Bev, an overweight guidance counselor who is smarting over a careless weight-focused remark by her husband…Leanne, a beautiful and definitely non-monogamous school psychologist who loses all interest…Ruth, the ex-lesbian gym teacher and harried young mother who feels sex has become an obligatory date…and last of all, Willa, Dory’s daughter, who is the throes of first love.Had The Uncoupling focused on the question asked by Bev ( “I keep thinking, how did this happen? For a long time, it wasn’t like this) or Leanne (“”Is the choice in life to either have some overly intense and basically impractical relationships with men or else to settle down?”) or even the musings of Dory (“”Maybe sex doesn’t even belong to us anymore. It belongs mostly to the kids, and we’re just hanging around too long”), this might have been a stronger book.But Ms. Wolitzer chooses to go with a magical realism overlay, distancing the reader from the characters and adding a layer of comedy to the very real issues of adults and teenager struggling to maintain intimacy in the wake of young family obligations, perimenopause, and day-to-day stresses.

As her grand theme, she takes on the universal quest for “home”, exploring all the manifestations of that search.The novel is bookmarked by two wars – the Vietnam War and the Iraqi War. It begins in 1973 when the Erickson family of Grenada, Iowa, gathers to celebrate the continuing of tradition with the marriage of the eldest daughter, Anita. As some family members – the parents, Anita and her new husband Jeff – get ready to take their place in pre-defined roles, others are restlessly searching for a way out of Iowa – notably, her brother Ryan.As this fiercely American novel takes this family down the road of its personal setbacks and triumphs, the country, too, is going through its own weaving road: from war to peace to war again, through economic booms to heartbreaking farm crises, from conventional values to sweeping changes. Ryan reflects, “The Great State of Alienation. It stretched from sea to shining sea. Everybody in America is one of two things, either in or out. His wife was right, they’d worked so hard and were so proud to be on the outside of everything they’d grown up with. But they were inside of nothing but themselves.”As the family disperses, each must strive to get back to that central core, a place to feel at ease. Their cousin Chip, a war-damaged Vietnam vet whose mind has become uncentered, has, perhaps, the further distance to navigate; he must travel geographically and emotionally to reach the place that he has known as home.But the others must also embark on their own personal journeys – confronting alcoholism, life-altering accidents, divorces, agoraphobia, professional setbacks, low-grade discount and changing standards to reach their own personal centers and to embrace their own realities. Ms. Thompson seems to imply that we all face our own forms of disconnect, but with recognition and a little effort, we will eventually arrive at “true home.”Only one of the characters – the younger brother, Blake – chooses to stay home and follow what appears to be his predestined path. Although he is the most content of the siblings, he does not escape unscathed. There are days in which he, too, ponders where life has taken him and whether he should have been more of a risk-taker.As a new generation follows their generation, Ryan again reflects, “They had done so much. They had meant to do so much more. Imagine them slipping off to death regretting the task unfinished, the field unplowed, the child unloved.”Richly told, finely crafted, authentically explored, The Year We Left Home gives new insights into home, family, and indeed, the American experience.

And indeed, in many areas, State of Wonder does meet its hype. Its vivid sense of place, for example, is truly magnificent. One can almost feel hear the buzzing and ravenous mosquitoes, feel the oppressive heat, recoil from the floating snake heads, and feel the power of the storms.But at the end of the day, I was torn between one crucial question: is a book that is realistic also authentic? How do the two concepts merge…and how do they differ?Ann Patchett, in State of Wonder, revisits the contemporary adventure story genre, with a provocative tale of an emotionally crippled doctor – Marina Singh – who embarks on an odyssey to the Amazon after learning that her pharma colleague Anders died there. Or did he? His wife doesn’t believe it...and her boss and love interest, Mr. Fox, entreats her to go there to find out what is going on.He is, after all, invested in the outcome of the research that is going on there. Dr. Annick Swenson – formidable and inscrutable – has been there for years, reportedly working on a new drug that will have a massive effect on female fertility, with the prospect of making his company very rich. Dr. Swenson was Marina’s former mentor and her associations with her are fearsome. As a result, the journey to the heart of darkness for Marina is also a plunge into her own emotional terrors.The exploration of these terrors – along with the world of the Amazon and the Lakisha tribe – are masterfully done. But for me, in the end, the characters became sacrificed to the plot, pacing, and setting.I did not believe in the relationship between Marina and her widowed older boss, Mr. Fox; neither seemed capable of sustaining it. Nor was the relationship between Marina and her doomed colleague fully developed. There were a number of missteps. For example, Marina must take a drug called lariam – a malaria preventative that can have major emotional side effects. She chooses to dump the lariam in the trash, exposing herself to almost certain malaria. As someone who has traveled to the region, I know that doxcycline can be used (not quite as effectively) for those who cannot take lariam.Dr. Swenson comes across as very one-dimensional – uncompromising and rigid. Yet (no spoilers), she eventually produces a part of the puzzle based on supposition – which does not fit her character and beliefs. There are many examples of ways in which the characters did not react in an authentic manner, but to enumerate all of them would create spoilers.It is always a little disconcerting to me when I am at odds with a majority of ers whose opinions I respect. I DO recommend State of Wonder for those who love plot-driven adventure stories that are well-written and have a strong sense of place.

Methinks not. What I do know is that Arthur Phillips shares his birthday with the Bard himself, that he was born in Minnesota, and that he is indeed a writer to be watched very carefully. Because what he's accomplished in this novel - er, memoir - is sheer genius.Arthur Phillips - the character - is an unreliable narrator if there ever was one, and points it out in various excerpts. Right from the start when he says, ""I have never much liked Shakespeare,"" we feel a little off-center. The book is, after all about the ultimate Shakespeare scam: his neer-do-well father, at the end of his life, shares with Arthur a previously unknown play by Shakespeare titled The Tragedy of Arthur and entices him to use his Random House connections to get the play published.To say his connection with his father is complicated is an understatement. Arthur Phillips, memoirist, reflects, ""His life was now beyond my comprehension and much of my sympathy - even if I had been a devoted visitor, a loving son, a concerned participant in his life. I was none of those."" Now he wonders: did his father perform the ultimate con? If so, how did he pull it off? And how do the two Arthurs - Arthur the ancient king portrayed in the ""lost"" play and Arthur the memoirist - intertwine their fates?It's a tricky project and Arthur Phillips - the novelist - is obviously having great fun with it. At one point, he urges readers to, ""Go Google the van Meergeen Vermeers...Read James Frey's memoir now...We blink and look around, rubbing the fairy dust from our eyes, wonder whether we might have dreamt it all. Once you know it isn't Shakespeare, none of it sounds like Shakespeare. How could it."" But somehow, it does.The play is reproduced in its entirety in the second part and indeed, it reads like Shakespeare (I read all of his major plays in grad school and have seen many of them performed). It's absolutely brazen that Arthur Phillips could have mimicked Shakespeare so successfully and with seeming authenticity.So in the end, the theme comes down to identity. As Phillips the memoirist writes, ""So much of Shakespeare is about being at a loss for identity being lost somewhere without the self-defining security of home and security, lost in a shipwreck, confused with a long-lost twin, stripped of familiar power, taken for a thief, taken for the opposite gender, taken fora pauper, believeing oneself an orphan.""And, as Phillips the novelist knows, it's also a trick for perspective. The play, the novel, the memoir, the scam can equally be said to be ""about a man born in Stratford in 1565 - maybe on April 22 or 24, by the way -- or about an apocryphal boy king in Dark Ages England or about my father or his idea of me or my grandfather or Dana in armor or or or."" Just as Shakespeare may or may not have written his plays - according to some anti-Bards - so might this new one be a fakery, written by Arthur's fictional father. There is layer steeped upon layer steeped upon layer in this book. It's audacious and it's brilliant. Arthur Phillips convincingly shows us just how easy it is to reinvent a play, a history, or ourselves with just a few sweeps of a pen....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Apr 04, 2011","Apr 08, 2011","Apr 04, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9271896-the-tragedy-of-arthur

And, in many ways, the birds are a metaphor for who they are. Early on, Milly reflects, “The smartest birds built their nests high up in the trees. Some birds, namely the wood pigeon, the clumsiest architect of all, began building their nests but never finished them.”The sisters would fall into that latter grouping. At one point in their lives, they were eager to take wing until the summer of 1947 changed everything. Since the story is told as a flashback, we, the readers, are charged with the task of finding out how – and why.It was, indeed, a pivotal summer. Their long-time trusted priest, Father Rice, pronounces that God doesn’t exist and leaves an astounded congregation for Mexico. Their father, a golf-pro, who loves the lifestyle more than he loves their mother, is in a car accident while coming home from buying ice-cream sundaes; his game, both literally and metaphorically) is forever altered. Milly develops her first real crush with a boy named Asa.But perhaps most important of all, their older cousin Bett arrives for an extended stay from her small town. Rasmussen writes, “While other girls planned their future weddings down to the kinds of cakes they thought they might like to serve, Bett had Twiss running around without her underwear on, hanging from trees in the moonlight invoking spirits who took joy in menacing young girls. She had Milly giving up her secrets only so she could make fun of them.”As dad retreats to his barn and shuts the door to the marriage and Bett becomes an unlikely rival, we know that things cannot end well, although the chain of events is only gradually revealed. We learn, for example, that these sisters realized that summer that they no longer possessed the power to change the future; they took an ordinary wounded starling back to their farmhouse, hoping it would recover from its injuries and take flight for them. But why? That’s part of the journey of discovery waiting for the reader. In heartbreaking detail, Ms. Rasmussen describes the loss of innocence and the tough decisions and sacrifices that will have far-reaching effects. As with many important moments in life, trades have to be made and none of it is easy. And through it all, the setting becomes a “character” in its own right. Ms. Rasmussen expertly recreates the life of a small farming town where townspeople gather and from time to time, dreams are shattered. Using descriptions of a town fair, home-baked pies sitting on checkered tables, and a goat named Hoo-Hoo, Spring Green becomes a little touch of Eden before the fall.Achingly authentic, filled with the loss of girlish dreams and the embracing of what is left, Rebecca Rasmussen weaves a portrait of two sisters who realize that for humans as well as birds, “You couldn’t fiddle with even the tiniest bones without repercussions in the larger ones.” The Bird Sisters is particularly recommended for female audiences who enjoy talented debut authors such as Beth Hoffman, Randy Susan Meyers, Eleanor Brown, and Ellen Meeropol. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,Apr 2011,"Apr 04, 2011","Apr 01, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8755291-the-bird-sisters

Although she was raised in Perth’s wealthy environs and showed early and sustained musical talent, she is abused and ultimately institutionalized by her cruel and loathsome stepfather. Her unlikely rescuer is Agrippas Toad, a dwarfish and crudely mannered farmer who happens to hear her play piano and immediately marries her. By doing so, he attempts to stave off the rumors about behavior that is deemed aberrant in his small-minded farm community. It is the “strangeness” of these two that binds them together.

The very pregnant and unloved Gin forms a dangerous affinity for Antonio, a shoemaker by trade, who gives her the attention and compassion that is missing from her marriage. In the meantime, Toad is more intrigued by John, for reasons that eventually become evident.Gin Boyle – aching from the death of her oldest daughter, Joan, also an albino…scarred from years of feeling like a freak…embarrassed that her life has become circumvented in an ugly small town with a small husband who has an obsession with lady’s corsets...feels the stirring of love under Antonio’s appreciative gazes and through his words. But is it real and can it last?There are some very real strengths in Goldie Goldbloom’s debut book. The prose often soars to lyricism and the description of the landscape is positively breathtaking. In fact, the harsh and unforgiving Australian outback becomes a character in its own right, and the occasional foray of violence – the hunting of the rabbits, the capricious weather, the lopping off of sheep’s tales – is a fine metaphor for the wartime world. In addition, the book presents some meaningful and compelling themes: what “home” really means, the subtle violence of displacement, and how so many of us are prisoners, either literally or metaphorically, either behind bars or within our own skin.Is it a perfect book? Well, no. Goldie Goldbloom sometimes doesn’t trust her reader quite enough and drums home certain messages: You are a stone fortress, not a person. When you opened your gates, it was not to surrender to me, but to capture me.” Or, in response to why Gin didn’t lock up her Italian captives, “They’re men. Not animals.” The build-up relating to Joan ends up being undeveloped and here and there, there’s some melodrama.But even with those fault lines, this is still an imaginative and stunningly original debut, with characters that will remain seared into your memory. Her mesmerizing tale demands to be read and to be appreciated. The book was originally called “Toad’s Museum of Freaks and Wonders” and has been retitled for its U.S. publication.

Or, as the author herAt a time when our culture is open to just about everything, there is one taboo – the grief experienced upon losing a loved one. Or, as the author herself puts it, “If the condition of grief is nearly universal, its transactions are exquisitely personal.It is one of those exquisitely personal transactions that lead me to this courageous and empathetic memoir. As I lose my own aging mother, little by little, I have entered a pre-mourning period that is often challenging for myself to navigate and others to understand.And so I gravitated towards this courageous memoir from a woman who has steered her way those grounds and provides a sort of blueprint of what it’s like to feel unmoored. Meghan O’Rourke’s mother Barbara died in her early fifties; as she lay dying of cancer, Meghan became “irrevocably aware that the Person Who Loved Me Most in the World was about to be dead.”Without the rituals of long ago to guide her, with a strong fear of death that encompassed her since childhood, she “just wanted to flee the pain that lay like a fog in the house; getting away would be like turning a blank page, to a new story, a different one.” The loss is so huge that she “needed to contain it somehow, to put barriers around its chaos.” But like a child who has become separated from mommy, she is in disbelief that “a person was present your entire life, and then one day she disappeared and never came back.”She knows logically that her mother is no longer with her and that it’s up to her and her two brothers to carry her forward in the year. Yet she remains “clueless about the rules of shelter and solace in this new world of exile.” As C.S. Lewis wrote at the beginning of A Grief Observed, “No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.”What is astounding about this memoir – what elevates it above many other so-called “grief books” – is that Meghan O’Rourke is able to take the personal and lifts it into the universal. The pain that any grieving or soon-to-be-grieving person feels – “Am I really she who has woken up again without a mother?” – or a father, or a husband or wife can understand Meghan’s emotions, her monumental agony. It’s a sorority or fraternity that only those who have experienced it are given entry.With both candor and lyricism and an unswerving eye to preserving her truth, the author explores the fifteen months following her mother’s death. She quotes scientific research as effortlessly as she quotes poets and writers who have confronted the grieving process. And at the end, when she resorts to a primal whisper – “Come on, Mom, say another night, stay the night—Stay the night,” she gives voice to all those who struggle with the implausibility of knowing that those they love cannot live forever.

You will not want to come up for air until you’ve reached the last pages. It’s that good.In his preface, Larson writes, “Once, at the dawn of a very dark time, an American father and daughter found themselves suddenly transported from their snug home in Chicago to the heart of Hitler’s Berlin. They remained there for four and a half years, but it is their first year that is the subject of the story to follow, for it coincided with Hitler’s ascent from chancellor to absolute tyrant, when everything hung in the balance and nothing was certain.”The father was William E. Dodd, the mild-mannered and almost laughingly frugal history professor who became an unlikely choice as FDR’s pick for America’s first ambassador to Nazi Germany. The daughter was his bon vivant 24-year-old daughter, Martha, a beautiful and irrepressible woman of great physical appetites, who went along for the adventure of a lifetime. Their story is nothing short of extraordinary.To quote Mark Twain: “Truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities. Truth isn’t.” Certainly, this is a story in which truth trumps fiction. Martha – a compatriot of literary legends Carl Sandburg and Thornton Wilder – quickly takes her place in German society. Larson writes, “As the daughter of the American ambassador she possessed instant cachet and in short order found herself sought after by men of all ranks, ages and nationalities.” One such pursuer was Rudolf Diels, the young chief of the Gestapo, a scarred, confident and charismatic man with penetrating eyes. The other – one of the great loves of her life – was Boris, a senior agent for the NKVD, the precursor of the Soviet Union’s KGB. Although he is nominally married, he falls passionately for Martha and indeed, the two consider marrying. In the meanwhile, her ambassador father is experiencing the crushing disillusionment of recognizing that the Germany of his college years has been taken over by a group of mad men. As a lone voice in the wilderness, he tries to voice concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home, encourage Roosevelt to censor the growing evil, and fight the backstabbing of the wealthy “Pretty Good Club” of affluent ambassadors who race from one glittery party to another. And astoundingly, he tries –without success – to refocus the State Department’s priorities; their “main concern about Germany remained its huge debt to America’s creditors.”Through the eyes of history, we – the readers – know the eventual outcome of the story, and it’s viscerally painful to see all the junctures where Hitler’s nefarious plans could have been stopped – but weren’t. Like his magnificent Devil in the White City, this book is tautly told, with lots of foreshadowing, building suspense at every corner.Ending about the time of “The Night of the Long Knives” – Hitler’s purge and the first act in the great tragedy of appeasement – this is an unforgettable look at life inside Germany in 1933 and 1934, through the eyes of a naïve but well-meaning American father and daughter. It is a tour de force about “complicated people moving through a complicated time, before the monsters declared their true nature.""...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Mar 23, 2011","Mar 27, 2011","Mar 23, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9938498-in-the-garden-of-beasts

Why, then, did Korean author Kyung-sook Shin carefully craft a novel from four different viewpoints?The answer is that the members of this family are unlucky, or at the very least, careless. Through years as a family, none of them ever really knew Mom or understood the sources of her strength. And now she has disappeared in a crowded Seoul subway station, where she and her husband of 50 years were about to board a train. Her disappearance devastates those who are left behind. The story is told from four alternating points of view: Chi-hon, the oldest daughter and a successful novelist, Hyung-chol, the oldest son who is wracked with guilt for not living up to his potential, her husband who inevitably disappointed Mom through his selfishness and adultery, and last of all, Mom. Little by little, a fuller image of Mom emerges, although we, the readers, never really get to know all the facets of Mom either. Chi-hon reflects, “Either a mother and daughter know each other very well, or they are strangers…You realized you’d become a stranger as you watched Mom try to conceal her messy everyday life.” As Chi-hon strives to sort out who her Mom really was, she realizes that, “…because of one thing or another you would push calling her to the end of your list.” Mom had become superfluous in her busy life, a solid presence who was always a little bit of an enigma.Hyung-chol was the favored son who was both idolized and pressured. In the end though, he could not live up to Mom’s aspirations and dreams for him. “Mom’s disappearance was triggering events in his memory moments, like the maple-leaf doors, he thought he’d forgotten about.”The two adult children – and their father – realize, too late, that Mom was an integral part of existence. Father thinks, “When she planted seedlings of eggplant, purple eggplants hung everywhere throughout the summer and into the fall. Anything she touched grew in bounty.” Still, he selfishly ignores her intense headaches and the heartbreaks that Mom is forced to undergo alone. When we get to Mom’s story, we learn some of the background – her arranged marriage, for instance, and a few of the secrets she keeps. But it’s left to Chi-hon to recognize the truth in a letter from her younger sister, “Do you remember asking me a little while ago to tell you something I knew about Mom? All I knew was that Mom’s missing. It’s the same now. I especially don’t know where her strength came from. Think about it. Mom did things that one person couldn’t do by herself. I think that’s why she became emptier and emptier.” Please Look After Mom is a novel that’s distinctly Korean –ancestral-rite tables, the Full Moon Harvest, plum juice and steamed skate – but is also very universal. Every view is explored – Chi-hon and Father’s stories are in second person, Hyung-chol’s is in third person and Mom’s is in first person. And, while the second person tense can become a little cumbersome, the writing is still direct, moving, and graceful.It’s worth noting that Kyung-sook Shin is already a prominent novelist in Korea; the book sold nearly one and a half million copies in South Korea. Translated expertly by Chi-Young Kim, the book is certain to make readers appreciate the hardworking, uncomplaining women who go by the simple endearment “Mom.”...more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Mar 21, 2011","Mar 23, 2011","Mar 21, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8574333-please-look-after-mom

His characters are written with precision, intelligence and detail; they’re so luminously alive that a reader can accurately guess about what they’re eating for dinner or what brand toothpaste they use.In Emily, Alone, Mr. O’Nan revisits Emily, the Maxell family matriarch from a prior book, Wish You Were Alone. Anyone who is seeking an action-based book or “a story arc” (as taught in college writing classes) will be sorely disappointed. But for those readers who are intrigued by a near-perfect portrait of a winningly flawed elderly woman who is still alive with anxieties, hopes, and frustrations, this is an unsparingly candid and beautifully rendered novel.Emily Maxwell is part of a gentle but dying breed, a representative of a generation that is anchored to faith, friends and family. She mourns the civilities that are gradually going the way of the dinosaur – thank you notes, Mother’s Day remembrances, and the kindness of strangers. Her two adult children have turned out imperfect – a recovering alcoholic daughter and an eager-to-please son who often acquiesces to an uncaring daughter-in-law. With her old cadre of friends dwindling and her children caught up in their own lives, Emily fills her days with two-for-one buffet breakfasts with her sister-in-law Arlene, classical music, and her daily routine with her obstreperous dog Rufus, whois instantly recognizable to anyone who has spent life with an aging, sometimes unruly, always goofy and loving animal.Whether she’s caring for and about her Arlene, trying to keep up with family holiday traditions, keeping tabs on a house sale nearby, and trying to do the right thing in educating her children about executor’s duties, Emily struggles to find purpose. She recognizes that time is not on her side any longer and reflects, “The past was the past. Better to work on the present instead of wallowing, and yet the one comforting thought was also the most infuriating. Time, which had her on the rack, would just as effortlessly rescue her. This funk was temporary. Tomorrow she would be fine.”The thing is, we all know Emily. She is our grandmother, our mother, our piano teacher, our neighbor. She is the woman who gets up each day and attends the breakfast buffet or participates in a church auction, or waits eagerly for the mail carrier or feels perplexed about preening teenagers who blast their stereo too loud. She is the one who wonders whether she should have tried a little harder with her kids, even though “she’d tried beyond the point where others might have reasonably given up.” She is the woman who senses that life is waning but still intends to hang on as long as possible and go for the gusto.The fact that Stewart O’Nan can take an “invisible woman” – someone we nod to pleasantly and hope she won’t engage us in conversation too long – and explore her interior and exterior life is testimony to his skill.

As humans face death – our own or our most beloved – the best writers have the ability to rise up and eloquently sing. I speak, of course, of Joan Didion in The Year of Magical Thinking, of Francisco Goldman in Say Her Name, of David Vann in Legend of a Suicide. And now, Michelle Latiolais takes her place in that very top tier of talented writers.Ms. Latiolais masterly interweaves stories of life after her husband Paul’s death with other tales: the complex eroticism experienced by a woman visiting a male strip club with her lover, the trials of traveling to Africa with an anthropologist husband who is researching the unusual eating habits of aboriginals, young children who entice an ancient aunt to craft shapes out of moistened bread crumbs. In a few sparse words, she is able to capture a deep and complex emotion.Take the eponymous title story. Ms. Latiolais writes, “Sometimes wandering is not better; it’s the horror of having no place she is going, no place he needs her to be, wants her to be, no one wanting her the way he wanted her. Then she sleeps, long blacked-out hours, her head beneath pillows, the quilt, and when she wakes, her pink pearls, sinuous on the vanity, comfort her…”Or her story Crazy, when it dawns on a wife that her husband – a drama professor – is unfaithful: “Benson knew an audience at his back when he had one, and he never touched her, never even leaned down to kiss her on the cheek—blameless—but this was how she, his wife in the window, knew. All theater people hugged and kissed all the time. They were crazy for it.” Tales of loss and betrayal – true and fictionalized – are interspersed with sensuous tales and images, of pink porcelain saucers with earthenware lips folded in and fluted out, spawning erotic fantasies…of exotic meals of lamb stew with garlic and baby lima beans, ladled over buttered couscous…of fine fabrics…of longing.And throughout, Ms. Latiolais reveals a love affair with words, the aural and etymological echoes , the mouth-sounds, the ravishing beauty. This is a writer who reflects on her wording (and whose characters do as well) and who also understands the limitations of words when strong emotions render them useless.The writing positively pulsates with pain and beauty, with heartbreak and reverence, with alienation and survival. In short, it is stunning writing, courageous writing; as Ms. Latiolais dances and weaves her way through her grief, it is only in the last story, Damned Spot, that we, her readers, learn the reality of Paul’s death. By then, we are invested enough so that our hearts shatter into little pieces.Some of the pieces in this collection were written long before Paul died; others were written in response to his death.

Doctorow is without a doubt one of the most critically acclaimed authors publishing in America today. He has enthralled me with Ragtime, mesmerized me with Homer & Langley, snapped me to attention with March, and provoked me to think outside of the box with The Book of Daniel. But even though I’ve periodically read his short stories in The New Yorker, I never quite viewed him as a “short story writer.” Well, after finishing All The Time in the World, that perception has definitely changed.Stylistically, Doctorow has been described as a nomad, leaping across styles and genres and this collection is no exception. The reader must dig hard to discover a thread that connects these disparate stories, finally deferring to Doctorow’s own judgment as defined in the preface, “I see there is no Winesburg here to be mined for humanity… What may unify them is the thematic segregation of their protagonists. The scale of a story causes it to home in on people who, for one reason or another, are distinct from their surroundings – people in some sort of contest with the prevailing world.”Take these stories for example: an affluent lawyer at the end of an ordinary workday decides to become an observer of his own life, hiding within feet of his wife and twin daughters. As he pares his life down to the bare essentials, it is only the thrill of competition that brings him back once again.A husband and wife – who have elevated verbal sparring to a fine art – see their relationship exposed in bare relief when a homeless poet who once lived in their home enters their life.A young immigrant, with aspirations to produce films, takes a dishwasher’s job in a criminal enterprise, and agrees to marry the top honcho’s beautiful niece for money. Yet this mercenary decision entangles him in a greater emotional involvement than he ever expected.A teenage boy named Jack – the writer in the family – is prevailed upon by an aunt to write letters to his ancient grandmother in the voice of his recently deceased father…until he comes face to face with his father’s real dream of life.And, in the eponymous final story, an urban citizen, out for a typical morning run, no longer recognizes his city and suspects that a nefarious Program has put him there without his consent.These wide-ranging pieces span time, American geography, and social strata: they’re set in New York City, a nameless but instantly recognized suburbia, the deep south, the Midwest. They move from the late nineteenth century to a moment in the future. They are populated with disenchanted lawyer, a down-on-her-luck teenager, an increasingly cynical priest, even a son of a serial murderer. They sing with tension, poignancy, and authenticity. And they evoke the past, present and future in ways that are both mysterious and familiar.In short, this is yet the latest indication that E.L.

Certainly, it’s the story of two little kings, Raj and David, as reflected from the 70 year old memory of Raj, the survivor. The title – The Last Brother – has dual meaning. Raj is, indeed, the last brother of three; he lost his younger and older brothers in the midst of an apocalyptic storm that caught the three of them unaware in the woods. But the title can also be construed as a tribute to David, who becomes, in many ways, Raj’s last brother: “I wanted a brother, two brothers, a family as before, games as before, I wanted to be protected as before, I wanted to catch sight of those shadows out of the corner of my eye that let you know you are not alone. I was struggling desperately to resist everything that took me further away from childhood…”Raj lives a brute existence in Mauritius with a violent, drunken, mean-spirited father who viciously beats his surviving son and his wife. In Beau Brissau, Raj’s father takes a job as a guard in a prison that holds 1,500 Jewish exiles who have been refused entry to Israel based on formalities. After one vicious beating, Raj ends up in the prison hospital, where he meets the blond-haired David who suffers from malaria.Nature in the tropic is another character in this tale; Raj feels in harmony with the surrounding landscape, filled with sweet-smelling stream and camphor trees and abundant mangos, lychees, and logans. But nature, is not always benevolent: it can rail without warning, it can deceive, and it can create havoc and death. It is, of course, a metaphor for life itself. And eventually – as we learn at the very beginning – it can separate bonds that are painstakingly created by two young and broken boys.This wistfulness and ripeness of the prose recall French-Russian author Andrei Makine; no surprise, since they share a translator. The story of two outcasts – a young tropical abused child and his exiled and orphaned friend – and their quixotic quest for freedom in a world that denies it is, at times, heartbreaking. There is a misstep at the ending, I think, when Ms. Appanah summarizes the implications of this little-known episode of Mauritian history, which momentarily causes the spell to disperse.

Below is my ...What does it mean to be biracial and free in postmillennial America? The writer James Baldwin is quoted as saying, “Freedom is something that people take and people are as free as they want to be.”By that definition, do the young interracial women that inhabit Danzy Senna’s first collection of short stories want to be free? Or do they want to belong to a collective…something, larger than themselves? The answer, as one might suspect, is complicated.Danzy Senna – author of Caucasia, daughter of the African-Mexican poet Carl Senna and Fanny Howe, a white American of Irish descent – explores this question from her unique vantage point. Each of her characters is struggling for self-identity; each is hopeful and yet yearning for more. The short story collection is populated with ambivalent women, detached husbands, troubled girlfriends, and young babies and toddlers. In the eponymous title story, Lara, a New Yorker who is anticipating her first byline from an obscure magazine tries hard to love her fate as a childless woman. Still, when she receives a mistaken call from a young girl who believes Lara is her mother, she goes into self-denial: “She had a family – a child – and the knowledge of this made her feel complete, though she knew she was not supposed to buy into such retrograde logic.” Yet still she does, with nebulous “what-ifs.”Then there’s Livy, a Brooklyn-born artist and new mother who has found happiness with a Santa Fe gallery owner. When Livy hosts an old and spurned friend, she discovers that the connection between them has disintegrated: “She felt the daughter-self, young and vain, dying, and the mother-self, huge and sad, rising up in its wake, linking her to nothing less than history.” And we meet the liberal and African-American couple Cassie Duncan; tensions flare when their pre-schooler is admitted to a very tony private school and a decision must be made.These women – and others – struggle with identity in a world that sometimes considers them interchangeable. (In the story What’s The Matter With Helga and Dave?, two women who look nothing alike are mistaken for each other because each is part of a supposedly interracial couple). Their greatest sense of comfort seems to be found in community: a young woman Janice takes in an abandoned puppy after being dumped by her black boyfriend and withdraws into a new world of dog caregivers who meet in the park each morning. Livy feels “love of a religious magnitude” for the world of new mothers, a world to which she has just gained entry. Helga’s friend Rachel gains a feeling of comfort after moving into The Chandler, an apartment building with other interracial couples.These revealing stories have a seemingly effortless flow to them, despite some flaws. Some of the conclusions do have a retrograde feel: single women are inevitably unhappy; motherhood mostly brings meaning and fulfillment. Danzy Senna sometimes doesn’t trust her readers enough; for instance, the reader can evidently conclude that the mixed-breed dog Beulah is a stand-in for her owner, but Ms. Senna drums the message home. And her story Triptych – the same story told three times – is simply too gimmicky. Still, this is an insightful look about appearances and attachment in our increasingly hard-to-define nation. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 07, 2011","Mar 09, 2011","Mar 07, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10125949-you-are-free

We utter a few platitudes and then turn away in discomfort from who are laid bare by their grief. And emotionally, we begin to withdraw.Francisco Goldman shatters those boundaries in his devastating book Say Her Name, forcing the reader to pay witness to the exquisite and blinding pain of a nearly unbearable loss. He positions the reader as a voyeur in a most intimate sadness, revealing the most basic nuances and details and the most complex ramifications of the loss of someone dear.And in the process, he captures our attention, rather like Samuel Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner, until the reader is literally as fascinated and transfixed with Aura Estrada – Francisco Goldman’s young and doomed wife – as he himself is. It is a masterful achievement, hard to read, hard to pull oneself away from. The barebones of his story are these: Francisco Goldman married a much younger would-be writer named Aura, who gives every indication of literary greatness. They revel in their marriage for two short years, but right before their second anniversary, Aura breaks her neck while body surfing and dies the next day. Francisco is raw with grief, which is exacerbated by Aura’s passionately devoted and controlling mother Juanita, who blames him for the tragedy.Brick by brick, Francisco builds a literary altar to the vibrant and exuberant woman he married. And at the same time, he lays naked his own grief at her loss: “Little did I suspect would come pouring out of me, that I would ever learn what it was like to feel swallowed up by my own sobbing, grief sucking me like marrow from a bone.” And later: “Every day a ghostly train. Every day the ruin of the day that was supposed to have been. Every second on the clock clicking forward, anything I do or see or think, all of it made of ashes and charred shards, the ruins of the future.”Hungry to keep Aura alive, Francisco takes us back to Aura’s past, to her complex relationship with her overbearing mother and her yearning for the father who left when she was only four years old (setting her on a course to look for a father replacement). He showcases various writings that Aura created in her advanced studies at Columbia and under the tutelage of two famous authors (revealed in bios to be Peter Carey and Colum McCann) for her MFA program. He paints a word picture of Aura as a young girl, a daughter, a wife, and a writer on the cusp of potential greatness.And in order to keep himself sane, he channels his grief into his art, documenting their time together and Aura’s extraordinary life: “This is why we need beauty to illuminate even what has most broken…Not to help us transcend or transform it into something, but first and foremost to help us see it.”At its core, Say Her Name is not “another grief book” but a love story, a tribute to Aura, a universal narrative of what happens when one loved one survives another. It is, I suspect, a novel that Francisco Goldman did not choose to write, but had to write. It is a wrenching and eloquent book of remembrance....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Mar 02, 2011","Mar 07, 2011","Mar 02, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9723191-say-her-name

The pause, of course, ""was French with limp but shiny brown hair"" and ""significant breasts that were real.""So starts this mordant comedy from Siri Hustvedt, a novelist of considerable talent. Mia finds herself eventually caught between a continuum of women -her mother and the other octogenarian widows whom she promptly dubs ""the five swans"" on one end, and the seven catty adolescent girls who compose her poetry class on the other.As Mia gingerly and then firmly enters her ""summer without men"", she strives to emerge from the overbearing shadow of Boris, whose ""pause"", predictably, is not much more than that. It's a good conceit but somehow, it just doesn't come together.The consortium of women are difficult to keep straight. The young girls never emerge as individuals; the whole really is bigger than the sum of the parts. Ditto for the ""five swans"" ,who all seem to be part of one big geriatric ""whole."" There are some scenes that shine; for example, Abigail, one of the elderly women, reveals embroideries that are actually private amusements, little scenes within scenes. ""They don't see it, you know,"" Abigail stroked a hearing aid cord as she tilted her head. ""Most of them. They see only when they expect to see, sugar, not spice, if you comprehend my meaning.""Unfortunately, though, for this reader, those scenes were few and far between, although the good ones are worth their weight in gold. Unlike other books of Ms. Hustvedt, the writing seems just a bit too self-conscious and contrived. There is not a two-dimensional quality in Mia (an anagram for ""I am""), the off-stage Boris, or the other leading characters. Despite the insertions of good-and-bad poetry, quirky drawings, and literary allusions and references, there is a distancing quality that never allowed me to embrace Mia or her plight.

You stavImagine that you’re a working class Cockney mother with a husband who detonates bombs and a young son who is four years and three months old. You stave off your anxieties about the uncertainty of your life through mindless sex encounters. Eventually, you meet a neighbor – a journalist named Jasper – and, while your husband and son are at a soccer game, you invite him to your flat. At the exact same time you are in the throes of sexual abandon, there’s a massive terrorist bomb attack at the London soccer stadium, vaporizing over one thousand people – your husband and son among them. How do you go on? How do you live with the remorse?Chris Cleave explores that question in an epistolary structure; the nameless woman writes a letter to Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of the attack. The epistolary form is used with caution as a framing device (Nicole Krauss’s The Great House and Moshid Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist come to mind), because it is not easy to pull off. The reader is a fly-on-the-wall and can choose to connect with the narrator – or not. And if truth be known, Mr. Cleave is not entirely successful in his narrative control as the conceit of writing to Osama begins to wear thin.What he is successful with is developing a fragile persona – an obsessive woman who is gradually unraveling as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder and who is quickly spiraling downward. The anonymity of the character makes her everywoman, trying to survive in a post-terrorist world. The woman writes, “Before you bombed my boy Osama I always through an explosion was such a quick thing but now I know better. The flash is over very fast but the fire catches hold inside you and the noise never stops…I live in an inferno where you could shiver with cold Osama. This life is a deafening roar but listen. You could hear a pin drop.”The bombing and PSTD, though, is only the beginning. London is quickly transformed into a virtual occupied territory as the woman fights her own inward battles. She is drawn into a psychological maelstrom with Jasper and his fiancée, Petra, an upper-class fashion journalist who happens to resemble her closely. Indeed, Petra and the narrator may very well represent two parts of London, which is described as “a smiling liar his front teeth are very nice but you can smell his back teeth rotten and stinking.” Each cannot exist without the other. And so they enter a danse-a-deux of symbiosis and betrayal. Eventually, the novel veers toward a stunning denouement and an over-the-top ending.It’s extraordinary ambitious for a first-time novelist (this book was written before Chris Cleave’s more well-known Little Bee) and sometimes the prose comes across as rather self-congratulatory or forced. Mr. Cleave’s intention, it seems, is to portray a decadent Western society that struggles to break free of its class distinctions – without success, setting itself up as something to tear down. Yet at the core of the novel, there is an emotional void. The characters are not quite satirical, yet not quite real. And as a result of the epistolary form, we, as readers, are held at arm’s length, not quite embracing them.This often disturbing, sometimes macabre novel has its own intriguing history. The morning after its initial launch party, in July 0f 2005, three suicide bombers detonated their devices in the London Underground. The book tour was shelves and the novel was temporarily withdrawn from sale by many UK retailers. Sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction. And in Chris Cleave’s world, fiction is very strange indeed.

His solid 17th novel carries a Ward Just is a writer’s writer, as straightforward and gritty and no-nonsense as Chicago—the city from which he hails. His solid 17th novel carries a seemingly enigmatic title – Rodin’s Debutante – a curiosity, considering the book has nothing to do with Rodin or debutantes.But wait – as in much of Ward Just’s work, there is complexity and hidden meaning behind the seeming simplicity. Sculpturally, Rodin – the progenitor of modern sculpture -- possessed a distinctive ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay. Similarly, Lee Goodell, the key protagonist of Rodin’s Debutante, takes his own unformed life and sculpts it, in an education that stretches from the boarding school at the Ogden Hall School of Boys to the mean south side city streets of Chicago.The story begins in the early 20th century with the bellicose Tommy Ogden, a rough-edged Chicago tycoon who thwarts his wife Maria’s desire to travel to Paris to commission her own Rodin bust; instead, he chooses to endow a Midwestern boy’s prep school. A Rodin bust of an anonymous debutante does eventually grace Ogden Hall’s Library, but it is not the bust of Maria Ogden, despite commonly accepted wisdom. It is “just appearances” and a metaphor for what life is all about.Flash forward many decades. The story shifts to Lee Goodell. He and his family live in New Jesper, a quiet traditional town off the shores of Lake Michigan, where Lee’s innocence is shattered after a particularly violent sex crime of a classmate. Lee – a self-described observer of life – ends up at enrolling at Ogden Hall, where he excels; he, too, wants to sculpt. In a twist of fate, he meets the now reclusive millionaire and gushes to him, “I believe Rodin’s bust of your late wife is a wonderful work of art. It’s a great thing to have in the library. It’s an inspiration. It’s been an inspiration to me.” A bemused Tommy Ogden casually shatters that illusion…the first of many illusions that will be shattered for Lee.And that is the book’s core theme: the divergence of false appearance and reality. Whether it’s the falsity of a respectable community where the truth never sees the light of day, the appearance of harmony in Hyde Park, which is rife with class and racial distinctions, or the falsity of the legend behind Rodin’s debutante marble statue, life is never what it seems, only what you make it. The fact that Lee becomes a sculptor, too, is also no accident. He finds comfort in a slab of unformed marble, where possibilities are infinite, and where he has the control of shaping the outcome. In this career, the ideal of art and the reality of life are finally able to blend.Lee Goodell is a good man…perhaps, a bit too good, which translates into not enough of the pockmarks and imperfections that lead to a fully-rounded and satisfying key character. Still, this is a solid piece of work, with sparse and powerful prose, rich observations, and a meticulously crafted plot. The sense of place, the crude glamour of rough-and-ready mid-century Chicago is spot-on.

And then their journey goes terribly wrong. “They didn’t carry enough water. Can there ever be enough water? Probably not. But the Popielas carried a couple of those little plastic twenty-ounce bottles with them, the kind you buy cold in the Coke cooler at the Circle K…”Luis Alberto Urrea writes so powerfully that there is a sense of immediacy and tragic intimacy in just about every paragraph. Take this opening paragraph: “Five men stumbled out of the mountain pass so sunstruck they didn’t know their own names, couldn’t remember where they’d come from, had forgotten how long they’d been lost. One of them was barefoot. They were burned nearly black, their lips huge and cracking, what paltry drool still available to them spuming from their mouths in a salty foam…They were drunk from having their brains baked in the pan, they were seeing God and devils, and they were dizzy from drinking their own urine…”Illegal immigration is an issue that has been used reductively – good versus evil – and Mr. Urrea refuses to fall into that trap. He is well aware that illegals make up 23 percent of unpaid bills in the Southwest’s ER’s and care centers for example, but this book is written to show Americans the face of the undocumented. In an aftermath, Mr. Urrea writes, “It was a chance to introduce Americans to the Border Patrol agent – a law enforcement officer who is disrespected, insulted, and demeaned by both the right and the left. Finally, it was a chance to reveal the complexities of the international crime syndicates that are now selling human flesh as if it were bags of marijuana.”The entire book rings with the authenticity of an eyewitness; it is obvious that Luis Alberto Urrea has done massive research into this tragedy. The richness of language, the empathy, the tragedy of the horrific trek through the Sonora is sometimes elevated to sheer poetry. It is an epic book that illuminates the nature of men at their most desperate and it will likely haunt my dreams. Devil’s Highway was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize.

It takes place in a Balkan location – likely Belgrade – and focuses on a young woman – Natalia’s – search for the truth about the last days of her grandfather.The narrative is woven around Natalia’s remembrances of two fable-like stories narrated to her by her grandfather, which weave tighter and tighter and ultimately reveal their truths. There is a magical realism quality to these stories, which encompass the haunting tale of a rogue tiger, an abused deaf-mute woman who is feared by the villagers and rumored to be the tiger’s wife, Darisa the bear and tiger hunter, and a “deathless man” who may be the nephew of Death itself, whose appearances often portend catastrophe.Whew! There are hints of Garcia Marquez, Rushdie, perhaps Arabian Nights as the narrator seeks to get to the truth by working through the deconstruction of the mythology. To add yet another layer, the grandfather is very attached to his edition of Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, which he carries everywhere. That allegorical book, of course, is a story of a boy raised by wolves when a tiger attacks an encampment, killing his father. Years later he finds himself back in “civilization”, which he finds far less civilized than his jungle haunts.Similarly, at the heart of The Tiger’s Wife, a pampered tiger becomes “free” and reverts back to his original nature, placing the only person with the compassion to feed him at risk. Ms. Obreht writes, “If things had turned out differently, if that winter’s disaster had fallen in some alternate order…the rumors that spread about the tiger’s wife might have been different…But because that winter was the longest anyone could remember, and filled with a thousand small discomforts, a thousand senseless quarrels, a thousand personal shames, the tiger’s wife shouldered the blame for the villagers’ misfortunes.” THIS Tiger burns bright with allegory as well.So…does it all work? Yes. And no. Ms. Tea Obreht shines when she weaves her fables; the sections on the tiger and the deathless man mesmerized me, as she paints ominous tales about the specters and superstitions that inhabit the woods and hills. I found myself to be curiously disengaged when the narrative shifted to the present. Natalia seems to be a means of unveiling the truths rather than a fully fleshed character and as a result, realism and the magic of the narration rather clashed. In the end, I admired Tiger’s Wife greatly, but cannot say I loved it.

It is the 1870s: Hans Bengler, a rootless and disconnected man, travels to Africa with the hopes of discovering an insect no one has ever seen before, the latest of his quixotic pursuits. The pickings are slender, but he DOES happen across a different kind of “specimen” – a young orphan who is caged and defenseless. He decides to bring him back to Sweden with the best of intentions, but he is challenged by the cold-hearted man who found him: “I do keep order, it’s true. But I don’t rip them up by the roots so they’ll fall dead in the snow of Sweden…”Back in Sweden, Bengler drills his own sort of catechism into Daniel: he must always say, “My name is Daniel. I believe in God.” This rehearsed sanctimony is juxtaposed against those “civilized” people with true savagery in their heart: those who regard Daniel as less than human, as an incarnation of the devil, as just another exotic specimen ripped from the dark continent.Daniel is none of these, of course. He’s just a little boy yearning to get back home, with a childish grasp of the world and a failed understanding of what the Swedish culture demands. “I’m going to walk home across the back of the sea…,” he says. He is haunted by memories of his deceased parents who he believes are calling him back to Africa. And he knows the only way to reclaim his destiny is to learn to walk on water like the white man’s god.There are twists and turns to this tale that the reader must discover for himself or herself. At its heart, this book is a powerful indictment against cultural insensitivity and willful dislocation, merged with a refusal to see those who are different as fully human. For everyone he meets, Daniel is no more than a curiosity, a specimen, a reflection of private fear or vaulting ambition. And therein lies the tragedy, which culminates in an ending of exquisite pathos. Kudos, too, to translator Steven T. Murray for an outstanding job....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,Feb 2011,"Feb 02, 2011","Feb 01, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9547615-daniel

I wish I could  it more favorably.Lemon Cake appears to have all the ingredients of success: a talented author, a fascinating start, an intriguing premise. Yet at the end of the day, this “cake” just seems to fall flat.The beginning is promising enough: nine-year-old Rose Edelstein bites into her mother’s homemade cake and discovers to her own astonishment that she can actually taste her mother’s emotions in the cake. This reminded me a lot of a recent book I read, Bitter In the Mouth, by Monique Truong. In that book, the character suffered from auditory-gustatory synesthesia – the ability to “taste” words as a result of a “neurological condition that caused the involuntary mixing of the senses.” In this book, Rose can taste emotions.Yet inexplicably, Ms. Bender introduces yet another complication: Rose can also “taste” exactly the location and factory in which the food originated. This added gift adds absolutely nothing to the plot and in fact, muddies the waters.By reading the book jacket, it appears to a prospective reader that the book centers around Rose and this unusual gift. In reality, it does not. Less than one-third into the book, the story switches largely to Joseph, Rose’s brother, who also possesses an unusual gift – the ability to disappear. The problem is, the reader never gets a nuanced sense of who Joseph is. He appears to be a loner, someone who doesn’t relate easily to others, an undiscovered genius. But there is no emotional investment in his character. When it is revealed how he disappears – a rather ludicrous plot twist – it seems less poignant than humorous.I believe I understand what Ms. Bender was striving to accomplish. The underlying theme is about the difficulty of growing up, the choices we make to stay in the world or disappear from it, the ways we imperfectly try to understand and love each other. But the book is simply too ambitious for its own good with too many sub-plots competing for dominancy. The magical and realistic aspects fought against each other; this novel never decided whether it wanted to opt for one or the other. With a few exceptions – for example, I thought the depiction of the daughter-father relationship was excellent and some of the coming-of-age scenes to be right-on – I felt disengaged. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 17, 2011","Feb 19, 2011","Feb 01, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7048800-the-particular-sadness-of-lemon-cake

And his sister Sarah pretends that she is a virgin so her mother won’t pry into her personal life. No wonder he’s constantly on a search to look for another family to belong to!If this reminds you a little of, say, Jonathan Tropper – well, it’s meant to. It’s Jewish-American humor that’s often belly-laughing funny and sometimes strikes close to home. Indeed, the entire first part of the novel – Seth’s coming-of-age – is as if J.D. Salinger and the aforementioned Tropper collaborated to come up with a needy and endearing Jewish anti-hero.As a teenager and college student, Seth gets his meaning in life from books. At one point, he muses about an impending talk to the college dean of admissions, “How could I explain to him that nothing felt real to me except the novels I read – not the other books I was supposed to read for school, not the grades I received, not the things I said to people – that something was always lost in translation between my feelings and actions, that, except for books, everything about my life felt alien to me.” Seth ends up losing himself in books and his own writing; a short story he writes called “A Stranger In The Planet” is acknowledged by those close to him as being literary genius, finally affirming him.As Seth grows up – if one can truly call it growing up – he remains largely stunted, wishing his father would provide him with affirmation, getting involved – and withholding intimacy – with women that range from a best friend who has just come out to a beautiful adult orphan of Irish descent who yearns to complete a family she never had.But the blunt adolescent hero is a little less successful as a protagonist as an adult. His emotional isolation tends to distance the reader as well. Some of the psychological insights begin to feel a little bit pat: “I had always been too cautious to embrace what I most wanted; I had always played the odds in life.” The last third feels a little overwrought and moves a tad from the caustic wit of the first part.On additional problem: there is much made of the short story, which is revealed to the reader in the last 20 pages or so in the book. At that point, expectations are very high: we’re told the story has traces of Saul Bellow, it’s been solicited by a literary publication, his family is over-the-moon about it. No short story can live up to that much hype and this one is rather stilted. it would have been better if Adam Schwartz had simply left it to the reader’s imagination.That being said, Adam Schwartz is an author who bears watching; an author with the talent to keep the reader turning pages. There’s a quirky humor and some very fine scenes that promise a great future for him. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 29, 2011","Jan 31, 2011","Jan 29, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8332431-a-stranger-on-the-planet

Indeed, in reading that aftermath, this is not the book for those who are seeking a historically-correct look into these principals. It is definitely fiction.But what fiction it is! It sings, glows, and at times, reads like sheer poetry. There are hints of James Joyce in the stream-of-consciousness. It all flows from the title Ghost Light, which O’Connor defines later in the book, “An ancient superstition among people of the stage. One lamp must always be left burning when the theatre is dark, so the ghosts can perform their own play.”And within the confines of this novel, these “ghosts” definitely do. The “play” begins in 1952; Molly, now quite old and penurious, is in London where is to record a radio play for the BBC studios. There, in an alcoholic haze, she muses upon the highlights of her life: as an actress at Abbey Theatre of Dublin, her acquaintance with Yeats, and most of all, her love affair with the much-older John M. Synge.She remembers that Synge was “a man who could see into things – very ordinary things…His imagination, or soul, or whatever province of his mind was hungry for the sustaining rain of the world, would soak in the storms of his own haunted strangeness, and the berries would bloom, and they were what they were, and if the tendrils were peculiar, and some of them wild, the fruits were so shockingly luscious and potent that the thirsty were willing to savour the bitter for the sake of the concomitant sweet.”Ah, poetry! By using the documented framework of Synge – his ascension to the top of his craft, his complicated relationship with his widowed mother (who strongly disapproved of his “liaison”), his engagement to Molly, his early death at age 37 – Mr. O’Connor expands his story, weaving fiction in with the fact. His portrayal of Molly – playful, wayward, with a spirited independence – is sublime. And then, Mr. O’Connor goes further, also weaving some highlights of the Abbey Theatre and the cruelty of class-consciousness into his tapestry.

I’m a passionate reader with an advanced degree in English Literature and have actually visited many of the homes she focuses on in her book, including Jack London’s, Ernest Hemingway’s. and, of course, what she calls “The Concord Pilgrimage” – Edith Wharton’s, Herman Melville’s, and Louisa May Alcott’s.The question she poses is why did I – or for that matter, any reader – tour these house museums? Anne answers, “There is something curious and ultimately insatiable about visiting a dead writer’s home. It has something to do with pilgrimage, the hushed aura of sacredness; it has something to do with history; one life preserved. It has something to do with loss, and objects as compensation for loss. And it has something to do with the way literature works, with the longing created by the fact that words separate writers from readers yet create an ineluctable intimacy between the two…”Whew! She’s got THAT right. And then she adds, “They (the homes) are teases; they ignite and continually frustrate our desire to fuse the material with the immaterial, the writer with the reader.”Some, of course, do it better than others. Mark Twain’s Hannibal is one that does NOT get it right; “Hannibal is not a postcard of iconic American sweetness, not a Rockwell painting.” The “snugness and smugness” of the town reveal nothing about Samuel Clemons, who had a delicious sense of irony. Nor is it possible to find Walt Whitman in Camden, an old, forgotten house in a depressing, urban blighted town.Anne Trubek fares better in Concord: “over two hundred published writers call this small town home.” And she totally connects with Paul Laurence Dunbar’s house in Dayton, Ohio – “full of the longing that I am seeking in these small museums.”Overall, Anne finds some truth in each about literature, history, urban blight, and today’s America…even if she doesn’t always find connection with the author. There are times when I felt she verved from her stated mission, focusing more on the history of the writer instead of the writer’s homes, or when she arrived with preconceived conclusions about the house. All in all, though, Anne brings an indefatigable curiosity, a sense of humor, and a researcher’s skill to her undertaking....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 25, 2011","Jan 27, 2011","Jan 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8340846-a-skeptic-s-guide-to-writers-houses

On rare occasions, it has even saved lives. In the ancienThrough the ages, the power of stories has defined and guided and transformed and healed us. On rare occasions, it has even saved lives. In the ancient One Thousand and One Nights, for example, the legendary Persian queen Scheherazade kept herself alive with mesmerizing stories that persuaded the King to spare her.With a nod toward this beloved tale, Jane Mendelsohn introduces Milo, a severely wounded Iraqi veteran suffering from a spinal cord injury and PTSD and Honor, his young and emotionally crippled physical therapist. When she touches his destroyed back, it unleashes powerful stories within him – a virtual tapestry of images from the past.For instance, there is the triangle of the married couple Joe and Pearl and her bewitching cousin Vivian in the mid 1930s. As the aspiring jazz musician Joe falls more and more under the sway of Pearl’s green-eyed cousin, he finds himself in the untenable position of loving two women in vastly different ways. Their affair takes off on the cusp of the golden age of jazz, when the two attend Count Basie’s inaugural concert in New York on Christmas Eve.There is a woman photographer in the 1960s, whose life’s work is shockingly stolen. And then there’s the story of a favored concubine and a eunich named Hyacinth in 17th century Turkey, whose forbidden love is captured in music. All these stories are interspersed with Honor’s own story – the daughter of an unmarried mother who is searching for both her past and her future. The one story that is held back from the reader – until much, much later – is the story of Milo himself. It is a story that he is afraid to grasp or explore. Honor muses: “Milo Hatch, a handsome young man, only in this story, the story she was receiving from him, he was not a twenty-four-year-old war veteran struggling or his sanity in the first decade of a new century, he was a young jazz musician in the 1930’s who was falling in and out of love. And he was more: he was the boats on the Hudson River at sunset, the blue light of a September dusk, a black car pulling up to a gritty curb at night, a woman with ships in her eyes.”Together, Honor and Milo – both crippled emotionally – seek the answers to their damaged lives through these stories. She says to him, “All I know is that these stories seem to be inside you. And that somehow when I touch you they come out. I you let us keep going maybe we can get some answers. But maybe not.” He recognizes the magic as well: “The story could not go on without her. He could not go on without her. And the light moved through her and she was strange to him, and radiant.”These stories appear in pulsating and transcendent detail – colorful, vibrant, ready to snatch onto, ready to burst forth. As the book progresses, Milo and Honor’s story becomes more and more part of the fabric of these tales – with love always at the core. Each must decide what stories to believe in and which to discard. Milo reflects that “he had nearly given his life for a story about his country, but he didn’t believe in that story anymore. Then he had come home and he had kept on fighting and had fought for another story: Honor’s.” And Honor? Her stories come alive for her as a way of reconciling with an unknown or misunderstood past.Is the torrent of memories and alternate lives a mirage and can it indeed save either or both? As this intricate puzzle plays out, we learn the answers. And all the while, the music is in the background “a moment in time that had given rise to that music, a moment and a music that had seemed so isolated from history.” Like Count Basie, this book elevates…and swings....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 24, 2011","Jan 25, 2011","Jan 24, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7169598-american-music

VisitIt is very rare that a book combines a mastery of language and cadence with an assured and innovative vision to redefine the literary landscape. Visitation is such a book. It is, to my mind, a contemporary masterpiece.It will be widely compared, no doubt, to Simon Mawer’s The Glass House, because its property on a Brandenburg lake outside of Berlin is at the heart of the novel. Yet in that book, Mr. Mawer sacrificed characters to themes. In Visitation, Ms. Erpenbeck does something far more daring: she focuses on time and place as a constant, while each of her characters is (to quote Macbeth) “a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more.” She is absolutely unflinching in her ability to look beneath the surface to the tapestry of individuals who come and go while the shimmering lake and woodland remain. Each of the characters receives his or her moment on the stage, with only one who consistently appears: the gardener. There is something soothing and reassuring about his constant reemergence, as he spans the seasons, adding topsoil, sowing grass seed, gathering fallen branches, coaxing nuts from their soft husks, stacking logs in the woodshed. He is a symbol of the cycles of life, spring, winter, summer, fall, always predictable, regardless of the temporary drama being played out.To illustrate the temporal nature of all characters, each is only defined by his or her profession: the architect, the Red Army Officer, the writer, the illegitimate owner. There is one exception: the Jewish characters are named: “Hermine and Arthur, his parents. He, himself, Ludwig, the firstborn. His sister Elisabeth, married to Ernst. Their daughter Doris, his niece.” Indeed, that chapter – the Cloth Manufacturer – contains some of the most powerful writing I’ve ever read, as Erpenbeck uses cadence and repetition to move her characters towards one of the worst horrors of modern history.On the chapter on Doris, Erpenbeck writes, “For three years the girl took piano lessons, but now, while her dead body slides down into the pit, the word piano is taken back from human beings, now the backflip on the high bar that the girl could perform better than her schoolmates is taken back, along with all the motions a swimmer makes, the gesture of seizing hold of a crab is taken back, as well as all the basic knots to be learned for sailing, all these things are taken back into uninventedness, and finally, last of all, the name of the girl herself is taken back, the name no one will ever call her by: Doris.”Descriptive and passionate writing like this – in the chapters that focus on the gardener and on the Jewish family – is interspersed with the mundane elements and ritualsof life, for example: “Present exigency: The property that is the subject of the proceedings. Pending determination of ownership. Registration number 654.”The language, in many cases, is like lyrical poetry. I must acknowledge the outstanding translator, Susan Bernofsky, who expertly translated this masterwork from German to English.

But on one cold night, he chances upon a deluded Japanese tourist who is searching for the buried ransom money from the Coen brothers’ movie Fargo. When she wanders off and dies of exposure, McMorsey finds himself thrust into the spotlight of an intrusive media campaign, dredging up ghosts from his past.One of these “ghosts” is Fred Howkowski, an Indian man whose life he saved once in Vietnam. But once was the charm; McMorsey can’t save his best friend again once Howkowski drifts to another kind of “shoot”, pursuing a Hollywood speaking role as an “extra Indian”. To complicate matters, upon arriving stateside, Howkowski entrusted McMorsey to raise his son – T.J. – who is tormented about why he was given up in the first place. And then there’s art history professor Annie Boans, the love child of McMorsey and Shirley, the woman he was romantically entangled with and whom he has never forgotten.The eventual meeting between Tommy Jack and his two children – the adopted son he raised, the daughter he never knew about – is just the foundation of a story that digs deep to explore powerful themes: how the past continues to haunt and inform the present. How images and stereotypes intersect with reality in Native America. How what is thought and what is spoken are often disjointed. How there is really no such thing as a “single truth”, no matter how hard you search.And search they do. Gansworth – a natural born storyteller who breathes life and complexity into his cast of characters – has a lot to say about how we pursue “the truth” in an era of reality T.V.; a crew for a reality-based T.V. show that specializes in unsolved mysteries shows up at his door with its own agenda, with predictably terrible results. He delves into “the truth” of Hollywood, where, according to Howkowski, “they cover me in this orange dye to make me darker for the screen, and it looks like blood every night when I try to wash it down the bathtub drain.But most harrowing and heartbreaking of all is “the truth” of Vietnam – the resonance of that misguided war and the inescapability of one’s actions. Eric Gansworth saves two of the most haunting memories for last; one can thoroughly understand how anyone who experienced these horrors can never be “whole” again.Gansworth suggests that the truth is complex and that knowledge isn’t power nor is it liberating. McMorsey ponders, “How do you tell these secret parts of your life…” They’re not secret because you need them to be, but secret because they are the moments you share with one other person, and here on, the camera everything about you is at least once removed. Their machine keeps rolling magnetic tape from one spool to another, copying your image over and over again, but they never get it right. No matter how closely they try to document your moves, they only get one angle…”It is, in the end, impossible to read this book from a one-angle perspective. A road trip detours into something more mysterious, which, in turn, opens up questions about Vietnam and the past, the endurance of love, the search for identity, and the secrets we keep and reveal. There is no closure, only progress. In other words, this book is about life itself.It helps to know that Eric Gansworth is a First Nations Author, a member of the Onondaga Nation. The character of Fred Howkowski appeared in The Ballad of Plastic Fred and Indian Summer. According to an afterword by the author, he “began to understand that the story of Fred Howkowski was not over yet. He kept showing up, a ghost wandering at the fringes of my other work.” He is finally – and expertly – laid to rest. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 20, 2011","Jan 23, 2011","Jan 20, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8401075-extra-indians

But, to my knowledge, there has been no book that has powerfully shone the spotlight on the families – non-enlistees who experience “small and fragile” moments.That void has just been masterfully filled. In a haunting and downright electrifying debut, Sioban Fallon takes us to Fort Hood, Texas, where the sign on the gate reads,”You’ve Survived The War, Now Survive The Homecoming.” In eight loosely linked interlocked stories, Ms. Fallon creates characters that are so authentic, so genuine, that the reader almost feels voyeuristic by peering into their world.In this world, there are extramarital affairs, physical and mental health crises, teenage rebellion, financial stresses, even scrapes with the law. The spouses – mostly women – are forced to “buck up”, knowing that the person they depend on most in the world is 5,000 miles from home in harm’s way.These stories are so devastatingly good – so unputdownable – that it’s hard to anoint a favorite. In the title story, an exotically beautiful and mysterious Serbian-born soldier’s wife is distrusted by the other wives and ends up creating an act of quiet desperation. In Camp Liberty, an investment-banker-turned-soldier experiences the clash of the soft and narcissistic life he yearns to return to and the realities of his battle life. His friendship with an Iraqi female interpreter offers him a rude awakening about what he really needs.In the most chilling story, Leave, an intelligence officer is convinced his wife is unfaithful and performs a reconnaissance, staking out his own basement. He reflects, “It was difficult to determine if someone was one-hundred-percent guilty, but nearly impossible to determine if someone was one-hundred-percent innocent.” Fallon rachets up the tension and desperation and doesn’t let go until the last word of the ambiguous ending – an ending that sent shivers through me. Another, Inside The Break, focuses on a wife who comes across an email disclosure of infidelity during her husband’s tour of duty. It takes his homecoming and his broken cries that rescue the marriage and show the couple how fortunate they are to be together. And in The Last Stand, a wounded twenty-one-year-old soldier reunites with his wife, a young college student who makes a choice to go her own way despite the consequences.These stories – and the others in this fine collection – are filled with compassion for those wracked with pain and loss, fear and jealousy, cynicism and at times, hope. There are powerful revelations and fascinating glimpses that delve deeply into this neglected world. Sioban Fallon – who herself lived in Fort Hood while her husband was on active duty in a war zone – never resorts to the jingoistic or the trite. Instead, with sparse, clean, and beautiful prose, she captures the reality of a small portion of society that deals with heightened stress and threat of deployments.You Know When The Men Are Gone is both a tribute to and an illuminating portrait of an often-overlooked world.

In real life, Churchill often referred to his depression as “that black dog”. However, in a bold move, Mr. Churchill is really relegated to the role of bit player in this very original book.The real protagonist is Esther Hammerhans, a young widow, a House of Commons library clerk, who is approaching the anniversary of her husband’s death. When we meet her, she has decided to rent out her guest room, and the giant Labrador – aka “Black Pat” – comes to look it over. Her first instinct is to hide but hide where? “There was nothing in the hallway to dive behind, it was a wasteland.”After wrestling with herself, Esther decides to let Black Pat – or metaphorical depression – stay, at least on a trial basis. She finds him to be strangely seductive: he makes bad jokes, builds a barbecue in her garden where he cooks coots and old shoes, misbehaves in dog-like manner, and tries to inveigle himself more thoroughly into her life.It will fall to Churchill – who is intimately familiar with Black Pat and wonders aloud to him “whether you were there, waiting to stake your flag from the moment my soul entered the earth” to minister to Esther and give her guidance to cope. Churchill says, “…it will struggle on its knees to serve, fighting out the inches in dust and desert. But do never forget where it is migrating to, for it will bear you there. It is a migration into the dust.” He has learned through trial and error that “we are still captains of our souls”, despite the fight it takes to remain there.There are strengths and weaknesses in this audacious novel. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 20.9 percent of American adults alone – or about 9.5 percent of the U.S. population who are 18 and older – suffer from a mood disorder. The novel speaks charmingly and originally about how depression is perceived by one who is coping with it. For the imaginative personification of depression alone, this is a book worth reading.However, it is precisely this unconventionality that sometimes works at odds with itself. Black Pat too often appears immensely loveable, not the fearsome force that cause too many adults to suffer or even take their own lives. More problematically, Ms. Hunt seems to wrestle with whether to keep using Black Pat as a metaphor or to make him a fully-realized being who can think, feel, and destroy.Ultimately, the book begins to read like a parable. Anyone in Esther’s place would be depressed; her depression is not the organic kind that Churchill appears to suffer from. The reader never quite feels the menace. At the end of the day, the characters (with the exception of Black Pat) come across as lacking verve and complexity.This is, after all, a debut book, and Rebecca Hunt amply signifies that she has the talent and rich imagination to become a force to be reckoned with. Her ability to take on the “bête noir” of Winston Churchill is audacious and bold.

So forget about everything you know about McCain and Palin, Clinton and Obama, Edwards and Giuliani. The truth is actually worse. Far worse. Game Change goes ahead and deliciously details all the backbiting, sex, lies, and self-destructions of the most dissected presidential campaign in history. It’s jaw dropping, gripping, and guaranteed to keep you reading late into the night. Here are just a few of the revelations:SARAH PALIN was the most colossally unprepared candidate ever to grace the national arena. “She couldn’t explain why North and South Korea were separate nations. She didn’t know what the Fed did. Asked who attacked America on 9/11, she suggested several times it was Saddam Hussein.” And her mental state was so precarious that at one point, John McCain actually had his doctor observe her.JOHN EDWARDS was such a blowhard egotist that he angled for a position as VP or Attorney General, all the while knowing that Rielle Hunter was eight months pregnant and the story could break at any time.JOHN MCCAIN was so disengaged and shoot-from-the-hip in style that GEORGE BUSH wondered about his ability to lead the nation. He vetted Palin for the second most important job in the nation in under 72 hours and barely knew her. Oh, and when he wanted to relax? He’d watch the infamous YouTube posting of John Edwards preening to the sounds of I Feel Pretty.HILLARY CLINTON was barely able to control her husband and his intemperate telephonic and in-person outbursts. Oh, and that speech she delivered at the convention anointing Obama? Bill rewrote it behind her back just hours before she was supposed to deliver it.The authors, Heilemann and Halperin reveal it all in this spicy smorgasbord: the friction between Obama and his garrulous vice presidential pick…Obama’s own tendency toward conceit and coldness…Hillary’s initial rejection of Obama’s Secretary of State offer…the perilous state of the marriage of John and Elizabeth Edwards.

It’s an audacious book, a highly imaginative one, and certainly an enigmatic one.Given its duality, it’s no surprise that I’m of two minds about it: in many places, I admired SOLO more than I loved it. Characters are often sacrificed to themes, yet often, the themes do become transcendent. SOLO is divided into two movements. In the first movement we meet Ulrich, an everyman, a blinded centurion who has lived his life in politically unstable Sofia, Bulgaria. As he combs through his life, his memories are mostly linear: he ruminates about his friend Boris who fell victim to anti-communist reprisals, his mother who was exiled to a labor camp, and his own spotted career as the handpicked factory administrator of an overly ambitious five-year plan. For the most part, he has lived his life on a false note, subjugating his passionate love of music for the pursuit of his chosen work in chemistry.It is the experimentation of chemistry that causes so much heartache, including his blinding with acid. Ulrich’s real chemistry is with music, not with science. In the second movement, Daydreams, there is a propulsive energy that is missing earlier on as Ulrich births a world of new characters and situations. His best friend Boris, for example, is transformed from a murdered would-be-musician to a Bulgarian prodigy, discovered by Plastic – an American music producer. The poetic Irakli and his highly ambitious and magnificently beautiful sister Khatuna likely morph from qualities within Ulrich; like him, they survive a rough transition from communism and a hard-drinking mother. The millennial setting and the thrillerish pace are at sharp contrast with the first movement.The brilliance of the book can be found in the way that Mr. Dasgupta weaves and reinvents characters, motifs, and themes in a subtle way. More than once, I stopped and thought, “This rings a bell”, only to realize that it had appeared in a different form earlier on in the book. There is definitely political undertones – or overtones – throughout, sometimes used seamlessly and at other times, a little jarringly. Bulgaria under communism in the first movement is contrasted with the imagined exploration of what happens when a nation’s economy is turned over to a wealthy gangsta oligarch; it’s no longer about “the people”, it’s about personal interest only. Both societal models are shown to be wanting.Yet there is beauty, too, as Ulrich muses, “Life happens in a certain time. But there is a great surplus left over, and where will we stow it but in our dreams?” And a little later: “When I die they will put me under the ground, and I will lie with an eternity of dreamers, breeding visions that will flicker on the surface – and the children of my daydreams will roam free.” Life and daydreams, Mr. Dasgupta suggests, are fluid, one harmoniously leading from the other. And in communicating that thought, he hits the right note. (3.5)...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 03, 2011","Jan 05, 2011","Jan 03, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6048816-solo

The Sweet Relief of Missing Children by SLately, there have been a plethora of books about missing girls and what they signify for those left behind. The Sweet Relief of Missing Children by Sara Braunstein and Songs for the Missing by Stewart O’Nan spring instantly to mind.In Hannah Pittard’s absorbing The Fates Will Find Their Way, this territory is mined again, and quite convincingly. Sixteen-year-old Nora vanishes one day and no one knows quite what happened. What’s left is a series of rumors, imaginings, suspicions, and what-ifs from teenage boys whose lives she touched.Ms. Pittard makes a risky choice in using the first person plural for narration – the “we” tense. It’s a hard tense to pull off, but she does it quite well. For instance, as the boys grow to men, she writes, “We owned homes, had wives. Some of us had more than one child by then. In many ways, we were kings. Everything was ahead of us…”But is it? As the fates dictate that the boys settle down into preordained future roles, something is lost in each of them. At one point, the narrator looks back to a time when the future was more limitless: “Our only limitation was our imagination, and that school year – and every school year after – our imagination seemed to grow, to outdo, what we’d ever believed possible. We outran our wildest fantasies. That is, until Nora Lindell went missing…”Nora is the fixed mark in time of all that might have been. Her life remains limitless, at least in the imaginings of her now-adult classmates; she took off to Arizona, she became pregnant, she married a much-older man, and so on. Their lives, however, are constrained by the realities of life, the wives and the babies and jobs and the homes as they sleepwalk forward. Ms. Pittard writes, “Certain outcomes are unavoidable, invariable, absolutely unaffectable, and yet completely unpredictable. Certain outcomes are that way. But maybe not Nora’s. Maybe she was the only one who escaped…”This haunting and minimalistic book has but one flaw in my opinion: Nora is consistently a symbol and never acquires that real-life mystique and fascination that would cause these teenage boys to remain starry-eyed and reverent way into adulthood. The conceit overpowers the reality of the story.That aside, there is some mighty fine writing from a debut author and some deep psychological insights that keeps the reader turning pages.

The other is his personal assistant, Ayyan Mani, a Dalit (or “untouchable”) who is “smarter than the average bear” (in this case, the average Dalit) with an IQ of 148.Ayyan, his wife Oja, and their rather geeky son Adi live in a large gray tenement teeming with humanity, “born into poverty that no human should have to endure” but Ayyan has his dreams and the wiles to achieve them. He and his half-deaf son play a secret little game: Ayyan feeds Adi some high-level math and physics answers to amaze and astound his teachers. At the same time, he spins flattering stories about his son that he pays a reporter to run. The result: 10-year-old Adi is soon hailed as a boy-genius throughout the community…and indeed, the nation.Meanwhile, his boss Arvind is engrossed in his own quixotic project: an attempt to prove that extraterrestrial life is raining down on Earth through a “Balloon Project.” By doing so, he sets himself at odds with underlings, jealous scientists who are far more interested in searching for life in outer space with a “Giant Ear.” And to make matters more complicated, an incredibly attractive astrobiologist – the Institute’s first female scientist – has her cap set for the much-older Arvind and is ready, willing and able to betray him.Both Ayyan and Arvan are involved in high-stake games: Ayyan is embroiled in the “bewitching life of creating a whole myth” with his son to save himself from “the tired face of Oja, the despondence of Adi, the thousand eyes that gaped vacantly in the grey corridors…” At the same time, the egotistical Arvind is aspiring beyond his capabilities with his belief in a souped-up theory.As these two egos meet – as this “odd couple” becomes more symbiotic – Manu Joseph weaves an amazingly compelling story. We laugh as Ayann Mani writes his daily “quote of the day”, falsified sayings from the likes of Einstein or Newton that tweak the narcissistic Brahmins. Or when Arvind sets himself up against the “Big Bang” theory, which he considers a Western plot because “the Vatican wanted a beginning.”Yet throughout, Ayyan, Arvan and the others who inhabit the world of Serious Men are not treated merely with humor, but with compassion – from status-crazy youngsters to pushy nuns, from May-December romances to predictable bureaucrats. The result is a pitch-perfect look at two evenly-matched compatriots who define their lives on their own terms and play for the highest stakes. If this is Mr. Joseph’s debut, I can only imagine how fabulous his next book will be.

This is just living.”***********************************************************“Just living” isn’t the easiest thing in the kingdoms of Valerie Laken. In her psychologically engrossing short story collection, there is always that gaping divide: between countries, cultures, or lovers, or even that schism within ourselves.In one of the most engrossing of the stories, Family Planning, a gay couple – Meg and Josie – travel to Russia to adopt a baby, and are suddenly faced with a choice: the little boy they had expected to bring home or an unknown baby girl. And Josie realizes in a flash, “Someone had to give sooner or later. That was how families and lovers everywhere functioned. It was not just a business thing, it was a kindness people gave to those they loved.”In another story, Remedies, Nick gets into a car accident as a result of losing small spells of time. “I’ll be going along like a regular person and then poof. It’s like the world has jumped ahead of me by a couple of minutes.” The future, the past, a vision of the flattest, basest reality all merge for him.And then there’s Before Long, another story in which a twelve year old blind boy named Anton briefly leaves his orderly and idyllic village life to visit a new American dentist and discovers, “There was no one anywhere, not even the foreigners, who could fix this.”Perhaps, though, the most inventive of the stories is the titled story, where a family strives to communicate after Colt – the father – loses his thumbs and his livelihood after he sabotages a machine at work. Ms. Lakin relies on a gimmick: a two-column, split-screen format to show the father’s viewpoint…and his young son Jack’s thoughts.While disconcerting at first, the conceit actually works: the reader can visually see the schism caused by lack of communication and connection and the deep divide that ensues. Colt has confined himself to a “reject room”; his son, Jack, is yearning for connection, at least with his classmates. As Colt is confronted by his former boss (on one side of the screen), Jack is drowning out the sounds with his drum-playing (Guh Duh Guh Guh Duh.) And, as Colt cries out, “I am not one of you!” at the retreating back of the lawyer, Jack is indeed trying to be “one of you” by taping his thumbs back to experience what his father is going through. It is indeed powerful.Ultimately, Valerie Laken – a Pushcart Prize-winning author – focuses her attention on the connections we need to make us whole by reaching out beyond our self-imposed borders.

A reader can see in it most anything he or she wants. Is it a terrifying supernatural thriller? A fast-paced adventure story? An elegiac narrative about a dysfunctional family slowly spinning out of control? A cautionary tale about the perils of being an outsider? Or a quirky and dream-like parable using the swamp as a mythic archetype?In fact, it’s all these things. Yet above all else, Swamplandia! is a lavishly imagined and highly original coming-of-age story. Swamplandia! is the name of a faded, nearly bankrupt Everglades tourist attraction, owned by the Bigtree clan of alligator wrestlers. Early on in the book, Hilola – the mother and star performer – dies shockingly young, of ovarian cancer, leaving the family unmoored. Their flamboyant father, Chief Bigtree, heads away to take care of “business” on the mainland, leaving the children undefended.Left to their own devices, the three Bigtree teens react in different and dysfunctional ways. Nerdy older brother Kiwi, just 17, sneaks away in the dead of night to join the heavily-advertised competition, a themed amusement park called World of Darkness, where guests (known as “Lost Souls”) partake in the various “rings of hell.” His plan is to make money to save Swamplandia! from extinction, despite his meager wages and the jeering of other employees.Osceloa, the middle girl, named for a Seminole Indian, falls under the spell of spiritualism, becoming more and more entranced with a young man Louis Thanksgiving…a ghost-figure who died during the Dredge and Fill Campaign of the 1930s. She mysteriously vanishes after leaving a note that she is running off to elope with him.And that leaves 13-year-old Ava, the first-person narrator of the story. There is a poignancy about Ava, who sorely misses her mother, worries about Kiwi and Ossie, and dreams of taking her mother’s place as a top performer and saving the day. It is up to Ava to take care of the alligators (redubbed “Seths” by the Bigtrees); when a rare red Seth is born, he becomes her talisman and in ways, her alter ego. She will ultimately take her own harrowing journey with a guide known as the Bird Man, who takes her on both a physical and emotional odyssey right to the very gates of hell.Karen Russell offers a profound knowledge of the world she creates – the hatching and care of the alligators, the imperiled swamp, the back-history (including the massacred Seminoles), the isolation and innate wisdom of those who live off the mainland. The swamp – the quagmire – that threatens to engulf the three siblings must be navigated for them to emerge whole and move on.The writing style calls forth an early John Irving, Katherine Dunne, or John Kennedy Toole. The yearning for a reconnection with her mother – the haunting quality of the outsider – the beauty of some of the descriptions elevates Swamplandia! over many debut novels and makes Karen Russell a writer to watch....more",Notes are private!,0,114,1,"Dec 19, 2010","Dec 28, 2010","Dec 19, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8584686-swamplandia

What if our pain manifested itself as visible light, and what if that pain Many believe that in today’s tortured times, humanity is mortally wounded. What if our pain manifested itself as visible light, and what if that pain was the most beautiful thing about us? What if the pain would cease and the light would radiate from us all?A major world religion was founded on just such a principle. But here, Brockmeir brings that suffering down to the human level, in overlapping narratives starting with injured data analyst Carol Ann whose life “seemed like one long litany of wounds.” Carol Ann had “known days of happiness and beauty, rare moments of motionless wonder, but trying to relive them was like looking out the window at night from a partially lit room.”It is into her hands that a very special journal falls – a journal of love notes from a young husband to his now-deceased wife. This is, indeed, a “bible” of love, filled with intensely intimate notes like, “I love the scent of your hair just after you’ve taken a shower. I love the funny noises you make when you dream, the tiny pop of your lips separating. I love the last question you ask me before bedtime.” Not unlike the structure of Geraldine Brooks’ People of the Book, this book falls into one narrator’s hands after the other: from Carol Ann to the husband, Jason, a photojournalist who learns the art of self-mutilation from a troubled teenage girl; Chuck Carter, a battered teenage boy who believes he can feel inanimate objects (such as the book’s) pain; evangelist Ryan Shifrin, who “wanted a Heaven of starting over, a Heaven of trying again” and who questions the very essence of suffering; the touring author Nina who is aching physically and emotionally; and lastly, the street-vendor Morse, who understands humanity but does not love it, and “who in this world would choose understanding over love?”This love journal will illuminate the way to these damaged souls as much as the physical wounds that blaze and glitter with light in this new world phenomenon. Brockmeir illuminates lives of quiet desperation – a severed thumb, chronic mouth ulcers, burns, punctures, wounds, and lacerations, and most of all, the emotional pain that divorces us from the connections we so sorely need.At times, the cataloguing of pain becomes a little mind-numbing and repetitive. But make no mistake, Brockmeir’s book is radiant and bewitching as he drills deep into the common human condition. Ryan Shifrin thinks, “You would think that taking the pain of very human being and making it so starkly visible – every drunken headache and frayed cuticle, every punctured lung and bowel pocked with cancer – would inspire waves of fellow feeling all over the world, at least ripples of pity…” In real life – and in Brockmeir’s artistically-created world – that does not happen, of course. But as one of the minor characters discovers, “Yes, his wounds burned out of him like a fire, but his pain would cease and his body would heal, and the light would last forever.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 13, 2010","Dec 19, 2010","Dec 13, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8472655-the-illumination

It starts with the disappearance of a 12-year-old girl, Leonora – a good girl, who does everything right, a cautious and obedient young lady who possesses “calm confidence, concern for the lower classes, a dimple in her right cheek.”Yet this is not a book about Leonora, who inhabits a small fraction of the 360+ pages. Rather, it’s about all kinds of “missing” children – children who have grown up, those who have gone missing emotionally or physically, those who have been exploited or who have grown alien to themselves and their families. It is, at its core, a book about trying to find one’s place in a careless world.Sarah Braunstein uses an interlocking story format to introduce several characters to form a sort of kaleidoscopic of our own desperate and hopeless efforts to pursue and yet push away the things in life we want the most.As readers, we meet them all: Paul (ironically renamed Pax, which stands for “peace”) – a boy who has run away from an abusive stepfather and who experiences not a moment of peace, who “felt a desire to smash love into his body, to smash love into the world, to allow love to be the violent act he’d always suspected it was.” We meet Judith (another irony – her name stands for “freedom”) who is anything but free as she marries young, moves to exactly the kind of quiet “every town” she’s wanted to escape, but in the end, cannot. We meet Sam, her young husband, an orphaned character who does everything right, but cannot break free to live larger than what appears to be his predestined fate.These and a handful of other characters bump and grind and thrash against each other, meeting up in odd ways, experiencing the bad in life and surviving in slightly diminished forms. Children grow up, adults flash back to childhood traumas and all have been affected in one way or the other. As Pax says about his childhood home, “I expected it to be – like, neutral. How stupid. Nothing is neutral, right? Least of all the home you grew up in.”Little by little, Braunstein explores these characters’ fears – of shame and abandonment and loss of control and hope. Although the desire for transformation and reinvention is strong, it is difficult to obtain. And as they strive, the eyes of the missing Leonora peer down from ubiquitous billboards, not unlike the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg in The Great Gatsby. I suspect it is no coincidence that Leonora’s eyes perform the same function as Dr. Eckleburg’s – watching over their respective desolate and foul wastelands with a certain aura of judgment.This is not a “feel good” book nor does it always work; there is such a large cast of characters and so many stories pleading for attention that it’s easy to become a little lost in the wilderness. Yet this novel – which spans decades – is also confidently written with many strong insights and an original voice. While it is not a book I’d recommend for everyone, it is a rewarding book for those who can handle multifaceted themes and wish to experience a writer on the cusp of potential greatness....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 07, 2010","Dec 13, 2010","Dec 07, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8248631-the-sweet-relief-of-missing-children

She writes, “Who would bean be if she dropped her beautiful mask? Who would Cordy be if she stepped up to the plate in her own life? And who would Rose be if she weren’t the responsible one anymore?”These are the questions the three sisters are forced to explore when twists of life bring the two younger prodigal sisters back to their collegial hometown, just at the point when their mother has received a breast cancer diagnosis. Each is at a crosspoint: Rose must decide whether to burst free from her self-imposed safety net, spread her wings, and follow her fiancée to his once-in-a-lifetime job in London. Bean is running from significant debt that she needed “to play her part effectively: the shoes, clothes, the makeup, the drinks at bars and clubs where a bottle of water alone ran nearly ten dollars.” And Cordy? The baby of the family has discovered that she herself is pregnant with her own baby.Eleanor Brown chooses to use the third-person plural to demonstrate the “we-ness” of these sisters, who are threads of the same cloth, tied in together for life. Third-person plural is not an easy tense to pull off, and truth be known, there is an awkwardness in it from time to time, although I certainly applaud her intentions. Similarly, the Shakespeare aphorisms that the father regularly spouts – “communicating his deepest feelings in the words of a man who has been dead for almost four hundred years” -- sometimes come across as inorganic, although very original.Of course, the exploration of sisterhood is complicated. Ms. Brown writes, “We weren’t going to talk about it, we weren’t going to share any feelings or discuss any arrangements, not going to bond in any type of movie montage moment where emotional music swelled as we hugged and wept for our mother’s loss and our own fear. Instead, we were going to wrap ourselves in cloaks woven from self-pity and victimhood, refusing to admit that we might be able to help each other if we’d only open up.”By the end of the book, there will be growth in each and every character, some predictable, some a surprise. There are many “weird sisters” out there who will recognize their own roles and family dynamics in this book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 05, 2010","Dec 07, 2010","Dec 05, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8573020-the-weird-sisters

I wondeNot long ago, I was mesmerized by David Vann’s exceptional and perceptive collection, Legend of a Suicide – a mythology of his father’s death. I wondered whether his first full-length novel would capture the magic and raw energy of that astonishing book.The answer, I’m pleased to say, is yes.Beware: Caribou Island is NOT for readers who are looking for “likeable characters” and Hollywood-type endings. It ventures into dark emotional territory that’s not always comfortable to reside in – the same type of territory that’s inhabited by, say, Martha and George in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Wolff. In other words, it packs a wallop.Gary and Irene are a couple who have lived for years in Alaska, “an open space, an opportunity to forget about something as small as heartache.” There’s a juxtaposition of Alaska as a grand and vast space with the downright claustrophobia of a marriage falling apart. Irene reluctantly “signs on” to Gary’s desire to build a cabin from the ground up in uninhabited and remote Caribou Island.The cabin becomes a metaphor for their lives. Irene thinks, “Maybe you can nail each layer down into the next…if the could take all their previous selves and nail them together, get who they were five years ago and twenty-five years to fit closer together, maybe they’d have a sense of something solid.”But that is not to be. Instead, Irene views herself as “chilled and alone…not the expansive vision you’d be tempted to have, spreading your arms on some sunny day on an open slope of purple lupine, looking at mountains all around.” Irene, if truth be known, is falling apart; she is having extreme flashbacks to the time when she found her mother, a suicide. And Gary is totally lost, searching for himself in the infinity of Alaska.Gary reflects, “You could only find an outward shape…if you followed your calling. If you took the wrong path, all you could shape was monstrosity.” And indeed, it’s evident from the beginning that the cabin is, indeed, that monstrosity.The legacy of mother to daughter – and daughter to her own children – plays out throughout this book. Rhoda, their daughter, is trying her best to reconcile her dreams of love with a man who is poised to disappoint her. And Mark, their son, has dropped out entirely, living month-to-month and unable to commit to much of anything.For the sense of place…for the imagery and prose…for the fierceness of Vann’s imagination, this is a book that is stunning to read.

In Andrei Makine’s exquisite and dreamlike 109-page novella, the reader learns about this new species through the person of Alexei Berg, a one-time brilliant young pianist.Not unlike Coleridge’s The Ancient Mariner, he happens across the narrator who is enduring a transportation delay with “human matter, breathing like a single organism, its resignation, its innate disregard of comfort, its endurance in the face of the absurd.” Together, they manage to get aboard an archaic third-class coach, where Alexei weaves his story to his new friend.Alexei’s parents are arrested by the pre-KGB for being part of the “rotten intelligentsia” during Stalin’s reign of terror in the 1930s, just as Alexei is posed to make an eagerly-awaited solo debut. Knowing his own arrest is imminent, he flees to his fiancee’s father’s home, waking up in the middle of the night convinced that he is about to be betrayed. After hiding briefly in his uncle’s barn, Alexei scours the bodies of dead Russian soldiers to find one who is close to him in appearance. He assumes that soldier’s identity and enters the war “indistinguishable in the column”, cloaked in his disguise.In taut, lyrical, beautifully-paced notes, Makine traces Alexi’s survival trek, and with an extraordinary economy of words, captures the terror of striving to make it through the Stalin years. The sparse portrait of a man caught up in a forgotten life is described thus:  “He told himself that in this life there should be a key, a code for expressing, in concise and unambiguous terms, all the complexity of our attempts, so natural and so greviously confused, at living and loving.”There is, of course, a denouement scene: creativity, in Makine’s world, is indestructible and survives in whatever spare soil it is planted. This exquisite elegy of loss – a multi-note symphony to the indestructibility of the human spirit—reaches a crescendo that is beautifully realized and will not soon be forgotten. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 30, 2010","Nov 30, 2010","Nov 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/135164.Music_of_a_Life

The howling wolves that come for their prey are both the two-legged and the four-legged kind, and each will stop at nothing to prevail.The book opens with the introduction of Martha Allen, a resourceful and sharp-tongued young woman who is forced to take the position of glorified servant to her weak-willed cousin Patience, who is expecting her third child in colonial Massachusetts. There she meets a giant of a man, the Welshman Thomas Carrier, a hired worker with an air of mystery. It is rumored that for the love of Oliver Cromwell’s cause, he took an axe to the head of King Charles I and now has a bounty on his own head.For Martha, Patience, Thomas and the other characters, life in the colonies is not easy. They must deal daily with threats of the plague, famished and hostile Indians, hard toil, and of course, the ever-present danger of the wolves. And the dangers lurk not in the community, but from overseas. Unbeknownst to Thomas, King Charles II has ordered a group of brutal Royalist minions to cross the ocean and bring Thomas back to be drawn and quartered for killing his father.The two stories – that of Martha and Thomas in the colonies and the expertly trained and thuggish killers who are determined to capture Thomas – are juxtaposed, each highlighting the same theme: the courage and independence that are demanded in a time of danger and change.Kathleen Kent does not shy away from darkness. She depicts everyday life in all its gore: an injured and frightened lamb being used as bait, a horrific recounting of a pit bull dog fight, the impressments of a young lad who is destined to be thrown overboard, the capture and burning of conspirators at the hands of some Indians. Those who have read Heretic’s Daughter know that this is not an author who will whitewash the quest for survival or the challenges of day-to-day existence in an often-unfair world.Even the progression of the love between Martha and Thomas is tempered by harshness dashed with a dollop of sweetness. At one point, Thomas pauses to tell her, “You are the deer shot through with arrows whose heart grows cold for want of being taken.” And eventually: “But for this day, we live. So bide with me. Bide with me and take from me what you can, as I will from you. And however long we walk this earth, we can stand for one another…”The book falters a bit when it takes the reader away from the main action to the back streets of London or the tempestuous times aboard a creaky merchant ship. Knowing that this is a prequel, the suspense of the hunt for Thomas is stunted. But then Wolves of Andover always rights itself and shines, capturing – through Thomas’s telling – the turbulent times and battle between Charles I and Cromwell and focusing on life in the plucky colonies and the budding romance of Martha and Thomas. It bears mentioning that Kathleen Kent is a descendant of the real Martha Allen Carrier, who was hung as a witch during the Salem trials of 1692. She does her ancestor proud with a book that is admittedly not an historical recreation, but rather a page-turning book of historical fiction (emphasis on the fiction) that, once started, is impossible to put down. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 27, 2010","Nov 30, 2010","Nov 27, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7933820-the-wolves-of-andover

This is the world Jaimy Gordon takes on – Indian Mound Downs, where the horses are mostly aging, drugged, or lame and the trainers are as crooked and cynical as they come.Into this world steps Maggie, a young, college-educated frizzly-haired, naïve girl who has hitched her wagon to her boyfriend Tommy’s star – a “young fool” with a scheme to rescue his failing stable. He intends to ship four down-and-out horses there, race them at long odds, take the money and run before anyone knows what’s happened. But Maggie and Tommy don’t really have a clue what they’re up against – jaded and desperate men for whom horses mean nothing and people mean even less.Jaimy Gordon knows her way around this world and she certainly knows her horses. Each of the four parts of the book is centered on an individual horse – Mr. Boll Weevil, Little Spinoza, Pelter, and the “devil horse” Lord of Misrule. These are horses filled with personality, treading their way into the flying mud with chopping legs and nostrils cavernous and flaring, neurotic as all hell, almost but not quite ready to live up to their potential. The descriptions of the horses and the races they enter and the conditions they endure are among the finest you’re ever likely to read.Ms. Gordon’s idiosyncratic people are slightly less developed, mainly because they are down-and-out and trapped. Some of them shine: Medicine Ed, for example, who dispenses drugs to the horses is beautifully depicted and Maggie – and her cruel awakening – is also detailed with fine strokes. So is Two-Tie, Maggie’s gangster uncle who strives to be her protector. Others – including Tommy -- are less so.These lowlifes speak in their own racetrack patois (and it helps to know at least be open to learning this patois); they are limited and restricted, unable to survive without the dust and the road of the racetrack. It’s difficult to even think of them racetrack hanger-ons existing in the outside world -- perhaps the one glaring fault of the novel. The characters become secondary to the world they live in, bit players who strut and fret their hour on stage when ultimately, they are mostly doomed. Tommy reflects: “Now it all falls into place. Before, you thought you knew, and felt your way along blindly. And though this world is a black tunnel of love where the gods admonished you to search without rest for your lost twin, it’s also haired all over with false pointers, evil instructions, lost-forever dead-ends.”There is a propulsive energy to Lord of Misrule, a voice that’s strong and original, and an intimate knowledge that’s in turn, poignant, comic, heartbreaking, and suspenseful.

Paula McLain – in an addictive and mesmerizing debut book – breathes life into their life together in Paris in the 1920s, when everything was just starting to come together.It was a golden time in Paris. Ernest Hemingway was a writer on the cusp; he was championed by Sherwood Anderson -- whom he eventually turns on – and he hung out with expatriates Gertrude Stein and Alice Tokias, Ezra Pound and his lover, Shakespear (no “e” at the end), and later, with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Gerald and Sara Murphy. He eagerly sought advice, learning to fine-tune his craft, especially with the guidance of Gertrude Stein: “She’d hit on something he’d recently begun to realize about directness, about stripping language all the way down.”Yet the book is always, definitively, Hadley’s to narrate – and indeed, she does so quite sympathetically, in the first-person. In many ways, it is a re-telling of Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast, as Ms. McLain pushes deeper into the lives of her characters while remaining true to the facts.Hadley meets Ernest not long after the death of her overprotective mother, and marries him after a short courtship. Nearly a decade older than her new spouse, she lets him lead the way; when Sherwood Anderson convinces him to go to Paris, she gladly signs on. In many ways, she becomes the personification of Hemingway’s famous “True Woman” – someone who is true and gentle and good and strong – without losing her essence.As their life becomes more and more colorful – ski trips, visits to Ezra Pound at Rapallo, wasted drinking weekends at Pamplona for the running of the bulls, Hadley asks one of their friends, “What is it we want, exactly?” The answer, “Everything, of course. Everything and then some.” Hadley retorts, “If this is a festival, then why aren’t we happy?”Happiness is hers in fleeting moments, as Ernest begins to attract attention for his work, after her son is born, and when she loses herself in her piano playing. But Hemingway is crippled by what would now be diagnosed as PTSD as a result of his war years, and is way too self-destructive. Followers of Hemingway know that he will leave her for another woman -- the hypocritical Pauline Pfeiffer, who embraces them both, calling them “her cherishables” and “her dears.”Hadley is, of course, immortalized for the famous lost manuscript incident. When her husband was covering the Lausanne Peace Conference, Hadley paid him a visit in train and packed all of his manuscripts including the carbons in a small valise, which was stolen and never recovered. This is but one of the story lines depicted in this page-turning debut.With a few missteps – a little too much foreshadowing and sometimes, an over-awe of her subject – Ms. McLain eloquently captures the innermost feelings of Hadley as well as the Paris life at a heady and exhilarating time. Years later, Ernest Hemingway – who married four times in all – writes of Hadley, “I wish I had died before I loved anyone but her.” I closed the pages of this book wondering how much better his life might have turned out had he remained with the woman he called “the best and truest and loveliest person I have ever known.”...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Nov 19, 2010","Nov 22, 2010","Nov 19, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8683812-the-paris-wife

And that’s a good thing, because I had no preconceived notions about what the story should be.It would have been easy enough for Doctorow to focus on their fact-filled ghoulish history – the stuff from which urban legends are defined – but the author veers into different territory. He places them in the epicenter of decades of history, conjuring up pivotal events: the gassing of Langley in World War I, the internment of their gentle American-born Japanese housekeepers in the next war, the anti-Vietnam rally in Central Park attended by the childlike flower children of the generation.It is to Homer – the blind brother -- that the interpretation of these events falls. Homer must deal with Langley’s mania as he stockpiles morning and evening newspapers and states, “Everything in life gets replaced. We are our parents’ replacements just as they were replacements of the previous generation.” Langley’s quixotic goal is to fit all of American life in one edition, as history repeats itself over and over again. Homer knows it's up to the future generation -- like E.L. Doctorow -- to sort it all out.And it is Homer to whom the maxim “there is none so blind as he who cannot see” contradicts itself. The inference is that Homer CAN see; it is the world around him that is increasingly blind. He eventually asks, “What could be more terrible than being turned into a mythic joke? How could we cope, once dead and gone, with no one available to reclaim our history?” Langley hoards the history – trying to fit it into certain slots –but history has a way of expanding and breaking out.Doctorow’s achievement is to elevate the Collyers beyond the stunted legend, into near-prophets of the times in which they live. The danger, of course, is in doing so, the Collyers sometimes have that “Forrest Gump” feel (similar to the protagonist of Barbara Kingsolver’s excellently written The Lacuna), that detracts from their humanity. Still, for the sheer beauty of the prose and the ambitiousness of his mission (not for historical fact), this is a book that should be read and savored....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 16, 2010","Nov 18, 2010","Nov 16, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6324914-homer-langley

I gravitated to this one because of the publisher's comparisons to Joan Didion's Year of Magical Thinking, a lyrical, unflinching highly introspective book about the death of Didion's husband, John Gregory Dunne.This is not that book.Sally Ryder Brady -- the long-time wife of Upton Brady, the editor-in-chief of Atlantic Monthly Press -- lived in a rarefied world of famous writers and parties, sailboats and elegance.

However, there are ample hints that Upton Brady is gay, including his own admission to her about his forays with a family friend, early on in the marriage. Upton Brady is also displayed to be a raging alcoholic, narcissistic, selfish (although Sally has born him several children, he piggishly states that his earnings are ""my money""), abjectly cruel, and emotionally abusive. Yet Sally eulogizes their marriage and this book is described as a ""story of great love."" In addition, in an all-too-familiar tale, Upton Brady is forced by the rigid and judgmental tenets of the church to feel that he is ""sinning"" by embracing who he really is -- and, in fact, ""sinning"" with premarital sex (although substance abuse, of course, is fine). Rather than explore the paradox of a ""loving church"" that forces people into self-hatred (by the laws of man, not God), Sally never casts her eye on this diachtomy.I was left with feeling that this was a mildly titillating read that did little to explore the big picture, and never fully convinced that it was ""worth it"" to remain in this marriage.

She was the first to discover an ichthyosaurus and complete pterosaur in Lyme, Great Britain, as well as the squaloraja, a transition animal between sharks and rays.She and her older friend Elizabeth Philpot – a middle-age spinster whose fossil fish collection ended up in Oxford – are now given their due in this complex and fascinating novel by Tracy Chevalier. It is a riveting work for many reasons: the exploration of the plight of English women in the 1800s, the class distinctions that define these women’s very identity, the art and science of fossil-hunting, and perhaps most of all, the advent of a new way of thinking about the world that had been hobbled and confined by superstitious religion.As a young child, Mary survived a lightning strike, which the locals felt gave her an uncanny gift for finding fossils. Her impoverished family sold these “curies” to Lyme tourists and eked out a living…until she came across a “crocodile” – in reality, the ichthyosaurus – which changed everything.As Elizabeth explains to her teenage nephew much later on: “When Mary discovered that ichthyosaurus, she did not know it at the time, but she was contributing to a new way of thinking about the world. Here was a creature that had never been seen before, that did not seem to exist any longer, but was extinct – the species had died out. Such phenomenons made people think that perhaps the world is changing, however slowly, rather than being a constant, as had been previously thought.” The world is suddenly seen to be older than the six thousand years, she goes on to say, calculated by Bishop Ussher.Much of this book is based on fact – for example, a spellbinding auction of collected fossils from one of her patrons, Lt. Col. Birch (a man who was above her station, but whom she loved) to raise money for Mary. Or the accusation of the renowned French scientist Cuvier, who accused Mary of fraud – a charge she successfully rebutted. But the novel really shines when it reveals the interactions between Mary and Elizabeth, in meticulous period detail. Elizabeth is the main voice of the novel – educated, analytical, pragmatic – and it is she who teaches Mary how to read letters, and especially how to read people. Ms. Chevalier does not shy away from the jealousies and resentments of these two women nor the ups and downs of a highly unconventional friendship, cemented by a shared passion for collecting…and eventually, for a man.The title that Ms. Chevalier chose, of course, has a double meaning. The extinct “monsters” that are unearthed by Mary are, indeed, remarkable, but so are these two women who influenced many famous male scientists (who gladly and greedily took the credit.)Elizabeth muses --when she shows up uninvited and unwelcome at the prestigious male-only Geological Society to defend her friend’s name -- “This is all she (Mary) will get: a scrap of thanks crowded out by far more talk of glory for beast and man. Her name will never be recorded in scientific journals or books, but will be forgotten. So be it.

But afterSomehow, I missed Dinaw Mengestu’s impressive literary debut – which garnered reams of ecstatic praise – so I’m a little late to this party. But after turning the last page of How To Read The Air, I can see what all the fuss was about. This is an exquisite multi-layered book, an extraordinary look at immigrant’s identity, the downward spiral of violence, the power of story-telling, and the vision of redemption. It is rich, complex, and very, very good.His protagonist, Jonas Woldemariam, is treading water at his position at a refugee resettlement center in Manhattan. In time, he is given the job of “editing out the less credulous or unnecessary parts of some of the narratives, while at the same time pointing out places where some stories could be expanded upon or magnified for greater narrative effect.” While there, he meets his wife-to-be, Angela, an ambitious and upwardly mobile fellow African-American who craves stability, security, and the great American Dream.Despite their mutual attraction, Angela is nearly immediately on to Jonas: “You don’t have any idea of who you are, do you, Jonas.” Jonas muses, “If I didn’t know who I really was, then I could hardly be held accountable for not facing life as she expected me to. I was innocent if there was no person behind the skin that could be charged.”The story of Jonas and Angela is juxtaposed with one of Jonas’s parents. Jonas’s parents, Mariam and Yosef, left Ethiopia, a land of terror and uncertainty. Their marriage was defined by consistent violence, which Jonas observed over and over again. Jonas knew that his father developed a special sensitivity to “the abrupt and dramatic shift of the air that precedes any violent confrontation. Something vibrated, buzzed. If ever there was a way to narrate it, he would have described it as the tiniest particles that made up the air we breathe becoming suddenly charged and electrified with a palpable life of its own.”Dinaw Mengestu lays out, brick by brick, the legacy of violence when overlaid with the immigrant’s experience. As Angela’s cravings for reassurance – including expensive shopping sprees – increase, Jonas becomes increasingly distant and reserved. When Jonas hears of his father’s lonely death, he begins to rewrite his own history in his new position as part-time teacher at a student academy. Soon, he falls under the spell of his own stories, reinventing narrative to make sense of his life.He reflects, “While this part of the story wasn’t true to anything, I, or anyone I knew had ever experienced, it had an air of serendipitous salvation that struck me as being so unlikely that one had to believe it had occurred that way.”This is a breathtaking astounding look into the retelling of truth in an effort to find oneself. It is about the price of honesty and the repetition of cause and effect. It is a book that will linger with you and get under your skin. I cannot recommend it highly enough....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 02, 2010","Nov 07, 2010","Nov 02, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7930252-how-to-read-the-air

You never know what you will get. The good news is, with House ArresReading a debut book is sort of like Forrest Gump’s proverbial box of chocolates. You never know what you will get. The good news is, with House Arrest, you get something that’s very savory indeed.Ellen Meeropol is a self-described “literary late bloomer” – even more enticing. House Arrest focuses on home-care nurse Emily Klein an her charge, Pippa Glenning – the young cult member under house arrest for the freezing death of her young daughter during a winter solstice ceremony. As the pregnant woman in her self-described family, it is Pippa’s responsibility to dance in the upcoming solstice…a near impossibility since she is confined by a ankle monitoring device. Soliciting Emily’s help is her only chance.The author – a long-time nurse and a social justice activist – does not take the easy way out by turning this into a crowd-pleasing adventure saga. Rather, she explores the ethical dilemmas that confront each of us every way we turn. These two women come from markedly different backgrounds, yet both are dealing with family incidents from the past…and the present. And both are navigating the limitations of freedom.Families, Elli Meeropol suggests, is a fluid definition. We get flashbacks to birth families, the cult family, families composed of cousins and exes living together. And ethics can be similarly fluid. At the beginning, Emily muses, “I didn’t know Pippa well, but I already suspected she wasn’t much on toeing the line either. Me? I follow the rules.” Or does she? Aren’t there times when rules are meant to be broken? And when?When Elli turns her laser beam on the world of home health, she writes with a special authority. In reading up on her background, I discovered that she authored many articles about pediatric issues and latex allergies, and was given a Chair’s Excellence Award from the Spina Bifida Association of America. Zoe, the young child of Emily’s cousin, has spina bifada, and she is one of the most delightful and fully-realized child characters I’ve recently met.The key flaw of House Arrest is the rather fast bonding of Emily and Pippa – two very mistrusting women – with each other. As a reader, I would have preferred a more languorous meeting of the minds; each one seems to instantly know the other will be a trusted friend without enough cause. That aside, this is still an assured debut that shimmers with authenticity. While reading it, I was immersed in the world she created. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 28, 2010","Nov 02, 2010","Oct 26, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9862830-house-arrest

She’s sassy and unaffected, disobedient and fun-loving, lonely and imaginative. And she’s also the daughter of a demanding and organized military man, and his emotionally fragile wife, Mara.At the book’s beginning, her father is getting ready to move the family to Washington D.C. to assume a top Pentagon position. Tillie is left with her father’s no-nonsense assistant and is to be sent for a week or so later, when everything is settled. But when she arrives, her mother has disappeared. And Tillie is left with feelings of confusion, pain, and inadequacy.Had Ms. Henderson concentrated her story on Tillie’s struggle – as she does, indeed, do in the first half of the book – this would be a strong book indeed. However, she moves into plot twists that become increasingly surreal and, to my mind, inauthentic.While Tillie imagines her mother murdered by her father or locked up in an asylum, the truth is much more complex. I will give no spoilers, except to say that the way the plot eventually plays out would be unlikely in real life. The children themselves would have guessed far earlier, neighbors would have been alerted, and interventions (including divorce) would have been the more likely conclusions. As a reader, I was unable to understand how Mara and Roy (the parents) came together to begin with, let alone everything that followed.There is also a significant subplot where Tillie meets a black girl who is bused in from the projects, named Shirl. Despite the times – race relations were heating up and equality was being fought for – there are only the most clichéd references. Indeed, Shirl seemed like a black girl as envisioned by a white writer; there was something not quite convincing about her.In the end, I felt that Ms. Henderson has ample talent but there are too many flaws for me to  more favorably. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 26, 2010","Oct 28, 2010","Oct 26, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7907787-up-from-the-blue

It has to be a distillation of experience more true to a person’s life than any moment he or she has actually lived.”Through that definition, Legends of a Suicide is a true book. James Edward Vann – the author’s father – did, indeed, kill himself when David was only 13. But the circumstances described here are that of mythology – a real-world event that is imagined, transformed, repackaged, reimagined. The book holds fast to the truth of the suicide and how it affected the author, even when it diverges significantly from the facts.In ways, one can describe this book as a howl in the dark; the tentacles of the father’s despairing act reach through the years and ensnare the author for decades. The book – opening and closing interweaving short stories and a novella – are mostly set in Ketchikan and the isolated Alaska woods.What emerges is the portrait of a self-absorbed, clinically depressed, damaged man. At one point, the fictional-but-real father says, “I need the world animated and I need it to refer to me. I need to know that when a glacier shifts or a bear farts, it has something to do with me…”Half-way through the book, there is a gasp-out-loud moment that will totally transform the relationship between the father, the son, and indeed, the reader. Everything is suddenly reconfigured and as the book takes form again, the reader begins to realize exactly how the suicide has affected the author. I will not reveal this spoiler, but it is one of the most astonishing feats I’ve seen in reimagined fiction. And although the reader understands that he or she is truly in a psychological wilderness, it does not take away from the truth of the experience.There are hints of Tobias Wolff and even Hemingway in the author’s control of the style, but make no mistake: this is a very authentic new voice. At the end of the day, it’s about a vulnerable son who does not have the mental apparatus to deal with an emotionally ill father who desperately seeks to stay on top of his life while falling through the crevices.

It takes place in nine loosely woven chapters and, at its core, it’s about the power of stories.“We’re always in stories,” says Leo Richter, the fictional famous writer. “Stories within stories within stories. You never know where one ends and another begins! In truth, they all flow into one another. It’s only in books that they’re clearly divided.”Two of the stories – towards the beginning and at the end – are focused on Leo Richter (famed for his “unpredictable shifts and swerves that were flourishes of empty virtuosity”) and his latest lover, a United Nations negotiator. Two others focus on a cell-phone manager who is leading a duplicitous life with a wife and mistress and his unbalanced underling who has a dark admiration for Leo Richter. Yet the greatest number of characters are writers, and Kehlmann is not above some inside jokes; for example, throughout the book, people keep asking Richter that hackneyed question, “Where do you get your ideas?” He answers, “In the bathtub,” which elicits some pseudo-sage “ohhhs” and “ahhhs.” These writers (and a well-known actor named Ralf) are losing all sense of identity and their grip on reality. Ralf, for example, opts out of his own life to become a “Ralf impersonator” and then cannot find his way back to becoming his authentic self.In other stories, the characters themselves acquire a life of their own. One of my favorites was that of a retired schoolteacher – a character in a Leo Richter story – who lobbies to persuade Richter not to let her die in a Swiss euthanasia clinic. In a balancing story, Richter’s lover fears that he is going to steal the details of her life for another story.The stories do not cohere to a cohesive work yet one by one, few of them are powerful enough to stand alone. The interlocking quality of the stories is not as present as it should be; truly, this is a short story collection and not a novel “as advertised.” Still, I enjoyed these stories and Kehlmann’s take on the paradoxes of fame – and fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 21, 2010","Oct 23, 2010","Oct 21, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6072294-ruhm-ein-roman-in-neun-geschichten

According to legend, the witch appears in the heat of day to spirit away children from their distracted parents. Those who are able to engage the witch in a short conversation find that her witch-like powers evaporate.In Julia Franck’s brilliant English version (translated by the very talented Anthea Bell), Helene gradually retreats into silence and passivity, losing her ability to communicate effectively. We meet her in the book’s prologue as the mother of an eight-year-old boy, leading her son towards a packed train in the direction of Berlin. Before the train arrives she tells him a white lie, abandoning him at a bench, never to return. In the succeeding 400 pages, the reader gains a glimpse as to what drove Helene to this most unnatural act.Helene is born into a family that defines the word “dysfunction”. Her charismatic, morphine-addicted older sister Martha engages her in an incestuous relationship. Her mentally unbalanced “foreign” (i.e., Jewish mother) is unable to connect with her two daughters, totally distancing from them when their father goes off to fight the Great War and becomes grievously injured. When the two sisters gain the chance to flee to Berlin, they grab it and train as nurses, exposing them to the pain of their patients and also giving them ready access to drugs.Martha fits right into the debauchery and frantic partying of a decaying Berlin with her enlightened free-thinking friend and physician-lover, Leontine, but Helene is far more circumspect and sensitive. Her one enduring love is a philosophy student named Carl who also feels deeply and tells her, “The God principle is built on pain. Only if pain were obliterated from the world could we speak of the death of God.” When he is gone from the scene, she is unable to protect herself from victimization, occurring time and time again, with sexual predators and the cruel man she eventually marries.As readers, we watch helplessly as Helene becomes increasingly detached, her heart becoming cold and numb. So it is no surprise when she concludes of her son, “…she had nothing more for him, her words were all used up long ago, she had neither bread nor an hour’s time for him, there was nothing of her left for the child.” As the book progresses, the reader is forced to adapt an omnipotent stance; we know the consequence of some of the characters’ decisions and the genocide that will soon follow, but we are powerless to guide the characters through. Julia Franck instructs through omission as much as she does the details. When Helene calls Berlin to speak to Martha and gets no answer, we as readers are reasonably sure what has occurred. But it is never confirmed. As a result, as Helene goes numb, we begin to understand. And we begin to gain some compassion for an act that virtually all mothers would consider unforgiveable.There is a menacing, ever-shifting quality that pervades the book, become more and more pronounced as Hitler rises in power. There is no black-and-white morality or easy outcomes; there are simply all kinds of loss – loss of one’s sanity, loss of innocence, loss of love, loss of the natural order of things, loss of hope. The more the characters lose, the more they must abandon.

There’s a great deal of power in your work. But there’s something hidden about the poems. They draw attention and give nothing back.”By the end of All Is Forgotten, Nothing Is Lost, I felt the same way about Lan Samantha Chang’s novel.In many ways, it reads like a fable. There is, at its core a triangle. There’s Miranda (no accident, I think, that Miranda’s name is the same as Duke Prospero’s daughter in The Tempest – a sheltered and beautiful woman who becomes emotionally entwined with the fates of the seekers). There’s Roman, a handsome, charismatic, talented student and lastly, there’s Bernard – his introspective, socially crippled friend who worships Miranda from an emotional distance.The book succeeds when it explores the attractiveness and destructive power of art. Roman’s star peaks early; Bernard laboriously pursues his own perhaps brighter star, yet ultimately, there are personal costs that must be borne by both. Ms. Chang is in her element as she turns her novelist’s eye on the rewards and costs of this pursuit of literary excellence and literary fame.Where she doesn’t succeed – in my opinion – is to develop fully fleshed characters. She has us believe that Miranda – a talented and married poet who wields absolute power in her classroom and goes to great lengths to remain elusive – suddenly is willing to throw over her career and her carefully-wrought stability for Roman. And why? Roman is portrayed as a handsome, callow, talented student who is, at the very least, careless with his emotional conquests and at the very most, unnecessarily cruel. He is her student and half her age. While things like that happen all the time, nothing in Miranda’s background seems to suggest she would be susceptible to a love affair with Roman.Roman is, ultimately, unlikeable. And while I have a high tolerance for unlikeable characters, I need to understand why I don’t like him. Why are so many attracted to him? His great looks only go so far. There has to be something more – some charisma, some inherent charm – that I can’t glean in him. Why would he attract such loyalty in Miranda, who falls quickly from a self-sufficient woman to a moth around his flame, and Bernard, to whom he is less than kind. In the end, I felt attracted to the themes of All Is Forgotten, but I suspect it will be quickly forgotten.

It’s quite simply one of the most lavishly imagined, masterfully researched, exquisitely written contemporary novels I’ve read. And if that sounds as if I’m gushing…well, it’s probably because I am.Under Fishbone Clouds is written by debut author Sam Meekings, who grew up near the south coast of England and currently resides in China. It is absolutely remarkable that the author is under 30; the book if full of gravitas and maturity that is normally the result of decades of living and writing. Interwoven seamlessly within this mesmerizing narrative is Chinese folklore and myths – absorbingly told – in addition to insights into Chinese distant and recent past history.This novel is narrated by the Kitchen God, a common household deity who is challenged by the more powerful Jade Emperor to fathom the inner workings of the human heart. He chooses to follow a couple who, like him and his own mythical wife, were caught in the whirlwind of history: Jinyi and his wife Yuying. The tale begins in 1942 when the two fall in love, in spite of their different backgrounds and their arranged marriage, and continues to their doddering old age as the new millennium takes hold. At the onset, Yuying follows her husband across war-torn China to her husband’s rustic and impoverished home. Bad times ensue, and when they eventually make their way back to the city, the Cultural Revolution has begun; everything now belongs to the state and all social strata are forced to undergo hard labor in the factories and the fields.Although the Mao Cultural Revolution years have been well documented, Under Fishbone Clouds takes you up close and personal to these dehumanizing times; it is a rare reader who will not wince at the no-holds-barred look at a country whose rigid ideology trumps personal relationships and freedoms. Business owners, entrepreneurs, artists, teachers, intellectuals – all are labeled “bourgeois” and re-educated in the harshest possible ways. In a particularly harrowing scene, a man has a heart attack and is ordered to “crawl” to comfort and stop being a slacker. The depths to which Jinyi and Yuying are forced to descend to – separately, without each other’s comfort – is heartbreaking.Yuying reflects, “Life isn’t meant for perfect things. I knew it when we were told to put making steel above common sense; I knew it when we were told to starve patriotically because the noble peasants had been huddling around homemade furnaces instead of growing food in the fields; I knew it when the whole country began to rise up to cut down the past. I felt in the pit of my stomach all the time; I just never knew what it was until now.”Yet despite the intensity of the Cultural Revolution years, Under Fishbone Clouds is not a book about tragedy; at its heart (and a big heart it is), it’s a family saga about the universal and enduring power of love. There is sheer magic and lyricism in the love that Jinyi and Yuying share as they navigate answers that are often impenetrable.And, Meekings suggests, by love we are transfigured. Jinyi realizes toward the end of his life: “Love also changes shape. It is no longer slim, lithe, nervous and sweaty palmed. It was no longer sleepless, heavy, a stone weighing deep within the chest. It was now warm, slow, soft, a tarry old blanket huddled under in the dark. It was the last embers of a promise made decades before, still glowing red though the flames had petered down.”Using Jinyi as a catalyst, the Kitchen God comes to the realization that people don’t just carry on with their lives because they must; the secret of life is love, atonement, and retribution. He puzzles out the human heart as he follows this couple through all kinds of trials: deep anguish, death of children, famine and forced labor, class warfare, drastic social and culture changes, isolation and homelessness, the loss of dignity and health. This is one of those rare books that I would confidently recommend to anybody: those with an interest in the history of the East, those who are enthralled with mythology and folklore, those who hold out for the best of prose, and those who are simply seeking an old-fashioned story where love prevails.

Matt Prior – the desperate narrator For everyone who put their faith in the American dream, the bubble that would never burst, this book is for them. Matt Prior – the desperate narrator of The Financial Lives of the Poets – is truly everyman…a basically good person who is now scrambling to stay marginally solvent in the wake of the huge financial crash.Matt hasn’t had it so good recently: he left a dying career in journalism (in one of the most scathing and accurate indictments I’ve read about modern-day newspapers) to develop a whimsical website using free verse poetry to dispense financial advice. Needless to say, not a huge market.On top of that, his shopaholic wife is on the verge of an affair with her hunky ex-boyfriend. His father, suffering from dementia, is sitting in the midst of his living room with the plaintive question, “Do you know what I miss?” The answer is inevitably either chipped beef or The Rockford Files. His two young sons may need to give up private school and enter a public school that’s the equivalent of the Iraqi combat zone. Oh, and have I mentioned that Matt’s accountant has just told him that he has “fiscal Ebola? He truly does. Based on bad financial advice to go for forbearance, a $31,000 balloon payment to the mortgage company is overdue, leading to almost immediate foreclosure. Small wonder, then, that Matt is attracted to two young stoners whom he meets in the 711 and cooks up a scheme…why not sell pot at a profit to get himself out of the hole?Yes, it sounds humorous – and it is. But Jess Walter revs it up a notch and addresses all the Matts in the world. Matt ruminates, “It’s almost as if Lisa and I deserve this. Or believe we do. And I don’t think we’re alone. It’s as if the whole country believes we’ve done something to deserve this collapse, this global warming, this endless war…We’ve lived beyond our means, spent the future, sapped resources, lived on the bubble.”At the end of the day, the blistering wisecracks and hold-on-to-your-seat twists and turns are secondary to the lesson imparted: that life is not meant to be fair, that our fantasies of what life “should” be is nothing compared to what really matters.

In The Death of The Adversary – poised on the brink of what soon will be one of the woWhat is the relationship between persecutors and their victims? In The Death of The Adversary – poised on the brink of what soon will be one of the world’s most horrific tragedies – an unnamed narrator in an unnamed country reflects on an unnamed figure who will soon ascend to power. Although the figure (“B”) is never revealed, it soon becomes obvious that he is Hitler and that the narrator is of Jewish descent.The narrator – who bemoans his own passivity – is blessed, or cursed, with high intelligence. Because he is unable to come to grips with evil for its own sake, he twists his logic to make sense out of the insensible; he knows B hates what the narrator represents, but he believes that the narrator desperately needs that hatred and, in fact, feeds on it…eliciting hatred in return. He goes further: in his “logical” mind, he believes that the adversary and his victims are in a state of symbiosis, feeding upon each other and because of their mutual need, neither adversary will eliminate the other. History, of course, has sadly shown how ludicrous this conclusion was.Keilson uses a conceit in presenting these musings; his fictional (or autobiographical?) narrator has deposited a manuscript for safekeeping during the war years. Now, as he awaits word of the death of B, he rekindles his memory about the events of those pre-war years.In haunting prose, he remembers his father’s words when he was only 10: “If B. should ever come to power, may God have mercy on us. Then things will really start to happen.” He recalls being ostracized from a group of non-Jewish children who expel him from their games. He remembers the ending of a close friendship with another man who, it turns out, is enthralled by B. and his ideas. He recounts the two times when his path and his adversary’s intersected. And, in one of the most devastating parts of the book, he recreates an evening at the apartment of a saleswomen he worked with whose brother and friends are revealed to be Nazi thugs, who desecrate a supposed Jewish cemetery to prove that even in death, Jews will not allowed to experience peace. As the young man describes in exhaustive detail how gravestones – even those of young children – were defaced, our narrator sits transfixed, unable to admit to his heritage or condemn these monstrous acts.It bears acknowledging that Hans Keilson – now a centenarian – lives in an Amsterdam village, after the Nuremberg laws forced him to flee from his native Germany. He is a psychoanalyst who pioneered the treatment of war trauma in children. It is no surprise, then, that the book is underpinned by a deep psychoanalysis of the relationship of perpetrator and victim, and the victim’s sense of denial and self-delusion.Sometimes this works; sometimes it doesn’t. By removing the victim from his more primal emotions, there is a certain sterility that is not normally seen in Holocaust-themed books. The translator, Ivo Jarosy, appears to take a literal rather than interpretive approach, which creates a certain British formality in tone. Still, as Arthur Miller once wrote, “Attention must be paid.” Hans Keilson is one of the last witnesses to the atrocity that was the Holocaust. In an era where – incredibly – a new breed of Holocaust deniers are rearing their ugly heads, it is important for the world to understand once again the sheer evil and damning repercussions of this most heinous act of genocide....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Oct 2010,"Oct 04, 2010","Oct 01, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8642793-the-death-of-the-adversary

The book is devoted to “truthiness”; Rick Bass quotes Ron Carlson in saying, “I try not to confuse the facts with the truth.”What he sets out to do is to unearth his truth and he does it with lyrical and often elegiac sensitivity. The Browns lived in simpler times… of small town growing-up, longings for love, dressing up for boys, cruel betrayals. Together as children, they sung three-part harmonies that were so smooth that they were dubbed “Nashville chrome.” During an early performance, they naively sign with an exploitive, morally challenged manager who, in effect, “owns” them from that point on, paying them next-to-nothing and working them hard.Rick Bass writes, “None of the Browns had a clue. They were like racehorses with blinders, thundering down the dirt track. There was a jockey lashing them, and the horses were dimly aware that there were people in the stands, but they knew nothing of where the track was going – whether it was straightening or circling in a loop – or of the consequences of their efforts and accomplishments.”The family eventually makes the acquaintance of a young and unknown Elvis; Elvis is drawn to the younger sister Bonnie and they enter into a sweet first love. Rather than lionize Elvis, this book humanizes him and chronicles the real-life friendship with unusual authenticity.This is an exquisitely written book – a novel that jumps from the heyday of the Browns to the present, where Maxine – now aging, ailing, and yearning for her glory days – has never been able to obtain the serenity of her younger siblings. It’s a psychologically-complex portrayal of a family “united in the desire to spill out onto the world and to change it before realizing that they each finally had to pull away.” Kudos to Rick Bass for this incredible rendering....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 27, 2010","Sep 30, 2010","Sep 27, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7981407-nashville-chrome

The young one is named Pajarita – translated to little bird – and the narrative, divided into three sections, sequentially focuses on her, her daughter Eva, and her granddaughter Salome.All three are strong, impassioned women, who are capable of making bold choices in order to remain authentic and true to themselves. As the century opens up with more options for women, the choices become increasingly bolder. One of the beauties of Invisible Mountain is that the prose accurately mirrors the country of Uruguay – from a time when gentle magic lit it from within to the near-present, when the country struggled under the harsh light of despotic politics.Each woman is named fortuitously and in ways, fulfills the destiny of her name. Each in turn, embraces passion, poetry, and politics and becomes a vessel into which De Robertis pours decades of Uruguayan and Argentinian culture and family dynamics. The magical lyricism (think: Isabel Allende or Gabriel Garcia Marquez) is replaced with the intense and painful down-to-earth images of a country that has veered from its destiny and imprisoned those with the courage to speak out. De Robertis writes: “This Uruguay: less innocent, smaller somehow, dwarfed by the looming world, more wounded, bleeding people out through its wounds, mourning the lost blood of the exiled and the dead and also those who simply shrugged and flew away, but also stronger for its wounds, mature, tenacious, wiser about what it can withstand, with a heart that beats and people who pulse through its pathways.” She could be speaking of her characters who also mature with their hearts joyfully beating despite their wounds.In many ways, this is a love song to Uruguay: “El Rio de la Plata’s curving motion a woman weeping against a balcony rail, the red aroma of beef roasting at las brasas at the corner bar…Montevideo’s sleepy beauties and its daily return into her skin.” In equally powerful ways, it’s a celebration of women, particularly mother-daughter relationships and how they evolve and endure.If there is a flaw in this novel, it is in the depiction of the male characters. The author was, at one time, a rape crisis counselor; perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that the vast majority of men are depicted as abusive, inebriated, unfaithful, and downright violent. There is one notable exception, but that character’s story is told inorganically; from both an economic and psychological perspective, the character’s decision – and the results stemming from that decision – would be highly unlikely in the real world.But as I closed the pages, I was left with the feeling that this multi-generational saga is assuredly destined to stand among the finest debut works, with a tone that is often elegiac and a theme that is truly of the ages. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 23, 2010","Sep 27, 2010","Sep 23, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5981625-the-invisible-mountain

Or, inIt’s been a long time since I’ve been introduced to a character as original as Linda – a woman who suffers from auditory-gustatory synesthesia. Or, in simpler terms, she has the rare ability to “taste” words as a result of a “neurological condition that caused the involuntary mixing of the senses.”Monique Truong represents her condition by marrying tastes with words; for example, “I thought youcannedgreenbeans knewpeanut butter.” Or “Lindamint. Stopcannedcorn it!” While the narrative can become a little cloying with this consistent device, it does serve to show the reader how estranged Linda is from her family…and indeed, just about everyone else in her life.Except for her colorful great-uncle, Baby Harper. Baby Harper harbors his own secrets – he, too, is not in sync with their rural North Carolina hometown – and he has a particularly strong bond with his grand-niece, whom he accepts wholeheartedly.There are several twists and turns in this sometimes elegiac book, and I would not want to provide unnecessary spoilers. The book is well worth reading for many reasons; the first is that it provides the only in-depth look of synesthesia I recall in my many years of reading. For example, Linda says, “I sometimes would crave a word. For me, there was, and still is, an appreciable distinction between hearing the word said and saying it for myself, though both would produce the same incomings. It was the difference between being served a good meal and having to cook one for myself.”Another reason: Bitter In The Mouth is a wonderful examination of loneliness and yearning for love, as in this differentiation between the missing and the void: “The void was the person, place or thing that was never there in the first place. The missing existed but was no longer present. One was theoretical loss. The other was actual. Which was worse?” Both the missing and the void are explored in their various manifestations. At times, the intrusions of North Carolina history halt the forward progression of the novel. And the ending is a little too wrapped up. Yet it is still a fascinating look at the experience of being an outsider within a dysfunctional family: an acerbic and infantilizing grandmother, a “respectable” father, a distant mother in the honeyed south. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 19, 2010","Sep 23, 2010","Sep 19, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7857663-bitter-in-the-mouth

So The Lotus Eaters sat on my To Be Read shelf for nearly three years before I picked it up. And once I started reading, the house could have burned down around me – THAT’S how compelling it is.Tatjana Soli’s main character, gutsy Helen Adams, is a photographer who feeds on the adrenalin rush of covering the war in Vietnam – an unwinnable war in which it is not unusual for a native Vietnamese to fight on each side as the war gets uglier. She will love and be loved by two men: Sam Darrow, a self-created American photographer who is hooked on the danger of war coverage and Linh, a Vietnamese photojournalist and former poet who is harboring explosive secrets. It has been a long time since I fell in love with a literary character, but I loved both these men – beautifully realized creations of the author.Sam asks Helen, ”Don’t you think it’s a calling to live in danger just to capture the face of those who are suffering? To show their invisible lives to the world?” As Helen begins to realize, sometimes, the question is not quite that simple. Sometimes, the craving for danger becomes an end in itself, blotting out the original noble goals. While Darrow claims to want to “photograph the North and South in peace”, Linh knows better. He reflects, “Most of the time, the reality of a situation fell into a gray no-man’s-land in between. The Americans called it ‘the Vietnam war” and the Vietnamese called it ‘the American war”, to differentiate it from ‘the French War.’” Eventually, Linh tells Helen, “You want to stand over the dead and cry, but that helps no one. That’s a tourist’s sensibility. Day after day I go out with photographers who are tourists of the war…The war is in my home.”And so, Tatiana Soli raises the integral questions: how do we bear witness to war? Once you really “see”, can you ever go back to a complacent former life? What happens when the mind becomes inured and the photojournalist needs more and more danger to get the same high? And what happens when you become so transformed that you only feel human when life is on the edge?Yet this book is far from philosophical. There are scenes that are so masterfully rendered that they will remain seared in my mind: the winning of hearts and minds that centers on a little girl and backfires, an insecure commander who orders one of his men into a suicide mission only to have that man choose his way to die, and most of all, the agony of the Vietnamese who are uprooted from ancestral homes and yet denigrated by their “saviors” (At one point, Helen dons a Vietnamese hat, only to be ordered to remove it; the men in the platoon all stomp over it).I loved this book.

And in SunsetPaul Auster is one of my favorite writers; always able to paint his characters with taut, finely-detailed, yet propulsive brush strokes. And in Sunset Park, he does not disappoint.This novel is less postmodern than his recent book Invisible. It focuses on debris: physical debris from trashed-out foreclosed homes in Florida that Miles Heller, a Brown University drop-out, rescues through his camera. And mental debris that Miles wrestles with after a spontaneous action on his part results in an accidental death, causing him to run from his New York family and live in self-imposed exile.Eventually, we will meet the other characters: four flat-broke twentysomethings who are searching for their more authentic selves, illegally squatting in an abandoned house in Sunset Park in Brooklyn. And we will meet Morris Heller, Miles’ father, the “Can Man” and an independent publisher, who has never quite given up that his son will eventually find his way back home. The fractured narrative, told sequentially in the third-person POV, weaves together a number of elements: baseball trivia including the economic recession foreclosure crisis, Jack Lohrke (“Lucky”) who cheated death repeatedly until the very end, William Wyler’s 1946 coming-home classic The Best Years of Our Lives, the demise of the literary publishing houses, and the Hospital of Broken Things, which repairs artifacts of a world that once was. The themes that Auster has explored in the past – art, rebellion, and soltitude – are all here again, this time dealt with directly and swiftly.These disparate elements all come together in an ending that took my breath away. In essence, Auster is asking: “Is luck random or is it within our control? How much responsibility can we take for occurrences? Is it worth hoping for a future when there is no future? Should we live for the passing moment or take the big picture into consideration?

Together, they are joined by a “common, day-to-day pursuit of music.”Music is the thread that ties this book together, and Amit Chaudhuri knows his stuff. He is, himself, a composer and musician and the meticulous detail and grand amount of exposition is clearly written by a man who has inhabited the world he creates.This is a populous novel; it’s easy for the reader to lose his or her way in the first 50 pages, and indeed, in other places in the book when many characters are introduced and obscure musical terms are freely used. It demands close attention to the text. Those who surrender to the text will be rewarded with lush language and a complex emotional landscape.The key character, Nirmalya Sengupta, is the teenage scion of a corporate father who enjoys all the trappings of the Indian nouveau riche. Not unlike many teenagers, he is trying to find his own way with the judgmental zeal that only the privileged can exude. With his long hair, grungy goatee, torn kurta and earmarked copy of Will Durant’s Story of Philosophy, Nirmalya is a purist: he dreams of classical music and softly condemns his mother Mallika, an excellent singer, for “selling out” to commerce over art. He is also more than a little naïve and spoiled: “Nirmalya had never known want; and so he couldn’t understand those who said, or implied, they couldn’t do without what they already had.”His guru Shyamji, is from the Brahmin caste; his father was a famous classical musician, but he has squandered his artistic inheritance by tutoring and enabling the dreams of the wealthy. Nirmalya might claim he “sold his soul” by straddling the two distinct worlds of classical versus popular music. The juxtaposition of Nirmalya and Shyamji sets up an intriguing premise: who should be granted more respect, the “upper born”, artistically-gifted guru or the newly-wealthy who are now, for all intents and purposes, his employers? What is the relationship between commerce and art and how does it “play out” in reality?Mallika – Nirmalya’s mother -- ponders this diachtomy: “Mallika had wanted recognition, that pure woebegone desire for a reward for her gift had accompanied her life from the start but never overwhelmed it; but she hadn’t wanted to dirty her hands in the music world; she’s wanted to preserve the prestige of being, at once, an artist and the wife of a successful executive. She knew, with an uncomplicated honesty, what her worth was; to what extent would she compromise or to which level stoop if others pretended not to.”There are flaws. The greatest is that at times, the demand for familiarity with Indian music – particularly classical music – can be disconcerting or even downright frustrating to the reader. A glossary or short introduction would have been immensely helpful. Still, The Immortals is a fascinating look at the Bombay of 30 years ago -- a Bombay that existed in pre-boom India.

Her first is the narrative voice she adapts: that of five-year-old Jack, a young boy who was born and has lived his entire life in an 11-foot by 11-foot room. One might think the voice would eventually become cloying or overly precious or manipulative or downright tiring. But it never does.Jack is an innocent, an imaginative child, whose mother was spirited away by an abductor (called Old Nick) when she was returning home from her college library. She has lived in Room ever since – for seven long years – and gave birth to Jack, the son of her abductor, within Room (a sound-proofed, lead-lined backyard shed). And she has tried her best to fashion a life for him there, creating innovative games -- from the Scream (done once a day), to Labyrinth and Fort and Bouncy Bunny. Together, Ma and Jack have created characters out of all aspects of Room – Rug, Plant, Wardrobe, Stove – watch the world on their small T.V. set, and devote every ounce of energy to each other.The horror of this confinement is racheted up through Jack’s simplistic view of the Room, which to him, constitutes the world. He hides in Wardrobe at night and times Old Nick’s visits by counting the number of creaks in the bed. He senses when Ma is “Gone”–depressed and withdrawn -- and yet can’t quite reason out why. But Ma is more attuned to the threats: she knows that as Jack ages, he is in increasing danger and that his budding curiosity will eventually cause him fatal harm.Eventually choices are made and freedom comes, but at a cost. And when it does, Ms. Donoghue develops some bold and powerful themes: is the Room we know safer than the World Outside? Is it better to have multiple choices or just a restrictive few? Are we all confined in a Room of our making – even when we choose freedom or have it thrust upon us – or will we eventually find the strength to break out?As Jack yearns for the security and predictability of Room, Ma tells him, “I keep messing up. I know you need me to be your ma but I’m having to remember how to be me as well at the same time…” The scariest thing for Ma is the fear that Room has obliterated who she really is. And for Jack? The scariest thing is a world without being the core of Ma’s universe.This riveting book – a book I easily place in my Top Five of the year – goes far beyond the victim-and-survivor tale. It’s an amazing and sensitive look about a mother’s love, a study of a “stranger in a strange land”, a tale that displays the power of survival, and an indictment of a society that has lost the ability to empathize with those who are hurting (Ms. Donoghue’s wickedly humorous look at the media and its over-the-top rhetoric is reason enough to buy ROOM.) Most of all, it’s a careful examination of how we can take the most heinous circumstances and painstakingly extract something of beauty and value.I cannot praise ROOM enough. It’s a triumph of story-telling filled with crackling dialogue, thought-provoking themes, and a page-turning quality that won’t let you stop until you reach the last page....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 13, 2010","Sep 14, 2010","Sep 13, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7937843-room

It’s a book about the legacy of betrayal and there’s not a single false or sanctimonious note to be found. Have I mentioned it’s very, very good?The book is divided into two narratives; the first takes place in the mid-70s when the protagonist, Sylvie, is only 12 years old. Her mother is “perfect”, the kind of mom who “wallpapered the insides of her silverware drawers” and her father is an ambitious surgeon who drinks too much and is prone to violence. Into this mix steps Mr. Robert, her mother’s lover, a man who is the epitome of everything her father is not – sensitive, funny, loving, and full of hopes and dreams.Thirty years later, Sylvie will ask her mother, “Did it feel like you had a choice? Or were you driven by forces beyond your control?” Her reason for the question is vastly personal: she, too, is on a crossroads, between her solid but emotionally absent husband Nathan, and her lover, Tai, who, symbolically, is a landscape architect who build labyrinths.Sylvie experiences her affair as “watching myself fall right through my life, floorboards splintering.” Using her lover’s language, she reflects that love is not simply “working the soil and laying the foundation for growth. There are boulders and tree roots , storm fronts and longing, someone’s decomposing old work boots. There are things you forgot to harvest, weeks of torrential memories…” As the affair takes wing, Sylvie struggles both toward and against her shared history with her mother, striving to make sense of her past, present…and future. “Ordinary World” goes far beyond a depiction of two marriages imploding – mother’s and daughter’s. It’s also about how our past comes back to haunt us, how we never truly escape the choices we make, and how most of the time, the power to fulfill our dreams lies in our own hands, not in the hands of others. It’s about how easy relationships can fall apart and how hard it is to keep it together. It’s about how unresolved issues come back to bite us. And most of all, it’s about how we need to “let go” to truly find ourselves....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 03, 2010","Sep 06, 2010","Sep 03, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7810984-outside-the-ordinary-world

We meet him when he is a pre-teen, pickpocketing his rich relative’s wallet so that his father will not have to experience the shame of losing at a card game. The stage is set: we know he is resourceful and will do whatever it takes to succeed.In the years ahead, Robert will show his resourcefulness in many ways: with his well-heeled college roommate who harbors a “shameful” (in some eyes) secret, with his unprecedented rise in his chosen law firm, with his choice of stunning women (all of whom are inevitably drop-dead gorgeous, sexually aggressive, and somewhat manipulative). He will also experience adversity with his first true love – Gwendolyn, an extremely fragile, socially conscious, vulnerable, and yes, gorgeous and doomed young woman. Sharon Pomerantz is at her best when she delves into an exploration of Jewish-American life in the 1960s-1980s: the one-time outsiders assimilating and taking their deserved place within the social hierarchy. The clash between the impoverished and frugal world that Robert shares with his birth family and the opportunities that are opening themselves for him is crisply done. Here is Robert, reflecting on the privileged life he shares with his moneyed wife and their young daughter: “Why now, when his daughter never needed to step inside a subway, and every major possession they owned came with insurance and an alarm, why now did he feel so nervous, as if he had woken up in the wrong life – a life lived from car windows and behind locked doors?”The paranoia of the Nixon years, the real estate and commodities boom and bust, the drug culture and over-the-top parties of the affluent, the wheeling-dealing of law firms – all this is handled with aplomb. Less successfully done is the focus on his Robert’s many relationships. The women are mostly caricatures: the self-destructive and forever-remembered first love, the cold and moneyed wife, the young-and-genuine actress on the cusp of discovery…as readers, we’ve met these women before.Still, this is a particularly American story – a Jewish-American story – of the class divides between rich and poor, rich and obscenely rich. It’s a story of “a family built for the 1970s.” Those who like straightforward, old-fashioned, rags-to-riches sagas will likely enjoy Rich Boy a great deal....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 30, 2010","Sep 03, 2010","Aug 30, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7231295-rich-boy

He has spent years in self-afflicted soltitude following the senseless and inadvertent death of his wife three decades earlier. After making an uncharacteristic choice – allowing his barn to become a preschool to help his rootless older daughter – his solitary life becomes dramatically transformed.Gradually, this trustafarian finds his world turned upside down as he falls for a younger woman with a young adopted son while purchasing the first swimsuit he has owned since college – laden with pink pineapples. A sudden complication in that relationship will emotionally test him in ways that he would never have dreamt possible. To add insult to injury, his beloved grandson, Robert – a Harvard pre-med student – becomes involved in an eco-activism movement that will have dire consequences.The characters that Julia Glass creates – including a Guatemalan landscaper, a gay preschool teacher, and Percy Darling’s two very opposite daughters – come alive so eloquently that they could literally walk off the pages. This book examines not only one’s responsibility to oneself, but to one’s family and to society at large by shining its laser beam onto the haves-and-have-nots in affluent New England and the costs and rewards of opening up to others.I loved this richly-layered and beautifully-rendered book.

Let’s Take The Long Way Home is, at its core, a love story. It’s a story of how a close connection with a friend can ground us and provide us with a life worth living. And it’s a story that any woman who has ever had a friend who is like a sister – I count myself among those fortunate women – will understand in a heartbeat.Gail Caldwell, the Pulitzer Prize winning author, met Caroline Knapp, also a writer, over their mutual love of their dogs. Ms. Caldwell writes, “Finding Caroline was like placing a personal ad for an imaginary friend, then having her show up at your door funnier and better than you had conceived.”Both women – about a decade apart in age – are passionate about writing and their dogs and have successfully dealt with alcohol addiction that knocked them to their knees. “We had a lot of dreams, some of them silly, all part of the private code shared by people who plan to be around for the luxuries of time,” Ms. Caldwell shares.Quickly, Gail and Caroline and their two dogs become a “pack of four”. They are both self-described moody introverts who prefer the company of dogs. Yet, “…we gave each other wide berth – it was far easier, we learned over the years, to be kind to the other than to ourselves.” As they grow closer, Gail and Caroline learn that nurturance and strength “were each the lesser without the other.”It is almost inconceivable that this close friendship would ever end, but Caroline is a smoker and at 42, she learns she has stage 4 lung cancer. Her death comes quickly, in a matter of weeks. Gail Caldwell reflects, “Death is a divorce nobody asked for; to live through it is to find a way to disengage form what you thought you couldn’t stand to lose.” And later: “Caroline’s death had left me with a great and terrible gift: how to live in a world where loss, some of it unbearable, is as common as dust or moonlight.” Eventually, she comes to realize “…we never get over great losses; we absorb them, and they carve us into different, often kinder, creatures.”This memoir is poignant, authentic, unflinching, and genuine – never manipulative or sudsy. In addition to the profound look at an extraordinary friendship, it also focuses on “inter-species” love – between two fiercely self-reliant woman and their dogs. The rich and moving portrayal of Gail Caldwell’s Samoy, Clementine, will be entirely familiar to those of us who have shared our lives with four-legged “fur babies”; love in any guise is still love.This eloquent book ends up being a celebration of life in all its complexities – including love, friendship, devotion, and grief. As Gail Caldwell writes, “The real trick is to let life, with all its ordinary missteps and regrets, be consistently more mysterious and alluring than its end.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Aug 19, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6855699-let-s-take-the-long-way-home

In her memoir The Glass Castle, she described in fascinating detail what it meant to be the daughter ofJeannette Walls is a natural-born storyteller. In her memoir The Glass Castle, she described in fascinating detail what it meant to be the daughter of Rose Mary and Rex, perhaps two of the most dysfunctional individuals on the planet, brainy underachievers who raised their bevy of children in a most unconventional way.By the end of that book, Jeannette was on her way to graduating from Barnard College and becoming a celebrated journalist in New York City. I exited the book wanting to know more and in ways, Half Broke Horses goes back to the well, helping readers understand the forces that shaped Rose Mary.Half Broke Horses precedes The Glass Castle by channeling the voice of Jeannette’s gritty West Texan grandmother, Lily Casey Smith. A rebellious and headstrong little girl, she is in charge of breaking in her father’s horses at age six and by age 12, she is running the ranch and helping to geld the horses. By the time she is a mid-teen, she takes off to the Arizona frontier atop one of the horses – Patches – to teach children not much younger than she is. All the while, she adheres to her mantra, “You had to be willing to work hard and persevere in the face of misfortune. A lot of people, even those born with brains and beauty, didn’t have what it took to knuckle down and get the thing done.”Knuckle down she does. Within the course of this true-life novel, Lily Casey Smith takes on many roles: she is a totally unorthodox teacher who gets fired from position after position, she marries and dumps a crumb-bum polygamist, she learns to fly an airplane, sells bootleg liquor from her back door, runs a 100,000-acre ranch with her second husband, the indomitable lapsed Mormon Cowboy, Jim Smith, survives tornadoes, floods, and the Great Depression, and gives birth to two incorrigible children, Jeannette’s mother Rose Mary and Little Jim.And herein lies the main problem with Half Broke Horses. The book has a campfire feel; it’s almost as if the reader is sitting at the author’s feet as she narrates one amazing adventure after another, upping the ante each time. But nowhere does the reader get the sense of the inner life of Lily Casey Smith, a rebel-before-her-time, a tough American original in the old frontier. After the birth of Rosemary and Jim, the prose becomes less imaginative, without the sparkle of The Glass Castle. Lily Casey Smith becomes bigger than life, a woman to be admired but not really known, whose life may or may not be filled with half-truths. The emotional distance the author takes from the narrative tends to distance us from ever really knowing Lily Casey Smith and Jim Smith....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 16, 2010","Aug 18, 2010","Aug 16, 2010",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8136642-half-broke-horses

Scott Fitzgerald describes Daisy Buchanan’s voice as being ‘full of money.’ :Who wouldn't love a book like that?The book focuses on a wanna-be author named Ian Minot, who toils in a coffee shop and envies his Romanian girlfriend who has just published the literary sensation of the year. His own stories are “small” and he is unable to find the right “home” for them. He is more than a little envious of Blade Markham, an ex-con who has written a smarmy memoir entitled “Blade by Blade”, which has topped the bestseller list, despite a glaring lack of talent. Enter Jed Roth, the Confident Man, who presents him with an offer he can’t refuse: rewrite Roth’s fictional book Thieves of Manhattan, repackage this over-the-top narrative as memoir, and become the darling of the publishing world. Roth adds, “When a hundred thousand copies of your book have already been shipped to every bookstore in America, you’ll say that every word in it is a lie…When people ask why you did it, you’ll tell them that you did it because it was the only way to get anyone to pay attention to your stories.”Shades of James Frey! Adam Langer divides his book into three sections: Fact, Fiction, and Memoir. And to add to the fun, the book is touted with real blurbs by two great literary hoaxers, JT Leroy and Clifford Irving. There’s an Oprah clone, a delicious look at bottom-crawler agents and more.

Page-turning, jaw-dropping, laugh-out-loud, cry-into-your-sleeves, gasp-with-recognition GOOD. It takes on nothing less than the theme of what is wrong with America today and it does it very well.The action takes place over one Thanksgiving day with lots of flashbacks. There hasn’t been a family like the Olsons since Zoe Heller’s The Believers – with a dollop of the movie Pieces of April blended in. This family DEFINES dysfunction. Gavin, the father, is a Vietnam vet whose career went wildly off track because of the anti-war sentiment when he returned. His wife Eleanor is a Wellesley graduate who traded in ambitions for an apron and a cookbook. Douglas, their older son, cashed in on the real estate boom – making him more successful than his old man ever was – and is now suffering the effects of the crash. His wife Denise – a one-time poor girl who has become enamored of the money – is less than enchanted with him. Ginny, the academic daughter, is emotionally closed-off and has recently adopted a 7-year-old Indian daughter, Priya,Add to that two 17-year-olds from the housing projects – Kijo and Spider – who have a personal grudge against Douglas and break-in and enter his home while they’re temporarily away – and you have the makings of a potentially tragic situation.The author, Jennifer Venderbes, has a clear understanding of the human condition. Her dialogue is crisp, compelling, and pithy. There are little gems throughout this book. For instance: “Men didn’t have heroes, they STUDIED heroes, as though greatness and masculinity could be transmitted through reading, as though knowing the lyrics to every Mick Jagger song…got them one step closer to playing Madison Square Garden. A woman, at most, would dress like the woman she admired…”There is much about the emasculation of the American warrior (Ginny is writing a paper on it), and how Vietnam was directly responsible for this phenomenon; this emasculation will show up time and time again. There is much about eminent domain and how it plays out in the real world, particularly with race relationships. There is much about how we – as Americans – have lost our sense of values and have substituted it with worship of money and status.But the book is never preachy or never pedantic. It’s filled with smart conversation, convincing characters, compassion and insights. Portions will make you laugh with recognition, other portions will break your heart. In a way, this is a portrait of the “every family.” You won’t soon forget the Olsons or the world that Jennifer Venderbes has so expertly created. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 02, 2010","Aug 07, 2010","Aug 02, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7114359-strangers-at-the-feast

With the one hundredth anniversary of the Armenian deportations only a few years away, author Mark Mustian has set himself a daunting task: to follow his character’s footsteps and to serve as a gendarme, a guide in the wilderness. For the most part, he succeeds admirably.As Mr. Mustian writes in the epilogue, “Genocide perhaps represents the ugliest of human deeds, the mass killing of often defenseless fellow beings…Saying it didn’t happen is a mere recipe for recurrence.”The focus is on one gendarme – a 92-year-old Turkish man named Ahmet Kahn on the verge of senility with a non-operable brain tumor – who must examine memories of events that he has previously denied or purposely forgotten. Many years ago – in World War I – he was a gendarme, charged with escorting Armenians across the border from Turkey to Syria. Many died from the grueling march and the lack of proper food and shelter and medicine.Women, in particular, had a tough time of it: they were frequently used as the playthings of the Turkish men who have grown hard and bored and demand women to do their physical bidding before killing them. One woman captures Ahmet’s attention: her name is Araxie and her eyes are her exotica, one nearly turquoise, one greenish-brown. Ahmet falls head over heals for her, sheltering her from the excesses of the trek that become, for all intensive purposes, a true genocide. Araxie demands of him, “Why not just shoot us all now? What is it about us you hate so?” And he must answer impotently, “I am only a small piece of the puzzle. I have a job to do. I did not ask for it, nor have I questioned its rationale.” As in books from the past – Sadie Jones’ Small Wars, for example, or the more famous A Separate Peace – Ahmet must eventually realize that his answer is non-satisfactory and that his love for Araxie outweighs the senseless slaughter.The novel is divided into two portions: the present day, where Emmett Conn suffers through mental disorientation, hospital confinement and the coldness of his grown daughter, and the past, where Ahmet Kahn – same person – struggles to survive amidst swollen corpses, monstrous murders, and clannishness, duplicity, and trickery. As the memories swell in intensity, the reader must ask, “How much of his memory is true and how much is a product of extreme guilt? What happened and what didn’t?”There are no clear answers. But as Mr. Mustian writes, “The point of the story seemed to be that to think is to forget, to filter from the mind the unnecessary, I have told myself this, repeated it to myself. I have called it our gift from God. This headstrong, heedless survival.” At the end of the day, love does survive…and so do the never relenting memories.

Three stories are interwoven: a whodunit story of how she got there and who perpetrated such violence on her…the story of forensic scientist Katya and her would-be suitor Nayir, a Bedouin guide, who is crippled emotionally by the yokes of his religion…and a vanished American expat Eric Walker, whose wife Miriam finds herself bereft in an alien culture where women truly have no face.What makes City of Veils stand out is its nuanced and highly intimate portrayal of a woman’s life in a repressive and paranoid country…where women’s faces are shielded, voices are silenced, and lifestyles are infantilized. Ms. Ferraris – who herself moved to Saudi Arabia with her now ex-husband and his extended family of Saudi-Palestinian Bedouins – has a voice that rings with authority. Some of it is unwittingly humorous: the husband Eric, for example, has a name that translates to a part of the male anatomy, and therefore is renamed Abullah while at work. But most of it is frustrating and heartbreaking. We read, for example, about women’s mini-rebellions, as they hide Bluetooth devices inside their burquas, which send the message, “Do you want to see my face?” Or the quagmire of lingerie stories: women cannot interact with the male proprietors of the stores; therefore, the government allowed women to work in these lingerie shops. Only one problem: the religious police are convinced women should be tending to their homes and babies, not shopping.Ferraris shows that this repression is not just a woman’s problem; it’s a man’s as well. Osama Ibrahim – the fair and liberal police investigator – believes his marriage is a strong one until he discovers his wife has been surreptitiously taking birth control pills. And Nayir, who was featured in Finding Nouf, is numbed down by the love he feels for Katya, all the while knowing she may not be such a “good Muslim woman”, and how can he possibly marry an infidel? Being in a car with a woman who is not his wife is excruciating for him: “This was the worst kind of weakness because there was nothing he could do about it…short of kicking her out of the car.”On one level, City of Veils has all the dimensions of a first-rate crime story; its eventual denouement in the scorching and unforgiving desert would make a stunning and crowd-pleasing movie. Yet on a deeper level, the book shines its laser-eye on woman who must be resourceful to even feel human while simmering inside, and the men who are raised to fear them and place a lid on their own human desires and compassion. City of Veils does what sometimes seems to be impossible – lifts the cultural veils off and looks gender segregation right in the eye....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Jul 28, 2010","Aug 02, 2010","Jul 28, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7168509-city-of-veils

It’s filled with vivid descriptions: afternoon sun streaming through the scarves in windows, stars that flare into full suns or disappear altogether, bright flashes of bird wings, wicks blazing in chandeliers, colorful marzipan fashioned into the shape of lemons, grapes, apples, and roses, glorious dresses in rich hues of blue watered silk with scarlett ribbons.The beauty of The Blind Contessa is that the young author, Carey Wallace, shows us exactly what is lost when Carolina Fantoni, an eighteen year old Italian contessa, gradually loses her eyesight.Her sight becomes a metaphor for the narrowing of her world in general. She becomes pledged to marry the town’s most handsome and wealthy bachelor, Pietro, who is good to her, but merely because of her exquisite beauty, not because of a meeting of the minds. It is her older married friend Pellegrino Turri, an eccentric inventor who enchants and engages her. Her mother cautions her: “After you are married…many things may happen. You will not speak of him. Neither will your husband, if he is a gentleman. Do you understand?”As Carolina loses all sight, Turri creates the world’s first typewriter to help her communicate with the outside world and to build deeper intimacy with him; something that is fraught with anxiety since both are married to other people. A simple read reveals a love affair between two people whose very souls connect despite overwhelming odds – a lyrical, poignant revelation of love fulfilled despite difficult odds.But a deeper read reflects that at its heart, The Blind Contessa’s true theme is the power of imagination: the invention of the typewriter (in historical fact, Turri did create this machine in 1808)…the ways our dreams compensate for what is lost in real life…and how our true vision is in our mind’s eye. Carey Wallace writes, “As the summer wore on, Turri had developed the habit of asking her where they were each time they met. At the question, a vision always sprang up…hidden waterfalls, new gardens, unknown shores. Perhaps lured by these imaginings, her dreams had begun to return as well.” Interestingly, as Carolina loses her sight, she begins to see whole new and fascinating worlds – those of her own creation. Her unseeing eyes may be useless, but her mind is stunningly alive and able to create a smorgasbord of mind-pictures.The author demonstrates a sure hand in her historical descriptions and a knowledge of the cost of encroaching blindness. Some characters need a little more back story, but all in all, this is a whimsical recreation of a forgotten time in history....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jul 28, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7718644-the-blind-contessa-s-new-machine

His writing is always exquisite and precise and heartbreaking and spare. In Out Stealing Horses and To Siberia, each word is used as a brick, building one upon the other, and not one brick is out of place.Per Petterson’s craftsmanship is on display here, as it has been in his prior novels. Alas, this one, which is explores the relationship between a mother and a son, is more static and sluggish than his other works. Still, Petterson at his less-than-best is still better than most writers at the height of their powers.Arvid Jansen is 37 and life hasn’t turned out exactly as it should. He has plundered the promise of a higher education to become part of the proletariat; he has embraced Communism and now the “party of the people” has unraveled and the Berlin wall is coming down His wife of 15 years is filing for divorce. And his mother – his beautiful, aloof, and strong mother – has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Arvid follows his mother to Norway where he reflects on his childhood, his flirtation with Communism, his birth family, and the women who have flitted through his life. Of his mother, he reflects, “I became the Lone Ranger, looking for unsafe ground, and I clung to her did tricks for her, performed for her, pulled laughter out of her with my silly jokes whose punchlines were lost in linguistic confusion…”Indeed, Arvid feels like he has disappointed his mother. In one of the more poignant scenes, his memory captures a time when his mother turned 50 and he prepared to give a toast. Drunk, out of his league, he bungles the moment and humiliates himself. He wants to say, “The good news, Mother, is the river had dried up…only a trickle remains so now it is easy to cross…so you see, nothing’s too late for us, we can walk right across or meet halfway.” What he DOES say is far different.Much of this book deals with the chasms between us, the rivers of time that don’t let us cross and connect. The river-as-time metaphor captures how Arvid is caught in the flow of life, sometimes turbulent, that has upturned his life and now may do the same to his two daughters. And, much like a river, the narrative ebbs and flows, becomes bogged down, bursts free in spurts, and meanders to its destination.Eventually, Arvid realizes that “…you suddenly realize that very chance of being the person you really wanted to be is gone forever, and the one you were is the one that those around you will remember.” In this, he is like everyman – sorting through regrets, trying to define who he really is, attempting to make peace (if only in his memories) with who he is and has been.The novel’s title is taken from a poem by Chairman Mao whom Arvid idolized in his Communist days; maturity and eventual mortality are themes that run throughout the book. This novel of ideas requires concentration and total immersion in the mind of Arvid; much of the action is internal and distanced. It will appeal to some, but not all, of Per Petterson’s fans. ...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jul 17, 2010","Jul 26, 2010","Jul 17, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7433149-i-curse-the-river-of-time

The title story, Memory Wall, presents the elderly Alma, who lives in South Africa where she undergoes periodic “harvesting” of memories, stored on a series of numbered cartridges. By “hooking herself up”, she is able to recreate experiences to stave off her worsening dementia. She falls victim to a criminal and his accomplice “memory hunter” who attempt to rummage through these cartridges to find the location of a rare and lucrative gorgon fossil – one that will be the ticket to the good life that has been denied them. The young accomplish muses, ”Dr. Amnesty’s cartridges, the South African Museum, Harold’s fossils, Chefe Carpenter’s collection, Alma’s memory wall – weren’t they all ways of trying to defy erasure? What is memory anyway? How can it be such a frail, perishable thing?”The ending story also focuses on an elderly woman – in this case, Esther, an orphan and an epileptic, who was spared the fate of her many close friends in Birkenau. Now in her early 80s and living in suburban Cleveland, her seizures are getting worse and she returns again and again in her mind to poignant, nightmarish memories of her times in ravaged Hamburg, as she relives her survivors guilt. As he watches her deterioration, her grandson Robert reflects, “Every hour…all over the globe, an infinite number of memories disappear, whole glowing atlases dragged into graves. But during the same hour, children are moving about, surveying territory that to them is totally new.”As in most short story collections, each reader will likely have his or her favorites. One of mine is the fable-like Village 113; the Three Gorges Dam is about to be built, submerging a village and forcing its inhabitants to relocate. The tale is relayed by seed keeper, whose engineer son is spearheading the project. Doerr writes, “Memory is a house with ten thousand rooms; it is a village slated to be inundated.” The seed keeper and the schoolteacher are quite literally drowning in memories.Each of Anthony Doerr's well-crafted stories focuses on the most important things in life: birth, death, survival, solace, but most of all the memories....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jul 14, 2010","Jul 17, 2010","Jul 14, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7696504-memory-wall

But it can be uneven; stretches of outstanding writing juxtaposed with pages that can be superfluous or preachy.*The characters are less universal than The Corrections. One of the characters in particular seems to elucidate Franzen's main political/social views on politics and socioeconomic issues. Some of his musings seem inorganic.*That being said, this novel is still better than much of what's out there. Some of the scenes are memory-searing. A few characters -- Patty Berglund and her son Joey, for example -- are portrayed with every nuance. It is very much worth reading.Ignore the hype -- good and bad -- and try to read Freedom with an open mind.

It is, quite simply, one of the best contemporary books I have ever read. And I have read a lot.The book – which reads like an allegory or dark adult fairy tale – transcends those genres by strongly tethering itself to recognizable events and images. Brodeck, by many indications, appears to be Jewish, yet he served as an acolyte to a priest in his youth, implying that he isn’t. The locale appears to be in France’s Alsace-Lorraine, yet many of the geographical features do not fit. And the Nazis have wrecked havoc in the region, yet they are never mentioned by name.What we DO know is this: Brodeck has been taken prisoner of war and has scratched and scraped his way to survival, serving as “Broderick the Dog” to sadistic camp officials. Against all odds, he has returned to his insular village where he is greeted with less than 100% enthusiasm.And now, an elusive stranger referred to as the Anderer – the Other – has appeared in the village with his horse and donkey and sketch pads, serving as a mirror to the truth of the village’s betrayals….its cowardice dishonorable conduct, spinelessness and moral stain. Early on, we learn that the village participated in a mass murder of the Anderer and it falls upon Brodeck – a low-level bureaucrat who now makes his living cataloguing the area’s flora and fauna – to write a whitewashing report about the event.Brodeck himself is “the other”; he is an orphan, with only the sketchiest recollections of where he comes from and how he got to where he is. He knows that “each of us was a nothing. A nothing handed over to death. Its slave. Its toy. Waiting and resigned.” His survival has not changed that fact: “The others the ones who came out of it alive, like me – all of us still carry a part of it, deep down inside, like a stain. We can never again meet the eyes of other people without wondering whether they harbor the desire to hunt us down, to torture us, to kill us.”His quest to discover what really happened to the Anderer is also a personal quest; to find out his own back story. At the start, the reader knows little: we know he has a mute wife Amelie and a young baby daughter and that he is merely tolerated by the village. As the book progresses, the picture begins to fall more and more into focus.As he interacts with the various members of the community, he at one point meets with the village priest. In one of the most harrowing passages, the priest says, “Men are strange. They commit the worst crimes without question, but later they can’t live anymore with the memory of what they’ve done. They have to get rid of it. And so they come to me, because they know I’m the only person who can give them relief, and they tell me everything. I’m the sewer, Brodeck. I’m not the priest; I’m the sewer man.”This book achieves something I thought would be impossible in literature: it universalizes the Holocaust. It offers up Brodeck as “every man” and his tormenters as “every man” as well. It reveals mankind’s ability to perpetrate the worst deeds and to turn its collective eye elsewhere when heinous deeds are being perpetrated. It displays our fervent struggle to forget and to absolve ourselves in the worst of times.The prose is luminous and masterful. For that, I must partially give credit to the incredible translator, John Cullen. In reading international books, I’ve learned that a good translator can make or break a work of literature, and Cullen does Philippe Claudel proud. As for Claudel, his insights are astounding and his words are transformational. Some of the scenes are exquisitely painful to read; I gasped and shed tears on some of the more horrific. Some evocations to works such as Camus’ The Stranger and Ibsen’s Enemy of the People come to mind but make no mistake: this is a highly original work.

It will grip you, entice you, and place you under its spell. And in the end, it just may break your heart.The book, narrated by Peter – a wannabe novelist turned businessman – focuses on his wife Georgie, a mother of three who has become unmoored with the day-to-day drudgeries of an ordinary life. A promotion to London puts a world of possibilities suddenly within reach. Peter ponders, “Shouldn’t I have told her…that everyone’s life had flat, ordinary parts? That growing older meant moving on, closing chapters in your life and opening new ones…”But he senses Georgie’s boredom and is on her side when she reignites her acting career, taking on the prestigious one-woman role of the true-life preeminent 18th century comedic British stage actress Dora Jordan. As she throws herself in the role, she discovers that she and Dora – the long-time companion of the Duke of Clarence (later, William IV) and the mother of 10 of his children – have a natural affinity.Gradually, Georgie “twins” herself to Dora, a kindred spirit whose struggle of motherhood versus career so mirrors her own. And, as any reader can guess from the title of the book, she enters into an affair with the elusive playwright, Piers Brighstone, that sets in motion a chain of events with tragic consequences.There is much about this book that sets it apart from the “chick lit” designation it might have become in a lesser author’s hands. For one thing, there’s the strength of the writing; Nancy Woodruff never resorts to overwrought, obvious, or manipulative sentences. For another, these characters and their pain are achingly real with genuine insights. At one point, Peter reflects, “When I looked at Georgie I saw two different people, the one I loved and the one who had broken my heart, and I had no idea how to dispose of one without losing the other.”But perhaps most compelling is the interspersed letters of Dora Jordan herself; in a preface the author claims to “remain faithful to both the facts of Mrs. Jordan’s life – insofar as they are known –and the warmth of her voice.” As Georgie states, “Two hundred years later and it’s exactly the same thing.”This is an unsparing look at a modern (and not-so-modern) marriage, a punishing glimpse into the costs of the decisions we make – yet it’s never preachy or moral. While I was reading My Wife’s Affair, I was totally enveloped into the world Nancy Woodruff created.

Each is a in a tenuous danse-a-deux with “the goon.”Every chapter is told from a different character’s point of view and it is no accident that the novel starts with Sasha – the assistant of music producer Bennie Salazar, one of the key focal points. Sasha has sticky fingers and is constantly pirating away meaningless objects to compose “the warped core of her life.” These objects serve as talismans, placing her at arm’s length from the love she wants.And Bennie? A one-time band member and arrogant indie genius, he is now one step removed from the action, adding flakes of gold to his coffee to enhance his libido and bemoaning the state of digital technology. Like Sasha, he’s at arm’s length from a direct connection with love and life in general. Bennie and Sasha will never know much about each other – even though they’ve worked together for decades – but the reader comes to know them through various stories. We get to know Lou, Bennie’s charismatic, misbehaving, skirt-chasing mentor during a harrowing African safari; Dolly, the PR mogul who places her own daughter in harm’s way; Jules, the ex-con journalist whose lunch with a Hollywood grade B actress goes terribly wrong; Ted Hollander, Sasha’s art-loving uncle, who travels to Naples to find her. Each will a little something to the puzzle.Yet none of their stories is told in chronological order, or even through flashbacks. Rather, time is revealed like the grooves of a record album, jumping from track to track in what appears to be no particular order. As each character takes his or her own moment in the spotlight, he or she is desperate for a second chance and to hold off the approaching goon. At one point, Dolly reflects, “Her deeper error had preceded all that: she’s overlooked a seismic shift…Now and then (she) finds herself wondering what sort of event or convergence would define the new world in which she found herself, as Capote’s party had, or Woodstock, or Malcolm Forbes’s seventieth birthday, or the party for Talk Magazine. She had no idea.”The rich, lush, adventurous life that these characters once lived is being replaced by PowerPoints (one young character reveals her story through a 40-page PowerPoint presentation), paid “parrots” who create social media buzz, truncated emails, and digital technology. As Egan’s characters “strut and fret” their last hours on the broader stage, the world of technology is making them increasingly irrelevant. When Alex – Sasha’s would be beau whom we meet in the first chapter – tells Bennie, “I don’t know what happened to me,” Bennie’s answer is, “You grew up, Alex…just like the rest of us.”...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jul 05, 2010","Jul 07, 2010","Jul 05, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7331435-a-visit-from-the-goon-squad

But for Daley AmYears ago, I sent out a birthday invitation with the theme, “It’s never too late to have a happy childhood.” Funny – or so I thought. But for Daley Amory, the main character of Lily King’s poignant and at times heartbreaking Father of the Rain, those words are anything but funny. We meet her as an 11-year-old, torn between the liberal and do-good world of her mother and the conservative, erratic, liquor-soaked world of her charismatic and arrogant father. A WASP of the first-degree – rich, Harvard-educated, disconnected – his signature phrase, while lying on his chaise chair, drink in one hand, cigarette in the other, is, “I wonder what the poor people are doing today.”Daley soon learns the rules of engagement with her father: “In my father’s culture there is no room for self-righteousness or even earnestness. To take something seriously is to be a fool. It has to be all irony, disdain and mockery. Passion is allowed only for athletics. Achievements off the court or playing field open the achiever up to ridicule. Achievement in any realm other than sports is a tell-tale sign of having taken something seriously.”This could fall into the world of stereotype or cliché – the toxic, alcoholic father and the daughter who tries to please him. But it doesn’t. Lily King takes great pains to paint Gardiner Amory – the father – as damaged but not evil. It is inevitable that the grown Daley try to reconnect with him and be the savior, attempting to liberate him from his alcohol dependency…as if that would make everything all right.Her beau will say to her: “Oh Daley…you want the daddy you never got. You want him to make your whole childhood okay…You’ve got it nicely cloaked in a gesture of great sacrifice.”The heartbreak, of course, is that none of us can ever “fix” another human being or get our childhood back. As Daley becomes more and more immersed in his world, falling into her charismatic and narcissistic father’s gravitational orbit, the stakes get higher and higher. There is not a false note in this authentic book, which takes the reader right into the vortex of a broken family relationship gone asunder. It is a compelling psychological study of how much we give up – including our own survival – to try to save and repair those relationships that are most dear to us. In a non-manipulative way, this book will pull at your heartstrings and stay with you....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,Jul 2010,"Jul 05, 2010","Jul 01, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7444174-father-of-the-rain

In reality, the book is lyrical, poignant, and from time to time, electrifying. It depicts the life of the Taos barrio colorfully and - in my mind - authentically.Milagro Creek is the story of Ignancia Vigil Romero, a Jicarilla (basket weaver) Apache and a curandera (medicine woman, or some might say, witch) and the two sons she raises to adulthood: Mister and Tomas. It is filled with secondary characters who jump off the pages - Raquel O'Brien, the gringo short-story writer, Chief, a bipolar man who establishes a local sweat house, the very fallible priest Manny Petit and a host of others.The immersion into Taos life is described at one point by Petit's Right Reverend: ""At first, it will jump right out at you - sun gods, saints dressed up like dolls, peyote buttons, nudity. Then you get used to it. You want to be politically correct and all that. Okay, then. After a while, you start to see it how they see it. When that happens, it's time to leave.""As readers, we enter this mystical world. We are present for susto--the live burial of the child Mister until ""the bud of (his) soul began to swell...pushing outward with mysterious force."" We hear the tales that are the framework for the Jicarilla Apache life. We see the rivalry of the blood brothers becoming more and more potent. And we get into the rhythm of the natural world and all its mysteries and glories.The denouement is played out in all sorts of ways - through police reports, witness statements, case worker interviews, short-story snippets written by Raquel (Rocky), and a pilgrimage to Chimayo - an actual event that takes place in New Mexico. This is not a linear book; it bounces back and forth in time, switches narrators (a big part is narrated by Ignacia, who is already dead of ALS at the books onset), and saunters back to ancient tales as it bobs and weaves it way to the conclusion. The mystical Taos landscape is every bit as much of a ""character"" as the humans; as Ignacia says to Mister, ""Rock, sky woman...this is your mother.""Melanie Sumner has created an authentic and heartbreaking book that will stay with me.

Many writers have tried, and have lost their footing, stumbling on the thin obstacles of sentimentality and bathos. The result is a feeling of manipulation on the part of the reader. I'm pleased to state that Ayelet Waldman navigates this topic with confidence and sensitivity, elevating this book of families unraveling with considerable aplomb.Instead of focusing on the tragedy itself, which many lesser writers might do, she asks important questions about how we survive when our world collapses: where do we find refuge or sanctuary? In music and the arts? Children? Hard work? Each other? How do we experience meaning again...and what do we do to seek redemption?Red Hook Road takes place in Maine, on the eve of a wedding between two mismatched families: the New York Copakens who have adopted Maine as their own and the Tetherlys, a local family of far lesser stature. In the first several pages, the dynamics are set up: each of these families will equally suffer an unbearable loss. The book is divided into four sections, representing four separate Fourth of July weekends; the first, second, and third anniversary of the tragedy. We learn more about each of the characters -- the mothers and fathers, the sister and brother, the world-renown violinist grandfather, and the Cambodian adoptee, Samantha, who just happens to be a musical genius. Each of these characters is so authentic that he or she could walk off these pages. Each, in his or her own way, is a survivor. One character, Ruthie, muses: ""Maybe, now more than ever some kind of statement was required, a refusal to submit to loss, to let it work its mischief on them. And maybe it was that kind of stubbornness in the face of grief...that could, in the end, redeem them all.""There is much to learn in this book about the human condition: love, marriage, loss, and survival.

Edinina keeps a stiff upper lip despite poverty, miscarriages, and the brutality of farm life. Mary goes through the motions of a day-to-day existence with three young sons and an abusive husband and succumbs to an elusive local preacher.The two key characters trade narration with each chapter, beginning in 1913 and closing in the winter of 1950, often correcting or adding to each other’s interpretation of events. Their lives are circumscribed: “…it was hard to be certain of anything outside our own hundred and eighty acres of land.” And indeed, Michelle Hoover appears to know the cadence and rhythm and dreariness and isolation and joy of farm life very well. The descriptions of the farm ring of stark authenticity.As the reader will immediately suspect, intertwined and guarded lives with little in common like Edidina’s and Mary’s are headed nowhere good. There will be accidents and betrayals and madness and despair and jealousies. The Great Depression will introduce another element of uncertainty into already fragile lives: Agriculture Secretary Wallace’s demand to destroy livestock in exchange for reimbursement (which could have been explained better) will pit family against family.There were many times that I wished this debut book had been written in third person instead of first person; observations and perceptions and self-analysis would have flowed more organically. The writing is taut – at times, too taut – and there are hints of themes that play out beautifully in C.E. Morgan’s All The Living.

At the start of this quirky and original book, he has impulsively purchased a second ranch house – right across the street from his original house – at an auction. His wife Beth, a teacher at a local college, his just left him for his good friend Terry Canavan. Terry’s long-time girlfriend, Rena, may or may not be coming on to him.To really complicate things, he is left in charge of his autistic savant son Hendrick, who has a penchant for memorizing the Weather Channel and mimicking advertising and sloganeering verbatim. And that’s just the start of things.We never know exactly why Beth left Jack except for she’s just fed up. “You can’t just let everything happen to you,” Beth tells him at one point. “You can’t always just wait.” But Jack is out of control; his plans and ideas exceed his abilities to execute them. “Sometimes he thinks of his life like everything that’s happened to him has been something he’s at least half-fallen into.” That includes his mulch-and-garden business at Patriot Mulch & Tree, which is authentically described but if truth be known, is a little too heavy on the details (at least for this reader).The novel takes place in an abbreviated time period and meanders along as Jack falls into one situation after another. For instance, he impulsively buys a huge fiberglass catfish from a defunct miniature golf course as decoration for a concrete tricycle path at the back of his new home. The point is made: Jack is unconventional and whimsical and Beth is solid and controlling. Still “he knows he needs Beth to save him from his crazier angels, or try to, and he knows, too, or hopes, that she needs him to try to save her from his plainer ones.”The depiction of Hendrick, the autistic savant, is delightful, especially when he emerges from his shell to spout off Spanish or participate with Rena in a karaoke night; it’s hard not to fall in love with this child. The father-son interactions sparkle. There is much wild black humor, despite the over-the-top, sometimes marginally successful characterizations. And there are fresh insights into what keeps couples together when by all natural instincts, they should fall apart.

Elizabeth Hay would answer a resounding “yes.”All of her characters – a diverse group of wounded lost souls who work together in a small Yellowknife radio station in the mid-1970s – are aching. Harry – the curmudgeonly acting manager with the cauliflower ear – has returned from a gig in television with its tail between his legs. Dido ran from the only man she ever loved – her own father-in-law -- and quickly connects with the station “bad boy”, Eddy. Eleanor fled from the memories of a husband who could not consummate their reunion. And Gwen, the youngest, who arrives at Yellowknife “subtle in her camouflage” with a buff-grey shirt with a pale brown collar and no adornment, looking to make a fresh start in an area in which fresh starts are legendary.Within the course of this subtle and timeless novel, we get to meet these characters and more, as they reveal themselves like slowly blooming flowers. Events encroach on the town: a television station threatens to supplant the intimacy of the radio, a gas pipeline (based on the Mackenzie Valley pipeline project) is poised to disrupt the rhythm of the community and particularly its native people. The natural and charged quality of the narrative is slightly disrupted by these events and there’s a bare hint of the authorial voice.But this author weaves her magic when she focuses on her characters, all of whom are connected to each other in intense and ultimately transformative ways. As summer turns to harsh winter, one of them muses, “Winter here does terrible things to people. You’ll find out.” And indeed, it does; people disappear or drift away or sometimes, forget to listen too closely. And what holds them together is the power of stories: Gwen’s creation of soundscapes and songs of longing during her late-night sound spot; others who present back stories that are so poignant and real you feel as if they’re coming from someone you know. One of the strongest – and there are many – parts of this amazing book is when four of the characters embark on a journey into the rarely-travelled Arctic wilderness, where real-life Englishman John Hornby and a party of two starved to death in the Barrens in 1927. Each has his or her own compelling reason to go: “Ralph wanted to prove himself – prove that at sixty-one he was still youthful. And Eleanor had indicated that she and the Barrens might be a good spiritual fit. And Gwen had the young person’s all-consuming desire to see a place for the first time especially since it would complete a story that had captured her imagination as a child…” And Harry? “He was looking forward to a clean break from his old dissatisfactions, a summer that would help him forget his winter.”The descriptions are exquisite: “They passed over the line into a world without walls, a land of rolling plains as exposed as the open sea. Their backs were sudden trees. Their hats were leaves the mosquitoes rested upon. Birds flew past their shoulders, like familiars. And at night, their quiet talk around the little bannock fire was similar to the voices of the trees that spooked the early Eskimos…”Some characters will find redemption, others will face more questions. Some will make it, some will not. When Harry muses about the caribou, “He’d never known before that migration wasn’t one outbroken forward movement; it was sideways, backwards, forwards, a passage enlivened with indecision in the face of real and imagined danger”, he might have been speaking of himself and the others. The morning after I completed this book, I woke up yearning to reinhabit the world of these characters.

I was hooked from the opening chapter of this very assured first book, which abounds with highly authentic characters and morally ambiguous situations, tempered with psychological suspense. By the last page, I was a definite fan.My advice to readers: ignore the publisher’s lurid tagline “a page-turning story of suburbia and its secrets.” This is a far more nuanced book that asks important questions: how far would you go to do the right thing? What is the right thing, anyway? And how do drugs permeate our society? There are no “pat” answers; Klein explores the moral dilemmas without sermonizing. That in itself is a relief.The central character, Gwen Raine, is an attractive suburban mother who engages in recreational pot smoking. Through an unfortunate chain of events, she is involved in a car accident with an elderly driver who suffers from Altzheimer’s; he is clearly at fault. Because of drug problems in the community, the cops intend to turn her into a scapegoat. They pressure her to give up her “source” – who just happens to be her old boyfriend, Jude.At the same time, her husband Brian, the marketing director at a pharmaceutical company, is engaged in his own ethical dilemma: his anxiety-fighting drug, Zuprone, is being prescribed as an off-label treatment for weight loss. Unfortunately, several users are experiencing an undesirable side effect that the company wishes to quench.The details that Klein uses are remarkably accurate. He obviously has carefully researched the drug chain – fascinating reading in itself. As a marketing person, I recognized the ways that pharmaceuticals are promoted to target physicians. And I particularly appreciated that Klein did not turn this into a simplistic “right or wrong” issue; he explores the ethical ambiguities that lie at the heart of each issue. This is a well-plotted book with crisp dialogue, well-rendered characters, and thought-provoking themes.

In a nameless country, at a nameless time, a president is overthrown by a military coup, and three men who are considered near to him are abruptly taken hostage and removed to his summer place...along with the portrait artist's very pregnant wife.Chapter by chapter, we get into the head of each of these characters and begin to gain an understanding of their own ruthlessness and ambition. The master chef, for example, muses over the captive abalone -- the last ingredient in his paella -- musing, ""If they sensed me coming they contracted like a heart muscle and were wasted."" The portraitist considers, ""I was ruthless about detail, and documented each new wrinkle or discoloration or sausage spot..."" And the barber recalls, ""This was the moment I waited for each day: with a brisk twist of my hands, I could have snapped his neck, slit his throat with a knife flick, but I did neither...""The men seamlessly take their place in the new regime; the portraitist says, ""Every person I see looks vaguely familiar"" and is answered by, ""In a strange place, ,your brain does things like that. Seeks out familiarity. A survival tactic."" Here comes another one, just like the other one -- the new Commander, indeed, takes over where the old President left off, including using the very people that were past intimates.Somewhere a little over half way through, three new characters are introduced: the chef's daughter, the portraitist's dissatisfied wife, and the barber's dead brother's fiancee. The reader knows something of them from the first part, but the story becomes increasingly fleshed out when viewed from their perspectives.All the cut-throat violence is conducted off stage; the reader only has a sense of what is happening in the collapsing country. But the characters are vivid and powerful, the writing is luscious, and the hint of connection or even collusion is tense and threatening.

Time and again in this short and assured book, Ms. Chung focuses in on loss and renewal; what each of us do to survive, even when we don't know all the answers and sometimes when we don't know the questions.The story starts in 1953 on a remote island in South Korea, where a young boy and his older brother and sister-in-law make their way to the mainland and a future. Now, decades later, the young boy, Han Jae-kyu, is a respected doctor with an efficient wife, two fine sons, and Min-yung, his pregnant daughter who is dealing with severe emotional/mental problems. His older brother, Han Hyu-kyu -- who has immigrated to America, decides to flee his cold and undemonstrative wife Lee Woo-in and make his way to his brother's door; nearly simultaneously, his older daughter Jane (a war photographer who has been injured in Baghdad) arrives as well.As the Koreans and Korean-American families get to know each other (and strive to know themselves), the older brother ruminates, ""How did they get here? A series of decisions: flight from one's home and family; immersion in a foreign world; disconnection from a set of rules or social expectations; an allowance, judgment compromised, the conception of a child; a rushed marriage...flung into a roulette of forces.""For this reader, the story soared when the juxtaposition of the two worlds (Korean and Korean American), rife with their individual choices, converged. I learned a lot about Korea and its customs and mores. A bit less successful was the focus on the American offspring; Jane (the only character who speaks in first person) and her brother Henry who is a recovering substance abuser. Some of their story is told instead of FELT; I wanted a more visceral connection with these characters and instead, I felt my mind was engaged more than my heart. (Caveat: this is my subjective reading experience and others may find a stronger connection).Ms. Chung wants to leave us with this impression: ""Some people are not long for this world. The rest of us survive. For whatever reason, we are still standing, the lasting ones. Why us and not them? No one knows and no one speaks of it."" The reader will discover who the survivors are along the journey and may be able to puzzle out the ""whys.""

Some will escape unscathed and others will never emerge. But all will be altered.At the start of the novel, John Clare has been incarcerated in a progressive (for the times) institution called the High Beach Private Asylum. It doesn't take long for the reader to come to the understanding that this seemingly sane poet is not unjustly imprisoned, but is in fact, stark raving mad. Shortly thereafter, John Clare is joined by Septimus Tennyson, the mad brother of the famous Alfred Lord Tennyson, who also takes up residence.The owner of the asylum -- Matthew Allen -- displays fairness to the inhabitants, yet he has demons of his own. He has escaped a dodgy past as a debtor and has lost the respect of his parsimonious older brother. One of his older daughters, Hannah, is just coming of age and has developed an unrequited crush on Tennyson. Other characters, such as the brutal right-hand man Stockdale and the delusional and fervent Margaret-turned-Mary, drift in and out of the narrative.Quickening Maze slips slightly when it delves into a subplot about a doomed mass-produce decorative woodcarvings invention, in my opinion. It helps to know that in reality, this happened, and Tennyson lost most of his inherited fortune as a result. After reading Quickening Maze, it is nearly impossible to not go running to check out what parts of this book are based on truths. Yet it does not slip enough for me to deprive the novel of its fifth rating star.Without spoilers, John Clare will try on various personage from the past, including Lord Byron and Shakespeare himself. Hannah will need to lose her path to find a new one. Matthew Allen will slip on his path and go down one that is far less traveled. And the famous Tennyson? He, too, will forge forward on the path that is his destiny.

One need only think of Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, Wide Saragasso Sea, The Awakening, and other well-ed books to realize that most such women are killed, commit suicide, or eventually go crazy.But what if one mysterious, brooding woman who is forced into involuntary institutionalization is saner and shows more humanity than the relatives that placed her there?That is the premise of The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox. As a young girl, she is forced to endure the death of her baby brother, who dies of typhoid in India, while her family is away. She receives no solace or support; in all likelihood, she experiences post traumatic stress syndrome afterward and begins to gently ""act out."" Not long after, the family resettles in Scotland and Esme is expected to ""do the right thing"" and get married. But things go terribly wrong, and her great niece, Iris, gets a call out of the blue one day -- an aunt whom she never even knew existed must be retrieved instantly.The rest of the book reads somewhat like a literary mystery. Why was Esme locked away at the tender age of 16? What were the events that brought her to this incarceration? What memories is she holding back...and what can she teach Iris, who is going through her own relationship problems.The answers to these questions will break your heart, particularly since situations like these happen over and over again. Esme reflects, ""This is the tricky part. Think yourself stretched and thin, beaten to transparency. Concentrate. Really concentrate. You need to attain a state of being, the bit of you that makes you what you are, that makes you stand out, three-dimensional in a room..."" The only way a woman can retain her sense of self,in the world that O'Farrell creates, is to essentially vanish and become Mrs. Somebody.Ms. O'Farrell takes narrative chances, using a few narrators (including Esme's sister, Kitty, who is in the throes of Altzheimer's); one needs to pay particular attention because the point of view and point in time will change quickly. It's a little bit of a challenge, but a rewarding one. The weaker part of the story focuses on the grand-niece, Iris; her own repressed and unsatisfying relationships needed fleshing out and, in one case, seemed a tad cliched. But the heart of the story is an indictment against the way society -- and psychiatry -- had been used to control women who did not conform to the norms.

That is a question that the fictional bestselling writer Octavia Frost asks herself – again and again – in this spellbinding book about the lengths we go to rewrite the chapters that comprise our lives.Octavia has literally rewritten the last chapters of all of her published books. On the way to her publisher, she reads a news crawl that her son Milo – the famous singer of a band called Pareidola (the human tendency to find meaning where there is none) – is charged with murdering his live-in girlfriend.The problem is, Octavia is estranged from her son. Both are survivors of a family tragedy that ended the lives of Octavia’s husband and her daughter when Milo was only nine years old. Since that time, Octavia consistently comes back to themes that echo the tragedy in her books, including one poignant fictional passage, “They were exactly the wrong two to die.”But what if she could rewrite these chapters…and indeed, her very life? In the most inventive and imaginative part of this book, Octavia intersperses the last chapters of the books she has written, before and after the rewrites. The sad and poignant endings become transformed into messages of hope with just a few strokes of a pen. These stories are good and leave the reader wondering if Carol Parkhurst will ever take any of these to fruition.In fact, the stories are superior to the framework of the novel, which focuses on Octavia’s quest to reconnect with her rock-star son and get to the bottom of the events of the dark night when Milo’s girlfriend is killed. The mystery story is somewhat pedestrian; I guessed the true murderer early on.After completing this imaginative novel, it’s hard to look at “endings” in the same way. Octavia states, “I’ve thought it might be interesting to change the endings. Find out how things might have worked out differently for the characters.” That’s a notion that will stick in your head after the last page is completed....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 17, 2010","May 19, 2010","May 17, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7099280-the-nobodies-album

In Lonely Polygamist, Brady Udall does the seemingly impossible: he actually garners sympathy for Golden Richards – husband to four wives, father to 28 children, in the midst of a whopper of a mid-life crisis. In this surprisingly fully-fleshed novel, Golden is a man who is beset by life’s misfortunes in spades “He was sorry for his complacency, his chronic boneheadedness, his propensity for worry and gloom.” His family has grown to unsustainable proportions, his sister-wives are beset with insurrection, and one of his sons, Rusty – the other key protagonist – is lonely and acting out in sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking ways.Brady Udall writes, “In this family, you were never free, you couldn’t do anything on your own, because there was always somebody who had a dentist’s appointment or volleyball practice or Deeanne would have one of her epileptic fits and there went everybody’s Labor Day picnic down the tubes. It was like they were all connected by the same invisible string…and when one person wanted to do a certain thing or go a certain way, they yanked on all the others, and then another person tried to go in another direction, and so on, and pretty soon they were all tangled up, tied to each other, tripping and flailing, thrashing around like a bunch of monkeys caught in the net.”In trying to get himself out of the ensnarement of that net, Golden is beset by difficulties. He covets his boss’s wife, his own wives are giving up on him, his family is falling apart, his finances are drying up, and he has a huge wad of gum in a very sensitive body area. On top of all that, “ he wanders around the houses like a vagrant or ghost, easily forgotten and leaving no trace…” Udall’s characters engage to the fullest because they are real, not just used as a contrivance. In the end, this polygamist family could be any of us (multiplied by four); grappling with the nature of love and belonging, trying hard to survive, losing our way and finding it again.

Frederick Reiken's provocative new novel meticulously and masterfully reveals the submerged connections among 12 seemingly disparate characters, devoting one chapter to each one.The book begins with Beverly Rabinowitz, a doctor with two daughters, who escaped from perilous Europe during World War II. Her father was one of the five hundred Jewish intellectuals who believed they were hand-chosen to be saved; instead, they were all mercilessly murdered. Half a century later, she begins to feel her father somehow escaped and is nearby.Gradually, other characters are introduced: a young man who is in a coma and at the mercy of his nefarious family; an elusive female fugitive from the 1960s; an American veteran who finds love on an Israeli kibbutz; an elderly and attractive Holocaust survivor; Beverly's great friend who is now an analyst; an Israeli sometime-soldier. All -- and then some -- will be part of an emerging picture. Reiken writes, ""It is not my intention to speak in riddles, but I will suggest that it is very natural to see all of these things as a big puzzle you must assemble. I will suggest, as well, that certain pieces will not fit, not now or ever, and that you must learn to live with these ambiguities. You must also learn to trust these ambiguities. This is perhaps the most important thing I know.""This is NOT a book for someone who wants a linear story or all the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place. Like all good works of literature, this one focuses on compelling themes: how we are all connected to a dazzling and elusive whole, how our shadow lives bring us to important truths, how those truths can take us far from ourselves and help us discover how to love, survive, and prevail. And perhaps how, most of all, nothing is as random as it seems.There is, I believe, a slight nod to D.M. Thomas's The White Hotel here, but Reiken's voice is strikingly original and the reader is always aware that he or she is in the hands of a confident writer.

Slidesplitting, chortle out loud, belly-aching funny. And the reason is because Jonathan Tropper has so genuinely captured the dynamics of a dysfunctional family that still maintains its love for each other...even if they can't stand to be together.The book opens with the death of the Foxman patriarch; the four adult children are summoned to sit shiva (the Jewish seven-day ritual of mourning) for him. For Judd -- the narrator -- this presents one big problem: his wife Jen's affair with his famous radio shock-jock boss has recently become public. He shoved a cheesecake birthday cake -- lit candles and all -- at his boss's sensitive anatomical areas and he is still seething from the aftermath.As if that weren't enough, his siblings include a wisecracking older sister whose husband is tied-and-tethered to his Blackberry, an older brother whose wife suffers from infertility issues, and another charming younger neer-do-well brother who happens to be getting it on with his attractive-but-older therapist and who comes up with one outrageous lie after the other about what he's doing now. It's a recipe for disaster.This is a totally irreverent book -- not for those who feel the least uptight about religion or sex, or hold traditional views of family. There are absolutely hilarious scenes: one of the siblings and his wife making love as their activities are inadvertently broadcast to the shocked older shiva attendees below. The ""inappropriately self-absorbed shiva caller"" award. Potty training gone awry. It's all interspersed with truly poignant moments of a family who clumsily works out those issues that every family seems to have.If there's a flaw, it's Jonathan Tropper's own buy-in to the typical male fantasy: every woman Judd sees is totally over-the-top gorgeous and doesn't care that he is only semi-attractive and unemployed and messed-up. Yeah, right, in an alternative universe! And sometimes, Judd's one-track mind can become a little adolescent and cloying. But it's been a long time since I've laughed this hard when reading a book.

It's an intelligent and literary thriller, a thought-provoking peek into America's dark soul, and a veritable page turner. It's also the debut book for David Goodwillie, an author who is up to the task of unearthing the country's seductive roots.The dual protagonists/narrators are Aidan Cole, a member of the chattering class, who blogs for Roorback, (""a roorback is a defamatory falsehood published for political effect"") and Paige Roderick, an attractive idealist who is involved in an act of domestic terrorism at the midtown Manhattan location of Barney's. One late night, at a glitterati party following this act, Aidan checks his email to view an image of a woman crossing Madison Avenue (the site of the bombing) with the words, ""This is Paige Roderick. She's the one responsible.""But Goodwillie is too good to settle for a ""who-done-it"" thriller. He delves deeply into his characters to reveal two alienated and unmoored thirty-somethings who are dealing with a profound disillusionment based on divorce, death, a country that lost its way, and friendships that easily turn into betrayals.Paige turns to domestic radicalism after the wasteful death of her brother Bobby in Iraq. She says,""Do you really want to know my worldview? Because it's pretty bleak these days. Everything I once saw as a problem with others -- the numbness, the detachment, the disillusionment that came with being American -- everything I once sought to fix...I'm coming now to feel myself."" And Aidan? His transformation is less organic. He reflects, ""A decade had passed in the back of countless cabs, at fancy dinners and midnight pizzerias; the drug dipping and surprisingly functional alcoholism that consumed our days and destroyed our mornings; nothing stimulating nothing surprising, our thirties spread out before us like our twenties, but with lessons unlearned.""There is a sadness in these characters, a lack of connection that makes them ripe for subversion. Aidan's emptiness and ennui primes him for a connection with Paige, who is intense and filled with purpose -- everything he is not, although interestingly, they are more intriguing characters alone and not together. Neither fall into stock stereotypes; rather, they are two-dimensional with distinct voices and a great deal of vulnerability. Only in the last 50 or so pages does the authorial voice intercede, momentarily reminding the reader that Goodwillie is creating these characters and pulling the strings.I read this book right after NYC dodged a bullet with a Times Square car bombing, and gasped at how unwittingly prophetic this book really is. It's a spot-on view of not only domestic terrorism, but a jaded Manhattan at the bulls-eye of today's digital age.

And will she respect herself in the morning? :) You won't be able to put this book down.

His latest opus, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, is a veritable masterpiece, and confirms his place as one of the most versatile and dazzling and inventive novelists of our era.The novel is set right at the turn of the 18th century in Japan, where the Dutch East India company has requisitioned the man-made trading island of Dejima. The eponymous red-haired Jacob de Zoet is an unimpeachable clerk who hopes to earn a reputation here, thus earning the right to marry his fiancée back in the Netherlands. In some of the most descriptive writing I’ve ever encountered, Mitchell describes an insular Japan in self-imposed exile, where Christianity is banned, thieves, liars, and culprits run rampant, and culture and law are yoked to a far more primitive standard.Jacob De Zoet ends up meeting a learned midwife, Orito Aibagawa, whose face has been marked by the splattering of hot oil, and fancies himself falling for her. It is only in section II that her story is revealed; upon her bankrupt’s father’s death, she is spirited away to a secluded convent where ghastly and unholy crimes occur and women are reduced to sexual slavery. One can almost visualize this section – which reads somewhat like a literary adventure story – on the big screen.The third and final section – a fictionalized reimaging of the fall of the Dutch VOC -- focuses on the arrival of a British warship captained by the gout-inflicted John Penhaligon. Determined to usurp the Dutch and set up a trading post in Dejima, the British attempt to make an uneasy truce with the Dutch and the Japanese. This is in my opinion the least satisfying of the sections (except for those who love history, who will revel in it), but even so, Mitchell’s prose remains beautiful and compelling.The Japanese gave florid names to their kingdom, calling it A Land of A Thousand Autumns; hence, the title. This book took my breath away. It’s a true original, a mélange of historical fiction, adventurous quest, love story, and fable (with a nod to another master, Haruki Murakami, in a few instances.) I have racked my brain to come up with another author today who can take such bold imaginative leaps and serve as a reliable interpreter of emotions and facts, and come up blank.

Over and over again, she returns to themes of exile, homesickness, and alienation. In the title story, the young narrator gains a prized American visa and goes to her uncle’s home in Maine. “They spoke Igbo and ate garri for lunch and it was like home until your uncle came into the cramped basement where you slept and pulled you forcefully to him…” recalls the barely-adult girl. Again, in Arrangers of Marriages, a young bride discovers that all is different in America when her new husband tells her, “You don’t understand how it works in this country. If you want to get anywhere you have to be as mainstream as possible. If not, you will be left by the roadside.” And in Imitation: “She does miss home, though, her friends, the cadence of Igbo and Yoruba and pidgin English spoken around her…”Home is a complex place. The protagonists, mostly young, mostly female, are often a long way from home, both figuratively and literally. Many have fled or want to flee because of violence – a young woman whose four-year-old son was killed before her eyes, for instance, in The American Embassy. But America, in most instances, is not a panacea. A dream of a college education is traded in for the reality of a waitress job. A man whom is chosen by one woman’s family -- “A doctor in America! What could be better?” – is, in reality, a pretentious idiot who insists she speak proper English, change her name, and eat in fast food courts. And so most of Adichie’s characers precariously straddle two worlds. Yet what shines forth is the resilience of the women who take destiny in their own hands and remain unbowed. We meet women who flee from uncomfortable situations with their dignity intact. In Monkey Hill, for example, the protagonist – a writer – is challenged that her character would not give up a lucrative job because she was a “woman with no other choices.” She reflects, “The only thing I didn’t add in the story is that after I left my coworker and walked out of the alhaji’s house, I got into the Jeep and insisted that the driver take me home because I knew it was the last time I would be riding in it.”One of the most affecting stories in this collection, to my mind, is the first story, Cell One, a harrowing tale of the narrator’s brother, who is arrested n a roundup of gang suspects and sent to jail. That story ends, “It would have been so easy for him, my charming brother, to make a sleek drama of his story, but he did not.” The same might be said about Ms. Adichie, who forgoes the drama for solid story-telling....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Aug 18, 2010","Aug 22, 2010","Mar 31, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5587960-the-thing-around-your-neck

Gabrielle Zevin introduces us to the Pomeroys, and they rock the Richter scale when it comes to being absolutely, totally screwed up.First, there’s good old dad, Roger – a fundamental Christian hypocrite who breaks half the Commandments after “praying on it.” Then there’s mom, Georgia, a disengaged narcissist who sacrifices her own adult children to deal with her crippling debt. And then there’s Vinnie, Helen, and Patsy. The focus is largely on Patsy, who struggles to get by, entering a loveless marriage and the military, striving to come to terms with her upbringing.There’s not much to admire about these individuals and that’s precisely the point. They could be you or me or any number of people we’ve come across in our lives. They’re people who bury their family secrets, get into massive debt, pass themselves off as “good Christians” when they’re anything BUT, and seek redemption without really confronting the price to get there.Ms. Zevin writes, “You spend your whole life trying to get out of holes. The hole you’re born into because of who your parents are. The hole you dig yourself trying to get out of the first hole…” She is totally unflinching in her examination of how impossible it is to understand how a person gets from point a to point b.The most relevant topics of the day form a backdrop for this novel: our distorted and self-serving view of religion and how we use religion to justify hatred, our worshipping of credit as a flawed solution, the fallout of serving in Iraq.

The good news is, for the most part, he succeeds admirably.Within these pages, we meet a fascinating cast of characters: a hedge fund manager who plots and schemes to become filthy rich from the crash of a well-known bank. His skunk-addicted son who is obsessed with a new reality show called It’s Madness, which pits schizophrenics, bipolars, and other mentally challenged contestants against each other to win a free year of treatment. A Pakistani businessman who introduces lime pickles to London and has been nominated for an OBE from the Palace and his teenage son, a would-be terrorist who dreams of converting the world to pure Islam. And a disgruntled literary critic – R. Tranter – who envies and savages a rising literary star in a most unpleasant way.At first glance, this disparate cast has little in common; however, each of them, in his or her own way, is escaping from something that one character calls “true life.” We’ve come a long way, Mr. Faulks seems to suggest, from a sense of value and purpose. Our modern life has become dumbed-down and turned us into anesthetized robots, tethered to our cell phones and laptops. One character shuts out the world with a genetically-mutated drug (“skunk”); another with an alternate-reality game called Parallax; yet another with extremist religious beliefs; still another with a retreat into the 19th century of literature where things were simpler. And perhaps the boldest reality-alterer of all, the financier John Veals, builds his fortune on the illusion of market stability.The satire is often delicious, like reading a Tom Wolfe novel (think: Bonfire of the Vanities). Some of it is laugh-out-loud hilarious, such as a scene in which the would-be suicide bomber explains to his handler that he may be tardy to his mission because he is being forced to accompany his father to Buckingham Palace to receive his OBE. Or this scene: the Pakistani Farroq al-Rashid hires R. Tranter to give him a crash course in literature so he can “chat up” the Queen, only to have his entire list summarily dismissed (“OT – Oirish Twaddle”, “poor man’s Somerset Maugham, or “the man who put the ‘anal’ into ‘banality’). Or this gem about the latest book prize: “The Pizza Palace Book of the Year prize, somewhat controversially, was awarded to either a children’s story, a travel book, or a biography. Excluding all fiction was a bold thing to do, but it was felt that novelists already had enough prizes of their own…”It is likely that the reader will relate to some characters over others; for this reader, it was sometimes hard to follow the marginally-legal high-stakes financial deals, done behind the backs of the regulators. Sebastian Faulks particularly skewers those who are “not just wealthy, but insanely, ineffably, immeasurably rich.” Still, A Week In December deserves big kudos for tackling greed and the dehumanizing effects of the electronic age and doing it so darn well....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Mar 26, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6961543-a-week-in-december

There were parts of this book that I found absolutely brilliant but as it neared its end, I was more than ready to move on to the next book. I need to reflect a little and figure out why.Part of it, I suspect, is the unevenness of the narrators (there are four). The postwar Jamaican immigrants -- Hortense and Gilbert -- were beautifully conceived. Andrea Levy has much to say about emigrants settling in post World War II Britain -- the overblown expectations, the massive prejudice, the culture shock. Queenie, their British landlady, is decently sketched as well, with her unabashed attitude as she takes in Jamaican (i.e., coloured) renters, shocking her London neighbors.The book tends to lose focus as it weaves toward the fourth narrator, Bernard -- Queenie's boring and sexless husband. There are many reasons: Bernard is stationed in India, which forcibly removes the reader from the rest of the story, which takes place in England. We are suddenly thrust into India's movement toward self-rule. And, when Bernard DOES come back home, the story arc becomes predictable and at the same time, melodramatic. I was somewhat certain I was going to 5-star this book until I got to the last third. At that point, it seemed to run out of steam. I liked this book, but I wanted to love it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 22, 2011","May 26, 2011","Mar 24, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44001.Small_Island

It seizes you by the throat in the first chapter and it never lets go. I found it to be an amazing portrait of two emotionally detached characters, one who “rejects the world” and the other who “is rejected by it.”The novel gets its title from mathematics; Paolo Giordano is a professional physicist. He writes, “Prime numbers are divisible only by 1 and by themselves. They hold their place in the infinite series of natural numbers, squashed, like all numbers, between two others, but one step further than the rest. They are suspicious, solitary numbers…”Alice Della Rocca is forced by her callous father to take ski lessons when she is quite young; a ski accident leaves her with disfiguring scars, a noticeable limp, and an eventual fall into anorexia. Her counterpart, Mattia Balossino, briefly abandoned his mentally disabled twin sister to attend a party unencumbered by her “weirdness”; she disappears, leaving him with a great deal of trauma and a need to harm himself with blade and flame.These two damaged individuals are unable to surmount the emotional wall they have raised up, but they do recognize a kindred spirit in the other. As they grow older, they attract warm-hearted and “normal” people to their orbit, but they can never truly reciprocate the emotions they evoke.There are images that Giordano creates that quite literally cause the reader to gasp because of their power. Alice’s attempt to flush a calorific meat-stuffed tomato down the toilet during a romantic first date or the cruelty exhibited to her by the “popular” girls… Mattia’s attempt to fit in with his mathematical peers…all of this is eloquently written and beautifully detailed.I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that this book is a translation from the Italian by the amazing Shaun Whiteside – one of the most fluent and flawless translations I’ve ever read. I’ve learned that a translator can make or break a book and I applaud him.

Lawrence Hill’s originally titled Book of Negroes (changed to Someone Knows My Name when the PC police got a hold of it) focuses on the largest single document about black people in North America. It contains the names and details of 3,000 black men, women, and children who, after serving or living behind British lines during the Revolutionary War, sailed from New York City to various British colonies.The heroine of the book, Aminata Diallo, is only 11 years old when she is kidnapped and enslaved, barely surviving the Atlantic crossing. We follow her as she is sold to a South Carolina plantation, then again to a more enlightened Jewish indigo inspector in Charles Town, and then to New York, Nova Scotia, and eventually back to Africa. Through part of her harrowing journey, she assumes the role of djeli, a storyteller entrusted with the ancestral tales of her people, bearing witness to what has occurred.This is an important book, in many places a harrowing one, itself bearing witness to a lost part of our shameful shared history. It shines its harsh spotlight not only on Americans, but on the British, who promised to liberate former slaves in exchange for service during the Revolution. That did not happen; instead, they encountered everything from anti-black race riots to indentured servitude. Eventually, some sailed to Africa to form the colony of Freetown in Sierra Leone – the first back-to-Africa exodus.This little-known, historically true story is so heartstopping, so impressive in its research, that I wish I could give Someone Knows My Name five stars. Unfortunately, I can’t. Although the first half of the book is page-turning in its intensity, the second half relies more on expository prose. We hear rather than experience what is happening. In addition, the author relies on contrived coincidences that defy the imagination. The ending, for example – which I will not reveal – is absolutely implausible. And sometimes, I felt as if the author was using 20th century dialect and character actions that did not feel quite authentic to a battered-down girl who lived in the 18th century.Despite those issues, this book is an impressive addition to the literature on slavery that deserves reading for its scope, humanity, and message....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 10, 2011","Feb 25, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2088385.The_Book_of_Negroes

He is a stranger in a strange land at both places; he's spent so much time making a living he's forgotten to make a life.I loved this book with its rich two-dimensional characters who could have walked off the pages.
