Styled as a recreation of the 1993 yearbook, For Tomorrow is a set of stories inspired by this premise. In many cases, surviving Wellbrook students are the protagonists, though some take a less direct approach. The setup also leaves a lot of room for stories that take place in different time periods, with some contributors opting for a nostalgic 90s setting and some the present day.Three in particular stood out to me. ‘Amusements’ by Verity Holloway sees Libby setting herself up as a psychic in a fading British seaside town (a dependably great setting for horror); it seethes with sinister undercurrents and ambiguity. In ‘Habitual’ by Daniel Carpenter, a struggling Londoner is offered a job and flat in a luxurious, but weirdly empty, building. Featuring the best ending in the book, this story slots into the tradition of urban horror alongside Joel Lane and Gary Budden, and also reminded me a lot of Jonathan Sims’ Thirteen Storeys. Finally, there’s a pleasing 90s-urban-legend feel to ‘Hyperlink’ by Polis Loizou, which sees its internet-obsessed protagonist discovering some oddly addictive music online.I also liked ‘Shadow Burdens’ by Charlotte Bond; tonally different from the rest, this story follows a woman who can see the shadow-like physical manifestations of people’s emotional burdens, and faces a dilemma when she meets someone with a different shadow to the rest. I knew I was going to like ‘Comments On This Video Have Been Disabled’ by James Everington based on the title alone, and it’s a great take on the ‘found footage’ trope that reminded me of Ray Cluley’s ‘6/6’. Speaking of which, ‘As I Want You To Be’ by Ray Cluley is another strong story, with what is perhaps the book’s best link to the events at Wellbrook, and Lucie McKnight Hardy’s ‘Carrion’ delivers an unnerving modern folk tale in the author’s signature style.Part of me wishes there had been more ‘yearbook’ content to flesh out the nature of the Event and bring a more cohesive feel to the whole thing. But then again, the lack of specificity allows for a fun range of interpretations (working similarly to the Eden Book Society series from Dead Ink). I always find something interesting to read from Black Shuck Books, and they should definitely be on your radar if you’re interested in modern British horror writing....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Apr 02, 2024","Apr 04, 2024","Apr 02, 2024",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/210678665-for-tomorrow

The three main characters, all aspiring artists, are in a love triangle as students; many years later, one of them – Jay, now so destitute he’s living in his car – washes up at the luxurious home of the other two, married couple Alice and Rob. It’s also a pandemic novel, with all the key scenes set in the late spring/early summer of 2020. Characters’ panic about the virus manifests in a variety of ways (and is arguably the engine of the plot, too).Much of the first half consists of Jay reflecting on his short, messy relationship with Alice; these scenes are well-written, but inconsequential. While Kunzru sketches a neat portrait of the young Jay – his naivety and idealism, as well as the late-90s London art scene through which he moves – I wasn’t sure why I should care, or where this was all going. Meanwhile, whenever we return to 2020, the dialogue between Jay, Alice, Rob and another couple has a sheen of unreality. Maybe it was just the Covid references, but I felt like I was watching actors perform a scene, rather than eavesdropping on a real conversation.And I questioned whether this artificiality is deliberate; we are, after all, encouraged to wonder what is true about Jay. (A sculpture made of multiple, spiralling mirrors – which Jay visits several times, and is even moved to tears by – seems significant here. As does the belief, shared by almost everyone and thus communicated to the reader, that Jay’s presence is too wild a coincidence to have happened purely by chance.) I found Jay’s account of himself unconvincing. Are we supposed to think he’s lying? Partly because he’s still hung up on Alice after so long, it’s hard to believe Jay has had the rich life experience he claims; it’s as though he’s jumped from being a student straight into middle age. Which, of course, for the purposes of the story, he has. But should it feel quite so much like that’s the case? Is it meant to be so noticeable?As I read Blue Ruin, and especially throughout the climax and ending, I kept thinking of questions like this – about the characters, and about the book. I found myself inventing and discarding theories about what was really going on, and whether some of the vaguely frustrating narrative techniques were a tricksy manoeuvre on the part of the author and/or his narrator (as in something like Ottessa Moshfegh’s Death in Her Hands). Should we ask whether this whole story is part of Jay’s performance art, or is that stretching the metaphor too far, inventing an authorial intention that isn’t there? Is it better for fiction to be thought-provoking than a good story? Even if so, is it enough for it to be thought-provoking?The closing lines put such a neat cap on the story that they make it all seem weightless. As if Rob, Alice et al have disappeared in a puff of smoke. While it takes particular talent to write something that feels that way, I’m not sure I want to read books where the characters leave no impression. I’m left with mixed feelings about Blue Ruin. It’s more interesting to think about than to read. But then, sometimes I really enjoy that.I received an advance  copy of Blue Ruin from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,2,24,1,"Mar 23, 2024","Mar 26, 2024","Mar 24, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/197472278-blue-ruin

My notes are crowded with ecstatic but I’ve been putting off writing about The Borrowed Hills; I’m worried I don’t have the ability to do it justice. My notes are crowded with ecstatic but useless phrases like ‘the real deal’ and ‘holy shit, this is a BOOK’. And in some ways I’d like to leave it at that. For better or worse, however, I like to pick apart why I loved things. So, first: this is a novel about a man, Steve Elliman, and his inheritance – not so much a literal inheritance as a way of life (shaped by centuries of farming knowledge) and character (the particular stoicism of the rural working class). It’s about how he is inexorably drawn back to the Lakes, to a volatile friend/neighbour/rival, William Herne, and to William’s wife Helen.So many of us have a complicated love-hate attachment to the places we grew up in. What Preston does beautifully here is to capture that in a way that feels universal, but also makes it specific to the Lake District Steve knows. This is a place where farms stay in families for generations, tradition is still meaningful, and locals deride the ‘offcomers’. It’s wildly beautiful, yet bleak and hostile – a world away from the curated tourist image of the region. Every moment of The Borrowed Hills is steeped in the gristle and mulch of farming life. Some early scenes take place as the Elliman and Herne farms are afflicted by foot and mouth disease, and after reading them, that cover illustration of a sheep amid flames takes on a much more sinister significance.Some of the language is a tough nut to crack; Steve peppers his narrative with dialect words that don’t come clear except with time and context. This creates the sense that the story, like its characters, is guarded and defensive, unwilling to letting an outsider in. (For example, the chapter titles use yan-tan-tethera, a method of counting sheep which mixes dead language with Cumbrian dialect. This is never actually explained anywhere, so it didn’t even occur to me that these titles were numbers until I was some way into the book and I realised none of the words had appeared elsewhere, so couldn’t be, as I’d vaguely supposed, place names.)The Borrowed Hills is also a story about the violence of men alone. We’re always seeing ‘individualism’ spoken about as a modern ill; what Preston shows us, through Steve, is not so much robust independence but something more ancient; solitude as an ancient survival instinct. What can a sense of community even be, when you make your home in so remote a place? And what happens if something goes wrong within that tiny group? In a different story, Steve’s dangerous pull towards Helen might only destroy his fragile truce with William, but here it (along with the arrival of a violent new influence) becomes a threat to a whole way of life.I read parts of this book at the same time as I was reading another, less-good book. The contrast was illuminating: while the other book disappeared from my mind as soon as I closed it, I couldn’t stop thinking about The Borrowed Hills and felt fully immersed in its world. All this bleak horror contrasting with the beauty of the landscape. There’s a central sequence that is just so exciting and tense – you feel the exhaustion, the way it never seems to end, yet how critical it is to keep going, and I read it in the same way, reluctant to put the book down until it was over.The themes of The Borrowed Hills reminded me of knotty modern fiction about masculinity such as Ross Raisin’s Waterline and Rob Doyle’s Here Are the Young Men. But I also really think fans of Tana French need to get on this. While it’s not a crime novel (although in some ways it is?), I haven’t read anything else that approximates the same combination of a real sense of a place and a people with writing that is simultaneously lyrical, expressive and down to earth.I received an advance  copy of The Borrowed Hills from the publisher through NetGalley....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Mar 07, 2024","Mar 11, 2024","Mar 07, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/199615929-the-borrowed-hills

I chose this Valancourt collection mainly becAfter loving Lisa Tuttle’s novella My Death last year, I knew I would have to read more of her work. I chose this Valancourt collection mainly because it’s recent (and, okay, yes, because the cover is nice), although the stories within are drawn from throughout Tuttle’s career.What I started to notice by the halfway point is that Tuttle writes very female horror. I don’t know if that’s quite the right term; I wouldn’t say 'feminist’ fits – there’s nothing political about many of these stories, the women in them are often subservient – but women’s experiences are very much at the book’s heart. A number focus on motherhood, birth or some proxy for it, and this is frequently combined with a strong theme of body horror: a dead-but-still-growing baby in ‘Born Dead’, inexplicable bleeding in ‘A Birthday’, cancerous pregnancies in ‘My Pathology’. In ‘Replacements’, women begin keeping vampiric animals as pets, while the men in their lives are repulsed to the point of being driven to kill the creatures. Sometimes there’s also a disquieting merging of these themes with sex, most memorably in ‘Food Man’, where a girl storing a mountain of rotting food under her bed is only the start of the weirdness. As with a number of the above, I didn’t quite enjoy this story but I couldn’t stop thinking about its dark, gnarled depths.So many of these reminded me of Robert Aickman’s stories in that I squirmed my way through them, skimming the most disgusting bits, but am sure I will remember them for much longer than I do the type of stories I merely ‘like’. This is apt, as The Dead Hours of Night contains at least one explicitly Aickman-inspired work: ‘The Book That Finds You’, which I first read in the anthology Aickman’s Heirs. I loved revisiting it: an obscure horror writer, a literary treasure hunt, a cursed manuscript; perfect. ‘Objects in Dreams May Be Closer Than They Appear’ exists in a similar vein, simple but extremely effective in its depiction of a couple drawn to a peculiarly elusive house.My favourite in the book was the earliest story, the dread-filled folk horror ‘Where the Stones Grow’. It’s interesting reading s and seeing that others seem to have found this one formulaic – whatever this says about me, I adored it! I felt it had a fantastic atmosphere, with some of the dark magic of Elizabeth Hand’s ‘Near Zennor’. I also loved ‘The Dream Detective’, about a man who meets a boring girl at a party, then can’t stop seeing her in his dreams (great ending in this one). ‘Closet Dreams’, in which a kidnapped girl recalls her impossible escape, is a brilliantly executed concept and truly disturbing.I really liked the beginning of ‘Vegetable Love’, but felt frustrated by the disappearance of the best element (the woman Hannah meets at the church halfway through. Bottom of my list was  ‘Mr Elphinstone’s Hands’, a historical story about a young woman who starts producing ectoplasm; again, it’s pretty disgusting, but in this case the story is dull and much longer than it needs to be. Yet for some other ers it seems to have been the highlight of the collection – which just goes to show how personal short stories are. Although a couple here didn’t work for me, I find Tuttle’s short fiction powerful, and her best work unforgettable....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Feb 26, 2024","Feb 28, 2024","Feb 18, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56468615-the-dead-hours-of-night

While those are typically adaptations of other people’s stories, usually from reddit posts and Twitter threads, the eleven stories here are all original. (Aside from one, a riff on the 19th-century story best known as ‘The Green Ribbon’ and recently reinterpreted by Carmen Maria Machado in ‘The Husband Stitch’.)Highlights include the urban legend vibes of ‘Bus Stop’; the moody, Junji Ito-lite ‘Butter Corn Ramen’; and the punchy modern ghost story ‘Viola Bloom’. The longer comics work best, and I also found them more effective when framed as a personal experience of the narrator, which takes the edge off anything that seems inconclusive. Shorter pieces like ‘Forest Fruit’ and ‘Hangnail’ hinge on visual punchlines; I’d call these dark jokes more than ‘horror stories’. Others have great setups – ‘Better Kate Than Never’, ‘Murder Party’ – but don’t do anything truly unexpected with them.My main problem with Bad Dreams in the Night – and I realise this may sound nitpicky to some – is that little knowledge or appreciation of contemporary horror seems to have gone into it. Instead, it’s inspired more by a combination of old children’s books and the sort of ‘this really happened to me!’ stories people post online in the hope of creating a viral creepypasta. This is reflected in the author’s notes accompanying each story, some of which take away from the effect. Reading the explanation for ‘Green Ribbon’, you’d think Ellis was the first person to conceive of telling this story from the woman’s perspective. One note starts with the words ‘not too much to say about this one’ – in which case, surely it’s better not to have a note at all.So, I liked this perfectly well but it’s all quite insubstantial. I’d perhaps consider buying it as a gift for someone who doesn’t usually read horror – and to be fair, I think that’s probably who it’s aimed at anyway!

So I approached this book – The Poison Tree is one of my favourites among Erin Kelly’s novels, but to be honest, I never felt it needed a sequel. So I approached this book – which revisits Karen, Rex and their daughter Alice more than twenty years after the fateful summer of 1997 – with what I’d call cautious interest. However, as soon as I started reading, that was it: I was hooked. This is Kelly’s most arresting, compelling work in years.It’s also not exactly a sequel, not a straightforward ‘second in the series’. It works just as well as a standalone novel, and is more of a reimagining – a reboot, if you like. It sets us down in another blazingly hot London summer, among a set of characters that mirror (but don’t simply replicate) those in the earlier book. The narrative is split between Alice, now in her twenties and running a vintage clothing boutique, and an increasingly paranoid Karen, desperate to protect her family as the Capels’ scandalous past rears its head again. The plot hinges on Alice’s obsessive curiosity about her parents’ history; her relationship with the sketchy (or is he?) Gabe; and the mystery of an eerily familiar stranger who’s keen to make contact with Alice. It has the heart and soul of the paciest thriller while it explores the depths of familial love from multiple angles.It’s a brilliant way of approaching the premise, and you can absolutely read it if you haven’t read The Poison Tree. In fact, it might be even more enjoyable that way – a couple of things readers of The Poison Tree will already know are treated as plot twists here. I wasn’t bothered by this, though: even if you already know what’s coming, it all works because the perspective is new, the stakes different.A real treat for fans of Kelly’s debut, but great in its own right, too. And so gripping, from first to last. Calling it a page-turner is an understatement; the speed with which I tore through this thing must actually have broken some record, if only a personal one.I received an advance  copy of The House of Mirrors from the publisher through NetGalley....more",Notes are private!,2,25,1,"Jan 18, 2024","Jan 19, 2024","Jan 18, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/199299165-the-house-of-mirrors

Strictly speaking, it’s mostly epistolary, switching between diary entries and emails as it tracks a father’s determined search for his 12-year-old daughter. The missing girl, Liza, was obsessed with ‘the Hidden World’, the setting of her favourite fantasy series, and it’s these books (and their enigmatic author) that prove key to untangling what happened to her. I can never resist something that has plot points like ‘person follows clue to to place and ends up in a weird museum’, and Dreambound combines that with whimsical fantasy – something I wouldn’t usually enjoy, but here it gives the narrative an edge, makes the book feel like something fresh.

Stephen is in thrall to his domineering friend Keith, who has a habit of spinning tall tales – including, pivotally, the claim that his mother is a German spy. Many years later, Stephen returns, reflecting on the events of his childhood and how this foolish lie ultimately upended the whole community. The narrative is crafted to not only convey, but embody, the ways in which memories become distorted – both by the layering effect that makes it seem as though many significant events occurred together, and by a child’s lack of full understanding being filtered through an adult’s recall.

A closeted boy plays a game as a teen, and finds it comes back to haunt him as an adult – or, perhaps, it’s the other way around. It embodies the ‘loss and longing’ theme: thwarted desire, the ache of missed chances. My personal favourite was ‘The Rental Sister’, a short, creepy, urban-legend-style tale in a colloquial style, about a young woman in Tokyo who briefly works in the titular role (designed to help hikikomori ease back into the world). ‘Giallo’ is everything you could want in a story called ‘Giallo’, capturing every aspect of the film genre so perfectly and vividly, you’ll never need to watch one again. The queasy, bloody ‘Conversion’ takes a more brutal tack, following a perverted therapist who successfully ‘converts’ an unhappily gay young man, but with horrifyingly extreme results.I liked ‘The Oestridae’, in which two siblings are blindsided when a previously-unheard-of aunt turns up shortly after their mother’s disappearance. I couldn’t get on with the indulgent ‘The Cenacle’, and ‘My Heart’s Own Desire’ left me with a lot of questions. There’s also the fact that a large proportion of the book is taken up by a novella, ‘Anaïs Nin at the Grand Guignol’. It’s well-written, and a good expression of the collection’s project, so it doesn’t feel out of place; but it’s a big chunk of pages, and I felt I was missing something – some essential context that might have made it more satisfying.This is a collection united by theme more than anything else, so it’s not easy to find any one point of comparison. After reading ‘The Closet Game’ and ‘The Oestridae’, I felt it was going to be a similar book to What Makes You Think You’re Awake? by Maegan Poland and The Ghost Sequences by A.C. Wise. Yet ‘Ceremonials’ and ‘Giallo’ might slot quite neatly into a Carmen Maria Machado collection, while at other points (e.g. ‘DST (Fall Back)’) I was reminded more of Lovecraftian stylists such as John Langan. In the end No One Dies from Love was a mixed bag for me, simply because the subject matter and particular brand of horror weren’t always to my taste – the stories lost me whenever they veered too far towards dark fantasy – but it was a book that left me impressed with Levy’s skills as a storyteller, and sure I’ll still read more from the author....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,Feb 2024,"Feb 04, 2024","Jan 14, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/145625624-no-one-dies-from-love

There’s a community in a valleyThe premise of The Other Valley is high-concept, yet so simple it seems amazing no-one’s written this book before now. There’s a community in a valley. Some distance either side lie duplicate valleys – exactly the same, except one is twenty years in the past, the other twenty years into the future. Movement between valleys is both physically taxing and strictly controlled: requests must be approved or denied by a special council, the Conseil (and they are almost always denied).Our protagonist and narrator, Odile Ozanne, is a 16-year-old schoolgirl who hopes to join the Conseil. At the same time as she enters the competitive ‘vetting’ process to win an apprenticeship, she accidentally witnesses a visit from residents of the future valley. She recognises them as the parents of her classmate Edme, and realises what this must mean: in the near future, Edme will die. Odile is drawn to him; they become friends; she begins to fall in love. In the second half of the story, we meet Odile as an adult and see how the events of her youth have affected her life.This is a beautifully written book. One of the most impressive things about it is the clear distinction between its two parts. In the first half of the book, the valley is wistful, nostalgic and magical. The elegant prose, the evocative settings, the sense of potential surrounding both Odile’s future career and her putative relationship with Edme – all combine to create an impression of a place that feels at once familiar and entirely otherworldly. In the second half, however, that pretty facade is ripped away. We’re clearly in the same place, just seeing behind the curtain, being shown the details of the dirty work that makes this idyll possible for the lucky few. It’s such an effective way to illustrate different facets of a fictional world.I was worried, early on, that this would be one of those books in which the course of someone’s entire life is dominated by a brief, youthful infatuation – a common plot point and one I dislike. But Howard is clearly aware this is a cliche. There’s a good balance between the obvious fact that the story’s world is unlike ours (time travel is possible here; regrets can be fixed, at a cost) and Odile’s own acknowledgement that she barely knew Edme. It’s a refreshingly unsentimental take on the trope, one that still allows for pathos and emotional heft.The Other Valley is my favourite kind of speculative fiction, mastering the formula of compelling genre hook + stunning writing. So interesting, accomplished and such a smart idea, it’s not the type of book that immediately strikes you as a debut. I’d go out and get all the author’s other books if I could.I received an advance  copy of The Other Valley from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,0,63,1,"Jan 14, 2024","Jan 18, 2024","Jan 14, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/200265628-the-other-valley

In I wanted to read this and I enjoyed it in parts, but I was left feeling conflicted about the fact that it’s arguably quite an intrusive endeavour. In Her Words was assembled by Amy’s parents, and it’s largely made up of youthful ephemera – letters, photographs, school reports, pages from notebooks and diaries. But it’s emphasised over and over again that Amy was a very private person (to the point of her family not hearing much of her music until it was ready to be released), and most of the material is the sort of thing she might not have wanted the world to see. I felt uncomfortable reading journal entries about which classmates Amy hated or fancied – I have loads of stuff like this in old notebooks and even now I’d be mortified if anyone else read it! The sections that deal with Amy’s evolution as a musician and songwriter are more interesting. Here, we get to see handwritten lyrics and unfinished songs, and there’s a clear sense of how her songwriting process worked. It’s easy to read many of the lines as she might have sung them. There are some beautiful photographs too, and at the end, two stories from people who have benefitted from the services offered by the Amy Winehouse Foundation. These are lovely to read – perhaps they should have taken up a larger portion of the book?With any person, famous or not, childhood scribblings might well provide glimpses of the adult they became, but I don’t know that they’re particularly interesting in themselves to anyone other than the person’s family. In Her Words is mostly these, and more or less cuts off at the point Amy became truly famous. It’s unclear whether this is because there’s little or no material available from those years, or just that her parents find it too painful to revisit them. As understandable as that might be, it shows the limitations of this book being curated by Amy’s family. While it was a time of great torment for Amy as an individual, that period of creative productivity and fame is, after all, the reason she is remembered, and the reason people want to read more about her in the first place. (Also, I’d mistakenly got the impression that In Her Words was some kind of follow-on from Amy Winehouse: Beyond Black, perhaps because of the similar format and design of the books, when in fact they were produced and published separately. If you want to read one book about Amy Winehouse, Beyond Black is the far better option, and a truly gorgeous tribute.)...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Dec 27, 2023","Dec 30, 2023","Dec 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/198152482-amy-winehouse-in-her-words

You can probably glean everything you need to know about this book from the marketing tagline branding it ‘the dark academia event of 2024’. Like The Cloisters, it appears to have been written and published with this particular niche in mind, and also feels quite juvenile compared to the novels it strives to emulate – perhaps best suited to readers who are just making the jump from YA to adult fiction. It’s the tale of four scholarship students at a private school where the social hierarchies are strict and the bullying is relentless. While narrator Rose makes some headway towards fitting in, her eccentric roommate Marta is less fortunate. When a popular girl is involved in an accident, Marta is blamed and the central ‘four’ are dragged into a bizarre game of subterfuge. The story is told from an adult perspective by Rose, but aside from a brief epilogue, it doesn’t delve into the characters’ lives after these events, instead concentrating on their school experience only (which, again, makes the book feel like it has quite a young focus). At the same time, the miseries heaped on one character are so extreme that they start to tip the scale into parody. Still, I can’t deny the narrative power this book has. It held my attention and absorbed and compelled me when nothing else could.

This is the setup: the author, Steve Hollyman, wrote a novella called He Knows His Name,Esc&Ctrl is a multilayered, metafictional book-within-a-book. This is the setup: the author, Steve Hollyman, wrote a novella called He Knows His Name, a second-person narrative about an angry and lonely man who creates an alternate identity online. The sole manuscript was stolen. Some time later he’s contacted by an academic who claims to have found the missing manuscript – but now it's had a whole additional plotline added to it by an anonymous contributor. This, known as VOID, is a cod-noir episode featuring the amnesiac Vincent, who’s searching for his girlfriend’s killer in New York City. Esc&Ctrl consists of both books spliced together with commentary from both Hollyman and the academic, complete with discussions in the footnotes.It’s reminiscent of S., The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas and especially theMystery.doc, as well as Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy (which is clearly an influence). Reviewing such a self-aware narrative always presents challenges. It’s difficult to tell how seriously you’re meant to take the poorly written women, or the pompousness of various personas; when artificiality is literally built into the story, any such bugs might actually be features. Somehow, I found Esc&Ctrl to be more than the sum of its parts. He Knows His Name could be a striking short story on its own, but VOID is simultaneously flimsy and pretentious – it’s the bringing together of both, plus all the postmodern flourishes, that makes the whole thing more interesting.After writing the above, I found out the text of Esc&Ctrl formed part of the author’s PhD thesis. This makes more sense of various references in the footnotes, which sometimes feel out of place as well as being a bit ‘Critical Theory 101’. I also learned it was originally meant to be read in conjunction with a series of Facebook pages set up for the characters, which are referenced in the novel (I don’t use Facebook so hadn’t tried to access these). Knowing all this shifted my perception of Esc&Ctrl: in fact, it’s not just metafictional but transmedia, in debt to hypertext fiction to an extent that isn’t fully evident from reading it as a book. (A weird irony: although the foreword extols the virtues of the print novel, I was unwittingly getting closer to the intended experience by reading my copy in ebook form, navigating through the footnotes by clicking back and forth.) I think it also helps to know that Hollyman was writing it between the late 2000s and early 2010s, when novels about online identity were much thinner on the ground. If what’s being said here – every social media profile is a work of fiction, etc – doesn’t exactly seem mindblowing today, it would have been a fresher observation at the time.I started to find Esc&Ctrl more interesting once I knew more about its origins, but this information isn’t referenced in the book itself, it’s something I had to go looking for. So should I allow it to affect my opinion? Or should I simply  the words on the page? These questions are strangely pertinent to the book’s project – perhaps it did exactly what it was supposed to after all. Ultimately, the formal experimentation kept me interested in the story even when I found it lacking as... well, a story. It’s a quick, easy read and certainly a page-turner, so well worth a look if you’re into books that play with format and narrative....more",Notes are private!,1,13,1,"Jan 31, 2024",Feb 2024,"Nov 23, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/74877374-esc-ctrl

Having moved to Milan (which she hates) with her boyfriend, she doesn’t do much with her time except smoke weed and pick up a few shifts at a local bar – until she meets Gloria, a successful influencer. Despite disliking Gloria and everything she stands for, Maia’s sucked into working for her... and that’s it, really. When I stand back from The Other Profile, I can see it’s a ‘nothing much really happens’ book. Its portrayal of a twentysomething living an aimless life can seem cliched (Maia’s relationship with the older Filippo is tedious, and should either have been a bigger part of the story, or not there at all) and there aren’t any particularly stunning insights about influencers. Why, then, did I enjoy it? Graziosi has unusually good control of her narrator’s voice; Maia’s wit keeps the whole thing alive. I loved reading about her job in the bar and her disdain for the hangers-on surrounding Gloria. Personally I also found it interesting to read a novel in translation about online culture.

Are the strange things he describes – a manuscript that keeps changing, the house crumbling, his own skin peeling off – all in his head? It’s a great concept that’s held back by frustratingly childish language and humour. At many points you’d think the narrator was meant to be about 12. I enjoyed various inserts into the main narrative (some stories ostensibly written by Gabriel’s ex; a somewhat metafictional script) much more than that narrative itself. I liked the way the ending brings everything together, poignantly framing the way Gabriel finally shucks off the shroud of grief, but it doesn’t fully offset the unevenness of the rest. As imperfect as first novels sometimes can be, though with sparks of interesting style.

It’s so clever, all of it – the use of ekphrasis, the title, the nature of the painting, how they all play into each other – but absorbing and readable at the same time, never too smart for its own good. One of the closest things I have read to Nina Allan’s short fiction, somehow seeming to embody the spirit of her fractured novels: I’m thinking especially of Stardust/Ruby, of ‘Wreck of the Julia’, as well as ‘Four Abstracts’ and Maggots. Reminded me of Aliya Whiteley too: the mystery of Skein Island’s premise, the cyclical nature of Three Eight One. As a horror reader, a lover of strange stories, and someone who’s enjoyed Tuttle’s contributions to anthologies, it’s probably embarrassing that it’s taken an NYRB edition to turn me on to her work. Even worse, in the past I’ve been put off by the covers (the design for A Nest of Nightmares, for example, makes it look exactly like the type of horror I like least). My Death is a revelation: subtle, grounded, yet indisputably weird. I will certainly read more now.

This isn’t a general history of social media, and it’s my own fault that I thought otherwise, because the real subject matter is right there in the subtitle: fame, influence and power. Lorenz is concerned with two things: firstly, how the now-ubiquitous figure of the influencer (or, ugh, ‘content creator’) came to exist; and secondly, how influencers started making big money. It is, at its heart, a book about money, much more than it is a book about the internet.In the chapter on MySpace and Facebook, Lorenz briefly writes about a ‘scene kid’, Kiki Kannibal, whose online popularity brought with it an onslaught of bullying. As I did with a lot of the figures in this book who were unknown to me, I googled the girl’s name to see what she’s doing now. This led me to a Rolling Stone article that fills in the details: Kiki was harassed relentlessly, threatened, doxxed, and targeted by a paedophile. It got so bad her parents had to abandon their house, which they then couldn’t sell, and ended up bankrupt. The article ends with the whole family crammed into Kiki’s grandmother’s house, broke, jittery, chafing against each other. It’s an incredibly bleak story. It’s also a hundred times more fascinating than anything in this book.This encapsulates my problem with Extremely Online: the interesting human stories are buried under a load of boring generalised detail. An oral history might have been a better way to tell it. A book about influencers who never actually made it could also be great. This book, as it is, is not for me.(It’s also so US-centric that Lorenz refers to a clip from The Day Today simply as ‘an early viral video’, as if it originated on YouTube. Which was, honestly, the point at which I thought yep, I’m probably not going to finish reading this.)...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 26, 2024",not set,"Nov 07, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/181848698-extremely-online

In the parts of the book entitleThis is pitched as a gothic coming-of-age novel set in a isolated coastal village, but that’s only part of the story. In the parts of the book entitled ‘The North Shore’, the young narrator is at home alone during a storm. The next morning, walking on the beach, they encounter what at first seems like a dead man. He revives – albeit coughing up impossible quantities of seaweed, and apparently unable to speak – before undergoing a bizarre transformation. ‘The North Shore’ itself reminded me of several writers who combine a strong sense of a specific place and beautiful landscape writing with the uncanny: Lucy Wood, Tim Cooke, Gary Budden. But swathes of the book, notably the sections ‘Knotty Entrails’ and ‘Knapped Flint’, slip into a more conversational style of (perhaps) autofiction that’s more in line with something like Edward Parnell’s Ghostland. In these, the narrator finds the ‘North Shore’ manuscript among some old papers, many years later. Unable to reconcile the written version of events with what they remember, they reflect on this seemingly distorted memory with reference to stories, myths and art about transformation, thresholds, the vast unknown.The North Shore deliberately plays into ideas about liminality and ‘the instability of that state we call reality’; nothing is fixed or certain. It’s a novel that reads like non-fiction, hard to categorise. It’s natural to assume the narrator is male (if only because the author is), but as far as I can tell, their gender is never stated. At one point they glimpse their own reflection in a dream, and the language is intentionally vague, as if they are aware of themselves as a cipher: ‘the face is unfamiliar and I am not sure if it is a boy or a girl that looks back at me.’ The narrator starts to read like a ghost in their own story. They are ephemeral while the ‘dead’ man becomes – literally – more solid, more permanent.The only elements that didn’t work for me were those relating to the narrator’s relationship with a childhood friend known only as ‘Quill’. This whole strand seems unfinished, and particularly bothered me as The North Shore is otherwise such an effective portrait of a solitary person – it’s as though Tufnell felt obliged to give his character at least one friend, but Quill’s presence in the story adds nothing, with the few letters that pass between the two reading as rather mawkish. This aside, I found this book very interesting – its combination of haunting fiction and more rational analysis, the sense of a narrator dismantling their own narrative as they go along, is strangely spellbinding. And even after all this dissection, the story still retains a sense of mystery....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Nov 02, 2023","Nov 06, 2023","Nov 02, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/121124841-the-north-shore

Imagine Aesthetica or The Odyssey but actually sharp and funny, with a sprinkling of the anarchic energy possessed by something like Come Join Our Disease. A good balance of humour that can bite, and not always by punching up, but also has a soft core. At times feels like an experiment in letting a female character behave like male characters once did (benefitting from the status of ‘artist’ despite repeatedly failing to create anything meaningful, chasing a succession of younger partners) – and you could argue the impact of that trope is blunted by the sheer amount of books about ‘messy women’ we’re drowning in nowadays but this is more acute I think, maybe because its concept (washed-up novelist gets obsessed with the work and philosophy of Ayn Rand, tries to apply it to her life and art) is hyperspecific, so there’s a hook to hang things on that doesn’t relate to a relationship/sex/being single/having or not having kids. Or... at least not entirely.

I really enjoyed the first part of the book, which is full of atmosphere, as we learn about James’s past and his encounters with the Tall Man. The book remains engaging after that, but doesn’t live up to the eerie, chilly promise of its first third. I felt similarly about The Paleontologist by Luke Dumas, with the same reservation about both: with the exception of one sceptical character, everyone just accepts a wild supernatural explanation for events almost instantly. The book also could’ve done with a more thorough proofread – lots of modern speech patterns and Americanisms for a story set in Victorian-era Yorkshire.Although I didn’t think it all hung together perfectly, I liked Blight for trying something different (and more ambitious) than your average ‘gothic chiller’.

It uses the setting of Shirley Jackson’s novel beautifully, while also playing to Elizabeth Hand’s own strengths, and established style, as a horror writer. Stumbling across Hill House on a drive in the country, playwright Holly thinks she’s found the perfect venue in which to rehearse and workshop what she hopes will be her breakthrough play, Witching Night. Holly is joined by the cast – her talented yet capricious younger girlfriend, Nisa, and a pair of actors, has-been Amanda and never-was Stevie – and at first, rehearsals go wonderfully: the house’s atmosphere perfectly complements the play’s tale of witchcraft. But there’s the matter of the staff who refuse to stay overnight, the hostile woman who lives in a neighbouring trailer, and the terrifyingly huge black hares Holly keeps glimpsing (a brilliant addition). As tensions increase, Hill House’s influence begins to feel less like an illumination of Witching Night’s themes and more like an infection. Everyone in the book has their own ghosts, cleverly feeding into their own personal hauntings. I was frequently reminded of Hand’s previous, equally good (if not better) novel Wylding Hall; clearly, sticking a bunch of creatives in a haunted house makes for a foolproof horror formula in her hands.I received an advance  copy of A Haunting on the Hill from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,1,17,1,"Sep 29, 2023","Oct 02, 2023","Oct 02, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63142463-a-haunting-on-the-hill

Every time I picked it up and read a couple of chapters, I enjoyed it. But every time I put it down, its details slid off my brain, as if I too was enveloped in the same chemical haze as Yoder’s characters.Hannah lives in Lumena, a town dominated by a vast pharmaceutical factory. Is this the near future, or an alternate version of our world? It’s never entirely clear. Every aspect of life – school, work, socialising – revolves around a vast spectrum of (legal) drugs, most prominently Valedictorian or ‘V’; it’s supposed to make students perform better academically, but its awful side effects are swept under the carpet. There’s a lot of talk of ‘devices’ and ‘streaming’ etc – basically, contemporary references written about in such a way that they sound vaguely futuristic. I was also slightly thrown off by the characters’ use of slang, much of which already sounds dated just two years after the book was published (honestly, I never want to see ‘obvi’ again in my life). The overall effect of Lumena is one of distracted surrealism, retro futurism, like a film set in the 22nd century but shot on burned celluloid.It all goes a bit ‘cli-fi’ in the final third as a disaster shakes everyone loose of Lumena’s grip. With Hannah’s friend Celia hospitalised, she’s led to wonder: ‘who was Celia without supplements? I mean who were any of us, really?’ This section pivots away from the smooth whimsy of the earlier chapters; the characters explore their relationships to one another amid post-Lumena life, a return to something more primordial (with added visions of chimps). It reminded me of some other slightly frustrating, difficult-to-pin-down novels about strange situations and ideas: Lamb by Matt Hill, Girls Against God by Jenny Hval, The Factory by Hiroko Oyamada.

Daniel is never sympathetic, but this arguably makes the book’s core question all the more urgent: after all, a man may be a raging misogynist without being guilty of rape (though the former makes it much easier for us to believe the latter). The real MVP of the book is Julie, in whose narrative Gilmartin skilfully combines protectiveness and rage. Stretching the story across three perspectives inevitably means that some of the characters are spread a bit thin – with Hannah, there’s a powerful sense of her experience in the restaurant; less of who she is beyond that – but the writing is strong enough to override this.

Her flighty sister Cecilia has done no such thing: she’s never truly grown up and has spent her life bouncing from place to place, obsession to obsession, taking up with eccentric new friends or lovers only to quickly discard them. When Cecilia vanishes while Rose is planning her wedding, it seems pretty typical. Then Rose uncovers her involvement with a cult-like group, Avalon, and becomes concerned. So she joins Avalon herself. Soon Rose is in way too deep – lying to her fiancé, having secret meetings with Cecilia’s estranged husband, entranced by Avalon’s charismatic followers...I liked but didn’t love Here in Avalon, and I feel bad about it, if only because Tara Isabella Burton’s previous novels are both among my favourites of all time. There’s an odd tension in this book, and I struggled with it: while everything deliberately feels fantastical, it emphatically isn’t, the point being that Avalon purposely manufactures this atmosphere, creating the impression – only the impression – of an escape from real life. Even away from Avalon, though, the characters seem as exaggerated as figures in a fable. This is especially true of Cecilia, who it is impossible to picture as a real person. She’s reminiscent of Ava in Mona Awad’s Bunny (and if you’ve read Bunny, you might understand why that’s a problem). Her wimpy husband is barely more credible.In her non-fiction book Strange Rites, Burton writes about the obsessive fandom surrounding immersive theatre, her own involvement in that scene, and her theory that such performances are (one example of) the modern equivalent to a religious ritual. It’s easy to see how this has fed into Here in Avalon, but I wonder if the author’s enchantment with the idea is the reason it lacks an essential spark on the page. I suppose it’s easier to imagine being bewitched by an interactive cabaret if you’ve got personal experience of that. I’m afraid to say that for me, nothing about Avalon seemed particularly interesting or beguiling. Instead I just felt utter frustration that Rose was risking her career and relationship to dance on a boat with a few people in costumes. Maybe that means I’m not open enough to the suggestion of magic or something, and that’s probably part of the problem here: I couldn’t meet the world of the story halfway. It’s just... if I’m reading a novel about a seductive cult, I want to feel that I too could be seduced. I don’t want to have to try too hard to see how it might happen.You know when you watch a film and the production values are amazing, sets and costumes all stunning, yet there’s no chemistry between the actors? That’s what this book is like. The plot flows smoothly and Burton’s prose is as gorgeous as ever; it just doesn’t quite click. An engaging story, for sure, with moments worth revisiting, but I’d recommend both Social Creature (more compelling) and The World Cannot Give (more emotionally resonant) over this.I must say, though: I loved the little Easter egg-style details in Here in Avalon that confirm all Burton’s novels take place within the same universe.I received an advance  copy of Here in Avalon from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 21, 2023","Dec 22, 2023","Sep 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/177075002-here-in-avalon

While it’A little girl goes missing, and we explore the ensuing search and investigation through the perspectives of her mother and a police officer. While it’s a standard premise for crime fiction, this is no ordinary family and no ordinary child: six-year-old Kimmy Diore is the daughter of a hugely popular family influencer who’s been broadcasting her kids’ lives on YouTube since they were born. Throughout, Kids Run the Show is a smart combination of social commentary and pacy, character-driven mystery – but it’s the concluding part of the book, unexpectedly jumping forward ten years, that really elevated this for me. De Vigan almost enters speculative fiction territory here, and it’s a risk that pays off, making the novel both more thought-provoking and more thrilling. De Vigan has explored themes of the tyranny of parents and helplessness of children throughout so much of her writing, but this is perhaps her most successful and exciting treatment of the theme yet.

You knew I was going to say this – but it’s genuinely my favourite of hers in years, a story I wanted to read again as soon as I’d finished it (and putting it first in the book is a bold move because it sets the bar high). Two women meet at a book signing, become unlikely friends, and encourage one another in their dreams of revenge. And then there are all the details: Deb’s love of the writer Olena Pohorska, and her own writerly aspirations; her assessment of Barbara’s appearance, and how that first impression evolves; the imagined stories, the imagined art. Deb’s descriptions of Pohorska’s work feed, playfully, into Allan’s fictional universe like an ouroboros – as though Allan is speaking to her dedicated reader, or maybe that’s just how I felt, but it fits so neatly with the story that I couldn’t stop thinking it. Like all the best short stories, ‘Saint Barbara’ feels like a whole world in miniature.‘Under Cover of Darkness’ by Stephen Volk. While it’s essentially a fictionalised version of real events, this is a narrative Volk makes his own, adding a twist scarcely more horrible than the true story.‘Facts Concerning the Disappearance of the Orloff Six’ by Alyssa C.

An excellent example of the family drama/folk horror combination that is becoming this author’s trademark.Of the rest, I liked Ronald Malfi’s ‘Remember Me’, which nails the atmosphere of Halloween (a surprisingly rare thing), and Carly Holmes’ uncomfortable and deeply terrifying ‘Dodger’.There are 20 stories in this book, which in my opinion is a few too many; I prefer my anthologies more tightly edited and selective. It also (broadly speaking) leans away from the ghostly, strange and ambiguous and more towards the supernatural, animate and gory, so most of it just isn’t in line with my tastes. I admit I was starstruck by Allan’s name (and the generally impressive list of contributors!) and didn’t pause to think about whether the concept was likely to appeal.

But it seems the slightly more specific brief – the tales here focus on ‘Christmas or Advent’ rather than just ‘winter’ – has helped bring out a bit more originality.At least the contributors seem to be having fun with it this time: Laura Shepherd-Robinson’s ‘Inferno’, Imogen Hermes Gowar’s ‘A Double Thread’ and Susan Stokes-Chapman’s ‘Widow’s Walk’ are all enjoyable, despite following similar lines. ‘The Gargoyle’ by Bridget Collins treads familiar ground too, but it’s beautifully crafted and pretty satisfying; I’d read it again. Stuart Turton’s ‘The Master of the House’ manages a surprisingly compelling fairytale-like narrative. In ‘Carol of the Bells and Chains’, Laura Purcell really commits to the theme by adding Krampus into the mix – of all the stories, this one feels the most like Christmas horror.For me, three stories stood out, and in each case it’s their unpredictability that makes them notable. Andrew Michael Hurley impresses again with his Aickmanesque ‘The Old Play’: it plunges the reader straight into a disconcertingly off-kilter community in which the titular play, a sinister parable, must be performed every year. Catriona Ward’s ‘Jenkin’ is refreshingly weird, following a young woman who sees a strange half-human creature every time she tells a lie. (It also has a great title + first line combo.) Natasha Pulley’s ‘The Salt Miracles’ is as lovely as it is horrible, and feels the most complete, its effectiveness a product of the author’s gorgeous writing and knack for a heart-wrenching detail rather than any cheap thrills....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Dec 25, 2023","Dec 27, 2023","Sep 02, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/114922506-the-winter-spirits

She’s lonely, insecure, and plagued by gory fantasies. The spectre of David’s former wife, Sheila – an artist whom Abby imagines as intimidatingly beautiful – looms large (yes, there are strong echoes of Rebecca here). Abby’s dreams and visions intensify; she becomes obsessed with the image of a drowned woman. What really happened to Sheila? And who is the ‘guest’?As sometimes happens with graphic novels, the story feels like it’s stretched a little thin. At the end, I was left wishing there could’ve been more meat on the bones of certain characters. However, the art here is stunning, much more advanced and elaborate than in Carroll’s debut collection Through the Woods. Abby’s day-to-day life is rendered in simple shades of grey, while her dreams come to life in glorious bursts of colour; dripping shades of turquoise, bloody reds.

The Company is inspired by the real-life Victorian scandal oAn atmospheric gothic tale with a lot of untapped potential and a frustrating conclusion. The Company is inspired by the real-life Victorian scandal of arsenic-laced wallpaper; Varese invents a successful wallpaper manufacturer, Braithwhite & Co, and Lucy Braithwhite, young heiress to ‘the company’, tells the story. We find her in a moment of crisis after the death of Mr Luckhurst, the company’s trusty manager. With Lucy’s brother John afflicted by a mystery illness, the future of the company is in doubt – until the young, charismatic, preternaturally talented Mr Rivers steps in. Lucy is suspicious of Rivers’ motives; as her misgivings grow, her reliability falters too, and her narrative becomes increasingly claustrophobic.There are some fantastic scenes and details: the intermingling of real and supernatural threats; a surreptitious conversation in a wintry graveyard; Lucy’s creepy bond with Rivers’ young servant. Yet the pacing is off. While parts of Lucy’s narrative drag and repeat, the ending is rushed and inconclusive. By the end, it’s unclear who is victim and who is villain – and I’m sure that’s the point, but it could have been taken so much further. (Indeed, it’s a point that seems to have been missed by those who interpret Lucy – who maintains a wilful, childish ignorance about the arsenic throughout – as some sort of 19th-century girlboss.) Given what’s implied about Rivers’ background, I would have much preferred a version of this story that gave us his perspective too....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Sep 13, 2023","Sep 18, 2023","Aug 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61415143-the-company

Like Cass in Play, Minerva (known by the nickname Minnow) is a woman fleeing scandal. All but fired from her teaching job, she seizes the chance to take up a role in Paris, where she starts a relationship with a colleague 15 years her junior. Charles is the son of a wealthy and influential family, but he’s also a passionate activist who’s become embroiled in the gilets jaunes movement alongside his mercurial friend Luc. Unbeknownst to her, Minnow’s choices have parallels to those of her father, Christopher, long before she was born. In a parallel storyline, set 50 years earlier, we follow a young Christopher as he’s swept up in student protests at Harvard and falls in love with firebrand campaigner Olya.This premise isn’t necessarily something that would have got my attention on its own, but with Silverman’s name attached, I was interested – and I’m so glad I was, because this is a masterfully crafted novel. The author’s background as a playwright seems to influence her writing in the best way: her ear for dialogue is matched only by her ability to write a perfect setpiece. So we get great, plausible debates between the characters; smart, snappy, but also believable as things people would actually say. Silverman has a gift for making something new and startling out of a cliche (it’s a tiny detail, but this book has possibly the best ‘parent meeting their new baby’ scene I’ve ever read). At times, the book is unexpectedly open – the mystery of what sent Minnow to Paris is dealt with swiftly, rather than being held back and used as a plot twist. The characters act in frustrating ways, and both central relationships seem obviously doomed to fail, but I don’t think we’re meant to be rooting for anyone here; this is a story about making mistakes and what happens afterwards, whatever that means.I received an advance  copy of There’s Going to Be Trouble from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jan 25, 2024","Jan 29, 2024","Aug 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/186877119-there-s-going-to-be-trouble

I thought The Paleontologist was on track to be an instant five-star favourite, just like the author’s brilliant debut A History of Fear. Ultimately, however, the supernatural elements just became too much for me – my suspension of disbelief collapsed and I simply couldn’t buy the characters’ swift acceptance of some deeply bizarre, out-there hauntings. The dialogue stumbles at points too: its heart is in the right place, but a book built around outlandish horrors and the protagonist’s traumatic childhood perhaps shouldn’t also be a pandemic novel and a dissection of white male privilege. It feels like this book was a passion project for the author, which perhaps explains why it seems overly packed with themes that don’t quite slot together.

A feeling that we’re reading a description of a videogame rather than seeing the coding underneath, or the inspiration for the story. Which makes it perfect that there is in fact an additional layer of interpretation: hundreds of years later, an archivist living in a very different world (where the individual no longer truly exists, as human consciousness is shared) finds Fairly’s story and annotates it, trying to decode its meaning.Fairly’s story, titled The Dance of the Horned Road, is weird and sometimes inscrutable, with repeating motifs such as mysterious creatures called cha, a ‘chain device’ Fairly must press at pivotal points in her journey (and which always causes the narrative perspective to shift), and the sinister ‘breathing man’ who stalks her all the way. It can feel useless to try and impose a moral on any of it. My take is that it’s best understood by way of the tension between Fairly’s solitary quest and the archivist’s existence as a person in whom ‘all the information ever amassed’ is contained. It reminded me of books like Confessions of the Fox, The Book of Luce and The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas – none of which are SFF, but all centre on a similar idea about a narrator trying to excavate the truth from a document/cache of evidence, layers of reading on top of reading.I received an advance  copy of Three Eight One from the publisher through NetGalley....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Oct 13, 2023","Oct 15, 2023","Jul 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/199385896-three-eight-one

While reading The Others of Edenwell, and especially after finishing it, I kept thinking the same thing: why isn’t this book getting more attention?! With its wartime setting, beautifully atmospheric description and slow-burn queer romance combined with elements of folk horror, this is a novel that feels ripe for obsessive fandom. If I was in charge of marketing it, I’d be targeting fans of Natasha Pulley and In Memoriam. This is a book that takes its time to set the scene: the Edenwell retreat comes to life in full colour; its staff are more than just background characters; it’s a whole world. There are so many threads here – from Freddie’s relationship with his dad and Scole’s secret to the creeping terror of ‘the German’ and the chatterings of the corvids – yet all are seamlessly woven together in what is both an elegaic war novel and a haunting ghost story.

This book takes the ‘trauma as horror’ trope and eats it from the inside out. It’s full of thrilling writing about fetishes, transness, transphobia, dysphoria, and whatever it means to be virtuous, if it even means anything. I know it sounds basic and borderline patronising to call it ‘fearless’, but it really is fearless and so brilliantly weird. Especially when it takes turns into more experimental style choices, with the stage play section (active monsters) being a particular high point.

The show, broadcast in real time, became a phenomenon. It changed the lives of everyone involved: the family of a missing girl suddenly catapulted to a very strange kind of ‘fame’; the producer who built a career on the back of Searching for Sara’s notoriety; the residents of a small town suddenly overrun with media and conspiracy theorists. Kill Show purports to be an oral history of the show, documenting its effect alongside the fate of the girl at its heart, 16-year-old Sara Parcell.Kill Show is compulsive reading – fast-paced, full of revelations, lots of characters, the plot rarely pausing for breath. This makes it a very compelling book, yet ultimately a little empty as a story, because we never learn who any of these people are beyond archetypes. The voices also don’t come across distinctly; these very different individuals all talk suspiciously similarly (this would probably be much less of a problem in audiobook format). Unlike recent novels in the same space – think True Crime Story, Six Stories, Penance – it doesn’t attempt any metatextual analysis beyond gesturing towards the idea that any engagement = consumption = perpetuation. Definitely worth a look if you enjoy stories of this type, but more of a beach read than a meaningful examination of true-crime-as-entertainment.I received an advance  copy of Kill Show from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jul 10, 2023","Jul 11, 2023","Jul 10, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/184029542-kill-show

I was reeled in by the drama of this and the mystery that surrounds it – even Evie herself doesn’t seem quite sure why she’s done it. The early scenes, with Evie and her friend Violet sneaking into a nightclub to watch Drum performing, are so captivating. The rest of the novel is quiet; a story of unfulfilled lives that doesn’t live up to its first few chapters. The title is taken from Drum’s description of himself: ‘I ain’t but nineteen years old and already living a slipping-down life.’ Even in this early novel, Tyler has a great line in character sketches, for example Drum’s bandmate, to whom a nickname refuses to stick because ‘he was the kind who slid out from under [them].

Mister Magic is the latest: 30 years after productionThis year has been packed with horror novels featuring premises that seem perfect for my tastes. Mister Magic is the latest: 30 years after production ceased on a mysterious kids’ TV programme, its stars are brought back together for a reunion podcast (!), the recording of which takes place at a huge, creepy house just outside an eerily perfect desert town (!!), with things being complicated by the fact that no records of the show exist and everyone remembers it differently (!!!). Clearly inspired by the ‘Candle Cove’ creepypasta, Mister Magic builds a fantastic setup and explores it well – the inserts between chapters, where we get to see extracts from various online discussions about the show (and even its Wikipedia page), were my favourite parts. Ultimately, however, the plot goes in a different direction than anticipated, examining the psychological effects of a cult-like community. It’s pretty effective, it’s just that I would have personally preferred to read more about the mythos of the show. Plus the relationships between characters are sweet but a bit cheesy. I liked The Devil’s Playground, Experimental Film and Blue in Green better as stories about cursed media of various types.I received an advance  copy of Mister Magic from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jun 10, 2023","Jun 12, 2023","Jun 13, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62061575-mister-magic

After a series of deaths linked to The Guesthouse, Laura has reinvented herself, but she’s dragged into a Hollywood nightmare when the ‘curse’ begins to affect the remake too. While I always enjoy a cursed-media story, pretty much everything about this one – plot twists, characters’ behaviour, pivotal scenes – takes suspension of disbelief to new heights. I can’t decide whether this is an appropriate critique or an ironic one, but much of the action would be better suited to the screen than the page. The fast-moving, drama-packed narrative leaves little time to explore what sometimes seem like baffling choices made by the characters. Overall, a bit sillier than I was hoping for, but if you enjoy horror in the Grady Hendrix/Clay McLeod Chapman mould, it’s worth a look.I received an advance  copy of Burn the Negative from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"May 31, 2023",Jun 2023,"May 31, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/168588917-burn-the-negative

The crime at its centre is the gruesome death of a teenager after she was set on fire by three classmates. Like an ever-growing number of modern novels about murder, it’s concerned with the mechanics of true crime and how ‘true’ it ever really is, though I don’t think Clark’s concern lies as much with the ‘ethics of true crime’ as it does with the messiness of ‘the truth’ and how we come to decide what we believe. What is truth, really, when there is no single tidy, complete version of a story?But more than that, and above all, it’s a book about teenage girlhood. The plasticity of identities at this age; how friendships can so easily curdle into enmity (or, really, were only ever enmity in the first place). How a strange idea – a piece of local folklore, or something from the internet – can fatefully take hold. How all this continues to define a person for years to come, maybe even forever: as one character says, ‘there’s a bit of you that’s always a teenager, isn’t there?’ And it’s even more specifically about the experience of the late-millennial, borderline-Gen-Z micro-generation whose adolescence coincided with the boom years of Tumblr.Penance doesn’t quite pack the same punch as Boy Parts because it isn’t driven by a single voice. Yet it’s more immediately a book I want to reread, a book I’m already looking forward to revisiting. I can’t get enough of the method of telling a story like this through a multitude of accounts: when they’re written well (and this is) these are one of my favourite types of books, such an effective way of getting under the skin of a place/community/event/anything, really. Clark also seamlessly folds elements of online culture into the story, something that’s easy to get wrong but here rings true. I’m all for more layered, choral, shifting-truth narratives like this: I love Six Stories, I loved this one (I’d honestly be delighted if this turned into a series as well), I hope it’s huge and sparks off a whole new wave of them.I received an advance  copy of Penance from the publisher through NetGalley....more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"May 15, 2023","May 16, 2023","May 15, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63104845-penance

I did find my investment in the outcome slipping towards the end, though I can’t quite decide if that was because the focus narrowed, or the opposite (i.e. not enough detail for me to feel I ‘knew’ the characters), and one promising subplot just seemed to peter out.

The blurb promises a dark, literary horror novel ‘about the uncanny valley, death cults, optical illusions and the enduring power of fantasy’, and there’s a bit of that, but too little too late for my taste. Delphi and Brendan are the kind of oddball characters who always test my patience. The way they’re written wobbles all over the line between charming and irritatingly quirky (the whole section about Brendan’s first girlfriend! interminable!) and Delphi in particular seems so vapid and immature I couldn’t help picturing her as a teenager, though the character is definitely supposed to be older. (There’s a... plot twist that arguably explains this, but in some ways only makes it odder.)All of which makes it even more frustrating that everything about the park is just brilliant. The chapters are punctuated by letters between a brother and sister, discussing the design of an earlier incarnation of the park, and I was fascinated by these – racing through Delphi’s ramblings just so I could get to them. The setting itself is real feat of imagination, described in amazing detail. The cult, the bots, there is so much good stuff here! A lot of potential. Yet when the climactic scenes come, when the narrative actually starts digging into the mysteries of the park, the descriptive language falters; I found I really couldn’t picture what was going on.The characters and pacing reminded me a lot of A Touch of Jen (and I’d definitely recommend it if you enjoyed that book); elements of the story have shades of Archive 81 and FantasticLand.

When Miss Emily White arrives, the other students take an instant dislike to her, so Ivy goes the other way, quickly coming to see the new teacher as a friend. This stance becomes increasingly difficult to defend as the girls start to believe Miss White is using occult magic. But what of Ivy herself; is her account all it seems?

I came for the combination of a ‘lost film’ plot and elements of horror – a recipe guaranteed to snag my interest – but I stayed for the incredibly well-researched portrait of old Hollywood, the brilliantly world-weary heroine, and the fascinating detective story. In the framing narrative, set in 1967, a man arrives at a middle-of-nowhere desert hotel in search of a legendary silent horror film, The Devil’s Playground. For most of the book, though, we’re with studio ‘fixer’ Mary Rourke in 1927 as she experiences the Devil’s Playground curse first-hand, starting with the death of leading lady Norma Carlton. This is an elaborately plotted historical mystery, rich in fascinating detail; the horror stuff is fun, but – surprisingly – far from my favourite thing about the story.

It’s told largely through transcripts – of a Netflix documentary about Melanie Lange, and interviews with her father – with a few other formats (emails, tweets) thrown into the mix. I’d normally eat this up, but here I wasn’t all that interested in getting to the end of the story. It wasn’t until I scanned some other lukewarm s, Emily May’s in particular, that I figured out why: it’s really quite boring and flat. North cherry-picks incidents from the lives of various tortured celebs; perhaps because of that – because it’s just rehashing real stories – it never gets exciting. All the voices are too similar, and they don’t read like transcripts of people speaking aloud. When Melanie’s journal entries are added to the narrative, they don’t gel with what we’ve been told about her (if you want me to believe your main character is a borderline genius and ace entrepreneur as well as one of the most beautiful women alive, her voice had better demonstrate some of that brilliance. It also strangely goes unexamined that her business model sounds like a Ponzi/MLM scheme). It really can’t stick the landing, either. The final ‘twist’ feels cheap and grim rather than shocking, and the conclusion to the documentary is so unconvincing that I almost started laughing when I read it.Unfortunately, however, I am addicted to mixed-media narratives. I still enjoyed the format of this if nothing else, and I’m still interested in reading North’s forthcoming (similarly structured) novel, Clickbait, which I’m hoping will improve on some of the problems here.

Speak to Me starts off as the tale of a woman, Susan, who’s convinced she’s losing her husband to his phone. She’s determined to separate Kurt from the device she calls ‘Wendy’, going as far as to hide and destroy multiple phones (even as she seems to have little idea what to say to Kurt once he’s phoneless). Yet Susan has her own preoccupation with an inanimate object: a case full of old love letters that went missing when she and Kurt moved to their current home in a soulless new-build estate. As Susan’s twin quests – to triumph over ‘Wendy’, and to get the case back – gather pace, she’s forced into a painful reckoning with her past.The narrative is strongly voice-driven, with Susan’s pain, anger, pettiness and bone-dry wit ringing out from the page. I have never really been a fan of ‘person inexplicably obsessed with an ex from years ago’ stories, and this book tested my patience a bit in that regard; I got to a point where the mere mention of Antony’s name was enough to make me roll my eyes. As much as the reader understands that the obsession (like Susan’s missing case) is symbolic, it feels like a step down from How to Be Human, in which a similarly unsettled protagonist’s primary obsession is with a fox – a weirder, more engaging way of tackling the same idea. As both books are about a woman unravelling as she develops a fixation with something, it’s hard not to compare them; measured against the powerful dread summoned up by the disturbing images and maddening scenes in Human, all the emotions in Speak to Me feel dampened. Though it is a recognisable as a manifestation of profound unhappiness, I was exasperated by Susan’s inertia, and it never feels like she gets to the bottom of who she is or what she wants. While I didn’t expect a neat resolution (and indeed understand that this is the tragedy of Susan’s story), such lack of insight is frustrating in a character-centric novel. Mixed feelings overall: Cocozza’s writing is excellent but Susan’s world, past and present, is portrayed so joylessly I found this a dispiriting read.I received an advance  copy of Speak to Me from the publisher through NetGalley....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Mar 23, 2023","Mar 27, 2023","Mar 23, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63104860-speak-to-me

Hydra feels entirely fresh, though it’s difficult to pinpoint why exactly. Maybe it’s protagonist Anja’s job at an auction house. Maybe it’s the story’s main setting: a derelict cottage on the wild fringes of a naval base with a dark history. Maybe it’s the extracts that appear throughout: taken from an investigative report written thirty years earlier, they chronicle strange incidents – with a supernatural cause? – on the same naval base. But most of all, I think, it’s the distinct voice Howell creates for Anja. Her narration, liberally sprinkled with exclamation marks, is delightfully idiosyncratic; her wry tone rings out from the page.There are whole swathes of the book where I could just quote everything Anja says. Her professional rival, Fran, is ‘a girl who’d forgotten she was a woman’; she bemoans her boss with his ‘orderly procession of pretty fuckboys’, and the ‘decaying boyish smile’ of a toadying colleague. Anja on Queen Anne furniture: ‘a design period so feminine one could imagine menstrual blood seeping from the furniture’s joints.’ Anja on the increasing coldness between her and erstwhile best friend Beth: ‘growing apart from me also meant growing apart from herself – best to let me be the whore.’At first, our antiheroine seems to be on the up: she’s well on her way to securing the coveted position of ‘specialist’. (Anja on the prospect of Fran beating her to it: ‘If I didn’t make specialist before her, I’d die.’) But then, in quick succession, comes a series of disastrous events: the death of Anja’s mother, the breakdown of her marriage, and – most ruinously – a dramatic incident at an open house. Anja is rendered jobless and disgraced in one fell swoop. Desperate for an escape, she buys the aforementioned derelict cottage on impulse. Which is when things get weird – and we start to understand the connection between Anja’s narrative and the investigative report.I know a lot of people are fed up of ‘unhinged woman’ novels, and I have been losing my patience with them too, but Hydra really is a cut above. The style definitely has shades of Ottessa Moshfegh, but it’s wittier – at times, Anja’s one-liners are reminiscent of Emma Jane Unsworth’s Animals – and Hydra also feels like a book twin to the film Tár. When the history of the cottage is revealed in full, and when Anja makes her triumphant, deranged and utterly career-crippling return to the auction house, the message is the same: wildness and violence are never as far away as you think....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jun 07, 2023","Jun 10, 2023","Mar 05, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61934441-hydra

Mostly alone, she wanders the streets and adopts her brother’s name, Ruben, subsuming her own identity. Then she begins a relationship with an enigmatic woman named Xu. Xu dominates the self-hating ‘Ruben’ both emotionally and physically, and the book’s central metaphor – Ruben’s willingness to be consumed – is writ large in Xu’s penchant for biting and the strange role of food in their sex life. Di Grado writes a fast-paced narrative stuffed with dizzying images of Shanghai (especially its architecture) and poignant evocations of loss. It’s not exactly a stream of consciousness, but it feels a little like one. Actually, it feels a bit like a number of things it isn’t: a dystopia, an elegy, a crooked love story.While the grief theme is familiar from Di Grado’s previous novels, the reflections on trying to live in a different language and culture reminded me of Polly Barton’s memoir Fifty Sounds, and the more bizarre aspects of the central relationship made me think this might appeal to those who loved Children of Paradise....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Mar 02, 2023","Mar 03, 2023","Mar 02, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/63239345-blue-hunger

Shirley Fearn, a naive 16-year-old, is infatuated with her young teacher, Mr Tiller. But she gets more than she bargained for when she spies on him and discovers something inexplicable. This leads Tiller to confide his secret: he believes he is receiving ‘missives’ from the future, and wants Shirley’s help to ensure a terrifying threat is neutralised.

This second novel is written in a similarly distinctive style – opening lines: It was the year the sow eradicated her piglets. It was a swift and menacing time. The plot, such as it is, is broader in scope, or maybe it’s just that it’s a little more unfocused, or felt that way to me. The narrator is a woman who sees her life as having been defined by obedience to her ‘many’ older siblings. In keeping with that, when her eldest brother asks her to stay with him in an Anna Kavan-esque ‘remote northern country’, she acquiesces without question. From there it unfurls in several directions: the brother’s ailing health, the suspicion of the locals, a thread of what seems like folk horror, and ultimately, a sort of reckoning with the weight of history. As in in Bad Days I found the writing very striking, but these pithy, glacial sentences are most successful when the narrative concentrates on the personal; less so when applied to bigger themes.

Nina Allan’s novelette Neptune’s Trident was previously listed on Goodreads as a separate book; looks like that listing (Review written January 2019. Nina Allan’s novelette Neptune’s Trident was previously listed on Goodreads as a separate book; looks like that listing has now been combined into the magazine issue it was published in. This is a  of Neptune’s Trident only.)Originally published in issue 129 of Clarkesworld magazine, Neptune's Trident is a science fiction novelette. It's set in a future version of Scotland in which a series of disasters and slow changes have precipitated the breakdown of society as we know it. There's also the phenomenon of the 'flukes', people afflicted by a new sort of infection. Some believe it to be a form of alien invasion, but its exact nature is difficult to define. Caitlin compares it to cancer. At one point, a character makes it sound like one version of a file being overwritten by another: 'their template placed over ours... a kind of bleed-through'.This story has a similar feel to 'The Common Tongue, the Present Tense, the Known', and like Noemi in that story, the protagonist Caitlin makes a living by scavenging valuable objects from the polluted coast. She also cares for her partner, Steph, who is one of the infected, and who often (increasingly often) glitches into what Caitlin calls 'not-Steph'. (The transition is described in vivid, chilling terms: 'she turned slowly away from the kitchen counter, moving in jerky increments, like a robot... [her] words slightly blurred, as if two identical recordings of her voice were being played over each other, a millisecond apart'.) One day, while selling her finds at the local market, Caitlin meets a parson – a man still wearing a dog collar despite the disintegration of old religions. At first, she takes pity on him, but it soon becomes clear he has extreme views about the flukes, and that his arrival will change the quiet community.The more explicitly science-fictional of Allan's stories are not usually my favourites, but I do appreciate their attention to detail. Allan's worldbuilding always focuses more on the things that would actually matter to real people, in their day-to-day lives, than stuff like technology and governance. It's the smallest things that make Neptune's Trident real: Caitlin's memories of watching horror films with her brother; the Johnson's shampoo she finds at the beach; the parson's resemblance to a man Caitlin's mother once had a relationship with. The ambiguous ending reflects the void at the heart of this new society, the stillness and silence of the ancient Earth in the face of human disaster....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 10, 2019","Jan 11, 2019","Jan 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35282523-clarkesworld-magazine-issue-129-june-2017

The format – the whole thing is just Slack messages – makes it an incredibly quick and easy read. Sometimes the narrative style doesn’t work as well as it could: the :thumbsup: :eyes: thing got old very fast, and (especially if you use Slack for work yourself) it’s hard not to keep thinking these people would surely, you know, use a chat app that wasn’t fully visible to their bosses for some of these conversations... But really, it’s not the sort of story where that kind of thing matters, and it’s fast-paced and entertaining enough that I could ignore any annoying or implausible bits. It ends up being a pretty perfect mix of funny and horrifying, with an ending that’s really quite moving in its own way. The effect is something like an all-digital version of Grady Hendrix’s Horrorstör. It would be great to read an interactive version of this that actually existed within Slack!...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jan 15, 2023","Jan 16, 2023","Jan 15, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/78265945-several-people-are-typing

I had the absolute time of my life reading this: it’s simply so enjoyable, so moreish. When I had it in my hands, I couldn’t stop reading, and when I was away from it, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Each section of the book focuses on a different inexplicable event on or around Mynydd Du, literally Black Mountain, through history (the chapters were originally released as ‘episodes’ in individual ebooks). There’s the failure of an ‘executive community’ made up of Futuro-style pod houses; the strange disappearance of a popular uni student; the ‘beast’ that terrorised a mining community – even the tale of a Roman general whose troops meet with a seemingly unbeatable foe. There are multiple layers of storytelling here: journalist Rob Markland sifts through the papers of doomed writer Russell Ware, and later we also get a certain Simon Bestwick jumping into the narrative. And in between the work of these characters, there are various interview transcripts, articles, diary entries, letters, forum posts, etc.Many books of this type resort to a more conventional approach when it’s time to tie all the threads together, but in Black Mountain the montage-style narrative is sustained to the end. This – along with the thoughtfully written recurrence of various characters – makes the story feel not like a series of discrete segments, more like a rich and cleverly woven tapestry. Had I not already known, I would never have guessed it was originally published episodically. The fact that it seems so complete also really helps its effectiveness as horror. I’ve read/watched so much horror that I rarely find it unnerving anymore, but this gets genuinely creepy at times; after certain scenes, I kept thinking I could see something lurking in the shadows... It’s the book equivalent of a found-footage film in which you can’t help but be persuaded that a real threat lies beneath even the most unlikely of sequences.Points of comparison for me are John Langan’s The Fisherman, the podcast The Magnus Archives, the film The Empty Man, the Six Stories series and Eliza Clark’s forthcoming Penance. If you like found-footage horror, mixed-media narratives and stories about cursed places, this book is for you. (Don’t be put off by the cover, I know it’s not the best, that’s so often the way with genre fiction published by small presses.) MANY more horror fans should know about Black Mountain....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"May 28, 2023","May 29, 2023","Jan 11, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62542871-black-mountain

Rucker’s stories whenever I’ve encountered them in anthologies, and this collection of weird, unsettling tales looked like it was made for me. In the introduction, Steve Rasnic Tem situates Rucker’s fiction at ‘[the] edge where the everyday dissolves and the numinous begins’, citing her ‘close, realistic character observations’ as a strong point, and comparing her work to that of Robert Aickman. This is all true: ‘No More A-Roving’ – singled out in the introduction as ‘a kind of keystone for this collection’ – particularly earns the Aickmanesque label with its tale of a backpacker who seems unable to leave a dreary, sinister hostel. Personally, I found the settings to be the major strength of The Moon Will Look Strange. A disintegrating, formerly grand flat in a Czech city in ‘The Chance Walker’; the haunted streets of Granada in the title story; a damp art studio in ‘Beneath the Drops’; the oppressive heat of a Georgia summer in ‘Different Angels’. All are beautifully, powerfully depicted, so that starting a new story feels like stepping through a portal from one place into another.As well as creating atmosphere, these vivid settings build a strong sense of how each story’s protagonist feels at odds with the world around them. Many of the stories follow a person who feels lost, displaced; someone who cannot make themselves understood. The very best of them, ‘The Moon Will Look Strange’, is a brilliant sequence of unease about a man who believes he can resurrect his dead daughter through occult magic. It’s reminiscent of both Daphne du Maurier’s ‘Don’t Look Now’ and M. John Harrison’s The Course of the Heart, but also genuinely original, especially the apocalyptic ending. ‘The Chance Walker’ has a wonderfully chilling, self-contained feel with its story of a teacher abroad struggling to make connections – until a weird student turns up at her flat. Also strong is ‘Beneath the Drops’, a creeping tale of a relationship breakdown, art, the balance between privacy and intimacy... and relentless rain. ‘Ash-Mouth’ frames family trauma with horror effectively. ‘These Things We Have Always Known’ dips its toe into dark fantasy (not my favourite genre) with a nonetheless potent tale of a strange, doomed creative community.The other stories are invariably well-written, but some concepts are weaker than others. ‘The Burned House’ is good, but it’s also more or less exactly what you’d expect based on the title. The extremely disjointed ‘In Death’s Other Kingdom’ didn’t work for me at all, with its themes of religious/demonic horror more effectively addressed in the later, more compelling ‘Different Angels’. ‘These Foolish Things’ is forgettable, and I was selfishly disappointed in ‘The Last Reel’ because I mistakenly thought it was going to be a lost film story....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Mar 31, 2023",Apr 2023,"Jan 11, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18777055-the-moon-will-look-strange

Even if I tilt my head, squint and think very hard, it’s still difficult to perceive this book as a ‘gothic fantasy’. Bezill follows an inept young tutor working at the country house of the title; he struggles to connect with his solemn pupil, Herbert, while maintaining infatuations with both Herbert’s mother and a taciturn maid. Yes, there’s a big old house, and an off-limits room in the tower, and oddball characters with disturbing hobbies. But the blurb makes all these things sound sinister when, in the book, they are invariably positioned as humorous. The story is stuffed full of innuendos and never truly feels serious. It’s very funny at points – though I started to find the humour too samey after a while – but I think I’d have enjoyed it more if I’d known it was a comedy going in. (Also, upon finishing it I was extremely relieved to realise I’m unlikely to come across the phrase ‘as cold as an ice lolly’ ever again.)...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 11, 2024","Mar 16, 2024","Jan 11, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63093384-bezill

But this is also the story of its narrator’s whole life, and at points – especially when Engleby becomes a journalist and has some bizarre meetings with famous politicians of the 1980s – it felt like I was reading some unhinged alternate version of Any Human Heart.

It has a similar setup to The Writing Retreat, and also reminded me of The Witch in the Well: the frenemy relationship, the premise of a blocked writer holing up in a big gothic house in the hope of making progress on a book she’s barely started, flashbacks to another fraught period in the villa’s history. Initially, I found the chapters about modern-day friends Emily and Chess far more absorbing than the 1970s scenes featuring teenage writer Mari and her rock-star boyfriend. With a lot of plot and a swiftly paced narrative, the 70s characters do end up feeling a bit thin. It all eventually comes together, though, and I thoroughly enjoyed the twisty ending.

The plot revolves around the disappearance of Jane’s friend Nathan, his involvement in a cult known as the Temple of the Lamb, and Jane’s attempts to find him (with the dubious ‘help’ of their mutual frenemy Madeline). This book is the most similar thing I’ve read to The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters and its sequels; while not exactly steampunk, McOmber’s version of London, filled with obscure folk heroes and festivals, always feels vaguely skewed. I had some problems with The White Forest: the pacing is off, with the story repeatedly gaining momentum and then suddenly grinding to a halt; the plot is definitely overstuffed.

AnWhen his sister and her husband are killed in a car crash, writer and professor Gil Duggan becomes the guardian of his 17-year-old nephew, Matthew. And, family tragedy aside, he’s not exactly happy about it: Gil has hated Matthew since an incident involving his daughter on a family holiday some years ago, and believes he is a nascent psychopath. When Matthew moves into the Duggans’ home in Vermont, tensions rise. Gil becomes increasingly obsessed with his nephew, partly because of his jealousy of Matthew’s immense wealth (his father was a high-flying banker). Matthew certainly seems devious. But Gil, we know, is an unreliable narrator, and the more he crosses the line – following Matthew, devising outlandish theories – the more his credibility falters.There are no true surprises here: as so often with this type of story, the pleasure is in the writing, and in the small details of the characterisation, particularly of Gil. I am getting a bit tired of the archetype he represents – the perfectly comfortable middle-class person who thinks not being super-rich is the same thing as being poor – but it’s undeniably used very well here: so clearly an obsession Gil can’t let go of, as much a factor in his disintegration as his hatred of Matthew. Things are wrapped up really smartly at the end, too, with a conclusion that’s satisfying on several fronts. I’d recommend this to anyone who enjoyed A Lonely Man or Hawk Mountain.I received an advance  copy of A Flaw in the Design from the publisher through NetGalley....more",Notes are private!,-1,20,1,"Jan 03, 2023","Jan 04, 2023","Jan 03, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63911945-a-flaw-in-the-design

As though Tana French pivoted to horror: a dark, eerie novel of great complexity and depth, steeped in Irish folklore.2. Black Mountain by Simon Bestwick. Had the time of my life with this mixed-media, faux-non-fiction book about a cursed mountain. Properly unputdownable.3. The Last Language by Jennifer duBois. The author is back on top form with this riveting, disturbing story following a language therapist’s use of facilitated communication (a controversial and now discredited technique) with an autistic man.4. Hydra by Adriane Howell. Something I didn’t think possible: a genuinely fresh spin on the ‘unhinged woman’ trend, alive with the protagonist’s dry, idiosyncratic voice.5. My Death by Lisa Tuttle. A perfect weird novella. Astonishingly clever, convincing and absorbing; turned me into an instant fan of Tuttle’s writing.6. Novel with Cocaine by M. Ageyev, translated by Michael Henry Heim. 1930s cult classic about a dissolute Russian teenager, his friendships, affairs and drug addiction; a bit like No Longer Human, but way better.7. Grasshopper by Barbara Vine. Vine is at the height of her powers with this beautiful and eloquent coming-of-age tale dressed up as a crime novel. Also made me cry.8. How Can I Help You by Laura Sims. A razor-sharp, nuanced, utterly propulsive character study about identity and obsession.9. Where the Dead Wait by Ally Wilkes. The Terror meets Heart of Darkness; a blood-soaked, frostbitten treat.And... I’m really struggling to choose a 10th, so here are some potential runners-up. Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, an obvious choice, but I can’t not mention it. Angel by Elizabeth Taylor, a beautiful and pathetic tragedy crafted with compassion. Two books that didn’t blow me away, but have stuck with me more vividly than many others: the darkly funny Honour Thy Father by Lesley Glaister; and Margaret Bearman’s brilliantly written coming-of-age novel We Were Never Friends.2023 was a particularly good year for horror, with so many of my favourites (both new releases and older books) falling into the genre. It was a boom year for the ‘lost media’ trope, with one of the highlights being Craig Russell’s The Devil’s Playground, which hides a fascinating historical mystery inside the story of a cursed film. Alison Rumfitt, one of our most exciting current writers of horror, did it again with the disgusting and absolutely fearless Brainwyrms. I continue to devour the reissues of Joel Lane’s work from Influx Press (long may they continue), and the bleak, moody linked stories in Where Furnaces Burn made it another winner. Two haunted, heartbreaking narratives used a metafictional approach to great effect: Looking Glass Sound by Catriona Ward and The Night Ocean by Paul La Farge. And The Others of Edenwell by Verity M. Holloway, a romantic and atmospheric ghost story, wins my ‘this should’ve got way more attention’ award.This was definitely a great year for new books, too. So many of the memorable novels I read in 2023 were brand new, including: The Book of Ayn by Lexi Freiman; A Flaw in the Design by Nathan Oates; Service by Sarah Gilmartin; Blue Hunger by Viola Di Grado, translated by Jamie Richards; The North Shore by Ben Tufnell; Kids Run the Show by Delphine de Vigan, translated by Alison Anderson; and A Haunting on the Hill by Elizabeth Hand (which I enjoyed much more than The Haunting of Hill House – sorry!)I reread 10 books this year, with mixed results. The pick of the bunch was Kiss Me First by Lottie Moggach, which I absolutely tore through, finding it just as fast-paced, gripping and brilliantly voice-driven as it was ten years ago. The Amber Fury by Natalie Haynes and When Nights Were Cold by Susanna Jones fared less well – I enjoyed revisiting both, but ended up feeling slightly bemused about my past self’s enthusiasm for them.2023 was a funny year – busy and, at times, difficult. There were whole months when I mainly read light and easy stuff (May), hardly read anything at all (August), or just reread old favourites (December). I wrote in 2022 about discarding reading goals, which I stuck to without regret (it isn’t important and life’s just too short). If there were any major disappointments, I can’t recall them. I’m a bit dismayed by how much of my reading was just good-but-unmemorable, but I suppose that’s normal – not everything can be an absolute banger after all.The most popular  I wrote this year was (I’m surprised to find) a brief and unremarkable four-star  of Jinwoo Chong’s Flux. But the one that really caught on, and is now my second most-liked  of all time, is my lukewarm  of Rebecca Makkai’s frustrating I Have Some Questions For You, written late last year.I also have to mention that I’ve never seen as many negative articles about Goodreads as I have this year. They were everywhere! They always baffle me because my experience on the site is never reflected in them at all. It’s increasingly the only social media I use in any meaningful way. I love reading s here and I will always maintain that, correctly curated, it’s the best resource of balanced, in-depth, well-written book s you’ll find anywhere....more",Notes are private!,6,48,1,Jan 2023,"Dec 31, 2023","Jan 01, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/62316199-2023-on-goodreads

I enjoyed how the stories moved through time without pinning down where or when we are, so the context is the reader’s only key to how much the invention has advanced.

Sorrowmouth, partly inspired by the William Blake painting ‘The Ghost of a Flea’, is about William Underhill, a man who seeks out the grief-stricken. His motivation is a need to appease the appetite of Sorrowmouth, the mute, otherwise invisible figure who accompanies him everywhere. When he comes into contact with Kate, a failed suicide who has a similar companion, Underhill finally sees a chance for a way out of this isolating pattern, including an opportunity to escape the lifelong shadow of his abusive father.Underhill and Kate (and Varley and Mary) are middle-aged and worn down by the drudgery of daily life; there’s no deus ex machina moment here, no wealthy family waiting to swoop in and save the characters from themselves.

This is a long, sprawling story whose central figure is 80-year-old writer Agnes, successful author of a series of bestselling children’s books and a set of pseudonymous adult novels, both based on people from her real life. The story surveys Agnes’s past as well as the life of her best friend, Polly, and several of their relatives and neighbours. The writing about old age is fantastic, devoid of cliché, and Agnes is a staggeringly good character. Polly and Dick’s marriage is brilliantly drawn, in all its wonder and banality. There were points at which I felt Alice Elliott Dark had pinned down something essential about human existence in a few breathtaking lines... but then there were pages and pages, even full chapters, I could happily have skipped. The character of Maud, an ambitious young publishing exec who persuades Agnes to write a memoir, feels from the start like she exists solely to move the plot along, a suspicion that is borne out repeatedly by events later in the book. I also found some of the dialogue a bit stilted.I cried twice during the final stretch of Fellowship Point – once at a moment of revelation that is devastating for Agnes (with her devastation portrayed so powerfully), and again at the very last line. But within the same stretch there is also a cheap, silly plot twist that feels more like something from a soap opera than a serious novel. I find it difficult to say whether I think the book is worth reading, especially as it’s almost 600 pages, a significant investment of time for any reader.

The central idea is that ‘lambdas’, aquatic aliens who are genetically human, have become part of human society, albeit controversially. But the plot also encompasses AI assassins, sentient objects and future policing. Our (main) guide to this world is officer Cara Gray, who works first in surveillance, then – when her role is superseded by a quantum processor – as a ‘lambda liaison officer’. (And there are additional layers here too, as we’re aware her narrative has been generated by a program, leading to some very particular turns of phrase and details that reverberate throughout her story.) I could have carried on reading about all this forever: it’s so well-written and comes together so satisfyingly, and every perspective is cleverly developed. With that said, don’t read this book if you’re looking for questions to be answered and loose threads neatly tied up. There’s not much in the way of resolution: this is more a portrait of one idea of a future-world.

I was excited to read more of her fiction in Hit Parade of Tears. Unfortunately, this book doesn’t quite live up to its predecessor. While the characters have similarly distinct personalities and voices, the pieces collected here are often more successful at capturing a mood than telling a story.There are recurring details that sometimes make Hit Parade of Tears seem like a particularly idiosyncratic novel-in-stories. The overall vibe is one of 1960s and 70s counterculture, epitomised by political statements and, particularly, music. (This also makes Hit Parade feel more obviously rooted in the time it was written, and much less prescient, than Terminal Boredom.) Another theme concerns characters who live among ordinary people, but believe themselves to be alien in some way – though it’s often unclear whether these beliefs are delusions. In this book we meet people who see visions of the dead, or other worlds; who can remember little of their recent past; who suspect they were born on another planet or have been alive for centuries.The best story in the book is ‘The Covenant’, in which two misanthropic girls decide to to make a ‘sacrifice’ together; it’s alive with well-developed characters, an original plot and a vivid sense of cynicism. I really liked ‘Softly, As In a Morning Sunrise’ too: a proper sci-fi story about a crew scouring a planet for strange animals, it has the most solid plot and is also really funny. ‘Hey, It’s a Love Psychedelic!’ combines strong cultural context with an intriguing time-travel twist, although it ends abruptly (a repeating problem). I loved the atmosphere in ‘Memory of Water’ – its sense of despair, details like the 3D art experience; it felt closest to what I was expecting from the stories in this collection.I initially thought ‘My Guy’ was an odd choice to open the book. Although it begins promisingly, and the narrator’s voice is immediately distinct, the narrative is choppy and difficult to follow. But perhaps it’s an appropriate first story after all – emblematic of the problems the weaker stories share. ‘I’ll Never Forget’, for example, is a sequel to the story ‘Forgotten’ from Terminal Boredom, but is far less successful; disjointed in a way that makes its events confusing.A trio of stories – ‘Full of Malice’, ‘After Everything’ and ‘The Walker’ – seem to be connected, sharing a common thread about a woman searching for her younger brother. They also operate according to a kind of dream-logic where absurd incidents pass without comment, reminding me of Leonora Carrington’s surrealist fiction. ‘The Walker’ is relatively strong as a strange, brief standalone story. ‘Full of Malice’, apparently one of the author’s earliest works, is very short yet still lacks clarity, and could have been left out (if not, I suppose, for its connection to the others).I enjoyed this new selection... but some of the stories in Hit Parade of Tears made me wonder whether those in Terminal Boredom represented the absolute apex of the author’s work, with the remainder inevitably being less impressive. There is no doubt that Terminal Boredom is the superior collection. If you haven’t read Izumi Suzuki before, start there.I received an advance  copy of Hit Parade of Tears from the publisher through NetGalley....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Jan 13, 2023","Jan 15, 2023","Dec 06, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/64391827-hit-parade-of-tears

But an anthology lives and dies by its curation, and unfortunately, the quality of stories here varies wildly. Pick of the bunch is Ally Wilkes’ wonderfully atmospheric and sinister ‘Summons’, a masterclass in building tension. It’s closely followed by Robert Levy’s ‘This Video is Unavailable’, an oral history of a maybe-haunted YouTuber and fandom gone sour, which is smart, entertaining and made me want to read more of the author’s work. The best stories in Found make use of ‘found footage’ as a format as well as a theme: the plausible forum discussions in ‘A Grave Issue’ by Bev Vincent; the effective video descriptions in ‘Ghost Town Adventures’ by Joe Butler; the mixed-media approach of ‘Disappearances at Coal Hill’ by Nick Kolakowski; co-editor Andrew Cull’s clever faux-intro ‘11/7/19’. I enjoyed some of the unsettling details in ‘The Novak Roadhouse Massacre’ by Alan Baxter and ‘Face Down Death Volume VIII’ by Josh Rountree, too.

The story wastes absolutely no time getting going, with the characters and elaborate premise set out swiftly. Would-be writer Alex is among the group of young women – another being her icy ex-best friend, Wren – who win places at an exclusive writing retreat, organised by reclusive horror author Roza Vallo and hosted at her isolated castle-like mansion. Almost as quickly, we find out the retreat is in fact a high-stakes competition. From there, the plot is best described as a demented rollercoaster that’s equal parts creepy, horny and zany.

Reading it as the weather seemed to suddenly change – heavy fog rolling in; the temperature dropping below zero for the first time this winter – it felt as though I had conjured the book’s atmosphere into reality.The Bed I Made is about a woman escaping an abusive relationship and hiding out on the Isle of Wight – a place she remembers fondly from childhood holidays, but a location chosen just as much for its isolation (particularly in winter). The narrative switches between recollections of her past and the new life she builds on the Island: a job in a cafe, a newfound love for sailing, tentative friendships with a few locals. At times, it’s tense – Kate lives in fear of being found by her ex, and she is also drawn into the drama surrounding a missing woman whose empty boat is found shortly after her arrival. But what I love most about the book is the writing, particularly the descriptions of landscape and solitude, and how they intersect.Reading it again made me wonder when commercial fiction stopped being like this; when the prose stopped being this good? Or is this book just an anomaly? Or am I looking in the wrong places for the 2022 equivalent? It would be a stretch to call The Bed I Made literary fiction, but the writing is sublime, the description leisurely, the scene-setting slow and generous. The book is filled with the sort of rich descriptions of solitude that are one of my favourite things in literature. I read another genre novel around the same time I reread this, and in terms of style the other book honestly seemed abysmal in comparison.In the second half of the story, things change for Kate, and I remembered disliking certain developments, feeling they took up too much space. Revisiting it, that isn’t the case at all. I’d clearly exaggerated this stuff in my memory; most of it doesn’t even come into play until the last few chapters. The climactic scenes are swift, and the epilogue perhaps tries to wrap up too many significant events in a small amount of space, but that doesn’t really put a dent in the effectiveness of the rest.Original  (August 2010): Lucie Whitehouse has done it again. Her brilliant debut, The House at Midnight, was one of the few books I have read from start to finish within one day. This riveting second novel lasted just a few days, and in the end I stayed up all night to finish it. There is just so much to love about Whitehouse's writing. Much like Jo in The House at Midnight, Kate is the perfect narrator – immediately likeable and absolutely human, you truly care about and believe in what happens to her. The minor characters (Chris in particular) are similarly believable and charming, and the dialogue, which flows like real speech, is a joy to read. I particularly loved the sections describing Kate's first week on the Island, which convey both the loneliness and the romance of her isolated experience perfectly. I've never been to the Isle of Wight, but I was left with vivid mental pictures of the characters' surroundings. The whole book is suffused with subtle tension, the flashbacks to Kate's relationship with Richard brimming with foreboding and suspense. I wasn't a big fan of the developments in the second half, and I would have chosen a different type of ending, but despite all that, this is a fantastic novel.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Nov 20, 2022","Nov 21, 2022","Nov 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7575266-the-bed-i-made

I’m generally not a big fan of fiction about real people, but this story – about the writer William Somerset Maugham staying with an English couple in 1920s Penang – is gorgeously written and gently absorbing. The plot incorporates the character of Sun Yat Sen, a real-life Chinese revolutionary, as well as an infamous murder and trial (which, in turn, was also fictionalised by Maugham!), that of Ethel Proudlock.

What do you do with a book you actively disliked a lot of the time but couldn’t tear yourself away from? At first I was just hate-reading it – the narrative voice irritated me from the first. Aaron Decker’s pompous self-importance and weirdly archaic turns of phrase would be bad enough on their own, but then there’s his infuriating habit of repeating his dead wife Allison’s name in practically every single paragraph, even though we know from the beginning that the story is addressed to her; that she is the ‘you’ in this narrative. With the possible exception of the final chapter, this approach just doesn’t work. There’d be no need for Aaron to tell Allison, in detail, what he got her for their last Christmas together (to give just one example) because... she’d know what the gift was. Etc, etc. Then again, who knows what’s going on when a line like ‘I think it’s time we reign this in’ makes it into the finished book? (Yes, I’m complaining about subpar editing yet again.)Also, hardly the book or author’s fault but despite widely being described as such, this is not horror. At all.BUT THEN. The plot got its hooks into me, and I was sucked in, and in spite of my frustration, I just couldn’t abandon the book without knowing how it would all be resolved.It’s impossible not to soften towards the story, for all its flaws, when you reach the concluding author’s note. The subtle, haunting notes of grief threaded through the story are elegant and clearly written with tenderness. And there are extremely compelling segments, almost all of them related to Allison’s secret obsession and Aaron’s later investigation of it. However, I remain unconvinced that the author’s overall style/approach is one I could ever truly enjoy.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 18, 2022","Nov 22, 2022","Nov 06, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58590086-come-with-me

Alice Slater has written a novel that sinks in its teeth and refuses to let go; I buzzed for days after finishing it.Roach has worked at a beleaguered branch of Spines, a chain of bookshops, since she was a teenager. Solitary and obsessed with true crime (specifically the killers rather than the victims, whose stories she generally finds boring), Roach scoffs at ‘normies’ and spends much of her time listening to podcasts about famous murders. When a new team are brought in to reverse the shop’s fortunes, she meets a very different type of bookseller: the wholesome, stylish, friendly Laura. Fixating on the fact that Laura also reads about serial killers and writes poetry with dark themes, Roach starts fantasising about a friendship. But the two women’s clashing views about the ethics surrounding true crime turn Laura against her... something Roach is very reluctant to accept.The narrative switches between the perspectives of the two main characters – a surprise to me, as from the blurb I’d assumed Roach would tell the whole story. At first, I was sceptical: could Laura’s viewpoint possibly be as interesting as Roach’s cynical, scathing voice? Would the story become lopsided? But Laura’s chapters bring a depth and complexity to her character that ultimately unlocks the power of the story.Sometimes Roach sounds like such an insufferable not-like-other-girls, sometimes Laura sounds like a tryhard London literary type – there are points where both of them will make you roll your eyes. Yet as dark as Roach’s story gets, it’s hard not to extend compassion to her, because the narrative is always extending compassion to her too. It’s the same thing with Laura: she’s often an absolute mess, and we see how her behaviour parallels Roach’s in ways she’d no doubt be reluctant to admit – but we get why. If at first it seems clear that Roach is the dark and Laura the light, somewhere along the line both characters are painted such similar shades of grey that they blend and bleed into each other.Something I also want to mention, that might easily get lost amid the irresistible momentum of the plot, is the power of the settings. I particularly loved Roach and Laura’s workplace, the bookshop itself. I could truly feel the atmosphere of the place: both cosy and decrepit. The story unfolds in the run-up to Christmas, and the writing absolutely nails the magic and the horror of being wrapped up in non-stop work at that time of year. (It’s also so good on the specifics of working in retail that it unlocked memories I hadn’t thought about for over a decade.)My literary recipe for Death of a Bookseller would involve: the razor-sharp character studies and themes of obsession and envy in Looker and Kiss Me First; the heady atmosphere of The Poison Tree; the deliciously nasty underbelly of Boy Parts and Eileen; and the spiralling, unstable mood of Animals or Problems – especially as the story reaches its climax and the protagonists seem bound for disaster.This is, naturally, a bookseller’s book. But it’s also for anyone who considers themselves a reader; likes true crime; anyone who hates it, or is disdainful towards it; anyone who has ever worked in a shop, or in customer service. And it’s also stealthily a book about grief. Like its characters, Death of a Bookseller contains more layers and subtleties you might first assume. This is a thrilling story of obsession with a dark, sticky soul – and it’s also so much more.I received an advance  copy of Death of a Bookseller from the publisher, Hodder & Stoughton....more",Notes are private!,0,110,1,"Nov 07, 2022","Nov 09, 2022","Nov 06, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61344814-death-of-a-bookseller

Various locations are detailed in risibly clichéd and/or improbable terms (at one point Michael bribes the doorman at a London hotel with a ‘hundred-pound note’).

When I hate a book, it can be equally difficult: I don’t want to waste energy on articulating my issues with it properly. It’s often the books in the grey areas in between that I find myself with the most to say about. I had a lot of problems with I Have Some Questions For You, but I also recognise that the fact I’m compelled to articulate them, examine them, is a form of praise, because this means I really want to engage with the book. I wanted to like it more than I do, and the following ‘’ ought to be understood more as a series of notes in which I try to work through the reasons it didn’t work for me.The narrator, Bodie Kane, is a successful podcaster in her early forties. As a teenager, she attended a prestigious boarding school, Granby, where she felt like an outsider. In their senior year, her popular roommate Thalia was murdered. The supposed killer – Omar, a young man who worked at the school as an athletic trainer – was convicted quickly, but the evidence was flimsy and there’s always been speculation about his guilt. When Bodie is invited back to the school to teach a course, she becomes newly obsessed with the case; through adult eyes, she sees something suspicious in Thalia’s close relationship with a music teacher. One of Bodie’s students decides to make her own podcast about Thalia’s death, opening up even more questions. Meanwhile, Bodie’s semi-estranged husband is accused of coercive behaviour by a younger ex-girlfriend, and her (Bodie’s) married lover seems to be growing distant. (Yes, there’s quite a lot going on.)I was so looking forward to a version of the true-crime-podcast story from a writer as good as Rebecca Makkai, whose The Great Believers I adored, whose ‘The November Story’ is an all-time favourite. But I Have Some Questions For You is significantly undercooked as a thriller, and too overwhelmed by plot for it to be satisfying at the character development level. What it is, more than anything, is a #MeToo novel – a concept that seems baffling, dead in the water, in 2022, particularly after books like My Dark Vanessa and True Story have tackled similar subject matter so successfully.There’s some value, I guess, in telling this type of story from the perspective of a watchful outsider, a person detached from the true harm, but frustratingly, the most interesting points thrown up by that are just not explored. There’s this moment where a woman, one of her former classmates, tells Bodie she was ‘safe’ from creepy adult men as a teen, with the obvious implication being that she (the younger Bodie) was too unattractive to be a target for them. And THAT’S interesting – both the idea itself, which is surely worth further discussion, and also the way this woman, who was a victim herself, so blithely throws it out there, assuming she’s right. Yet Bodie barely examines it!Similarly, we’re shown how Bodie’s continuing attachment to her ‘outsider’ status leads her to place too much emphasis on what she endured at school – some bullying and mockery which, sure, is horrible, but hardly in the same league as being groomed by an abuser – while completely dismissing her husband’s accuser. The book never really gets into the hypocrisy of this. It’s like... we’re meant to see the irony, but nothing is done with it. Is this the whole point? That Bodie is a vulture, exploding the Thalia case to centre herself while ignoring situations in which she could truly make a positive impact? Certainly, the way Omar’s perspective is filtered through Bodie’s feels patronising. Almost the only way I can read the book favourably is to see Bodie as a (the?) villain, and though I’m sure she’s deliberately flawed, I doubt that’s the intention.Bodie’s ruminations on how girls are conditioned to accept exploitation are not without merit, but they aren’t particularly fresh or interesting. My Dark Vanessa is so much more visceral; True Story achieves a more thought-provoking effect by varying its perspective and digging into how these stories get told; Death of a Bookseller and the Six Stories books engage more productively with questions around the ethics of true crime. Here, every seemingly intriguing idea is flattened into a hackneyed ‘There Is A Lot Of Misogyny’ message achieved through methods like the recital of a litany of faceless/nameless victims alongside details of what happened to them (a device I really cannot stand), or the anodyne horror of an adult woman realising that yes, a teacher sleeping with teenagers is Bad (who would have thought!!)A lot of my problems with this book boil down to the fact that it feels like it is trying to Say Something, and what it is trying to Say is so stale, and – I realise this is completely unfair – what I wanted from Makkai was another meaty literary novel with some expansive subplot that shouldn’t be fascinating but is, like the art bequest thing in The Great Believers. There is a real art to writing a compelling crime/thriller narrative, and this is never more apparent than when a talented author of literary fiction doesn’t quite pull it off.

Iain Rowan’s stories create an atmosphere of desolation and unreality, with a grounding in the domestic uncanny, that reminded me of Joel Lane and Sam Thompson. I loved ‘The Call’, the wonderfully atmospheric story of a widower who moves to a run-down seaside town and forges a brief connection with a neighbour. ‘Through the Window’ is a superb example of the collection’s strengths, being both a fantastic portrait of its main character, Parker, and a quiet, unsettling account of a deceptively nondescript house. There are shades of Daphne du Maurier to ‘Driving in Circles’, in which a quarrelling couple are lost en route to a weekend away, the title neatly summarising both the journey and their relationship. ‘The Circular Path’, too, is cleverly named; it’s about a man who finds an inexplicable childhood encounter coming back to haunt him – or was it always a haunting?A couple of stories appear to be set in imagined worlds: ‘Here Comes the New Way’, wherein proponents of an enigmatic ideology explode in flames once they reach the apotheosis of their faith, feels like it pairs naturally with opening story ‘Lilies’, about mysterious assassins seeking to end the custom of dead people briefly resurrecting. (Both stories involve fanatics who refer to their beliefs as ‘the new way’, for one thing. ‘Lilies’ in particular recalls the vague and horrible dystopia of Kay Dick’s They: ‘Soon the war will be over and it will all be like this.’) Yet we also see how the personal or emotional overlaps and blurs with the corporeal. The collection concludes with the appropriately chilly ‘Ice Age’, in which a man’s perpetual coldness may – or may not – be a product of his consuming sadness.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 09, 2022","Nov 10, 2022","Oct 25, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11928012-ice-age

I was surprised by how different this is from the author’s debut, the excellent Professor Everywhere; it’s significantly more high-octane and much more ambitious in scope, with forays into horror territory that lean towards the bloody.Physicist Harold Tunmore is missing for almost 30 years before his brother discovers him living, anonymously, in a psychiatric hospital. His story is told via a cache of letters written by Harold to his niece. These chart a mission he claims to have been a part of: in 1991, he was (so he says) one of a group put together to scale and research an immense mountain that materialised out of nowhere in the middle of the ocean. It’s a place where people are not themselves and time appears altered – and the further the team go, the weirder things get. Ascension is packed with dramatic scenes and eerie dialogue that give it a particularly cinematic feel. I especially loved how Binge developed the character of Jet (who gets all the best lines). Yet it also has room for contemplative, even philosophical moments and a solid backstory for Harold.

I think that’s a pretty good hit rate for an anthology! I won’t say exactly which is which – these things are subjective, after all – but my personal favourite was ‘The Lovers’ by Lynda E.

Elsewhere there are excellent stories from Malcolm Devlin (‘The Chariot’, a slice of sheer unease set in that quintessential liminal space, a hotel); Dan Coxon (‘The High Priestess’, a dark domestic tale which shades into religious folk horror); and Gary Budden (‘Temperance’, about a man at a crossroads in his life who glimpses what he comes to call ‘the Enfield angel’).

Like her excellent debut Looker, this is a sharp, nuanced character study about identity and obsession – but here, the stakes are altogether higher.At the Carlyle Public Library, two women are not quite what they seem. Margo, who’s been a circulation clerk for two years, has a dark past, one that Sims wastes no time revealing to us. Her new colleague Patricia – a younger, more glamorous reference librarian – has somewhat bitterly given up her preferred career as a writer, having failed to sell her novel. Each woman senses something unaccountably intriguing in the other. Soon they are locked in a strange dance, trying to pry information from one another. Margo attempts to hide her true self, her mask slipping with increasing regularity; Patricia finds a new muse in her prickly coworker, and begins writing again. But this uneasy dynamic can’t last forever.At points in the book, Margo and Patricia both find themselves transported by reading or writing – Margo with Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle (a book she, a non-reader, is drawn to because of Patricia’s love for it), and Patricia with her own manuscript (a fictionalised account of Margo’s life that is more true than she can know). I felt similarly enthralled by How Can I Help You, any thoughts of my own totally erased by the story. Margo in particular is a superb creation: repellent yet, in the oddest of ways, sympathetic; a villain with thrilling layers. Patricia’s fascination with her is entirely understandable. The community of the library is so well realised, too: the familiar patrons, the other staff with their own difficult relationships. These background characters contribute much to our understanding of the world Margo and Patricia inhabit.If you loved Death of a Bookseller then this should be at the top of your wishlist; the energy between Margo and Patricia also reminded me of Eileen. It’s an utterly propulsive feat of literary suspense: gripping, complex, and unpredictable to the last (I thought I’d guessed how it would all end – and I was completely wrong).I received an advance  copy of How Can I Help You from the publisher through Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Jun 18, 2023","Jun 19, 2023","Sep 29, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63062386-how-can-i-help-you

Lambert’s books always seem to be something entirely new, something different to the rest of his work; this has little in common with the others of his I’ve read (The Children’s Home and Two Dark Tales), except a certain macabre edge. It tells the story of naive Edward, a young man whose first relationship with a low-born flower seller turns out to haunt him in a rather literal sense.

The author sets out his stall with the first sentence of the book proper: ‘The first thing to proclaim is: the absolute impossibility of summing up Fassbinder.’ (Despite that, he does find a neat way of collectively describing Fassbinder’s thematically and aesthetically diverse output: ‘malign fairytales for jaded adults’.) Thousands of Mirrors is not supposed to be comprehensive – while a few of Fassbinder’s films are discussed in some detail, others have only a brief paragraph devoted to them, and Penman is most interested in personal aspects, in puzzling out why exactly Fassbinder became so significant in his own life. Mulling over the effect of the whole piece, I feel both Fassbinder and Penman remain somewhat obscure to me, but I don’t find that to be a problem.

A Box Full of Darkness is a collection of four short stories, each quite different from the others but all filled with both deep strangeness and profound humanity. It opens with the stunning title story, a tale of voids in one’s memory, solitary wandering, the random nature of what we remember most, and a man with a ‘casual atrocity bag’. ‘Violent Men, Lonely Men’ is an epic in a nutshell, a story that tells of a woman’s whole life and the shadow cast over it by a) growing up in a ‘murder house’ and b) more importantly, her volatile father. It’s incredibly hard to pick a favourite from the book, but I think ‘Perfidious Albion’ might have to be it – it’s a lost media story, about a mythic Play for Today, and it’s also about mental illness, grief, a cult-like organisation, real magic and a whole load of other chewy subjects. God, it’s good.I stumbled over the third story, ‘Lost and Found’: its not so much that I disliked it, rather that I couldn’t get a handle on it for whatever reason; couldn’t figure out what the focus of it was supposed to be, couldn’t reconcile the timeline or make anything about the characters line up properly. As sometimes happens, me and the story just did not gel. If not for that, the book would certainly be an easy five stars for me. Avery’s fiction is compelling as hell, and he’s got a great knack for writing about the vaguely uncanny, the weird-in-the-ordinary, but more than that his work contains a deep understanding of loneliness and the different types of human connection that offer a route out of it. The last time I felt this excited to discover a writer, it was Nina Allan, and I don’t make that comparison lightly.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Dec 02, 2022","Dec 03, 2022","Sep 13, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/62536492-a-box-full-of-darkness

More in the vein of The Appeal than The Twyford Code, this is another irresistibly page-turning mystery, this time following true crime author Amanda Bailey as she attempts to revive her career with a book about a cold case. The ‘Alperton Angels’ were a tiny cult in the early 2000s; after several members died, their manipulative leader was given a life sentence. Amanda’s new angle is to track down a baby rescued from the group – the child will now be 18, and an exclusive interview would launch her book with a splash. But her search runs into so many baffling dead ends that it seems a conspiracy is afoot...What ensues is told as a patchwork of text messages, emails, transcriptions, extracts from books and scripts, etc. This is a format I simply never get tired of; it’s as moreish as a box of chocolates, and it allows for the narrative to be funny and irreverent as well as gripping. And in the end, The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels is a story about deception, resentment and professional rivalry as much as it is a crime novel. It relies not so much on plot twists but on shifting the reader’s perception of what the story is really about. Oh, and there’s also a very entertaining creepy/quasi-supernatural element thanks to the unexplained events surrounding the cult.

The situation is more complex than it first appears: Frank holds a variety of esoteric beliefs about a secret ‘supersoldier’ programme and a incipient war between aliens and humans; the friends are people he knows from a forum dedicated to discussing these ideas. Dismissed by the police, his girlfriend Rachel enlists the help of Robin, a private detective. By bizarre coincidence (or something else?), Robin shares a particular interest with Frank – an obsessive passion for the music of J.S. Bach. Compelled by both Frank’s story and her attraction to Rachel, Robin starts investigating, but the more she follows clues, the stranger the trail becomes.Conquest is a story about many things: conspiracy theories, mental illness, the similarities between music and code, obsession, ambition (and apathy), love, legacy, belief; how information is corrosive, like acid – once you touch it, you’re changed by it, and how choosing not to believe in something you know to be true is an act of self-destruction. It shows how the lines between faith and doubt, between reasonable scepticism and fervid delusion, are thinner and more tenuous than we tend to believe; it shows what happens when someone falls into the cracks. It’s told from a number of perspectives – Robin and Rachel and Frank, but also an essay by one of Frank’s forum friends, a concert  by another, documents that illuminate both the characters’ individual stories and the broader themes of the novel.At the heart of everything (including the book itself) is ‘The Tower’ by John C. Sylvester, an obscure 1950s sci-fi story which becomes one of Frank’s obsessions, a ‘sacred text’. It tells of a pioneering architect, a character like something out of Ayn Rand, who builds a vast, monumental tower out of an alien rock, only to discover it is both alive and contagious. Ultimately, the story seems a possible key to both Frank’s disappearance and his beliefs. ‘The Tower’ is a marvel in its own right, an unsettling tale that simmers with strange possibilities.Conquest combines the speculative elements and missing-person angle of The Rift with the ‘fractured novel’ approach of the author’s earlier books and the detailed investigation central to The Good Neighbours. It’s strongly reminiscent of the haunting novella Maggots, my favourite of her shorter works, and also made me think of the short stories ‘The Silver Wind’ and ‘A Princess of Mars’. (As ever with Allan’s writing, I’m not sure whether I’m making connections that aren’t really there. But this – the connections, the not-knowing – is part of the pleasure of reading her work, and feels particularly appropriate for a book so much about hidden links and obscure connotations.)As soon as I finished Conquest, I wanted to read it again. It’s a towering achievement (pun only slightly intended): a deeply complex and layered work of speculative fiction that rewards (and deserves) close reading yet is also incredibly enjoyable. I’ve tried to cover some of its ideas in this , but the truth is that Conquest can’t be summarised neatly because it is about everything, about life. I have no doubt that when I revisit it, I will find completely different meanings and mysteries in the text.I received an advance  copy of Conquest from the publisher through NetGalley....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Nov 24, 2022","Nov 26, 2022","Sep 11, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62358270-conquest

She’s a college dropout with a terrible job, a mess of a life and an arsenal of questionable coping strategies. One of them is a definitely-unhealthy, apparently random obsession with a coworker, Kurt, who she’s essentially stalking. Another is her tendency to retreat to the mental safe room of her ‘kitchen-door world’, an imagined universe based on her favourite children’s book. When Kurt suddenly vanishes – leaving a cryptic note that seems meant for Katrina – things spiral even further.This is a cosy book. At the same time, it gets horribly real about the nature and effects of its protagonist’s mental health problems. (Going into detail about my own issues/diagnoses in a Goodreads  is not something I have any interest in doing at this point in my life, but I can confidently say Maria Dong’s portrayal of Katrina and her obsessions is extremely accurate, and I enjoyed and appreciated it a lot.) The writing is sometimes awkward, sometimes brilliant, and it suits the character perfectly – it feels like this is Katrina’s voice rather than a novel. It’s difficult to explain just how much I loved reading about her fascination with Kurt and her hunt for clues to his disappearance.The story is always shifting and transforming. I felt like I was constantly being kept on my toes not just about where the plot was going, but about the nature of the book. Is it a conspiracy thriller, an ‘unhinged woman’ narrative, a story about a fractured family coming back together? It’s all three and more – a glorious Technicolor starburst of a novel. The closest comparisons I can think of are Catie Disabato’s The Ghost Network and the stories in Elizabeth Tan’s Rubik and Smart Ovens for Lonely People.

This person writes exactly the way I like, and exactly the kind of fiction I crave, and I want to read everything of theirs I can get my hands on. That’s what happened with The Teardrop Method, a quietly haunting speculative novella, accompanied in this edition by an equally spellbinding short story.In the title novella, Krisztina, a musician, hears the songs of people’s souls. She follows them around wintry Budapest, and in doing so realises someone – a man in a strange mask – is following her. This is a story that’s both disconcerting and beautiful, suffused with melancholy. It contains wonderful evocation of music: its sound and power. The atmosphere is perfect, the setting palpable, and there’s a terrifying/tragic villain, and even a story within a story. But, as Krisztina mourns her late partner and reconnects with her father, it also has that grounding in reality and human connection which I think is essential to good uncanny fiction.In the linked story ‘Going Back to the World’, we’re with Susanna as she returns to the house she once shared with her ex, Dave, after his suicide. (Dave appears, sort of, in The Teardrop Method; he’s a music journalist who interviews both Krisztina and her father.) There’s arguably a stronger flavour of horror to this story – it’s certainly quite a bit creepier – but it retains the humanity of The Teardrop Method, as well as that sense of quietness that is, somehow, both unnerving and comforting.This book positions Avery as an obvious heir to Joel Lane – at times I felt I was reading a Lane story. And to be clear, I don’t think Avery is copying Lane’s style at all, more that they both have the same – rare – ability to capture and pin down an ethereal, unsettling mood.

A grimy, uncomfortable portrait of girlhood replete with challenging imagery, it’s often arresting but ultimately too fragmented to leave much of an impression.The narrator (known by the distinctive nickname Shit) and her best friend Isora grow up on the island of Tenerife during the 90s; specifically, this story is set during the summer they’re ten years old. Their little world seems, or at least it seemed to me, shockingly permissive and quite brutal, but they’re also just typically disgusting kids. As such, there’s a lot of vivid depictions of offputting things – obsessive masturbation to the point of self-injury, very detailed descriptions of vomiting and shitting, animal abuse – and sometimes I had to look away from the page.The crux of the story is Shit’s nascent sexual awakening as she grows increasingly obsessed with Isora. It’s told in vignettes, though, and some of them feel disconnected from the rest. Various scenes of family life add colour to Abreu’s portrait of the girls’ community, but do little to advance the plot and rather rather numb the effect of the climactic event. It’s a book of distinct moments rather than a memorable whole.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Sep 04, 2022","Sep 04, 2022","Aug 24, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61197762-dogs-of-summer

So when her family move tLotti Coates is the eldest daughter of an acclaimed painter and his beautiful muse; she’s accustomed to glamour and success. So when her family move to Canberra and she starts attending a new school, she’s determined to be one of the in-crowd – a plan that’s jeopardised when her parents allow her classmate Kyla Tyler, a notoriously strange and unpopular girl, to stay at their house. Lotti hates Kyla, whose odd looks and coarse manners horrify her. Yet as time goes on (and to Lotti’s disgust), Kyla seems to become increasingly entangled with the Coates. In the present day, the adult Lotti, now a doctor, returns to Canberra and – with a retrospective of her father’s work due to open – is forced to reckon with memories of those years.Initially, I couldn’t help but compare We Were Never Friends to Emily Bitto’s The Strays, another Australian novel which features many similar plot points: an artistic family with three children taking in a disadvantaged girl; an unequal, obsessive friendship; complicated family dynamics and emotional neglect; a narrative structure that involves an adult reflecting on their childhood. But after a while, Bearman’s book pulls way ahead of Bitto’s. The writing is brilliant at the sentence level, and those crisp sentences illuminate Lotti’s world with startling colour – the settings are vividly portrayed, as is the emotional landscape of adolescence. I thought at first this would be an easy read, and while I certainly got through it quickly (I couldn’t put it down in the second half), it’s much bolder than I had imagined. Whenever I thought I knew where the story was going, it did something even more daring.I would have liked to know a bit more about present-day Lotti, whose concerns aren’t fully elucidated. I also found it slightly jarring that past-Lotti and friends are pre-teens – a lot of their experiences, along with their language, feel too ‘old’ for girls who have just left primary school – but that’s probably a lack of similarity with my own experience more than anything else.

In 1952, young siblings Charlie and Joyce Savigear have just been released from borstal; they join a rural architectural practice, Leventree, as apprentices. Leventree is the idea of architects Arthur and Florence Mayhood, inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin as well as Arthur’s redemption after his own youthful period of incarceration. At first, all seems well. But soon Joyce is dragged into a criminal scheme by an old acquaintance, threatening the tenuous peace of this makeshift family.The Young Accomplice has echoes of the author’s previous work: the setup, with troubled young people arriving at a kind of artistic refuge, reminded me of The Ecliptic; the malevolent influence of (the aptly named) Mal recalls Francis from Station. I know Wood can write ruthlessly, but that isn’t really on display in this relatively slow-paced novel – for example, there’s a section about how the Mayhoods fell in love that doesn’t seem fully relevant, and could have been cut without the story losing anything. Instead, this is a book concerned more with quiet emotion than suspense (though there are certainly moments of the latter). It sometimes steers away from moments of potential turmoil to focus on what the characters are thinking. The writing is always beautiful. It’s unlikely I would have picked this up if it wasn’t by Wood, and I’m glad I did – its unhurried grace felt like a literary palate cleanser.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Aug 08, 2022","Aug 10, 2022","Jul 31, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59010635-the-young-accomplice

It’s the early 90s, and despite Lu’s poverty she’s still able to keep a space in a massive (albeit freezing and rat-infested) Brooklyn loft, where she and numerous other artists are basically squatting. She’s 400 days into a self-portrait project when she takes a once-in-a-lifetime photograph: an image of herself jumping, in which an unfocused shape, seen through the window, appears to perfectly balance the composition. But the shape is in fact the blurred form of Max, her upstairs neighbours’ nine-year-old son, falling to his death from the top of the building. As Lu becomes increasingly convinced the image is a masterpiece that could launch her career, she also grows close to Kate, Max’s mother. Lu is close to starving, desperate to exhibit the photo and equally desperate not to lose Kate. Add in her conviction that Max’s ghost is haunting her apartment, and it seems clear Lu is heading for either a breakdown or a breakthrough. Maybe both.Self-Portrait with Boy seemed perfect for me: an art novel with a moral dilemma at its heart, usually a reliably gripping combination. It’s a little quieter than I was expecting, albeit well-written. Lu is a conundrum: she can be unpleasantly selfish, seeing her father (who raised her alone) mostly as an inconvenience or embarrassment; yet she’s too inert, not ruthless enough, to be a juicy antiheroine. All in all Lu is quite a blurry character, perhaps exactly what people mean when they talk about ‘morally grey’. I think her arc could have gone in a slightly more interesting direction, but there are some good details here – I liked that Lu is genuinely poor; characters in these sort of stories so often have rich parents who can swoop in at a convenient juncture – and while I’ve got no way of knowing whether it’s accurate, the book brings early-90s Brooklyn to life vividly.

The Parson wasn’t published until after Kavan’s death, but is estimated to have been written at some point between the late 1950s and early 60s, which places it after Sleep Has His House but before the success of Ice. It’s about the relationship between a young lieutenant, nicknamed ‘the Parson’ for his pious bearing, and Rejane, an initially charming woman whose beauty and refinement conceals her scheming nature. The plot hinges on their visit to a ruined castle, where Rejane’s true nature becomes clear. These scenes are deliciously melodramatic and full of portent: ‘an aura of sadism and terror clung to the walls’... Much has been made of how The Parson prefigures Ice; I’ll be honest, I didn’t really get that from it, but I liked it a lot.

One can assume many details of the plot, in which Bret parties with his similarly wealthy friends and struggles with his sexuality and episodes of existential dread, are true to life – but the book diverges from reality when it introduces a serial killer, ‘The Trawler’, who seems somehow connected to Bret’s magnetic new classmate Robert Mallory. I understand the story was originally serialised on the author’s podcast, and it bears the hallmarks of that – it rambles on and on, various pieces of information and characterisation are repeated – but the overall effect is somehow hypnotic. There’s some brilliant writing about nostalgia for youth. The reader is completely immersed in this glossy 80s milieu, complete with detailed settings and enough mentions of specific songs to make a lengthy soundtrack playlist if you want.

It should be the polar opposite of the last Junji Ito book I read, Deserter, which collected stories from earlier in his career – but in fact they feel like two sides of the same coin, in the sense that neither represent the artist/author’s strongest work. The Liminal Zone also feels comparatively slight, with just four stories. ‘Weeping Woman Way’ follows a couple whose lives are transformed after they visit a village which continues the tradition of employing professional mourners at funerals. ‘Madonna’ is set at a religious boarding school for girls, where the principal’s wife takes a disturbing interest in a new student. In ‘Slumber’, aspiring lawyer Takuya becomes convinced he’s murdering people in his sleep. My favourite of the four was ‘The Spirit Flow of Aokigahara’, which features a terminally ill young man and his girlfriend visiting Aokigahara – the famous ‘suicide forest’ – with the intention of dying together. But instead they find a mysterious ‘spirit flow’. The changes wrought by this power are genuinely creepy, epitomising the body horror and general sense of squeamishness Junji Ito’s work is famous for.It’s difficult to fault the art – there are some striking illustrations in here, most notably in ‘Slumber’, where the simplicity of the plot fits well with stark black-and-white imagery. But I wasn’t thrilled or disturbed by anything except the effects of the spirits in ‘The Spirit Flow of Aokigahara’, and that detail was the only thing I remembered clearly after finishing the book.

This is a collect(4.5) Isn’t it amazing when you buy a book on a whim and it turns out to be exactly the sort of thing you’re always longing to read? This is a collection of linked stories (good) and encompasses a dazzling range of genres that might best be collectively summed up as speculative litfic (even better). It revolves around a man called Prentis O’Rourke: his death, we learn, is significant in that it occurs simultaneously in every possible version of reality. This is all observed and catalogued by a multiple-existence-monitoring agency called The Landry Institute. Some of the stories in Unexpected Places feature versions of Prentis, along with his partner Laura and daughter Carrie. But others focus on characters with only tangential connections to the central figure.The stories speak the language of science fiction: there’s time travel, synthetic bodies and possible cloning. There’s also a more indefinite strangeness always creeping around the edges: urban ghost stories, deserted places wreathed in mysterious mist... even a potentially immortal dog. At the same time, it wouldn’t be inaccurate to describe this book chiefly as hugely empathetic literary fiction. Unexpected Places would, I think, particularly appeal to anyone who loved Keith Ridgway’s Hawthorn & Child or Daniel Kehlmann’s Fame.The three-part story ‘Walking to Doggerland’, which forms the backbone of the book, centres on Penny, one of three daughters of the Landry Institute’s founder, and is about what happens when the very different siblings reunite in a house where they used to spend summer holidays. It’s just perfect. Subtly weird and totally unpredictable, but very human. I have said this before about Malcolm Devlin’s writing, but his best stories are full of the sort of details so original I can’t really understand how someone could just make them up. ‘Walking to Doggerland’ is the closest thing to a Nina Allan story that isn’t a Nina Allan story – and that is one of the highest forms of praise I could give.‘Five Conversations With My Daughter (Who Travels in Time)’, another standout, is narrated by Prentis himself. It takes place in a reality where six-year-old Carrie can, occasionally and momentarily, allow an older version of herself to occupy her body and talk to her father about the future. Again, to my mind this story really plays to the collection’s strengths – it has this pure SF concept at its heart, but its real power lies in a believable and sensitive depiction of family relationships.That’s also a strength of ‘My Uncle Eff’, in which Laura remembers her eccentric, itinerant uncle and the stories he told her. It’s a story about storytelling, and memory and landscape; it captures precisely the way stories can speak to you as a child, and how you understand them differently from an adult perspective.‘The New Man’ is straight out of the Alexander Weinstein playbook of character-driven near-future sci-fi. After an accident, a man’s consciousness is placed in a ‘basic model’ synthetic body that looks nothing like his old self; his family struggle to readjust. The fantastic and the ordinary are juxtaposed superbly here.Meanwhile, ‘The Knowledge’, told in taxi journeys around London – with dark & bloody undercurrents – would slot right into Gary Budden’s London Incognita. ‘We Can Walk It Off in the Morning’ follows two friends who are cheating on their respective partners with each other. It’s not a ghost story, but it feels like one. The same characters appear again in ‘Talking to Strangers on Planes’, a story cleverly told backwards – though whether we’re meeting the same versions of Aleyna and Jack, it’s impossible to know.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jun 29, 2022","Jun 30, 2022","Jun 26, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61081789-unexpected-places-to-fall-from-unexpected-places-to-land

Tiffany says early on that ‘this is not actually a book about One Direction’, but if you’re not a fan of them, it certainly feels like it is. After finishing the book and scanning through s, I noticed it’s already been criticised a lot for this, so I feel the need to point out that I don’t think it’s a bad thing! Concentrating on a single fandom gives a clear focus to a study that could otherwise become too sprawling to be confined to a short, neatly segmented analysis, and it makes sense for the author to write about something that a) was personally significant to her and b) she knows a lot about. (It’s also written well, in a style that captures the insularity – and bizarro humour – of the fan community while remaining understandable to outsiders.) The analysis of fandom more broadly can admittedly be a bit thin. What I think Tiffany does really well is to conjure up the magic of being a fan of something: how a song can make you feel ‘nineteen forever’, how observing and understanding the weird machinations of an online fandom can you create a sense of belonging even if you’re just watching from the sidelines. It got me thinking a lot about the cultural things I love – especially music – that feel like they’re part of my personal history, particularly the ones people laughed at me for liking, and how I love them even more now I’m older and they feel like a magic portal to youth.Also, an interviewee in this book says the most incredible thing: ‘I know there are things I like. I want to talk about them and go have a good time.

There are stories told through various types of art anThe Ghost Sequences is an immensely pleasurable collection thanks in large part to its variety. There are stories told through various types of art and media: extracts from letters and articles; scenes from movies; an art exhibition. There’s a story told in instructions. There are more traditional ghostly tales that have the ring of local legends to them. There are stories about stage magic, sea monsters, war trauma, a ghost-spotting app, a snuff film, a cursed play. At various points, these narratives reminded me of writers as different as Carmen Maria Machado, Vernon Lee, Nina Allan and Mariana Enríquez.I love what I often refer to as ‘mixed media’ stories – those purporting to consist of scraps of real-life information, slowly building a full picture – and there are lots of them here. ‘The Secret of Flight’ assembles the story of a family’s entanglement with a mysterious woman through press clippings, letters and dialogue from a play. ‘I Dress My Lover in Yellow’ is an account of two students’ disappearance by way of a ‘lost painting’ they were trying to investigate. The title of ‘Excerpts from a Film (1942–1987)’, about a director and his ill-fated muse, speaks for itself; ‘The Ghost Sequences’ describes an art display in which each exhibit is based on the artist’s own personal ghost story. ‘The Last Sailing of the “Henry Charles Morgan” in Six Pieces of Scrimshaw (1841)’ is a particularly ingenious example, telling the story of an unexplained shipwreck as it appears in scenes etched on material like whale baleen and walrus tusk. It uses the language a curator might, so that the narrative is presented in an unnerving factual style.The two best stories in The Ghost Sequences, however, are two of the most (seemingly) straightforward. Especially outstanding is ‘The Nag Bride’, which follows a woman who returns to her hometown after the death of her best friend’s grandparents. There, she’s reminded of a terrifying story she heard as a child. In ‘The Stories We Tell About Ghosts’, the 12-year-old narrator and his little brother Gen are pulled into an obsession with an app called Ghost Hunt! It’s supposed to be a game, but starts to seem worryingly real, especially to the sensitive and suggestible Gen. Both display a major strength of Wise’s storytelling: her ability to include just enough detail about the characters and their relationships, making them vividly real. These are stories that feel, in the best way, like you’ve already heard them somewhere, maybe at a sleepover or around a campfire.There are 16 stories in this book – perhaps a few too many? – and it has its weak moments. A few, e.g. ‘Crossing’, lean too far towards the whimsical and cutesy for my tastes. ‘Harvest Song, Gathering Song’ is about an Arctic military expedition and magical honey; while that might sound good, the combination of convoluted plot + far too many characters turns into a bit of a mess. But for every slight misstep there’s a brilliant idea, like ‘In the End, It Always Turns Out the Same’, which deals with the existential horror of being part of a crime-fighting detective squad – the TV-cartoon type where everyone is confined to an archetype and the ending always takes the same form.All in all, it’s a collection well worth reading. The best stories in here have buckets of atmosphere and already feel like classics in the making.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 29, 2022","Jul 31, 2022","Jun 12, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58848872-the-ghost-sequences

Every now and then I have a go at reading an epic fantasy novel in the hope that it will live up to how much I loved Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell or The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters. Last year I failed with The Absolute Book, and this year I’ve failed again with this.Really, a lot of its issues seem to be to do with editing, or lack of. The dialogue is the worst, especially the way that so many of the characters (in Victorian England and Scotland) use modern American English; at one point, a British man in the 1870s says ‘she ain’t picking up what we’re putting down’. The characters with accents have their dialogue written in the accent, which is nearly always a bad idea – several of them end up sounding like the sort of overexaggerated Cockney urchins you’d expect to find in a comedy sketch. Then there’s the bizarre way of describing children where everything is ‘little’ (if I already know they’re children, I don’t need telling that their arms or whatever are little, I can infer that, I’m not picturing them with enormous arms. The word ‘little’ is used just under 350 times in this book).These are the sort of things that irritate me so much I can’t continue reading unless I’m really loving the story.

We first meet Ali and her partner in crime Sean on a beach in France, where they attempt to con posh tourist Lulu out of some money. Something goes wrong, and in the sort of ludicrous twist that could only happen in a summer pageturner, Ali agrees to impersonate Lulu and take up her job as a private chef. Only after all this has happened does the plot described in the book’s blurb – the thing about nine people with secrets cooped up at a remote villa – actually come into play. This means there’s really not a lot of room for the rest of the story to be developed properly, and it repeatedly feels like the plot is stalling. There are just too many things happening: the book would’ve been better either as a more detailed portrait of Ali (with things like the cringeworthy romance subplot cut out), or stripped back to its bare bones as a tense, taut thriller. Instead, it’s underdeveloped in every direction, with characters who really shouldn’t be quite so boring, and a cheesy, contrived ending....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"May 10, 2023","May 12, 2023","Jun 08, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61111777-sun-damage

A zingy headrush of a campus novel, Stargazer is set mostly at a lakeside university in Ontario, Canada, and follows the friendship – and rivalry – between two girls, both extremely wealthy. The first, Diana, is from a loveless family, made jealous and resentful by her cold parents and sadistic brother; the second, Aurelle, is adored, but unwillingly famous due to her celebrity mother, and desperate to escape into anonymity. Skipping back and forth between the genesis of the girls’ friendship and their later notoriety, Petrou manages the plot’s progression with enviable skill – you have a sense Diana and Aurelle become infamous without knowing exactly why until the end, and it’s always intriguing, never too much, never too slow. It’s set in the early-to-mid-1990s, and features the ideal amount of ‘period detail’: enough to evoke the era, not so much that it overpowers the story.While reading it I barely came up for air, totally absorbed in this world: the dream forest ‘cottage’ (actually a mansion), canoeing across the lake to classes, stargazing, parties, art. It’s delicious to watch the two girls transform into fully realised (or fully subjugated) versions of themselves, and the character development is just right. It’s believable that Diana, the bitter outsider, would become ruthless and enigmatic; would be admired without ever really integrating. It’s believable that pampered Aurelle’s clingy, babyish tendencies would transmute into a cowed, pathetic misery.Stargazer is one of those novels that seems excellent when you’re reading it, but even more impressive when you step back and think about it. What Petrou does with the narrative is like sleight of hand; it’s so deftly structured that I can’t quite see how it was made to work so perfectly. And Diana Martin – controlled, laconic, terrifyingly driven – is my favourite literary character of the year so far. This is one of those books that feels like it should have a fandom. Hopefully, it soon will.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Jun 10, 2022","Jun 10, 2022","Jun 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60182327-stargazer

The recently ubiquitPaul Dalla Rosa writes the kind of characters that stay in your head and keep narrating your life after you’ve put the book down. The recently ubiquitous Short Story Tone of Voice – flat, affectless, unsentimental – is something I’ve complained about when reading other collections (such as Out There), but its full potential is realised here. In Dalla Rosa’s fiction, the characters always retain a charming vulnerability even as they speak, or are spoken about, dispassionately. (There’s also something much more entertaining about that tone when narrators use it to say things like ‘I wanted to swallow a thousand dicks, ten thousand dicks’.)From the start, the Voice works so well that I expected the stories with first-person narrators to be my favourites, and indeed, some of them are incredibly effective: opener ‘The Hardest Thing’, about a lonely young man trying to scratch a living in Dubai; ‘Comme’, following the anguished manager of a high-fashion store; ‘The Fame’, in which a delusionally ambitious guy tries to make it as a dancer on the Gold Coast. (This last reminded me a lot of Ottessa Moshfegh’s ‘Malibu’; I liked Inner Life overall better than Homesick For Another World, but if you loved one you’d probably at least like the other.) But my actual favourite from the book was, unexpectedly, ‘Contact’, about a woman working in a call centre – which I know doesn’t sound like much; it’s just so perfectly crafted, written in pared-back segments, brilliant at the sentence level, funny. I was also surprised at how much I enjoyed ‘In Bright Light’, as it – being about an LA-based actress reckoning with the fallout of her involvement in a scandal – feels like something of a departure from the rest. In some cases it’s a particular detail that stands out: the coke incident in ‘I Feel It’, the theft in ‘Life Coach’, the narrator realising it’s Cyndi’s house in ‘An MFA story’. There’s something to love in almost every story, and a lot of things – scenes, lines, some sense of an atmosphere – that I think I’ll remember.

I have a shelf for them, called secret-history-esque. Nowadays, however, these books have a more widely recognised appellation – ‘dark academia’ – and there’s a steady supply of novels seemingly created specifically to fit its parameters.The Cloisters is one such book. This may seem a bit unfair, but I truly don’t mean it as a criticism when I say it could have been written to order for this trend. It has the scholarly setting: The Cloisters, a museum of medieval art and architecture in New York City. The outsider protagonist – Ann, a naive but driven graduate with a love of ancient languages (thanks to her autodidact father) – whose wealthy, well-educated new colleagues seem to offer a ticket to a world of learning, society and glamour beyond her wildest dreams. The uneven, arguably toxic friendship between Ann and the charismatic Rachel. There are esoteric themes and motifs: fate, tarot cards, botanical drugs. It even has the portentous ‘if only I’d known then what I know now...’ prologue beloved of the genre. Finally, of course, there’s a mysterious death or two.Because I seek out this type of story, I’ve read books exactly like this before. While the tarot angle is interesting, The Cloisters doesn’t really do much that feels new. But I’ve written before about how much I enjoy this plot structure as long as it hits all the right notes, and the familiar formula has yet to lose its lustre for me. The Cloisters is executed perfectly: a heady book to get lost in, a perfect summer novel. The atmosphere of the setting, with its verdant gardens and myriad hidden corners, is undeniably intoxicating.With a tangled web of relationships at its heart, this book reminded me of ‘coming of age in the big city’ narratives like Sweetbitter as well as its more obvious kin in the ‘dark academia’ niche (especially this year’s Stargazer). I’m glad I read it in August, the perfect month for revelling in such an unabashedly indulgent tale.I received an advance  copy of The Cloisters from the publisher through Edelweiss.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,1,92,1,"Aug 13, 2022","Aug 14, 2022","Jun 04, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61223973-the-cloisters

But this is about tThis is my first Catherine Ryan Howard thriller – I’ve heard good things about the others, just never got round to picking one up. But this is about the making of a horror film, so naturally I was all over it. The focus is on struggling ex-soap actress Adele, whose unexpected casting as the lead of Final Cut brings her back to her home country, Ireland. She’s terrified of an incident from her past resurfacing, so it initially seems great that the film is being shot in the middle of a forest with no phone reception and a tiny crew of amateurs. Of course, when things start going wrong on set, these ‘perks’ prove rather more of a problem.Run Time has a surprising and unusual structure: something that seems like it should be the climactic event starts happening far too early, so you know there must be much more to come, but what? The atmosphere is fantastic; I read most of the book on a mild, sunny afternoon, but it made me feel like I was reading it on a dark, rainy winter night. The full-throttle plot also replicates the experience of actually watching a horror film in clever and entertaining style. It’s engrossing, twisty and very enjoyable. ‘Run Time is a fun time!’ – me (put that on the cover).I received an advance  copy of Run Time from the publisher through NetGalley.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"May 16, 2022","May 16, 2022","May 16, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60496636-run-time

We follow a period in the life of AIdol, Burning is a peculiar little book, even by the arguably odder-than-average standards of translated novellas. We follow a period in the life of Akari, a young woman in the grip of an all-consuming obsession with a singer and actor, Masaki: as she puts it, ‘believing in him was how I lived’. When her idol (or oshi, as she usually calls him) punches a fan, it ignites a scandal. Akari goes into a tailspin; her immersion in the fandom threatens to engulf the rest of her life. Yet this description makes the story sound much more plot-driven than it actually is. It’s strangely formless, even loose, for such a brief tale.I was torn on the rating here; if I’m not sure I tend to lean towards generosity, but there are many ways in which Idol, Burning is unsatisfying, and I felt some of its potential was wasted. (At the beginning, Akari seems to see the world wholly in online terms – ‘I looked at her face... and thought, there’s an emoji like that’ – which I thought was a really clever way to emphasise the narrowness of her perspective, but these descriptions stop after the first chapter. The book also vaguely gestures towards Akari’s mental health and possible neurodivergence, but never properly discusses it, which I found frustrating.) Ultimately, I downgraded this from four to three stars when I realised one of the main positive things I had to say was ‘it’s really short’. While I liked elements of Akari’s characterisation, the story didn’t say anything about the nature of stan culture that wasn’t articulated more effectively in Everything I Need I Get From You, a non-fiction book about fandom I read recently.I received an advance  copy of Idol, Burning from the publisher through Edelweiss.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Jul 04, 2022","Jul 05, 2022","May 14, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61091848-idol-burning

Split into two narratives – a contemporary one and a historical story-within-a-story – it’s well-written, creepy, with some great moments of atmosphere and suspense. It directly references Lovecraft, M.R. James and Moby-Dick; in its best moments, it reminded me of certain books by F.G. Cottam: The Colony, Brodmaw Bay, The Memory of Trees. I loved the protagonist being spellbound by a long, strange tale told in a rain-lashed diner, and I loved the backstory of Dutchman’s Creek, the haunted place at the story’s heart. Ultimately it falls down in a couple of places: the pacing could be better – there are parts of the central narrative that really do not need to drag on for as long as they do – and the portrayal of the narrator’s wife is... well, it leaves something to be desired, let’s just say that. On a personal note, the book also strays just a bit too far into fantasy/cosmic horror terrain for me.

The early chapters are the strongest, with a good sense of place and an engaging articulation of the narrator’s background. I could’ve verged on giving this 3.5/rounding up to 4 in the first half, but the sub-Point Horror climax and the ending are a bit of a mess; the timeline becomes too muddled for the emotional aspects to have any oomph.

I mean, you either want to read that or you don’t; there isn’t really any inbetween.I say that, but I actually went into this knowing/remembering nothing but that it was horror, which was enough for me to be intrigued. Especially as it starts off innocuously, seeming like a kind of semi-autobiographical account of the author’s life with a few details altered, and I couldn’t imagine how it was going to manage the switch in genres. Turns out, this switch is handled superbly, better than I could have hoped. The story as a whole is absolutely nothing like I expected. It’s quite funny at times, but it’s not flippant. It does such strange and brilliant things with material that would sound insubstantial and possibly terrible if I tried to outline it here. The impression I’m left with is of being trapped in a nightmare in this sprawling suburban house, a setting that appears to have imprinted itself on me: I can recall it in vivid detail; I feel like I’ve seen it.I only chose to read this (and the less impressive Less Than Zero) as prep for The Shards, but I’m so glad I did. I could easily never have read it – the length seemed daunting, the themes fuzzy – and the thought of that makes me shudder a bit, because it’s so much the kind of book I’m constantly looking for!

They each contemplate their own lives as well as (particularly in Summer’s case) the devastating bushfires blazing outside. The book is cleverly structured in three sections to match the acts of the play, with conversations during the interval, when the characters encounter one another, rendered as a script.I found it uneven, mainly because Margot is a much more interesting character than the other two. There’s so much that’s fascinating about her ruminations, so much I wanted to explore further: her lifelong ambivalence about motherhood; unwelcome nudges towards retirement from her boss; the problem of her husband’s incipient dementia, which has turned him occasionally violent. Meanwhile, I can remember very little about Ivy without referring back to the book. And I’m afraid almost nothing about Summer worked for me – she’s totally unconvincing and her ‘climate anxiety’ is so clumsily rendered that it repeatedly made me cringe. (To be fair, after reading Alexandra Kleeman’s Something New Under the Sun, any other novel that attempts to approach this topic is automatically on the back foot; it feels pointless that anyone else should even try.) I would have preferred The Performance had it focused primarily on Margot; by including two other main characters, the story spreads its many themes far too thinly, and its treatment of most of them ends up feeling superficial.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jun 07, 2022","Jun 08, 2022","Apr 25, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60883055-the-performance

When I got a bit further in I realised it wasn’t for me at all, but I had the time to finish it and thought I might as well do so. Cathy is a solitary woman in her thirties who is on the verge of taking her own life when she receives an unexpected visit from her estranged sister’s ex, Stephen. He tells her that Veronica Karen (who apparently insists on being called by both names) is seriously ill and has suddenly disappeared. What follows is a sort of road trip as Cathy and Stephen visit various friends/acquaintances, trying to find Veronica Karen and ruminating on the past. I expected the story to be darker and more mysterious than it is; there’s a lot of strangely pitched humour that I never really got to grips with, and Cathy’s scatterbrained narrative voice is difficult to follow. (Side note, but I really just can’t imagine this book being published with this cover now – I feel like it’d have bright colours, something to denote ‘quirkiness’ and an Eleanor Oliphant vibe.)TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Apr 16, 2022","Apr 18, 2022","Apr 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3093625-little-sister

The narrator is horrified and terrified by Green’s sexuality, barely able to confront it; she’s determined to believe her daughter still ‘has time’ to find a husband and have children. Alongside this, we’re also shown a more compassionate side to the narrator, typified by her tenderness towards Jen, the elderly childless woman for whom she is a part-time carer.This is a short, brisk novel that’s effectively nuanced and thought-provoking on the topics it covers (primarily homophobia and ageing) and almost seems designed to spark discussion. The ending is another strength: poignant without resorting to anything too far-fetched. I’m not surprised it’s become, per the cover, an international bestseller. I did, however, have a few issues with the way the story is told. The combination of quoteless dialogue and flashbacks makes for several confusing passages where it’s difficult to tell whether we’re reading someone’s speech or the narrator’s thoughts. There are also continuity errors with the ages of the main characters – pretty distracting given how frequently age is mentioned and its significance to the plot! – and the story might feel more complete if we had any real sense of Green’s perspective.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Apr 19, 2022","Apr 20, 2022","Apr 15, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60778264-concerning-my-daughter

The second thing is that I absolutely loved it. Build Your House Around My Body – an inappropriately twee title, if you ask me – is a wide-ranging novel of love, hate, family legacy and folklore that reminded me of Ghostwritten and The Kingdoms. It’s loosely organised around the disappearance of a young Vietnamese woman, Winnie, from Saigon in 2011, but flicks back and forth between different times and places, alighting on a group of linked characters who include Winnie’s boyfriend and his brother, but also a ghost extermination crew in the 1980s, a pair of French settlers in the 1940s, etc. Kupersmith has that gift of being able to swiftly breathe life into each and every character, and in particular I adored her empathetic portrait of lonely, displaced Winnie and her misadventures at Achievement! International Language Academy. This is a story that’s equally strong on character and plot; suggestions of magic/horror and unexpected connections make it endlessly exciting and surprising. It’s pretty long, but I would have been more than happy to keep reading about this world. One of those books I will be recommending to people in real life as well as online – Violet Kupersmith has a new fan in me.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Apr 14, 2022","Apr 17, 2022","Apr 13, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60805722-build-your-house-around-my-body

It must have been fate that the title came to mind again recently because, after idly searching it on eBay, I found an affordable copy and snapped it up. This sort of thing often results in disappointment so, all things considered, I was quite surprised by how much I ended up genuinely enjoying it. The plot is alluring, if unoriginal: JC, less wealthy than his outrageously moneyed circle of friends, longs for acceptance; this seems to become a possibility when a long-lost relative reappears with promises of an inheritance, but the windfall comes with its own dark side. There are some typical ‘first novel’ issues: the character of Anna – a woman so beautiful that everyone (including her own cousin) falls in love with her, who also possesses a genius IQ and an immense fortune – is a Mary Sue if ever there was one. Even so, it’s all written with a charm and eye for detail that makes such flaws somehow forgiveable. That, plus the satisfyingly melancholy ending, make it feel like a shame that Darling’s subsequent output has been limited.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 24, 2022","Mar 28, 2022","Mar 24, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17911597-glass-people

After the procedure, some clients are left with no idea they’ve even had a memory removed, until a high-profile trial forces Nepenthe to tell all of them and offer a ‘restoration’. We see the fallout from this development through the stories of six main characters. These are Noor, Nepenthe’s head of aftercare; sensitive teenager Mei; William, an ex-police officer with PTSD symptoms; smug middle-aged couple Finn and Mirande; and Oscar, a young man who remembers virtually nothing of his past and is perpetually on the run.Tonally, Tell Me an Ending reminded me of Natasha Pulley’s writing; thematically and structurally, it has a lot in common with Jennifer Egan’s The Candy House. It took me a while to get into it, as the chapters alternate between characters, and it’s initially quite difficult to keep so many perspectives straight. But once I was hooked, I was hooked. The plot creates its own momentum – naturally, I wanted to know what each of these people had chosen to erase. (Noor is the only one without a missing memory, but her plotline involves a similarly compelling element of corporate intrigue.) For a book that focuses on ‘endings’, however, its own are probably the weakest part; actually, one of them is downright bizarre. I’d still recommend it if you enjoy near-future stories, and it’s hard not to be charmed by the story’s warmth and compassion.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"May 18, 2022","May 19, 2022","Mar 16, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59589008-tell-me-an-ending

Following the death of her long-term partner, Penny is ‘very old and very much alone’. After an accident, she’s moved into a care home, Six Cedars; she’s told her partner secured her place there before he died, though she remembers nothing of this. Six Cedars – with its oddly small group of residents, imposing manager, and strange slips in time – initially reminded me of the Robert Aickman story ‘The Hospice’. And there are, indeed, many mysteries to unravel, and elements of the plot that stray into horror territory. But We Spread is more than that. It doesn’t succumb to the familiar cliches about old age as a horror story, instead gently challenging typical ways of thinking about ageing and mortality, agency and freedom.‘But what would the work mean if it was endless? What would a relationship mean if it kept going forever? What would a day be if it didn’t end?’The ending is abrupt, and I felt some of the plot’s most interesting threads amounted to loose ends that were never picked up. But I recognise that – given the book’s themes – it’s probably ironic that I wanted to know more, to keep spending time with Penny... and I suspect that may have been the whole point.I received an advance  copy of We Spread from the publisher through Edelweiss.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jun 14, 2022","Jun 19, 2022","Mar 16, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60631221-we-spread

A Separate Peace is told almost entirely from The usual dilemma with any kind of classic novel: what to say about this that hasn’t already been said? A Separate Peace is told almost entirely from the perspective of a teenage boy at a New England boarding school during the Second World War (there’s also a brief – powerfully evocative – introductory section in which the narrator returns to his old school as an adult). Concentrating on the friendship between the narrator, Gene, and his best friend, Phineas, it’s a story of how these children of privilege navigate the effects of war as well as the paradox in which they are now contained: they will imminently join the fight, so they’re expected to grow up fast, but adults also treat them as paragons of precious innocence, to be indulged and coddled. The writing is so clean and smooth and lucid. It rolls along wonderfully; it’s emotionally resonant. I found it beautiful, and well deserving of its status.Two favourite passages:‘... One summer day after another broke with a cool effulgence over us, and there was a breath of widening life in the morning air—something hard to describe—an oxygen intoxicant, a shining northern paganism, some odor, some feeling so hopelessly promising that I would fall back in my bed on guard against it. I forgot whom I hated and who hated me. I wanted to break out crying from stabs of hopeless joy, or intolerable promise, or because these mornings were too full of beauty for me, because I knew of too much hate to be contained in a world like this.’‘Here the road turned to the left and became dirt. It proceeded along the lower end of the playing fields, and under the pale night glow the playing fields swept away from me in slight frosty undulations which bespoke meanings upon meanings, levels of reality I had never suspected before, a kind of thronging and epic grandeur which my superficial eyes and cluttered mind had been blind to before. They unrolled away impervious to me as though I were a roaming ghost, not only tonight but always, as though I had never played on them a hundred times, as though my feet had never touched them, as though my whole life at Devon had been a dream, or rather that everything at Devon, the playing fields, the gym, the water hole, and all the other buildings and all the people there were intensely real, wildly alive and totally meaningful, and I alone was a dream, a figment which had never really touched anything. I felt that I was not, never had been and never would be a living part of this overpoweringly solid and deeply meaningful world around me.’TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Mar 14, 2022","Mar 19, 2022","Mar 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59484009-a-separate-peace

But after reading Graeme Macrae Burnet’s latest, the excellent Case Study, I was inspired to pick it up. There are some similarities between the two books: both are framed as a sort of investigation, both touch on themes that involve contemporaneous schools of thought in psychology, and both position the main character as an unreliable narrator. Here, that’s Roderick Macrae, a young crofter accused of multiple murders in a remote community in 1869. The two main narratives are Roderick’s own confession and an assessment of him written by a pompous criminal anthropologist; they’re surrounded by other material, including witness statements and an account of the controversial trial. On balance, I think I liked Case Study a little more – Project doesn’t seem to make the most of some of its most intriguing details. But its depiction of life in the village of Culduie is convincing, Roderick’s tale engrossing, and the various voices well-realised. It seems like it could easily be a true story, with the result that it feels something like a 19th-century serial filtered through the lens of modern true crime.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Jun 04, 2022","Jun 06, 2022","Mar 05, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27468988-his-bloody-project

There are other brands of horror I’d cross the metaphorical street to avoid. Horror anthologies are often a mixture of the two, and can therefore be tricky to . Then again, if the stories in an anthology are too similar to one another, that can also be an issue; an editorial hand is important. Isolation is an extremely varied collection, expertly curated so that all flavours of horror are represented. It’s fair to say that some of them just weren’t to my taste at all (hence no rating for the book as a whole), but there are as many different interpretations of the theme of ‘isolation’ here as any reader could hope for – I was impressed by the lack of cliche.Personal highlights for me included:• ‘Friends for Life’ by Mark Morris: lockdown folk horror with characters I truly cared about – brilliant! Of all the stories, I’ll remember the atmosphere of this one most vividly.• ‘Alone is a Long Time’ by Michael Marshall Smith: a cursed object in the collection of an elderly recluse spells disaster for a light-fingered carer. A classic creepy tale, told in effective style.• ‘Letters to a Young Psychopath’ by Nina Allan: I read this twice – once before I’d even looked at the rest of the book, and once after I had read all the other stories. It’s the tale of a serial killer who sees his job in the police force as ‘a methadone for murder’, and I’m biased because of how much I adore Allan’s writing, but it really IS great.• ‘Jaunt’ by Ken Liu: an excellent sci-fi story about what happens when ‘telepresence robots’ revolutionise the tourism industry. There’s so much potential in the premise that I feel like this could easily be expanded to novel length.TinyLetter | Linktree...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Oct 05, 2022","Oct 07, 2022","Feb 25, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61660451-isolation
