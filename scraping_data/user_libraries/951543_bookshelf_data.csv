Honestly it was a pretty basic slow burn enemies to lovers plot. I more enjoyed the fantasy storyline, which I see others who read Hazelwood seemed to be bored by. I thought Misery was a strong female lead, she wasn’t whiny or piney which I think I usually expect from romance which is why I don’t read them. So I guess that’s a plus. The spicy parts weren’t all that weird. But maybe I’m just more “alternative” than the rest of you so it didn’t make me clutch my pearls or anything.

Think everyone should think about dying so that they learn how to live. This book reminds me of a course I took in college called “Death and Dying” — my teacher started the first day of that class asking all of us “Have you ever looked at your hands…your skin…and thought about your own mortality?” A lot of the things in this book reflect back to the thinking we did in that course.Of course, this book wraps it all up in a cute love story and a plot about family and friendship.

This book sat on my table for days at a time and I never wanted to pick it up, which should tell you how I felt about it. About 1/4 of the way in, I started wondering why I was even reading this. It’s slow, jumbled and sloggy. The multiple timelines of the same characters gets really confusing and honestly I don’t want to think that hard when I’m reading. I usually like a true crime story and i really do have a strange fascination with serial killers, but I felt this particular novel had no value. Tina was a really awful character. She was annoying, her “progressiveness” was so over the top it bordered on aggressive and pretentious, and from what I gather she was supposed to be the narrative thread holding this story together.

The nature of the somewhat interconnectedness of these chapters was interesting - until it was more confusing than interesting - then it got annoying. Some of these pseudo stories were okay. Some weren’t. I think the point of this novel was not to be a novel and so I guess that part technically “worked” but I don’t know if it actually made it good or just “something”. I’m not sure where the art of a book gets in the way and the meaning of writing for the reader suffers. I think this “novel” borders on finding that line, for me. The struggle to write really good short stories and tell a whole picture about different versions of love - that capture me and make me want to read them - was lost in the desire to do something “unique” and I feel like it ended up with neither thing truly succeeding.

The feelings of both hopelessness and hope told through this one “family” story were immense in depth and breadth and amazing to experience.

But my brain was also wishing that an editor took a red pen and done their job on some parts too. Where the story excelled was in the language and the idea. Where it faltered was in the execution of the characters and their motivations. The absolute best part about the book was the world building. The amount of time spent describing the food, the setting and the shops or homes was incredible. I felt like I was there eating every bite or feeling every fabric. I wish Aoki had spent more time with that level of detail on the characters. It seemed like everything about their feelings was “told” to me, not shown. Like how many times Katrina repeated things in her head was a bit overt. Her growth as a character wasn’t fully realized enough for me.

The story isn’t for the light of heart — these kids on the run encounter a harrowing journey — and they didn’t start off that well to begin with. But the way Krueger writes is so beautiful - I was caught up and drawn in — I feel like this is a modern classic in the making.There really is danger around every corner in this novel, but danger set in a quilt of wonderful word and beautiful friendship.

Exciting and suspenseful to the last. Why I didn’t like:- why does it always have to be a broken woman?? Why can’t we get more books about men in stories like The Sixth Sense or of Alec Hardy in Broadchurch?- I agree with other s, situations are a bit contrived move the story along.

There were also a lot of generalizations made based on one or two interviews. The thought that Orenstei went into this study with a particular goal in mind is evident, and I'm not sure she thoughtfully investigated all sides. I tend to agree with a lot of what she said (not all), but she offered too much of her own opinion while presenting these women's stories and I think that brought down the credibility of this investigation.Also, while there were a lot of upsetting revelations made by honest and brave young women, but the last few sentences wrapping up ""talk to your teens"" really doesn't help layout any realistic steps to help fix this major problem.

While this installment had the ability to be the best of the bunch it was mired down a bit by the turn in Robin's personality. I felt like everything she did in this novel was against the character that has been built around her in the previous two books.
