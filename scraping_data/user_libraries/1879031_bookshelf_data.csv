I loved her novel The Oath so much that I decided to read her previous work. All I can say is that House of Grace won’t be the last one I read. That’s a given. I look forward to the other two books in this series.Grace is a wonderful character. Born to great wealth, she doesn’t hesitate to give it all up when she falls madly in love with a coal miner. She pour herself into their life together. Her background and his don’t matter: love does. A strong woman, even in her young years, Grace endures what she must to follow her heart.That’s about all I want to say about the plot: no desire to ruin it for anyone. What draws me into this author’s work is Osborne's storytelling, her understanding of family (good, bad, and in-between), and the emotions that her characters and their respective situations stir in me. She isn't afraid to take us where her characters lead—whether that be in the sunshine or the dark shade. Her writing is relatable and strong—her stories compelling.

Lizzy O’Meara is a young woman who is incarcerated for murdering her newborn baby, a crime she vehemently denies having committed. Conditions are harsh as she serves her unjust four-year sentence in solitary confinement. Lizzy’s fortitude and strength, confronted with abuse and despair, diminish to the brink of insanity, where suicide appears to be the only way out. But after four years, she emerges back into the world. She is different, the world is different, yet so much of what she fought for remains the same. When she receives some shocking news about the supposed crime she committed, her world changes again.Author Dyen does a masterful job of capturing the courage and the strong will of a woman who has seen the worst, but presses on. Not only does Lizzy do what she can to right the personal wrongs in her life, she champions the abolitionist movement (fighting all of the ugliness that surrounds it) with unfailing determination that constantly tests her inner strength. This beautiful portrait of Lizzy O’Meara is also a touching love story—in more ways than one. Lizzy’s character was so very real to me in every way, and the events of pre-Civil War Philadelphia were superbly researched.

Real people.I won’t recap the general plot in any detail as one can easily read the blurb. Rather, I’d just like to expound a bit on why I loved this beautifully written novella. So many of us can relate to past loves that for one reason or another, didn’t fully form into lifetime relationships … or continue to form at all. Life happens for all of us, and things can swiftly change. Especially when tragedy is involved. We move on, but often, we don’t forget. This is what happened with Laynie and Trace, both from the town of Beach Way, Oregon, who always thought they’d be together. What I loved about this story is that when Trace returns to Beach Way, and Laynie and he see one another again, their chemistry is strong. The past, which determined their present, still plays a role in their story.

On a quiet Sunday, with the rain falling outside, I believe the mood was finally set.Anna Casemento Arrigo knows the power of a word. In many of these gorgeous poems, there is only one word per line. A gifted poet knows that one word must do so much to move forth the message, the scene, the inner thoughts, and the soul of the poet who has placed them just so.While I enjoy well-written poetry such as this, I never quite know how one s it adequately or accurately. So, as I read, I jotted down my thoughts, hoping they’d make sense as I came back to them. I read most of these poems twice to receive the full impact. And I so enjoyed the inclusion of artwork throughout, gently complementing the poetry. In the poem “god …” I discovered fantastic, thought-provoking imagery. In “Maria,” the sad, yet-for-some joy of going home was beautifully captured.There wasn’t one poem unworthy of its place in this collection. I loved “Dust Bowl” and “By the river” which paints a word portrait of an old man. Being a long-time admirer of artist Edvard Munch, I was delighted by the poem in his name. One of my favorites was “Leftover Crumbs,” a poignant and powerful description of a man at a bar.

A Nightingale’s Last Song gives the reader a front-row seat to the courageous and committed nurses who served tirelessly and selflessly in WWII.

Being a huge fan of the first two books, I couldn’t wait to read the third. It exceeded my expectations, which is tough to do.In this book, Phaedra Brighton, a Jane Austen scholar and English professor, is delighted when her younger sister returns home to open up a patisserie (Tout de Sweet) — adding a French bakery to the town of Laurel Springs. I won’t belabor the plot, only to say that it gets going quickly when a local celebrity’s assistant takes a bite from a poisonous cupcake and is rushed to the hospital, leaving no one the wiser as to who the intended victim is. And Phaedra, as she always does, refuses to leave this crime alone, especially as her sister’s reputation and new shop are both in jeopardy.Why did I love this book? So many reasons. It grabbed my attention immediately and was intriguing until the very end. Katie Oliver does a superb job of offering her readers a plethora of suspects and possibilities. The story was so brilliantly and beautifully crafted—with subplots that enhanced every page. Every dubious character has reason to be under scrutiny, but why? The motive is as elusive as the culprit. And the love stories woven through this book, they’re just the icing on … well, maybe not a cupcake … but some kind of cake. You decide.I highly recommend this book. I read it in two sittings. It’s a great story to lose yourself in and just get away from it all.

They’re open to the wisdom and enlightenment that surrounds them. But first and foremost, they’re flawed, relatable human beings who often fight the chance to elevate their lives until understanding comes to them.Indeed, I was intrigued by Halley Bowen being offered a wonderful life by an anonymous benefactor — in the beautiful seaside town of Port Royal — with one hitch. This premise was so different from anything I’d read before. What was the hitch? What could it be? Why was the benefactor making this offer? So many wonderful questions.

Set in the picturesque Appalachian village of Divine, this exquisite novel follows Lacey Jordan’s quest to meet the mountain sage she’s heard so much about—and to whom she feels a magnetic pull toward. Penrose skillfully unfolds the story of these two women meeting, but also tells the tale of several other Divine residents and visitors. The plot alone, powerful in its magical qualities, though written about fictional characters, offers a road map of sorts to readers seeking to understand their own lives and the power that each of us might harness to have a hand in crafting our respective journeys. The way the characters’ choices and destinies merge is absolutely brilliant. The author offers insight and, perhaps, new ways to divine our lives, but is never preachy. And that alone is pure gold.Cassie is a spirited, spiritual, and delightful character. She chats with her “growin’ things’ and has an otherworldly connection with animals and nature. Her wisdom is grand, yet quietly offered. She is relatable, especially when she recognizes that Lacey is “afraid of newness and afraid of sameness.” I can’t speak for other readers, but this is a truth I’ve long held, which only gives more credence to Cassie’s sagacity. Another aspect of this book I really appreciated was Penrose’s careful balance between wisdom and outright humor.

I absolutely loved this story. The word “unputdownable” is often exaggerated, but that’s truly how I felt. I read this in two days, taking time to absorb the story and all of the wonderful characters.Taking place at the very end of the 19th century, this story centers around Françoise, who is forced/compelled into marrying her distant cousin, Charles, in England, because of a family oath made one-hundred years ago. And that’s all I want to say about the specifics of the story, because Osborne’s storytelling is superb, and I wouldn’t want to deprive potential readers of not experiencing the story for themselves.I loved Françoise’s character because she was a strong-willed, yet vulnerable young woman. I loved how she was caught between what was deemed the right thing to do in the late 1890s vs. what she felt in her heart—even when she wasn’t sure what her heart was telling her.The book alternates points of view between Françoise and Tilly, who becomes her best friend. The older women in the book, more “wed” to traditions of the time, often frustrated me as I’m sure they would’ve had I lived in those times. Osborne did a wonderful job of portraying the society and its norms, expectations, and hierarchy. From page one, I was immediately invested in the characters. I cared about them and never stopped.

It can be hard to move ahead when one has invested so much in a particular person, but it’s a great boost to one’s self-esteem when that can be accomplished.

I found it special as I believe many others will too: I’ll say no more.“Lyrical Dragon” like many of these stories in this collection, is filled with phantasmagorical elements that when looked at, hold so many truths. So many of the stories have simple lessons, yet are told in a way that reminds the reader how many different ways there are to look at life—and death, and that the world gives us so many messages—in every form imaginable.As an animal lover, “The Bench” particularly appealed to me, but I loved seeing dogs, cats, and nature in general in so many of the stories.“Deadline” was another favorite. I felt as if I’d been transported into a horror movie – one I believe could really happen. “The Day the Ground Moved,” all within a few pages, was scary in imaginable and unimaginable ways.This  will be too long if I continue with all of the notes I made.

After finishing the first story, which went somewhere I never expected, I knew that I was really going to enjoy this author. She has great insight into human nature, but also, as is evident in all of her work, she has a keen eye for observation.The subjects of the stories have many tales to tell, from a woman who decides to speak as little as possible, to a woman railing against her neighbor, an over-tanning trophy wife/widow, to a poignant story about a reporter developing a friendship with an obese woman. There is a car that seems to have a particular personality, a man at the end of his life who speaks through a synthesizer, and an art student who is “perplexed” by the demands of her professor … and so many more. The last story, which gave me a chill similar to the first one … makes a second and brilliant bookend in this collection. Oh, and there was a poem called “Dot” which I found exceptional and spot on. But I won’t give that away.The writing is superb, and the situations and characters are clearly from a writer who understands human nature and how it can evolve or devolve.

What makes this mystery particularly intriguing is that it’s not just a “whodunit,” but a “whytheydunit.” Schwindt’s dialogue always takes me right into the scene; I feel more like a fly on the wall than a reader.

It’s always great to see old friends. That said, this wonderful book doesn’t rely on past novels to be enjoyed. Sculptor Andreas, who has been lonely and depressed since his wife’s death three years prior, often hikes into the mountains. One day, while with his dog in a cave, he is surprised when the dog unearths a backpack from years ago. Looking inside, Andreas finds a letter from an Italian man named Joshua to his pregnant wife, Bella during World War II. He realizes Joshua never made it home and his family most likely never knew what happened to him or that he had tried to make contact.The emotional weight of the letter hits Andreas hard, and with the encouragement of his daughter, Emilia, and his son, Tonio, he sets off to Italy to see if he can do the impossible and track down Bella (if she’s still alive) or other family members. Tonio takes his sister and father to a vineyard in Tuscany where he has a friend, Julietta. Readers of the author’s previous book will remember Julietta and her mother, Luisa, from The Italian Sister.From this point on, the story really takes off. I don’t want to summarize the plot, but rather offer a short commentary on why I found this book to be so special. Author Polkinhorn has several wonderful and heartfelt sub-plots flowing through the main story. All of them are skillfully woven together, beautifully emulating life and its twisty, unpredictable ways. I genuinely cared about every character. Letter from a Cave offers suspense, romance, emotion, surprises, nostalgia, and so much more. The author’s gorgeous descriptions made it easy to visualize the scenes in Switzerland and Italy—not to mention making me hungry for Italian food.

For anyone who is interested in what life was like in and around Johannesburg, Valerie Poore brilliantly provides not only a colorful overview, but zeroes in on the many areas in which she and her family lived, detailing each city’s unique traits — the good, the bad, and the well, unfortunate. The author’s beautiful writing, as in her others books, draws the reader in as if one has almost been teleported to each location. Her attention to detail is mesmerizing, but never boring. I can’t stress strongly enough how well this author recreates a scene—even with the fine detailing of car and bicycle mishaps. Humor is prevalent throughout the book, serving to make the stories all the more charming.For someone who isn’t keen on moving, I was amazed by the moving of house five times in this book’s time span alone. Not only did the family pack up and move, but they renovated homes and made major adaptations to their previous ways of living — something I found to be very impressive. I learned so much about the various cities, what it was like to work, what it was like for her daughters, and so much more. Being an animal lover, I was heartened by the many stories about animals and pets. I was fascinated by many of the author’s descriptions, and as I read, I did much Internet research – from the upside down Baobab trees to Velvet Monkeys in a Zimbawbe trees. I was saddened to read about schoolchildren begging not for money—but for pens and paper. Having read much about this author’s life on a barge based in Rotterdam, I was especially interested to learn how she went from living in South Africa to the Netherlands—and I understand so well by her former country is so dear to her heart.If you’re interested in life in South Africa, especially during turbulent political times, you may find this book every bit as fascinating as I did.

I just had no idea how much, nor for how many reasons.When Sofia Martin from Boston and Eduardo Diaz from Spain, both meet in Venice, the City of Love, as a reader might expect, the attraction and the chemistry are instant, as are the obstacles. That’s all I want to say about the story line, because what this author delivered went so far beyond all of my expectations (and I expected to thoroughly enjoy the book!) As I read, I had no idea where the story was going. And that was exactly what I loved about it. First, the characters were real, and while they walked a path together, destiny made sure they walked their own paths as well. The author has a deep and spiritual understanding of the human psyche: what propels it forward and what yanks it back. She always understands that each love story is unique, requiring every soul to chart their own course. Both Sofia and Eduardo found magic and “unexplainables” in their journey to find love, but as they both learned, that alone does not guarantee a happy ending.Author Penrose has written a beautiful story that is simultaneously steeped in the veracity of human nature and both the visible and invisible guides that help us through this journey called life. Her characters were extremely real to me, neither invulnerable to tripping and falling on the way to love. Where I expected the story to go “right,” it went “left,” making it that much more beguiling to me. As I read, I stopped myself from trying to second guess the outcome; I just went along for the ride.Aside from the characters, Penrose did a superb job of bringing the characters’ surroundings to life. If you’ve never been to Venice, expect to visit for the first time. If you’ve been before, expect a “return trip.”This is an exceptional love story — an exceptional story about life and love.**Ordinarily, my  would end here. But this is no ordinary novel. It is a collaboration of Ms. Penrose’s words and composer David Bazo’s music. While one need not have the companion CD to enjoy this novel, I highly recommend it.

And while it sounds like such a cliché, yes, this was indeed another page turner.Lost in Time is wonderful, historically rich novel filled with suspense and intrigue from the beginning.

And yes, his children have disappeared.I don’t want to give away any more of this story. What I want to emphasize is that I truly loved every moment of this book.

The issue of self-esteem, which the author speaks so knowingly about, is one that affects more people than I believe most of us even realize. Low self-esteem manifests itself in many ways and that can make it more difficult for some to see. Yet, I believe it visits a preponderant number of people at some point in their lives, if not throughout. Reading this book was like talking to a new friend and sharing common experiences.

Only Finola finds way more than the quiet respite she may have imagined. As prospective readers can take a gander at the blurb without my help, this  will focus on why I enjoyed this novel rather than recap the plot in any detail. First, the author has a great sense of humor—one that shows itself in unexpected ways. I really liked how the villain was drawn in this story, not in the typical way readers might expect, and was intrigued by how the story was brought to a satisfying resolution. Another high point was the way a joke had unexpected consequences, and most of all, can’t say I didn’t wasn’t very happy the way Fiona’s love story worked out, not to mention the honest and special way Ms. Miller brought all of the elements together. I think my favorite thing of all was that the author didn’t adhere to the resolutions readers might first expect. The story was real and relatable.

Having read one the first book in this author’s Fat Dogs and French Estates series (can’t wait to read more), I was intrigued by this prequel, eager to learn more about the woman who had so many wonderful tales to share about her life in France.As it turns out, the girl who grew up in Wales was every bit as fascinating. I know people with many different childhood stories, but Beth Haslam’s was truly unlike anything I’ve heard before. With each chapter, I couldn’t help but imagine how many children’s series could have been developed from just her life alone: Her family, animals, school adventures, sailing, castle-living, and so much more. Not only is this memoir enchanting, but it is so beautifully written that it just draws the reader in.This memoir not only tells of a magical childhood, but the historic value of this book, in my opinion, should not be overlooked. Haslam takes great care to share her Welsh heritage with readers, from proverbs to language to pronunciation of those very easy-to-pronounce (not!) Welsh words. I couldn’t help but think that I hope this book will be read by generations to come: there is so very much to be learned and appreciated.I found this book to be enlightening, entertaining, and rich in detail. This was a labor of love. It’s clear how much effort the author put into the writing, especially having to go back decades to bring the past to life again. Truly delightful.

What a book!When I picked up this book, I wasn’t prepared for how honest, raw, real, and gripping it would be. The author has lived through so much in her young life, and to say that I applaud her bravery in writing this memoir would be a vast understatement. She is not only helping herself in what has to be a long recovery process, but I have no doubt this book will help others in ways even the author has not imagined.I read a lot of books. This is the first memoir I’ve read written by someone only in her mid-twenties. But Ms. Testerman has a wisdom and a soul far older than her physical years. She also has a natural writing ability. This is not a long, drawn-out memoir. The author instinctively knows what matters and what doesn’t. Every line gets to the point and packs a punch—one you may physically feel for a long time. It’s that intense.While reading this, certain parts took my breath away. As the disclaimer in the beginning of the book states, the author “talks about sexual abuse, self-harm, suicide, and heavy drug and alcohol use.” This is not to be taken lightly. While I highly recommend this book, I recommend it only to those who are prepared and able to read it NOW. I believe this book has the ability to help so many people. A person need not have lived a life similar to Ms. Testerman’s to find solace, hope, and help in this book. This is for anyone who is suffering so intensely that they believe life cannot be lived without a great deal of pain … without thoughts of ending that life. It is also for anyone who wants to grasp even a basic understanding of what others go through, for those anyone who may wish to expand their knowledge or understand a loved one … and so much more. I hope this talented author will write more about her life and recovery, but only when she feels the time is right. This is a compelling read. Brava for writing it.

However, now that I’m writing a , I am finding it difficult to put those notes into one paragraph and make any cohesive sense. So let me try this another way.What I loved most about the poetry is the author’s gift for nuanced descriptions of nature and its creatures as if we’re seeing them with brand new eyes. Her poem “The Robin – Size doesn’t matter” really resonated with me. In my childhood, robins were abundant where I lived, but reading this poem felt as though I was meeting them anew, just as I felt reading about bees, butterflies, starlings and other creatures. The author is brilliantly observant and knows how to extract what is most special about the world she sees. And I love the pieces of art she creates with her lines of poetry. Most clever.I don’t want to give too much away about the short stories, but each one delighted me in a different way. I especially loved “The Secret” and wanted it to go on.

Beneath a Copper Sky begins with an extraordinary word painting of two people, Angela and Stephen, as they leave England for a job in South Africa as caretakers for a remote farm … a brand-new and enchanting world where slow immersion into a new culture and environment, in a time of political turbulence, is not an option. The author’s talent for capturing the scenery, showing us the culture shock (yet love at first sight) from the characters’ point of view, and putting the reader right into the scene is absolutely brilliant. As Angela and Stephen work hard to acclimate to their new life, tension and unrest surround them. I could empathize and as I tried imagine what it must have been like to meet so many new people, all with very different stations in life, and try to figure out who to trust … and who to be wary about. In situations like this book relates … dark can seem light and light can seem dark.In every  I write, it’s important for me to express what I took from a book, never to recap the plot … I leave that for the readers. I not only thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I also learned more about the racial oppression (apartheid) that was a part of this country for far too many years. Kudos to the author for another engaging and fascinating story. As always, Ms. Poore teaches me so much and I look forward to more of her books.

Cold Blows the Wind is one of those books that embedded itself in my heart and wouldn’t let go.Ellen Thompson was the epitome of a strong woman … and true strength, to me, shines the brightest when one is poor, when life is unfair, when one is mistreated, and when dreams die unfulfilled. All of this and much more describes Ellen, yet she managed to take care of herself, her children, and her loved ones in the way she best could … always standing up for who she was. This historical story, which begins in Hobart Town, Australia in 1878, is rich in color and character … offering much insight into the lives of the poor and the harsh and often brutal living and societal conditions that were the norm. I did not know until I had read the entire book that it was based on the author’s great-great grandparents and their families. (While this is stated in the blurb, I only read the first paragraph when I purchased it.)I have no wish to give away any of the story, but Ellen’s character and her story resonated strongly with me. I was fascinated to read the historical notes at the end of the book, and I am impressed by all I can imagine Catherine Meyrick put into telling/researching this fragile, yet very human tale. She has combined history and fiction to produce a truly wonderful book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Aug 04, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60852887-cold-blows-the-wind

In fact, it is the “something special” in her work that makes me appreciate short fiction more than ever.Overall, what I truly admire about Ms. Maza’s work is that she skillfully plucks seemingly everyday stories from real life, crafts a story around them, then hits home so well. She nails such very important points in a way that feels effortless, but is not.I liked every story in this collection. I particularly liked “Mother’s Day” which tells the story of a woman, Abbey, who recalls different ages in her own past as she celebrates Mother’s Day with her own child, Chloe. For me, this story held so many truths that I imagine even readers with disparate lives will relate to the way Abbey works to resolve the pain of her own unhappy childhood.“Fate of the Fairy,” probably the shortest story in the book … was so incredibly poignant and I wondered how the author knew how I would feel about something many might see as insignificant. Again, it is Ms. Maza’s insight into the human psyche that comes shining through.And in the last story, “A Bistro in Paris,” where a woman resolves her unrequited past … without giving anything away, I can only say I was deeply touched by this.

Immediately, I was engrossed in the tale of the Kornet family in the early 60s. From the first page, Arie, the lone son, is bemoaning what constantly felt like endless, interminable days on the barge. Because his father, Henrik, was Dutch commercial skipper, the life he and his two sisters lived was unlike the lives from other children: they had it better. Why did his father have to be a skipper!So much was different, especially schooling. And the family took baths in a tin tub used for washing clothes. Being a skipper’s child also meant one tended to marry one another skipper’s child. Arie’s dreary days on the barge take a dramatic turn (also for the entire family) after Arie discovers a young Russian stowaway onboard, Dmitri, who is wanted by the authorities. The author’s superb writing captures the nuances of family interaction and makes the reader feel invisible alongside the characters.Just as I’ve learned so much from this author’s memoirs, this novel was no exception. I not only felt that I had an amazing look into a life so different from anything I’ve known, but I thought this was an exceptional coming-of-age story … and I loved seeing the characters evolve, especially Arie, as he began to see his life (and his future) differently. I think this evolution is what tugged at my heartstrings the most.Valerie Poore has an amazing gift for taking readers to new places.

It is very easy to understand why.Getting to know Rudy through her memories and descriptions, I know he was the kind of man who made the world a better place, just by his presence in it.

While nobody handles grief the same way, or can, Ms. Perez, while acknowledging that we are all unique creatures, talks of much common ground through her experience.Rudy is still very much alive … and the profound impact he’s made on his family and friends is too great to be measured and far too great to be gone.

As I read, it was like pieces of my own life floated by and I thought about how interesting it is that while we all have unique lives and that one person’s imagery and experiences can truly tap into another’s.I could have read this in one sitting, but after I began reading, I knew that was not what I wanted to do. I wanted to read in small pieces – to digest the words and feelings, to read them again, and to get permission from my introspective self before moving on.I chose this book because, for quite a long time, here and there, I had watched the author’s videos on YouTube and heard her read her poetry aloud. When I saw she had a new book out, I knew I had to read more. It was long past time.One of my first favorite lines in the book was this one:“Word, letters, breaths seduced by a tongue.”How beautiful … and how countless the images that these words brought forth for me.Whether we know what the poet was writing about – her precise coupling of words and phrasing not only paint of picture of what might have been, but it’s hard not to imagine that every reader conjures up her/his own life … wondering how she knew.From lingering childhood memories to the pain of adulthood – Slater brilliantly forms crisp and colorful portraits that help us to understand the adult we meet in other poems. And yes, sometimes both the child and adult make an appearance in the same poem – lamenting the harsh past and how it has formed who she is today.“With her too-tight and too-short gingham apron she wears as a big badgeAnd her dirty, pastry hands smeared all over me.”It felt to me as if everyone had a friend whose mother (or grandmother) matched this description. I felt the child’s pain in this poem so much that it reminded me of specific incidents in my own life. Again, so universal are our truths.At the very end of the collection, Slater writes a poem to her grandmother. It touched me deeply … and while memories of my own grandmother are quite different … she writes in such a way that every word resonated. There were just so many layers and they were so real.I always have such a hard time “ing” poetry. The very best I can do is to share a bit of what a poet’s words meant to me. Wendy Slater is an exceptional poet who isn’t afraid to expose herself … and even knowing little to nothing about her life … you just know that she isn’t hiding behind pretense..

Let me tell you more.When Nick Castle’s father, Jim, dies from prostate cancer, Nick is given a large envelope with instructions not to open it until his father is gone. Immediately, Nick is riveted … consumed … by what he finds … the story of Carlyle U student Braden Delaney, who set an ROTC building on fire during the turbulent early ‘70s. After a student is found dead in the building Braden thought empty … he goes on the run … leaving behind the love of his life, Cheryl, and ending up in Central America for many years. (Note: Braden’s story, written by Jim Castle, is a novel within a novel and is as compelling as the entire book.)First, although it sounds like an old cliché, I was gripped from the first page to the last. After Nick finishes reading the manuscript, an emotional effort to say the least, he embarks on a journey to find out if the manuscript is memoir, biography, or fiction. So much of Nick’s own identity is tangled up in the discovery process … along his grief over the death of the father he loved so much … yet whose early life he’d known little about. The author’s writing style is very clean … no wasted words or descriptions … scenes and emotions easy to visualize … and very believable. Mark Piper writes in a style that seems effortless, but as any reader knows … it takes a lot of talent to do so. Nick’s character was always believable, never contrived … and I felt his angst and unsettled emotions as he sets out to discover the truth as his personal life takes an unexpected turn.This is a really wonderful and relatable story … one that will stick with me for a long time.

The first day of filming turns out to be an adventure … but far from the one envisioned. Charlene’s husband is murdered and Charlene is the prime suspect.

After reading the first short piece, which had a truly shocking ending, I was excited to keep reading.

Three of my favorite stories were “The Twenty-First Birthday,” “It’s Written on the Rocks,” and “Virginia Creeper.” While these stories worked beautifully as short, flash fiction, I also could see how each one might have played out as a novel.

The premise of the novel is in the blurb, so there’s no point in repeating it here. What I do want to share is that this book was engrossing because the author builds her house of cards very well. The reader knows that some major events are about to happen, but which ones it will be, and how the action will present itself, is never a given. I couldn’t help do what many readers do … wonder if this or that will happen, then ponder a different scenario, change my mind, and come up with something else. And through all of that, the author still surprises me. This is exactly why I love this author’s books. She keeps you guessing! So much happens that if you jumped inside the book, you wouldn’t know where to look first.

I only need to say that this novel was about an alcoholic couple, Al and Chrissy Markham, and how drink affected their marriage, their subsequent relationships, and every nuance of the world around them. Fry did an excellent job of characterizing the common, yet unique ways that alcoholism affects different people. There is no one description that fits all, and this is why I found this story so compelling and painfully real. I know this story will stay with me for a long time.There is so much that factors into how an alcoholic fares in life, and the odds for sobriety are definitely not with most. Aside from the author painting his characters with an incredibly authentic brush, the plot was well structured, twisting and turning in places I wasn’t expecting. But never, for a moment, did anything feel contrived or overblown. The story was excellent. And yes, in many ways, it was triggering to read.

Reading the epilogue, which shook me to the core, I had a feeling there would be another book — having no clue if the author intended one or not. But I knew it was a brilliant place to end a book … and years later … to begin another anew. Known as the Yorkshire Slasher, Lauren Michaels (Tracy Bennett) is locked up in a mental health facility. Tracy, who was molested as a child by her uncle, developed DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder and Lauren was born … and Tracy died. Forever. In Darkness Rising, Lauren escapes from the facility and a new story takes hold. The author chose the perfect place for Lauren to hide out. After meeting a woman on a site called Perfect Pals, Lauren, who has disguised herself and now answers to the name Audrey, goes to work for Emily on her farm. At this point, the intrigue is dialed up several notches. Emily is studying criminal psychology and has a collection of books on various serial killers — including several about the Yorkshire Slasher.This novel is told in the first person … which is the only way a story like this should be narrated … from the killer’s mind to the page. Harryman spares no detail and allows the nuances of the Yorkshire Slasher’s deviant thoughts to unnerve the reader, not only in understanding the pleasure she derives from her heinous acts, but also allowing the reader to share an uncomfortable closeness with the victims as they realize what is happening … or about to happen. As I read, I was on edge. While the Yorkshire Slasher continued to handpick her victims, I wondered: What about Emily, her friend and criminal psychology student? Did she know? Did she suspect? Would she be next? While this book is a sequel, it can be read as a stand-alone, but I recommend both.

Historically, I found it fascinating to learn about how women suspected of witchcraft were treated: brutally and without remorse. The scenes in the court and the jail/gaol were so well crafted that I could see them unfold in front of me.

Sally Cronin has a true talent for marrying depth and simplicity and making it look easy. Each poem in this wonderful collection is preceded by a photograph followed by a poem that complements it so naturally. What really impressed me was that the author so easily packs solid truths into poems of so few words. As a reader, I could tell how much thought went into every single word she chose as a brush to paint her stories. There wasn’t one poem that I didn’t read two or three times to fully enjoy its message.I knew I would love this book with the very first poem, “Washed Up,” showing us the beauty of an object brought to the shore by the sea … one that should have disrupted the scenery, yet oddly enhanced it.I also loved the poem “Our Legacy” that offered a simple truth about writers. It should be an anthem. “Silver Lining to Isolation” brought forth truths that I believe most of the world can understand right now. I really appreciated the positive message in what has been a dark, yet revealing/enlightening time for many.“The Crocodile,” which I won’t explain, was just entirely spot on. I’ll leave that there. “Advancing Years” is another poem upon which I heap similar praise: it was so eerily, yet stunningly, on target.While most of this glorious poetry is short, its messages are far more poignant than much longer works I have read. I don’t want to mention every poem, but I want to say that I so related to Sally Cronin’s thoughts on climate change, ageism, immortality, and yearning. Lastly, I especially loved the poetry, preceded by the author’s youthful photos, that so brilliantly captured moments of her early life as skillfully as the photos themselves did. They all resonated so deeply with me. This is a book one could read (and look at the photographs) over and over and each time, the reader would find a new tidbit or truth not seen before. A truly lovely collection. Kudos to Ms. Cronin with a short message:.

A far more respectable man, David, who has a wife and another grown daughter, is her true biological father. Kirsty meets David and his family, but she is nervous about revealing too much, fearing her past might be too much for her new family to accept.Rick, who now is out of prison, wastes no time in making trouble in every way he can … and Kirsty is a wreck.No more about the plot, only to say that it is intricately woven with lots of interesting and quirky characters … paired with all the craziness that life has to offer.

Unfortunately, I’ve never experienced any since. But somehow, the fascination has remained with me all of these years. And so, reading about author Valerie Poore’s journey with her partner, Koos, and her descriptions of the many locks they encountered through Belgium and France, fascinated me anew.This was an immensely enjoyable read. I learned so much about what it is like to live on their boat, the Hennie Ha, what amenities they enjoyed, and which ones were a bit more difficult to come by. I was especially interested in what it takes in some places just to have a shower. And even though I’m not a coffee drinker, I loved reading about how different it is in various locales.I loved all of the local color … from the waitress in her 80s to the one in her 90s … to the ephemeral friendships … to the story about a donkey and a carrot. (You’ll have to read the book to completely enjoy this one.)The author has a wonderful way of bringing the reader onboard. In one place, from the boat, she was admiring a beautiful white house on the land. But then she writes: “Envy floods me for a moment and then ebbs away. While it must be wonderful to have such a home, here on the water I feel I am the lucky one.” I felt that passage really summed up so much about her life and her love of living on the water. I was very touched by it.There are links throughout the book to the author’s Flickr page with photos covering much of what was described in each chapter. That was absolutely wonderful to see, and I really appreciated the maps showing both the routes both coming and going.I highly recommend the book: a terrific armchair journey or perhaps a guide book for a future trip. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jun 26, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/34383760-faring-to-france-on-a-shoe

While it sounds so cliché, this novel grabbed my attention from the first page and gripped me until the very end. The story begins in 1911, when we are introduced to Winifred, who works in a grocer’s shop with her miserable mother, Ethel. Winifred’s life changes when she meets an Irish girl, Honora, who pulls her into the Suffragettes cause … and one where she meets her friend’s handsome brother, Conal. Winifred’s life is suddenly more colorful, and happier, though it is also fraught with risk. Before she can enjoy what she sees as a new life, circumstances send her back to the shop with her condescending and cruel mother.The reader is also introduced to Bill, rough around the edges. When he sees Winifred, he is determined that she is the one for him … and enraged to find her heart belongs to someone else. I don’t want to give away this finely executed and beautifully paced story. It is rich with color, emotion, and details that play out like a film on the page.

Her stories cover far more areas than I’ve just mentioned, and even the shortest ones pack a wallop the reader probably won’t seeing coming.In “Family Function,” a family wedding has added “enhancements” that are anything but favorable to some, and for good reason.

The tension and stress the author created was far too real … and all too common.In “Going Home,” three siblings drive to their childhood home together … with conflicting results that brilliantly mirror life as it is.

That said, I’m always fascinated to learn about other times in history, especially through the stories of those (both fictional and real) who lived in those times.This book (series, actually) came highly recommended to me. The ninth-century, when the Danes raided Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, is a time that I had only the vaguest knowledge about, emphasis on the word “vague.” The author’s extraordinary and rich storytelling was as gripping to me as it was educational.It was especially interesting to learn how the status of a person could drastically change depending on events that transpired … such as being the son of a King in Mercia to a thrall to a Dane. Relationships are always complex things, ever-changing, especially when they are not established as mutual choice of both parties, and when circumstances completely transform a child’s life and determine his or her future. The author beautifully weaves Issues of loyalty, trust, and revenge into her characters, as these are most certainly central themes in history.What I really enjoyed what that I learned so much but never felt that the author was putting in a lot of boring detail for the sake of it, yet, in the telling of this story, she infused such rich detail and even for a reader like me who knows so little about this time, I never was without a visual in my head – the mark of a great storyteller like Millie Thom.When time permits, I want to read more in this series.

Having read this author’s work before, finding her books both well written, interesting, and humorous, the dedicated dog parent in me couldn’t resist this one. The author’s story of her beloved dog, Sindy, resonated with me in so many ways. First, after being reluctant to adopt this dog, she realized in no time that this was one very special canine pup with, what some might say, exceptional needs and neuroses. Adopting a dog is a different experience for everyone, but when you get a dog who has been abused in her formative first four months of life, one can expect the unexpected.Valerie Poore beautifully expresses her frustrations, victories and defeats, and the lengths that she went to for this very spirited dog, who never allowed a day to be dull. While the dog owner in me sighed at all of the crazy things Sindy did, I also knew that if Sindy had been my dog, I would have fallen every bit in love with her. No question. As a matter of fact, I kind of fell in love just reading this book.Writing this , as I reflect back on what I read, isn’t easy. There’s so much that I can relate to with my own animals, and while there are experiences that I don’t share, I can still picture myself in the author’s place and feel what is in her heart as she tells this beautiful story.

Noor, in her teens, had no experience with men, but Robert, several years her senior, had plenty with women. As soon as their wedding night, things go wrong and Robert finds comfort in his “past.” And the story moves full speed ahead from there and, as to coin a cliché, the plot thickens. What I really liked so much about this novel was the author’s superb historical storytelling, from which I learned quite a bit, and the intensity of her distinct cast of characters. They were headstrong, passionate, determined, angry, intimidating, violent, loving, and much more. As the story evolved, the characters really made the plot come alive. I loved the story of Robert and Noor … and the battles (literally!) that they had to fight as their nascent relationship progressed and blossomed. But their story was far from the only one, and the intriguing secondary characters, who also “came alive” on the page, added even more depth this absorbing tale.

(And that’s the short list.) Through the darkness, there is broken glass (literally and figuratively), and the light does stream in, often with great humor and in defiance of the norms.Seen through a lens of honesty and pain (often self-torment), we see and feel this character as he longs to be a writer … one so masterful that he will make the public suffer by offering no more of himself once they have recognized his greatness. He just needs to get that pinnacle. The urge claws at every bit of him, refusing to let him settle into mediocrity. Snubbing his nose at the self-published writers he sees in his Twitter feed (and their preferred methods of blatant self-promotion), he recoils in horror as he watches how these writers turn themselves into everything he loathes and nothing he ever wishes to emulate.

The storytelling is beautiful and haunting and the descriptions of the character’s life in various areas of Australia could not be more disparate.

Living in Malibu, California, she’s just earned her doctoral degree and the possibilities are endless. When she finds her boyfriend has been cheating on her, the crossroads get a bit more twisty … fast. So, when Gemma is presented with an opportunity to go to England and help her cousin compete for the opportunity to have her ancestral home, Cherrywood Manor, become the setting for a new British period drama series, Gemma welcomes the opportunity. Once she arrives, the memory of her cheating boyfriend begins to fade, especially as she meets Kyle, and the mutual attraction is immediate.

Of course, this book would have been just as good if written years ago, but now, there is an extra layer of fear as events are just too close for comfort.The wasteland is a place where people have gone to escape the structured world of megacities (where free speech is outlawed and the government watches everyone) or the Hope villages where the otherwise homeless are housed. Though life in the wasteland is tough … for many it is better than the alternative. But how long can it last?

Not only is it difficult for a person to feel any sense of safety, but also, things are often far from what they seem to be. The fates of the characters swerve like an out-of-control driver on a busy street. The characters play a dangerous game, but the worst part of it is that they don’t know the rules … and sometimes … if even for a brief moment … losing can look like winning … and vice versa.

I don’t want to give away any spoilers about the story itself. What I can say is that Tony’s character really appealed to me. I found Tony very true-to-life and unlike many people in the real world, he isn’t afraid to take a second look at his flaws and to be introspective and honest with himself. The author has created a multi-faceted character who I think will probably become even more interesting as he steps into a formal role as PI in future books.In additional to Tony’s character, Congel did a great job with the supporting characters.

Let’s just say that I planned to read for an hour tonight, but ended up reading for over four hours because I just had to finish the book. What makes Hawes’s fiction exceptional for me are the colorful characterizations, especially six-foot tall, cigar-smoking, no-time-for nonsense, quite-willing-to-break-the-law-when-she-needs to, madeira-loving redheaded detective, Justina “Tina” Wright. Her brother Harry, the narrator of the book, is no slouch either.

She is excited by the prospect of moving into a gorgeous barn that will be renovated for them as they begin their lives together.Almost immediately, the idyll Holly has expected is tarnished. Nathan’s surrogate brother, Kyle, clearly seems to dislike her, and unsettling events begin to happen, one after another. I was immediately drawn into Holly’s predicament: she suspects Kyle is behind the events, but Nathan’s loyalty is him is great, and Nathan brushes off her concerns. In a situation like that, how far can you push? Not exactly the honeymoon she had expected.I don’t want to say too much about the story itself, but rather, my reaction to it. The tension was ever-present and I could relate to Holly as she struggled to reconcile her marriage along with the many unexpected and unfortunate surprises. I felt a range of emotions, and kept contemplating what I would do in Holly’s shoes. The author did a great job of capturing relationship dynamics that are quite common and relatable, yet unique in many relationships. As the story progresses, more is revealed about the past, and what may or may not explain the present. Holly searches for clues and pieces of unexpected information present themselves. Only unlike with a jigsaw puzzle, there is no neat way to put all of the pieces together to see the picture. There are many themes in this book that are ever-present in our lives: trust, betrayal, forgiveness, anger, uncertainty, and of course, suspicion.

And everything keeps getting worse … and worse … and then, when we try to fix the pain … it becomes even more overpowering.

Had I read it ten years ago, it would have also been an excellent read, only I would have read it with a different mindset. Today, I hope that the dystopian society that Terry Tyler has so brilliantly created will never be more than speculation. The author has created a frightening, yet chillingly believable picture of what could happen if we’re not careful. Set in the UK, in the very near future (2024), a virus breaks out that only a small number of the population is inoculated against. Death comes quickly to many, through illness and murder … and a popular social network is looking far nefarious than neighborly. And there’s more … so much more.Tyler paints a realistic portrait of how quickly a functioning, semi-civilized, and internet-dependent society can fall apart, reminding us all, against our wishes perhaps, that we need to remember how very fragile our lives are and how the world as we know it can fade away. Even one character’s reliance on emojis to convey her feelings is something she’s learning to do without. For it’s the small things as well as the big things … the things you never even realized were an integral part of your existence. This is one example of how nuanced Tyler’s storytelling is: she really zeroes in the characters’ forced metamorphoses and all that goes along with them.This is the third book I have read by this author, and I keep returning to her because her style is powerful and on point. She doesn’t waste words and she creates multi-dimensional characters that compel the reader to pay attention to them. It is clear that she has done her homework: studying society, social media, and how those in power can drastically change it all. I look forward to continuing with this series. I know the characters have many more stories to tell, but what I appreciated about this book, even though it is #1 in a series of four books, I didn't feel like I was left without answers.

Living the “online life,” Lita is tuned in to the nation’s politics. She becomes increasingly uneasy by the policies of Prime Minster Guy Morrissey and his fitness guru wife, Mona, who, like Lita, has a large social media presence. Although Lita and her friends are happy in their private flat, she cannot help but be concerned about the Hope Villages, homeless compounds that are owned by a US corporation called Nutricorp, that are suddenly dotting the landscape and offering services that some might see as too good to be real. It’s a good thing they are secure in their flat …Only pages into this book, I found myself feeing unnerved by Lita’s narrative. In one respect it was intimate, in another, chilling. As rumors about life at the Villages began to increase, so did my anxiety. There was nothing in the story that I believed could never happen, and much that is way close to events that are already happening. Hope isn’t the kind of thriller with shoot-outs and car chases, but a psychological thriller and cautionary tale paced ever so delicately, with just the right balance of hope and despair, that it keeps the reader off-kilter. If my schedule had allowed for it, I might have read this book in one sitting, as it was that engrossing and that gripping.

I wondered what life on a barge might be like and decided to give this book a whirl.From beginning to end, I found it a fascinating and delightful read. I never believed that living on any kind of a barge or boat was an easy thing, but even more so, I never imagined what might be involved in buying an historic barge and restoring it into a livable home. But what I believed to be true was confirmed many times over: it is a labor of love and a whole lot of work. Not work one can do and forget about, but work that is ongoing and forever. I also have newfound respect for exactly how much weather (especially winter weather) can impact a ligger’s (harbor resident) life. For example, I never thought about how scary it could be just getting on and off a barge in bad weather. Just reading the number of things the author had to contend with was amazing, but it all made sense, and the joy in all of it was evident. No matter who we are, any of us go to great lengths to follow our passion.The book was well written, sprinkled with self-deprecating humor. I especially enjoyed one story about shopping for supplies (big supplies), adopting and living with the author’s trash-loving dog, Sindy, and so much more. Lastly, I loved the photos at the end of each chapter and I was especially happy to find an epilogue that updated the reader on stories (both happy and sad) since this book was initially written, explained many terms used in the book, and generally wrapped everything up very nicely.

Within these standalone stories, are slices of life, of humanity infected by the inhumane, and portraits of people dealing with a dying world they have never known.Even the prepper who was planned for years, no longer knows what to do with himself. I was quite intrigued by this story because I always wondered why anyone would want to be a prepper, and as our world hasn’t quite reached a doomsday scenario, I was very interested that the author chose to explore this subject.Well-written and insightful, Tyler’s stories captured many end-of-life scenarios for everyday situations: how to deal with a cheating girlfriend, deciding whether to unburden oneself to a dying sibling with a hurtful truth, and creating a brilliant new Twitter hash tag in a world where there is no Twitter. #horrorsindeedAs the author notes at the end, these stories are a sidestep from her Post-Apocalyptic Project Renova series, which I hope to read in the future.

The story intrigued me from the start as New Yorker Renee Dutten witnesses a mob hit, enters Witness Protection, and moves into a colorful camper, as Chloe Barnard, at a campground in Ohio. Having grown up in foster care, Chloe has little to leave behind, but she has a whole lot ahead of her … all brand new … and all of it scary.Quickly and unexpectedly, she finds herself falling for Aiden Gerrod, but her world is topsy-turvy and she now has to remember that she has a new identity and she must act in accord with it. Of course, that’s easier said than done. But it’s not just her safety at risk, but Aiden’s, too. There are lots of colorful people in Chloe’s new neighborhood (the campground) and some odd goings-on. She isn’t sure who to trust or who might be watching her, but she’s sure of one thing: she’s falling in love … and it’s mutual … and the pull is magnetic!I’d read less than half of the book and finding a break in my day, I picked it up to read for another half hour. That didn’t work. It was such a great story that I read all the way to the very end. I won’t give anything away, but the author did a fantastic job of building suspense with twists, turns, and surprises. And of course, romance.A really delightful read!

From page one to the very end, RJ McDonnell’s Rock & Roll Homicide is an engaging and delightful book. When Doberman Stub musician Terry Tucker is killed by exploding headphones, Jason Duffy, a former musician and fledgling PI, is hired to find the killer. Because she stands to inherit a fortune, Tucker’s widow, Chelsea, is the premier suspect, and wants Jason Duffy to find the person who killed her husband.Rather than repeat a synopsis that anyone can read above, I prefer to write about why I enjoyed this book so much. Author McDonnell has created a likeable, funny, clever, insightful, and human character with the young Duffy. As a PI with a new practice, eager to prove himself, he dives into the Tucker investigation. But he needs the help of his father, a retired San Diego PD detective with whom he’s been on the outs. I really enjoyed the banter between the two as the story evolves.There isn’t a dull moment in the book. The story moves along at a hearty clip, and there are plenty of colorful characters that I could picture almost as if I were watching a movie. I loved the suspense. It kept me reading and sometimes laughing. There was one scene involving a shower that was particularly artful, but that’s all I’ll say. This was a really enjoyable book for anyone who likes mysteries.

Everything as she knows it changes quickly and not for the best, but after she leaves her hometown, her life takes a turn for the better. But what happened on prom night still haunts her … in ways she can't understand. Her nagging memories … her questions … her fear … are always there in one form or another.Swann writes beautifully. Her characters are distinct and her fluid and colorful writing draws the reader into each scene.

As the story begins, department store heiress/socialite and shopaholic Natalie Dashwood waits on a very demanding (and good-looking) customer — who is much more than he appears to be. I won't re-hash the synopsis, but rather, will say a few words about why I enjoyed Prada and Prejudice so much.The book has wonderful humor and multiple story arcs that feature the various characters who run the very old, dignified, staid (and failing) Dashwood and James department store, in desperate need of a makeover on every level. Mirroring real life, all of the stories in this delightful novel merge today into one bigger story with lots of twists and turns..The characters are so much fun (and a bit evil), and the issues they deal with ring true to me, which only served to pull me into the book and made me care about them.The term ""page-turner"" may be a bit of a cliché, but honestly, I couldn't stop reading.

I read it in one sitting: the characters and the story grabbed my attention and didn't let go.Sometimes when things go wrong in our lives, rather than sitting around stewing and playing the same tape over and over in our heads, we decide to take radical measures. And that's exactly what Alexandra Henry did when her marriage ended. She signed up for a program that would put her on an island for seven days with someone equally in need of a personal renaissance. Quite the risky proposition, having no idea who would be joining her, but Alex was up for the challenge of having a male stranger help her to regain trust again in the opposite sex.​ Would she be able to do the same for him?​This was such a fun story. Jan Romes is such a witty writer, but this sweet romance also had a lot of poignant moments to remind the reader that we all have our scars, fears, and painful memories.

In book one, four suddenly single women in their forties meet at a cash-for-gold event, and in book three, the fab foursome decide to leave Ohio and take over a bread-and-breakfast in Maine. The trip to Maine is eventful, hilariously so, and there’s lots of action after the women arrive in Maine. Not only do they each strive to find their individual path in life, but they work together to figure out how to they’re going to successfully run a business together. This is a terrific read for those looking for a lot of laughs and a good escape from life. But don’t let the laughs fool you; these women couldn’t be more serious about their connection to and love for one another.

The narrator’s voice is sarcastic and sadistic, keenly observant of every nuance in her midst as she plots her next murder, with the prowess of a hungry animal licking its lips in delightful anticipation.Most of the victims work at a York department store, and as more of them are savagely killed, a tight-knit group of women fear for their own lives, scrambling to keep themselves safe.

Schwindt’s characterization of burnt-out social worker Tony Price was just too charming, in a dark sort of way, to pull away from. And even though I have no ties to the world of social work, the feeling the author captured with Price’s worn out, sarcastic, take-no-prisoners attitude is relatable to pretty much any field of endeavor one can grow weary of working in.In the last book in this exceptional series, twenty years have passed since Book Two.

The author really taps into the bond of friendship and loyalty, illustrating this beautifully and with the continued adventures of Steph, Tawny, Grace, and Elaina. Not only do these women have one each other's backs, they also live together, adding lots of flavor to Sipping Sangria.Romes has a real penchant for crafting witty dialogue. The book had many loud-out-loud moments for me.

The book is narrated in multiple points of view from the main characters. From page one, I identified with “Kate” who wakes up in a hospital bed having no idea who she is. When she meets Liam, the man whom she’s told is her husband, she doesn’t believe that she’s ever seen him before. Her gut isn’t buying the story she’s been told. But there are photos of her wedding and much more … so, she has no choice but to go with him. Before she even leaves the hospital, she knows this is not a nice man. He insists that she wear heels, designer clothing, and makeup … just to go home. And that’s only the beginning …Because the book was written in multiple POVs, the reader gets a bird’s eye view of exactly how evil Liam is: what he has done to get what he wants, what he will do, and how his sick, sociopathic mindset places no value on anyone’s life but his own.I really enjoyed the author’s storytelling, characters, and wit.

It is amazing to note that some of the poet’s earlier work was translated from Swedish. Even in her teen years, Haskins wrote with the insight and depth of a person who has been on the earth for many more years.Poetry is so difficult to . One almost has to be a poet (which I am not) to clearly articulate the feelings given to the reader as a gift from the poet.Quite appropriately, this collection opens with poems about a new life—childbirth being born. The poet writes these poignant slices of life with delicate perfection.As I slowly read through this collection, I was so taken by the work that I read many of the poems two or three times. GRANDMOTHER was one of these poems: fragile, exquisite, true-to-life, sad, relatable, and real. IN THE FOREST was another favorite because of its extraordinary imagery.In END OF THE WORLD and LOST, I was captivated because of the way the poet softly lets the reader feel her pain.IN SCHOOL was special to me because of the memories and pain it brought to mind, feelings that I think most of us relate to in one way or another.WEATHERED, with its words shrouded in sadness, was another that touched me deeply and I loved the descriptive DRAGON.HAWK, for me, had such insightful meaning and RAPUNZEL, with its poetic storytelling, had me imagining a glorious scene from a film.In her poem, TRESPASSERS WILL, Haskins writes: “Sometimes I think you know everything about me, and sometimes I am sure that you know nothing at all.”I believe most all of us know someone to whom these words. Another line I loved came from the poem IN A RUT: “only crumbled time like stale bread in front of the benches in the park,”I could go on, but my feelings/responses/reactions about/to these wonderful poems won’t mean much unless you read this collection for yourself.

With his dry (no pun intended) wit and unapologetic truths, he starts by explaining why, at 53 years old, he reached a point in his life where he could no longer deny his alcoholism and the havoc it was wreaking on his life.Checking into rehab was an adventure from day one. Leaving behind his job as a yoga instructor and his work as a freelance writer, he headed to Florida for what turned out to be a three-month stint in rehab. With his sharp eye for the eccentricities of his fellow human beings, Dinsmoor paints a colorful portrait of a man working his way through the process of rehabilitation. He’s not only honest about his perceptions of those he interacts with, but he’s unafraid to bare his own truths. And that’s what made this book so engaging.

I would give it six stars if I could.Doreen Cox’s story is one that resonates with so many of us. It is never easy to watch our parents or loved ones grow old, but when dementia and/or myriad other conditions or diseases present, not only is it painful to see, but many become caregivers to those they love. Caregivers must tend to every aspect of her/his loved one’s care. There is nothing easy about it.Adventures in Mother-Sitting, a book written from Doreen Cox’s journals during her three years as her mother’s caregiver, offers something very special to the reader.I don’t wish to write a synopsis of this book; I simply want to explain why I found this book to be extraordinary, and why I recommend it to anyone who has gone or will be going through a similar experience: past, present, or future.First, AIM is beautifully written; Doreen Cox is a gifted writer. Second, this is an honest memoir. The author was not afraid to bare her soul, expose her fears, or question her perceived shortcomings. But what really resonated with me, and the reason I so emphatically recommend this book, is because of Cox’s ability to take soul-crushing situations and turn them into joyful memories. That said, because the author chose to see the glass as half full and cherish every moment she could, doesn’t mean she didn’t get angry, break down, or cry like any sentient human being.After reading the author’s story, where roles were reversed and her mother became her child, it is my great wish that this book will become known to the masses, because I so strongly believe that it could serve as a guiding hand to millions in similar situations. While caring for a mother with dementia is profoundly sad, Doreen Cox created an uplifting environment that no doubt brought joy to her mother and extraordinary comfort to herself.

So I really loved the premise of Coincidences. As a young woman raised by a single mother, Alice has always been curious about her father, but a series of events triggers an even more urgent need to learn more—not only about her father, but about all of her family. Alice had always believed that hers was simply a case of not knowing the father who left, but there were far more secrets than she imagined.Despite the protestations of her mother, who didn’t want to see her hurt (and had her own concerns), Alice courageously put herself in some very vulnerable positions to get the answers she needed. And as most of us know, that’s easier said than done. As I read, I wondered what I would do in her shoes and what I wouldn’t do.Coincidences is an interesting and thought-provoking read: a very real and human story.

What seems like it should be so easy: isn’t.The relationships between the characters were so very real and relatable … painfully so at times. The story is beautifully written, taking the reader on a parallel journey to where life unexpectedly takes us all. I really look forward to reading the rest of this series. This book was too enjoyable not to do so. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 29, 2018","Feb 17, 2018","Oct 20, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22713669-meredith-out-of-the-darkness

She can’t stop thinking about John, the eighteen-year-old boy she was crazy about when she was a mere fourteen. She’s got a lot on her mind, but what she doesn’t know is that there’s a sociopath on the loose, just released from prison, who is has quickly become a serial killer as payback to the DA who put him away. Having obsessed about murder for years, he’s eager to kill all of the women on his list and anyone else who gets in his way.The author does a fantastic job of introducing us to the various and disparate characters in her book, then skillfully piecing all of their stories together as a suspenseful, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat story unfolds.

I don’t think a day goes by where I don’t read one chilling account after another in the news—and those are cases where the abusers were caught. And even in many of those cases, justice does not always prevail. Worse, a staggering number of abuse cases stay hidden in the shadows and way too many people who work hard to keep them there. Taylor Evan Fulks isn’t one of them. My Prison Without Bars is a novel based on a true story of child sexual abuse. The little girl in this story, brutally abused by her stepfather while her mother turned a blind eye, grew up to be a courageous woman who wants the world to know what it’s really like to be abused. Why? So that people will see the horror of this abuse for what it really is and the perpetrators of this abuse for the monsters they are. Too many cases are swept under the rug, whitewashed, forgiven, forgotten, and excused because people do not understand the true horror experienced by the survivors or because they simply wish to deny it happened. To understand the true purpose of this book is to understand why the incidents in the book are described so graphically. While the book is a fictionalized account of a true story, the abuse is all too real.This is not a book one can read passively. The story doesn’t allow it. Ms. Fulks has written a raw, gripping, descriptive, powerful, and sadly, believable story. On every page of this book, I could feel the author’s anger, her fear, her sadness, her hurt, her rage, and her love. My Prison Without Bars isn’t an easy read. Be forewarned.

My reading time is so limited and for me to commit to an entire series, it has got to be a great read.I loved the first book in this series, With Good Behavior. The two main characters, Sophie Taylor (a psychologist) and Grant Madsen (a Navy man), are both paroled from prison. They’re two good people who should have never been in prison, but for two very different reasons, both courtesy of the Barbieri crime family (Grant’s family), they each served time. They meet in their parole officer’s waiting room and the story takes off from there.Lane has done a terrific job in moving seamlessly from With Good Behavior to Bad Behavior. In this second novel, she writes just enough to remind the reader what they read in the first novel or to initiate a reader who hasn’t read the first book. As in most series, they’re better enjoyed if you read all books, but this book would be very readable on its own.The characters are well defined, and the story is well paced and always on the move from one place to another. Something is always happening both with the emotional growth of the characters as well as the action. I’m quite interested in psychology, so I was not only pulled in by the story, but I learned more about the psychology via the two characters who are clinical practitioners.

They meet outside their mutual parole officer’s door and the story begins. They’re flawed, likeable, endearing and immediately attracted to one another.

I enjoyed all three stories for different reasons, but what impressed me the most is that they all made me think … wonder … about the thin line that separates the past and the present—reality from imagination. Savva’s stories make us think about things people do, good and bad, and how actions always have a ripple effect that lead into the future and beyond. There is always a connection—and even if it is not sought, that connection has a way of making itself known. Warning: you may get a chill after reading the last words of these stories.

Thirty-two year-old Jamie breaks up with her boyfriend of five years, Derek. Although she never regrets the decision, she is left with a void in her life that needs filling. When the TV talk show that she works for decides to do a story on finding old loves, Jamie decides that finding her first love, Lucas, will be just what the doctor ordered to bring true love back into her life. I loved this book for many reasons. 1) The author is hilarious. 2) The book is well written. 3) Jamie evolves as she goes on her adventure to find love (and evolving is a very good thing.) 4) The author isn’t afraid to get real, and Jamie’s emotions, insecurities, daydreams, nightmares, and moments of sheer, unadulterated panic are all very relatable…and insightful.

Although it is not a long book, the shorts are powerful and every word matters. I am such a fan of this author because she intensely cares about teen issues: bullying, suicide, self-mutilation, grief, love, and much more. She steps out of the way and lets her character, Katie McCabe, explore her feelings, describe her pain, and make impossible decisions. And that is precisely why Katie is so believable and why her words so easy captivate the reader.In between the shorts, there is author commentary that I found very enlightening and helpful. Gardner-Griffie also took the time to include resources that related to the various shorts. Again, her passion for teen issues is clear.

This beautifully written novel really captures the life of one woman, Liz Rose, and all that she did for (and in reaction to) the actions of the man she loved. Swann beautifully weaves in the protagonist’s best friends and family members in a story that adeptly mirrors the maze called life.What I really liked so much about this novel, written in the first person, is that author Swann wrote a nuanced portrayal of a woman’s life and love, which was fully of irony, karma, surprises, disappointments, regret, guilt, and so much more.

Dean Mayes writes about a young aboriginal girl, Ruby, a gifted violinist on the streets of Adelaide, who, like her grandmother, Virginia, despite difficult life circumstances, knows how to make amazing music.The novel is very well constructed, and Mayes goes back and forth between Ruby’s childhood days and her grandmother’s (in the 1950s), with great fluidly, thus enhancing the story by telling two stories side by side. Mayes has given a great deal of thought to all of his characters, thus painting a comprehensive, and often deeply disturbing portrait of a family at the peak of the divisive White Australia Policy and the ripple effect for generations to come.I really enjoyed the author’s first novel, The Hambledown Dream, and I was quite delighted by the way this book was interwoven into Gifts of the Peramangk.

Chinese American attorney Fiona Yu, loses her virginity to a silicone dildo coated in two-percent Lidocaine gel and decides she must get her hymen restored. The plastic surgeon, specializing in hymen restoration, who greets her in the office, turns out to be a childhood friend, Sean. And Sean did some pretty crazy stuff back in school.Fiona, “half in love with Sean,” is trying to get the message to her father that she has no interest in marrying a Chinese man and having babies. Sean, as it turns out, liked to kill people. That doesn’t bother Fiona, who decides to “do God’s work” as well when people get in her way.This book was sort of a hybrid of black humor, stand-up comedy, a commentary on Chinese culture, serial killers and the story of a young woman. As I read, I wasn’t sure how I would rate it or what I thought of it. I had different opinions in different chapters. But it moved at a fast pace and had no drawn out or boring parts. Not always my kind of humor, but it moved along.The author is talented and irreverent. This is the kind of book that some people are going to love and some are going to hate. And maybe both.And that was me. Be your own judge. 3.5 stars. No, make that 4 stars. No 5. No, 2. No, it was pretty good. Yeah, I'll stick with 3.5.

And one night, while driving along the cliff of a dangerous road, his road rage toward another driver escalates into the unthinkable — murder. What happens to a man who tries to escape the anger issues of his youth and now has committed murder, by chance? How does he reconcile that within himself? Nigel, though he goes on living, withdraws from life and from his marriage. As the years go on, his haunting takes on new forms. He is left wondering what is real and what is not. I read this book in three sittings, but had time permitted, I could have read it in one. Maria Savva did a brilliant job building suspense, painting a portrait of a haunted man, and evenly pacing the novel so that it remained a constant thriller throughout.

How long they lived in one town depended on what man Lucinda had hooked up with and on what bills she was skipping out on. By the time they arrive in a Four Corners, Montana trailer park, they have a string of addresses behind them: shelters, projects, rundown motels and apartments. It is Katelyn's plan to hold on until she turns eighteen, when she can legally wrest her younger brother from the woman who gave birth to them and little else. Katelyn comforts Kevin by telling him that their ""someday soon"" will come.There are so many things about this book I really liked. Katelyn and Kevin's sister/brother bond was special. The characters were distinct and the situations and dialogue believable. Like many kids with abusive parents, no matter how bad it gets, Katelyn tries to minimize the damage and stay strong.

Each story features a character in a wheelchair, and whether gay or straight, their stories of love are honest, real, and human. Each author gives us a glimpse into her/his world, into a new perspective, and into a unique, thought-provoking story.Already a fan of Christy Leigh Stewart's, I was swept up by the tale she wove in ""Bad Hotel Art"". Her writing always makes me smile. Another favorite story was ""Meet Cutie"" by D.C. Graham. I not only enjoyed the solid writing, but weeks later, I'm still thinking about the ending. Another favorite was ""Fire on Babylon"" by Amanda Dier. Her characters drew me in and made me care about their happiness. Truly, each author in this anthology brings something special.The characters in Accessible Love Stories have challenges that many of us never think about because we haven't had to do so. I love that this book was published and I hope that it is followed by many more books like this that include wonderful, interesting people that we don't always meet in books.

This gifted writer’s third book in her acclaiI have so many wonderful things to say about LK Gardner-Griffie’s Tattered; I’m not sure where to begin. This gifted writer’s third book in her acclaimed Misfit McCabe series is masterfully written. Her superb use of the English language to tell a story puts Tattered (and its predecessors) high on the shelf with the classic books of our youth that are passed down from one generation to the next. Simply put: Gardner-Griffie’s books are written to stick around for a long time.Spirited Katie McCabe doesn’t go looking for trouble, but it finds her. Navigating the world is tough for any teen, but for orphaned Katie, who lives with her Uncle Charley, finding her place in the world has its special challenges. The author is not only spot on with her teen characterizations, but also with the issues that plague so many teens today: bullying, peer pressure, censorship, cutting, relationships, drinking, and so many more. One of the highlights of this book (and there are many) is when Katie learns that a local “morality” group has decided that many classic books, such as To Kill A Mockingbird should be banned from the library. The group is not satisfied with just a ban; their uneducated fury escalates into a book burning and Katie plays a leading role in stopping them, but not without consequences. Gardner-Griffie’s storytelling not only excels, but she is a responsible author, taking the time to fully research what she writes. The stinging reality of her stories is a testament to the heart and soul that she puts into her work.Tattered, and Gardner-Griffie’s two previous books in this series, Misfit McCabe and Nowhere Feels Like Home are exceptional reads for both teens and adults alike. I cannot recommend these books more highly, and as a reader, I can’t wait for the next book in this standout series....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 23, 2012","Feb 19, 2012","Jan 23, 2012",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13138549-tattered

This is a terrific, easy-to-read book that covers nearly everything one could want to know about owning a cat: including but not limited to: choosing the right kitten or cat, creating a safe, healthy environment, training your cat, understanding cat behavior, recognizing (and preventing) illnesses and health issues, addressing litter box issues, introducing animals to one another, dispelling common myths about cats, learning about different breeds, and so much more. For the person who is getting a cat for the first time, this is a book that will leave you feeling very confident that you have the knowledge to provide the healthiest and happiest home possible. For those who have had cats for many years, this book is a great refresher for what you do know and likely holds much information you probably don’t know. Author Darlene Arden has written a great reference book that is a delight to read straight through and to keep on your shelf as a reference book afterward.

Hale’s, NeIt is always a pleasure to  a novel that kept me absorbed from the first page to the last — which is exactly the case with Richard C. Hale’s, Near Death. After the tragic loss of his wife in a car crash, Jake Townsend is inconsolable. His beloved wife Beth appears in recurring dreams and is trying to send him a message he cannot quite decipher. Meanwhile, Jake has developed technology that might bring him closer to Beth, but at what cost?We live in a day and age where new technology does things that not too long ago we may have thought to be science fiction. That is exactly why Hale’s book was so gripping. Jake’s new technology, a machine that can produce video from the minds of those who have had near death experiences and come back to tell the tale, is riveting science fiction. Or is it a brilliant precursor of what is to come? Probably the former, but as a reader, I couldn’t help but explore the possibilities and to weigh the endless ethical/moral questions that go hand in hand with the use of new technology. Near Death is a fast-paced, romance-laced, thought-provoking, and highly entertaining novel with an intriguing premise. Hale doesn’t shortchange his readers on character development. The characters were well-defined, realistic, and had me simultaneously rooting for and against them.

Schultz’s work is honest, courageous, haunting, provocative, beautiful, and entirely relatable. The first part of the book, “Laments from the Darkness” takes the reader to a very personal place that most of us have visited. While writing of depression, sadness, lost love and so much more, Schultz embraces the darkness while wrapping her arms willingly around the pain. She speaks of truths that plague and define us all. In “Songs of the Light,” Schultz brings the reader along as she climbs out of the darkness, rediscovering nature’s miracles, letting go, finding love, and rejoicing over tiny bursts of sunlight that were previously unable to be seen or appreciated.The poet brilliantly explores the themes of darkness and light with glorious imagery and clarity of thought. Complementing Schultz’s words are paintings by Ruth Schultz Rudolf and photographs by Anton Mueller. All combine to make a truly special book.

But he always stood out in a positive light. John gives the reader exactly what he promises and only delivers information germane to the topic of his book.

By chance one day in Zurich, they meet artist Jonas Bergman, who had lost his beloved wife to cancer.

In this case, because of the nature of Chaz's story, I was curious to see how others had responded.

Everyone's story is different, but as Chaz says, it is very much what is between the ears that is important, not what is between the legs. As Chaz states, he chose to write this book (and agree to a documentary) because if he didn't, there was no way to avoid the tabloids. Better to take control over one's own story, for sure.The book was well written and well paced. I respect the choices Chaz has made and why he wants to keep some things private. Just because someone has chosen to write a memoir, I don't think that they need to reveal every last personal detail -- not at all.I don't agree with a lot of the s, but I'm not here to dispute them. For me, the book satisfied my curiosity and left me with the strong feeling that Chaz will remain very happy with his decision. I wish him well and admire his advocacy work a great deal.

Rather, I'll just say how much I enjoyed this paranormal love story that connected the lives of two men: Andy DeVries from Chicago and Denny Barrister from Australia to one woman: Sonya Llewellyn. This well-paced, beautifully written story touched my heart as I thought about just how plausible this story could be. Author Dean Mayes tells an engaging story about a love that refuses to die, allowing the reader to consider the possibilities that lie beyond our everyday definition of enduring love. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 29, 2012","Jun 30, 2012","Mar 28, 2011",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/7625196-the-hambledown-dream

Her emotions are too overpowering to live the life of a normal teen and she is without friends. However, Krista does have someone special: a boy who appears in her dreams every night, and who after a sudden move to Santa Cruz, California, turns out to be a living, breathing person, Mark, who has been having the same dreams. They recognize (and love) one another immediately.Additionally, at her new school in Santa Cruz, Krista meets another girl, Sam, who has the same connection with a boy named Shawn as she does with Mark. The four become acutely aware of their commonalities and begin searching for answers. Tiffany King keeps the suspense going as the characters explore the possibilities, unaware that danger is just around the corner.I’m so glad to know that the author is writing a sequel to this delightful book. The end of “Meant to Be,” while satisfying, also will serve well as the beginning to the next book in this YA Paranormal series. I look forward to the development of the characters and their further adventures. I have no doubt that Tiffany King has some exciting plans in the works. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 07, 2011","Jun 05, 2011","Mar 16, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10809019-meant-to-be

The author’s knowledge of the area of Canandaigua, the folklore of the Seneca Indians, is so real, that throughout the book, I felt as if I were standing invisible among the people of Canandaigua, watching myriad stories unfold around me. This is an author who cannot only write, but also who deeply understands the human spirit — what threatens it, what kills it, and what heals it. The story flows beautifully as the present and past lives of her character’s fight for their rightful place. As Echo O’Connell reunites with her first love, Grant Shongo, who she has not seen since she was seventeen, there is much to sort out. Secrets and spirits float through the air and every character has their pain, their regret, and their unique need for forgiveness.

I had never read any of Joseph Wambaugh’s Hollywood Station novels and was eager to do so.Wambaugh weaves the lives of the cops of Hollywood Station into the story. The reader gets a true-to-life taste of the craziness that a Hollywood cop sees in a typical night. In Los Angeles’ Hollywood Hills, there are a string of robberies going on by a teenage group of burglars known as “The Bling Ring.” Raleigh Dribble, an ex-con (fraud and tax evasion) takes a job working for a wealthy widow, Leona Brueger, and her fiancée, Rudy Ressler, a struggling B-list movie director, in her house in the Hollywood Hills. While the couple vacation in Italy, Raleigh, who is trying to stay on the straight and narrow, is approached by Beverly Hills gallery owner, Nigel Wickland, who has a surefire plot to make a million dollars. He wants Raleigh to allow him access to photograph two paintings that he will then replace with fakes. He tells Raleigh he has buyers for the originals in Europe and will cut him in on a 50/50 split after expenses.Raleigh, reluctant to get involved, eventually concedes to Wickland’s plan. Meanwhile, a couple of young drug addicts are casing the homes of Hollywood Hills, trying to emulate the actions of the “Bling Ring.” when they stumble upon the Brueger home while the painting switch is in action.Add the painting switch, the young drug-addicted burglars, greed, the motley cast of policemen and women, and the sights and sounds (and humor) of Hollywood, and you get the absorbing story that is Joseph Wambaugh’s Hollywood HillsWhat I especially liked about this book was that I got a great feel for the characters. In other books of this sort that I’ve read, the characters have not been as distinct as I would have liked, and the stories have been hard to follow. Wambaugh writes a rich, easy-to-follow stories with characters that are unique and memorable. This isn't a literary classic, but isn't supposed to be. It's an action-packed, page-turning story.

Charles Dickens’ “David Copperfield” is the author’s favorite book. He says “I am a fond parent to every child of my fancy, and that no one can ever love that family as dearly as I love them. But, like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.”“David Copperfield,” which was published in 1850 (Dickens began publishing stories in 1833), is the book that most mirrors his own life. David Copperfield is born to his widowed mother, Clara, and his looked after by this loving nurse, Peggotty. While still a young boy, David’s mother marries a dreadful man by the name of Murdstone, who along with his sinister sister, Miss Murdstone, make life miserable for young Davy. He is sent off to boarding school, and subsequently after his mother dies, Murdstone sends him to work in a factory.David finds his only living relative, his aunt Betsey Trotwood, (who calls him “Trotwood Copperfield” and life begins anew under her care and as he returns to school. This novel, told in the first person, takes the reader from David’s birth well into adulthood, effortlessly weaving many stories throughout which often beautifully connect with one another.It is not just the stories in this novel that make it so wonderful; it is also Dickens’ trademark colorful, larger-than-life, funny, cruel, outspoken, pathetic, sweet, eccentric, and outrageous characters. The people are all so vivid and memorable and the situations hilarious, poignant, remarkable, and sad. I laughed aloud so many times, especially at the character David Copperfield so hated, the skeletal, “umble,” and always writhing, Uriah Heep. This is truly not a  of Dickens’ book as much as it is my profession of love for this book. I’m glad I didn’t read it years ago; I might have forgotten too much. But truly, these are characters that I know will stay with me. It is rare that I choose (or make time) to read an 821-page book; this was worth it, indeed. I look forward, down the line, to reading more of Dickens’ work that I missed in earlier years....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 07, 2010","Dec 02, 2010","Nov 07, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1420751.David_Copperfield

As tThis is the second Ann Rule book that I've read, and remain impressed with the massive amount of work and research that goes into such a project. As the story of Liysa Northon, currently in prison for killing her husband Chris, is widely available, I'm not going to spend any time summarizing it. I have read some s that state that the language and context in this book is repetitive. While in one sense that is true, the list of people involved in this story is massive -- there are several pages in the beginning of this book listing the names of all of the people involved in this tragic tale.When I saw the long list, I wondered I might have trouble following the story, but I did not. I found it to be an easy and quick read, though naturally, disturbing. I think Rule was intentionally a bit repetitive at times just to keep the reader from getting lost. Maybe it's because she is so skilled as a true crime writer that she repeated names/situations more than necessary. It didn't bother me but I can see why some people would make mention of it.At any rate, I have great respect for this author.

This veryAfter reading Stuart Ross McCallum's Beyond My Control, I felt like I had just finished having a warm, open conversation with a good friend. This very personable author does a wonderful job of taking the reader through his twenty-year struggle with epilepsy.McCallum's first awareness of epilepsy began with peculiar auras that produced sensations unlike anything he'd ever known. As time went on, these auras became a warning that something much more serious was about to happen. McCallum then began to experience violent frightening episodes that not only threatened his well-being, but those around him. This was all the more terrifying as he could not remember the wild things he would do and say after the episodes had ended. They were, as the title of this memoir indicates, beyond his control.After much suffering, McCallum is eventually presented with the opportunity to consider seizure surgery -- and to consider the pros and cons of living with the most important decision of his life.What I most appreciated about this book was the author's deep love and gratitude toward his family and friends, especially his wife, Lisa. What I found extremely valuable in McCallum's story is that I learned much more about the full scope of epilepsy than I ever knew. This was truly a compelling, eye-opening story that was a true pleasure to read. It is an easy and engaging read by a true gentleman. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,Oct 2010,"Oct 06, 2010","Sep 25, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3398701-beyond-my-control

James and Pamela have been married for several years with two children. As an attorney Second Chances is a novel that mirrors so many people’s lives. James and Pamela have been married for several years with two children. As an attorney at a law firm run by partners who are brutal and unsympathetic toward their staff, James is put in a tough position to spend too much time away from his family. He knows that his wife Pamela hates his demanding work schedule and after-work obligations, but financial times are tough and new jobs are difficult to come by. And so, despite arguments about the situation, James goes on, doing what he believes is in the best interest of his family.One day, after another argument about the troubles that plague them, James is shocked to find a note from his wife saying that she has left and taken the kids. But Pamela hasn’t just run away from James, she has gone to confront something in her past that she has ignored for far too long.Author Maria Savva taps into common situations that so many couples find themselves in, especially in these hard times. Savva does a great job of painting the unreasonable, demanding men that James works for at the firm of Hornchurch, Bean & Co. There were several times that I wanted to jump into the novel and have several not-so-nice exchanges with these brutes.While I appreciated the story, I felt that too much time was spent on Pamela and James second-guessing each other and being upset over what they thought the other was thinking or doing. There were times when their respective insecurities, especially Pamela’s, were overwhelming to me, and even though I would argue that this reflects true life, I would have liked to see the couple spend more time trying to communicate better. But all in all, I am a fan of character-driven novels and quite enjoyed this book and its realistic premise. I also appreciated the author's humor and laughed aloud at a few of the situations in the story. I look forward to reading more from Maria Savva in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 12, 2010","Sep 25, 2010","Jul 11, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8530245-second-chances

When I began reading this “autobiography” about Brian Wilson’s life, I was pretty sure that I would probably rate it with three, probably four stars. So why the one star? I’ll tell you:This book by Brian Wilson, as told to Todd Gold, was at first, to me, quite an interesting read. While I had heard about Wilson’s struggle with mental illness and drugs, I had never known any of the details. So, it was quite eye opening to read Wilson’s account of his father, Murry Wilson’s lifetime of abuse and how it affected and tragically incapacitated Brian as a human being. In the midst of this abuse, Brian and the Beach Boys still found their stardom, with Brian responsible for the lion’s share of their success.Brian married his first wife Marilyn and they had two daughters, Carnie & Wendy. Brian was unable to be any kind of husband to Marilyn, much less a father to his girls. The book candidly details his ghastly life of drug addiction, food addiction, mental illness and literally his inability to function as a human being. Brian found salvation at the hands of a doctor Eugene Landy. Once Dr. Landy enters Wouldn’t It Be Nice, he never leaves. As the book tells the story of the miracles performed by Dr. Landy, it also explains that many in Brian’s family had serious objections to Dr. Landy and thought he was brainwashing Brian. The more I read, the more curious I got.I put down the book and began watching videos on YouTube. In 1991, Diane Sawyer interviewed Brian Wilson about Dr. Landy, concerning the allegations that Landy was a con man, had moved into Wilson’s homes, was writing and recording songs with Brian, involved himself in all of Wilson’s business deals, was making a fortune off Brian, and on and on. (These charges eventually led Landy to lose his license to practice in California and a court order in 1992 barred him from contacting Wilson.) I had gotten a bad feeling about Dr. Landy from the book thus far, but the videos and other research I performed convinced me I was right. In addition to watching videos of both Wilson and Landy, I read accounts by people who said that Brian Wilson never even saw the completed manuscript of the book before it went to print, and that Dr. Landy had controlled the writing of the book to portray himself in a messianic way. There is extensive documentation on the internet about Landy (who died in 2006) and his relationship to Brian Wilson. All I can say is that when Dr. Landy enters Brian’s story, he’s there on every page. His ubiquity is overwhelming. Supposedly, Brian is recalling the wonderful things this amazing doctor did for him and there is nothing but defense after defense about poor misunderstood Dr. Landy’s actions. Landy, Landy, Landy, and Landy. The title of the book truly should have been changed midway to become Dr. Landy’s story, not Brian’s.Most photos in the second group are credited from the Eugene Landy Collection. It took me forever to finish this book because it was such a toxic read. On page 388, Landy is described as Brian’s “business partner, teacher, adviser, manager, protector, voice of sanity, collaborator, and closest friend. Gene Landy was all those to me, and more.” If you’re interested in Brian Wilson’s life, you might enjoy the first part of this book and maybe even all of it. But if you’re interested in the controversy over Dr. Landy, I’d suggest watching the interviews and judging for yourself. In my opinion and that of many others, this book is Dr. Landy’s, not Brian Wilson’s. If I could rate the first half of this book higher, I would. :)It would be interesting to hear how Brian Wilson would write his autobiography today, with Dr. Landy gone. To me, that would be the far more fascinating read.2021 UPDATE: I wrote this  in 2010. As many who read this will know, what I described above was later made into a film called LOVE & MERCY (2014) which stars both Paul Dano and John Cusack as Wilson and the amazing Paul Giamatti as Landy. It tells the truly toxic story which this book revealed (while ironically trying to portray the opposite) about the very sick Eugene Landy, now deceased. I highly recommend the film....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2010","Oct 30, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/312340.Wouldn_t_it_Be_Nice

For the very same reason that I picked up it (familiarity), I didn’t want to read it right away. After a while, I realized that the details of the movie were increasingly vague to me and that the book would be a new experience. For those unfamiliar with the story, Bathsheba (Sheba) Hart, a teacher, is caught having a lengthy affair with a teenage boy from her school. But this powerful, psychological thriller of a story is not so much about Sheba’s illicit, illegal affair as it is about the development of a friendship with a fellow teacher (and the narrator of this book), Barbara Covett. Lonely, desperate to be liked, and emotionally disturbed, Barbara becomes increasingly obsessed with Sheba, her family, and her affairs.Zoe Heller has created one of the creepiest narrators I’ve ever encountered. Having known people like Barbara (as I think we all have), I found myself reacting very strongly to this tremendously unappealing human being. While the first half of the book (with more narrative than dialogue) was much slower than the second half, it was still a thrilling read by an author with a delightful, clever sense of humor who also pays delicious attention to detail. Down to the very last line, the author created extraordinary psychological tension. Literally, when I read the last line, the book actually jumped a bit out of my hands as I found myself wanting to detach from Barbara as quickly as possibly.

How right I was; this delightful book captured my attention and imagination from the beginning.The story begins as Sarah stands in an old graveyard with a group of ghost-hunting buddies who called themselves the Specters. Not only is Sarah not an official member of the group, she isn’t a believer, either. Ah, how quickly things change!After some photographs are developed from Sarah’s first outing, a photo and some eerie happenings convince Sarah that not only do ghosts exist, but one is reaching out to her — a young woman named Emily who was murdered decades before Sarah was born. Sarah is soon absorbed by Emily’s death and by other spirits who have agendas of their own.In no time, it is Sarah who is the biggest believer of all, as her ghost-hunting friends get way more than they bargained for and become uneasy with Sarah’s fierce determination to unravel the mystery of Emily.The story was beautifully written by author Joann Reneé Muszynski, and I found it absorbing and compelling from the beginning. I especially thought some of Ms. Muszynski’s descriptions of otherworldly spirits and circumstances were quite nicely put into words. The pace of the story kept me intrigued from the beginning.

Eleven-year old Wendy Wiles, a young poet, is crushed when her parents tell her that they are considering divorce and need time apart. As if that weren’t bad enough, finances put Wendy, her brother Mike, and her mom in a position to move out of their apartment and into a rundown farmhouse way out in the country.Just as it looks as if life is going to be boring for Wendy, she meets a brand new friend, Jennifer, who tells her that the farmhouse is haunted. In no time at all, Wendy sees chilling evidence as vivid apparitions of former residents, from long ago, begin to appear. But who will believe her? Can even she believe her own eyes? Wendy knows that ghosts hang around only because there is unfinished business. But what can that be? Wendy’s older brother, Mike, as brothers will do, delights in taunting his sister, but soon becomes every bit as convinced of the ghosts as Wendy. Together with her new friend Jennifer, and a little help from their respective brothers, the kids embark on a mission to solve the curious and haunting mystery.I particularly enjoyed the author’s banter between Wendy and her young brother. The dialog was funny and realistic and I think young readers will most definitely relate. Additionally, I loved the way that the author used Wendy’s love of poetry to help her cope with her new surroundings and her life.

When Frank Brown, a widowed, wearied Vietnam vet takes on the job as skipper of the Belle Tata, he immediately asks mate Mike Long what happened to the former captain and cook, but neither Long nor anyone else has the answers. Uneasy yet determined to go forth with his new job, Brown lines up three applicants to replace the cook, but two of them mysteriously disappear before their scheduled interviews. The curious man Brown is left to hire, George Savastano, is the last man anyone would want to know. Not long after the luxury schooner sets sail, Frank Brown and his crew discover cargo hidden in the bilges. They soon learn that the owners of the dangerous stash mean business — mean business, and Brown and his crew must do everything in their power to delicately balance the appearance of normalcy and stay alive. As the situation becomes more precarious, the beautiful Turkish intelligence agent, Nevser Akkaya Chase, joins them but Brown isn’t sure what to make of her, either. Author Wright Gres has written a well-paced, intricately plotted novel that instantly captivates the reader. His extensive knowledge of sailing creates a vivid portraiture of high seas travel, but his clear, readable prose makes for absorbing reading even for those with little or no knowledge of the nautical world. Macedonia Passage is a take-me-away read that compels the reader to not only root for the good guys, but to become emotionally invested in their ultimate fate....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 05, 2009","Apr 07, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1667671.Macedonia_Passage

Then, I found Jeffrey**spoiler alert** The night I began reading Middlesex, I had picked up five other novels and just couldn’t get into any of them. Then, I found Jeffrey Eugenides Middlesex and was magically transported into another world. I’m not going to spend too much time synopsizing this book, which many people probably know is a multi-generational story of a family and their stunning history that leads the narrator, Cal Stephanides, to be born as a hermaphrodite. Cal is born as Calliope (Callie) and it is not until Callie does not transition into puberty like other girls (and is attracted to them), that anyone, including Cal, suspects things are not as they should be.That fascinating premise alone might tempt me to pick up this book, but it is Eugenides brilliant, comical, and gifted style that kept me reading. The book begins with the story of his grandparents, Lefty and Desdemona, who flee Turkey and emigrate to the United States, where they join a cousin in Detroit. These characters, who hold the key to Cal’s genetic misfortune, are described with rich prose and humor against a fascinating historical backdrop. Not only did the author do an outstanding job of describing the history of the 70s, especially in Detroit, but I loved the comical way he brought in products that were popular back then, such as the shampoo called, “Gee, Your Hair Smells Terrific.” This kind of attention to detail contributed to a really wonderful reading experience.The book covers three generations of the Stephanides family: Lefty and Desdemona, Cal’s parents, Milton and Tessie, and the present-day Cal.If there was any disappointment in this book, it was that the end, for me, didn’t quite deliver as the beginning did. Eugenides’ descriptions of his grandparents were by far the most skillfully drawn main characters in the book, though there were many others that truly “popped off the pages” for me. Middlesex does take a long time to get the much-anticipated part of the story where a true discovery of Cal’s hermaphrodism is revealed. The narrative after this point didn’t hold the same appeal for me as the book did prior to this part, and I felt a bit cheated out of knowing what had happened to Cal in all of the years afterward until such a time as he “wrote” the book.Still, I found the book to be engrossing, charming, fascinating, funny, gloriously written and worth the five stars I am giving it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Sep 11, 2009","Mar 20, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2187.Middlesex

If you’re reading this in 2009, you’ll likely disagree that it’s an old saying, but if you time travel to 2061, you’ll find that it’s true. Paul Levinson’s delightful sci-fi book opens in New York in 2042. Sierra Waters, a student of the classics who is working on her dissertation, comes across a newly discovered dialog of Socrates. In it, an unidentified time traveler tries to convince Socrates to escape his death sentence by letting a cloned double drink hemlock while Socrates travels to the future. As the characters time travel to different periods in the past and the future, the reader cannot help but be absorbed in not only the engaging plot, but also by the myriad questions that time travel raises. I think we all can relate to even the smallest incidents in our own lives that have profoundly changed the course of our personal history. In that sense, The Plot To Save Socrates really challenges our minds as we’re led to contemplate how even the smallest adjustments in history could literally change its course.Though written in a lighthearted style, the depth of research and thought that Paul Levinson put into the writing is clear and the result is truly a thought-provoking, breathtaking, and highly entertaining novel....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Apr 26, 2009","Mar 01, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/393153.The_Plot_to_Save_Socrates

No matter how much we know this, it’s still shocking to love a book and see that others hated it, or to hate a book that others loved. It’s the same for everything else in life: people, films, TV shows, vacation spots, singers, etc. etc. We are all so very different. Sometimes, when I finish a book, if I didn’t like it, I will usually have very concrete reasons why I did not. And sometimes I will have very concrete reasons why I did like a book. But often, as is the case with BEL CANTO, it’s simply because the book touched me in a way that I personally can appreciate.  Ann Patchett writes a beautiful story of a lavish birthday party in a small South American country gone wrong. A group of gun-wielding terrorists interrupt a party for a Japanese businessman (at the residence of the Vice President), hoping to take the president hostage and be on their way. But the President is home watching his favorite soap opera, and is nowhere to be found. The terrorists make a quick decision to take the multi-national group of party guests hostage, most notably opera star, Roxane Coss, the party honoree, Mr. Hosokawa, his translator, Gen, the country’s Vice President, a local priest, and many others. I like character-based stories, especially when they are exceptionally well written. I enjoyed seeing how the hostages and the terrorists interacted over a period of months, especially with music as the central theme. I found it quite interesting to watch how relationships developed and blossomed between members of the eclectic group of people who found themselves living together in the vice presidential residence.This is my kind of book as I’m a true people watcher. I can appreciate why it might not be for everyone, especially those preferring more action than interaction, but for me it was a beautiful story with some very tense, poignant and engaging moments....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Apr 06, 2009","Feb 12, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

I will start by saying that Kim Edwards is a skilled writer and there's no taking that away frWow, I'm really torn as to what to say about this book. I will start by saying that Kim Edwards is a skilled writer and there's no taking that away from her. Her words flow beautifully and that was greatly appreciated by me.I began reading this book and fell in love with it. From the beginning, I was very sure that I was going to rate it with five stars. I was intrigued by the premise: It's 1964 and a doctor's wife gives birth to twins. The twins were unexpected (no ultrasounds back then) and so the second baby, a girl with Down's Syndrome, was a shock. In the panic of a moment, the doctor, who had lost his own sister when she was 12 (due to a heart problem), panics and gives his newborn daughter, Phoebe, to his nurse, Caroline. He wants to spare his wife (and himself) the pain of having a child with Down Syndrome who might not live long. Caroline takes the baby to the home, but when she gets there, she realizes she cannot leave the child in such a wretched place and makes a split-second decision to keep her as her own. The author skillfully goes back and forth between the doctor's family, David and Norah Henry (and their son, Paul) and Caroline's life with the girl, Phoebe. I was intrigued.Somewhere, around page 175, I started not liking the book so much. What had been a taut, interesting story, started taking little side trips that I felt tarnished the characters and didn't stay within what I thought the author had set up. But I didn't want to dislike the book for this reason, because I don't expect the author to go where I might go or where I might have liked to see her go. Still, the things that were going on kept nagging at me and making me uneasy in a way that I don't think were intended to make me uneasy.I began to care less and less about the characters, but stayed with the book because it was interesting to see where it went and I had already invested so much time in reading it. There were too many long descriptions of things that didn't matter to me, and no matter how hard I tried, I didn't get to know the characters in the way I thought I should.I am stuck in the middle. In the end, I didn't really care for it all too much, but cannot say that others would not. I give the writer kudos for being so skilled with the English language. I didn't really care about any of the characters very much in the end, if at all, and I think that's what really soured me on this book. This is a hard one for me to judge. If you're at all interested, read it for yourself and see what you think....more",Notes are private!,1,63,1,not set,"Feb 07, 2009","Jan 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10441.The_Memory_Keeper_s_Daughter

As a writer, I don't have a problem with almost any theme, because for me, it's how the story is told. Not everyone is going to like every book, no matter how well written, no matter how much mass appeal. Such is virtually impossible.In this book, the main character, Delia Grinstead, decides to walk away from her life as she knows it. Delia is on the beach with her family and her husband says something, and suddenly, all of the pain of her past comes flooding back to her and she is compelled to flee life as she has known it. The problem is, I wasn't the least bit convinced. While I understand that what may seem like a simple infraction to some can be the straw that breaks the camel's back for another, Tyler failed to convince me that Delia was THAT angry. I kept feeling like the author just rushed through the writing of this book to get it finished.There were also a series of improbable meetings (prior to ""the big flee"") of characters that I felt were just a little beaucoup too convenient. That forgiven, I felt that there were just way too many missed opportunities here. I wasn't very interested in this character and couldn't find myself caring either way.

He sat down and wrote a book about what it was like being born with multiple birth defects: Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AMC) and club hands and feet. As the author likes to make crystal clear: just because you’re born with birth defects it doesn’t mean that more bad things can’t happen to you. And they did. Being nearly killed by a drunk driver, being beaten by troubled teens he was trying to help, and falling into a 400-degree fryer are perfect examples. Surely, Foley could have become embittered and assume he’d already achieved his quota of bad things at birth. But Ward Foley is anything but a bitter man. He focuses on what he can do, not on what he can’t do. And without a doubt, his natural wit and delightful humor in tandem with his life story are what made this book shine especially bright for me.After raising his family, Foley increased the volunteer work that he had been doing for years and found a very special place in his heart for hospice patients. For me, this was the most uplifting part of the book. While writing about hospice may at first sound gloomy to some, the fact that Ward Foley can sit with a hospice patient is one of the greatest blessings of his life. The stories he tells are touching, inspiring, heartwarming, funny, surprising and heart-wrenching. As the author talks about the many “God moments” where time after time amazing things happen, he doesn’t try to convince the reader to interpret it as he does. He doesn’t talk about what he gives to others; he talks about what others give to him. To me, that is the very foundation of a truly inspirational story....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Jan 07, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5067665-thank-my-lucky-scars

He said that Stewart was tough on him, but had been a superior professional, giving him so many things to think about. But most importantly, Stewart had forever remained a strong presence in his life. In particular, he recalled Stewart telling him to always make the tough choices in your own life because if you don’t make them, they will be made for you.It was just a few years ago that my friend decided to try and find out if Sidney Stewart was still alive. Sadly, he was not, but my friend did make contact with Stewart’s wife. It was at this point, for the very first time, that my friend learned that his extraordinary psychoanalyst had also been a Japanese prisoner of war and had written Give Us This Day. And this is how I came to learn of this outstanding book.Stewart, who had written down his memoirs, eventually found that “fictionalizing” them made for a much better read. This account of a small group of soldiers, who along with thousands of others, were captured and held by the Japanese, makes for riveting and harrowing reading.With all that is going on in the world, it is not a rarity to see or hear about atrocities. But for most of us, no matter how much we pay attention to the news, or how aware we believe ourselves to be, we do not, we cannot know what really and truly goes on.In reading Give Us This Day, it was hard to imagine 600 soldiers in the hold of a ship that was only meant for one hundred men. It was hard to imagine sickness turning to delusion, and men (fellow soldiers) being so thirsty that they would cut one another’s throats in order to drink blood, much less a son doing that to his own father. While I do not wish to retell the horrors here in this , I do wish to say that I was alternately struck by the conditions these men faced in real life which few of us ever encounter in a nightmare. I was amazed by the will to live and the lengths the men went to (and the ingenuity) in trying to survive under such impossible circumstances. Give Us This Day was an amazing story of survival. Even for the men who did not survive, most tried just as hard to do so as the few who did. But beyond anything, this book is a story that pays homage to the power of friendship, to taking responsibility for one's own life, and to never giving up....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jan 14, 2009","Jan 07, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/242067.Give_Us_This_Day
