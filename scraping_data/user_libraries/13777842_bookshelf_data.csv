Even though President Kennedy did send fifteen thousand advisers to Vietnam, surely he would never had escalated the situation to all out war and by the end of his term have nearly sent half-a-million soldiers to Vietnam in hope of never being known as the first President to lose a war. And to make things worse, Nixon never would have become president nor his secretary of state Henry Kissinger finding no fault with killing hundreds of thousands of Cambodian and Vietnam citizens while another 26,000 American soldiers were killed and another one-hundred thousand wounded.The same could be said of President Lincoln's assassination. If he was never killed, surely the reconstruction period would have looked so much different. Unlike his incompetent successor,  President Johnson never would have allowed the south to resurrect slavery under the disguise of state rights.Ms. Millard's extraordinary account of President  Garfield's life and presidency, short lived as it was (five months) before he died from the hauntingly inept treatments prescribed by a self serving Dr. Bliss for a bullet wound, inflicted by the assassin Charles Guiteau, that if left alone would have healed on its own. President Garfield came from dirt poor roots that didn't hinder his rise, rising to rank of General on the Union side during the civil war, to a scholar and president of a university, to a renowned congressman and the President of the United States who was intent on changing the nation's corrupt political establishment. A few quotes from this great man and what a full term or two would of meant for our country:“There is no horizontal stratification of society in this countrylike the rocks in the earth, that hold one class down belowforevermore, and let another come to the surface to stay thereforever. Our stratification is like the ocean, where every individualdrop is free to move, and where from the sternest depths of the mightydeep any drop may come up to glitter on the highest wave that rolls.”""The chief duty of government is to keep the peace and stand out of the sunshine of the people.""“I never meet a ragged boy in the street without feeling that i may owe him a salute, for I know not what possibilities may be buttoned up under his coat.”President Garfield was a man with a loud laugh that filled his family and nation with a feeling of goodness and caring. He was a man who lived by the morals he preached, and when he passed away the nation mourned for their President in a way few presidents have ever been mourned. It is hard not to believe that if he lived, civil rights for all Americans would have been far more advanced and our country and the world would have been better off....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 27, 2024","Apr 06, 2024","Mar 27, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/142598312-destiny-of-the-republic

My project was to write a screenplay on the Civil War in Angelo with the Soviet Union (with help from Cuba) backing the government and the revolutionary leader, CIA backed, madman Jonas Savimbi fighting against the government. That was the first half of the screenplay. The second part of the screenplay took place in South Africa and the fictitious over throw of the racist, apartheid, government by the ANC (African National Congress) led by a figure similar to Nelson Mandela. The screenplay was amazingly well received and I was promised by prominent talent agencies ""Not to worry. They would take care of me."" Naturally nothing came of their promises. Note to all future Hollywood writers: When an agent or even a studio head tells you, ""Not to worry. They will take care of you."" Start looking for other avenues to sell your work.So when I picked up Candice Millard's fantastic biography, ""Hero of the Empire: The Boer War, a Daring Escape, and the Making of Winston Churchill"" I thought I at least had an idea of the situation she was examining. In fact, I learned so much from this novel that all the research I did for my screenplay seemed like nothing. What I would learn of a young Churchill I simply had no idea about. The man was after glory on the battle field in such a way that's it's hard to believe he made it passed twenty-five. Naturally, the glory he sought was in hope of advancing his political career which it did.Mrs. Millard, like any great biographer, does not take sides in the war between the Boers and the British.

The Johnson Administration and the military were infusing the American public with out and out lies...proclaiming that we were winning. That unless we stopped the Communist, these Godless crickets, it would be only a matter of time before they took over our God fearing country.When Johnson saw that public opinion turn against him and the war, one of our worst presidents ever, decided not to run for re-election and he finally had his people sit down at the table with the Godless Communist and just as they were about to sign a peace treaty a bigger evil than even Johnson secretly entered the negotiations. Behind the back of the current administration, Nixon told the corrupt South Vietnamese Leadership that the peace treaty being negotiated would be the end of their country and the North would have complete control. And so, the negotiations broke down and the second worst President in our country's history prolonged the war for another four years resulting in the deaths of at least another 26 thousand Americans, hundreds of thousands wounded, and quite possibly the death of a half-a-million innocent Vietnamese.It was just around 1969 that I remember my parents having one of the only arguments I remember them having. My father told my mother that if this war continued for another ten years, which seemed much more of a possibility than ever, that he would support his sons going to Canada. ""That this wasn't a war worth fighting. That it was all a bunch of lies and it was disgraceful that we were even there.""My mother, in turn, argued that she ""would never allow none of her sons to go to Canada and that the idea that her sons would be looked upon as cowards made her sick.""In one year's time, as the coverage of the war increased and our presence in Vietnam didn't make any rational sense, my mother changed her mind.Kristin Hannah's marvelous novel, ""The Women,"" followed the career and life of Frances McGrath and her girlfriends who volunteered as nurses in Vietnam.

That happen in this marvelous book by Ellen Marie Wiseman, three separate times. The character of Pia Lange is so amazingly written that anytime a dangerous or negative thing was about to happen to her I could feel my heart racing. Pia, the 13 year old child of German immigrants, sees her life turned upside down in a day when the Spanish Flu epidemic hit her home city of Philadelphia. Her mother Mutti, healthy one day was dead the next, as were thousands of people throughout the city. Her father was off fighting during World War I, and she was suddenly left with two twin brothers who she became responsible for. Living in a ghetto, she left her small brothers in their apartment and went searching for food. She suddenly got very sick and passed out and when she woke-up, six days later, after surviving the flu all she could think about were her baby brothers and if they were still alive. When she went back to her apartment her brothers were gone and a new family was living there and they couldn't tell her much about her brothers but she would not give up her search and her journey in the hope of finding them alive is both mesmerizing and enthralling.The novel takes place, as I wrote, during the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918 but it could have easily taken place during the covid epidemic. The anti immigrant phenomena during covid and riding high right up to this minute in the U.S.A. was very similar during 1918. They were blamed for everything. It's sad to think that ""nativism"" could still be so out of control today.The misinformation in 1918 about the epidemic was out of control and cost thousands of lives; similar to the misinformation spit out of the mouths of such God loving politicians as President Trump, Gov. Ron DeSantis, and Senator Rand Paul. Sadly, far too many people listened to these self-serving, evil individuals than to Dr. Anthony Fauci whose previously accomplishments saved millions of people during the HIV epidemic and other serious illnesses. Thankfully, he was not deterred by the criticism and continually pushed forward with the importance of the vaccinations.""The Orphan Collector,"" is a book I highly, highly recommend.Note: ""The Spanish Flu most likely originated in the United States. One of the first recorded cases was on March 11, 1918, at Fort Riley in Kansas.

It was the efforts of the Polish pilots during the Battle of Britain that saved the British from becoming the eight country taken over by Hitler.  It was the contributions of the Polish and French code breakers that cracked the Germans' ""Enigma Code,"" which led to the flood of top secret information about German intelligence and operations that would help ensure the success of the Allied invasion of occupied Europe. The Highly regarded MI6 was quite useless during most of the war and without a doubt contributed to the senseless deaths of thousands of spies and resistance networks in each of the seven occupied countries.MI6 had a reputation for being the best spy organization in the world before the war simply because a number of fiction writers used MI6 as the organization for which their heroic, fictitious, spies worked for. President Roosevelt's betrayal of Poland and Czechoslovakia and his unwillingness to help the Netherlands at the end of the war while the Nazis were committing another genocide inside part of the country, is criminal. The Poles had probably done more to help the Allied cause than any other exiled country. The President said he didn't care about the Polish people, and he had promised that country to Stalin. General Patton was only forty miles from the Czechoslovakian capitol and when asked permission to free the Czechs from the Nazi oppression they suffered under for five years was told by Eisenhower that it would upset Stalin who was 120 miles away.Ms. Olson reminds the reader that unless you lived under the brutal repression of the Germans or fought against them, or was part of a resistance, you really had no idea what was really going on. Apparently, quite a few prominent people in high positions, unknowingly, perpetrated the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people, allies of ours, because their empathy went only so far.This is a great book.

Working at this famous establishment would provide me with some of the greatest stories I have ever heard. Strange as it might sound, almost all the stories had nothing to do with the world of entertainment, politics, or sports.I don't know if I have read any autobiography on any famous entertainers, sport figures, or politicians, unless of course they had experiences in the real world that I found exceptional.Jimmy Stewart, a famous actor, certainly fit into the category of a person who did something exceptional far outside his acting profession. Mr. Stewart came from a family of men who served in the military. He had relatives who fought in the Civil War, his father fought in World War 1, and so when World War II broke out with the bombing of Pearl Harbor it saw a surge in American boys joining the military while many more were drafted.Jimmy Stewart was not a young boy when he tried to join the military and was rejected because of his weight and age. He was thirty-one and wanted to join the air-force and Louis Mayer, head of MGM, didn't want to hear any talk from one of his major stars about joining the military. Steward was not only a major star but had dated some of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and was making really good money.But it is amazing what perseverance and talent can get you. Unwilling to take 'no' from the military, he convinced them with his knowledge and ability to handle a plane that he was exactly what the American air-force needed. After overcoming obstacle after obstacle by Mayer to at least keep him in states, he convinced the air-force to send him over to England where he would rise in rank and command twenty combat missions over France and Germany...escaping death many times.To put this in perspective: ""The most dangerous were the first and last five trips. During the whole war, 51% of aircrew were killed on operations, 12% were killed or wounded in non-operational accidents and 13% became prisoners of war or evaders. Only 24% survived the war unscathed.""""Mission, Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe,"" by Robert Matzen is so much more than about the courageous movie star. It is a story of so many courageous young men in their early twenties that never made it back, or were severely wounded. ""The Liberator bomber"" that was flown and commanded by Stewart and his crew wouldn't pass the easiest safety standards that the military goes by today. They were death traps in so many ways.Mr. Stewart stayed four and a half years in the air force and wasn't discharged until the war in Europe was over.

The 'Gilded Age,' and 'The Roaring Twenties,' David Leonhardt's, ""Ours Was The Shining Future,"" is the best book I have read on the American economy. The 'Gilded Age,' and 'The Roaring Twenties,' might make wonderful T.V. and movies but it was during these periods that the largest wage gap between the rich and working class existed. It was during this time that the one percenters controlled their biggest share of the U.S. economy.Enter President Franklin Roosevelt, who inherited the worst depression in modern American history. He decided that it was about time that the largest corporation in the world, the U.S. Government, had to invest in corporations. Slowly, the economy started to pick-up. There was the highway bill, a pick up in car manufacturing, airplane production, and many, so many more schools built. He introduced Social Security and Medicare. Two untouchable programs nearly 90 years later but not so popular with the republicans and big business at the time. He supported labor unions which also increased wages for the poor and working class, black and whites.Then World War 2 came and the U.S. economy went into overdrive with manufacturing reaching peaks unimaginable. For the next 5 decades the U.S. economy out paced the rest of the world in manufacturing, education, research, health care, and life expectancy. The best decade being the 1950's under the leadership of President Eisenhower, a republican, who continued the Roosevelt blueprint, against the wishes of his own party.Naturally, as times changed, and President Reagan's policies of small government, lower taxes, and less regulations came back into play, 'The Gilded Age,' made somewhat of a comeback and the gap between the working class and the one percenters grew larger and larger. Wages remained stagnant and corporations like Amazon and Google grew richer and richer. Enter President Biden, a man so old he was friends with Augustus Caesar. Suddenly, that ancient idea of investing in America became fashionable again. He passed the Infrastructure bill, invested in the U.S., computer chips, stood in line with striking union workers, and forced pharmaceutical companies to drastically drop their prices on life saving drugs. And that's just a few of the things he has achieved. Under his leadership the U.S. economy is the strongest it has been since the 1950's, there are more jobs than workers, the gap between the rich and working class has lessened somewhat, and the minimum wage in over twenty states has risen to $15 dollars or more. Strange, but President Franklin Roosevelt, who was crippled from the waist down from polio, and President Biden, who many Americans believe is too old, both accomplished so much for The American People...For the American People!!!!The points I have stated above are just a small portion of what is discussed in this book. It is an all encompassing look at the U.S. economy that I strongly recommend.

What I couldn't understand was how I never heard about her because she was in Paris, France during the late 1920's and then, on and off, throughout the 1930's. She hung out with the likes of Picasso, was in the company of Hemingway, and so many other artists that I have read so much about.She was a beautiful lady and started out as a fashion model for Vogue and then went on to be one of its leading photographers, covering not only fashion, but the Normandy invasion and the allies advance into Germany. She and her partner were the first to step into Hitler's mansion, and she took a bath in Hitler's bathtub and slept in Eva Braun's bed. If all this might seem a little weird, believe me, after reading this book it seemed perfectly in her character.She traveled the world, was sexually active, and needed adventure in her life to feel alive. The more dangerous the better. She drank heavily, was interested not only in photography but anything that was new in science, medicine, technology, and world events. She wrote numerous articles for Vogue about the war with photographs that only someone up close, in danger of being killed, could have taken.She is what I call a little 'Da Vinci.' It is the highest compliment I could give to a person. Like Da Vinci, the world around her was fascinating and needed an explanation.

The Netherlands, which borders Germany to the West, was taken over by the Germans early in war, 1940. The Munninghoff family was rich, and the grandfather, The Old Boss, was behind the family's good fortune. He was a wise, perceptive, somewhat corrupt businessman who was a devout Catholic, anti-German, patriotic Dutchman, and a man who tried to keep his family together in the Dutch tradition anyway he could, even if it meant discarding one of his son's wives who was German and eventually discarding that son who joined the SS.Previously, I did not think of the Netherlands as playing a big part in World War 2. I knew that General Patton fought some vicious and famous battles in the Netherlands against the occupying Germans at the end of the war before finally arriving in Berlin, but not much else. Mr. Munninghoff's  memoir gives a clear picture of how the war, the occupation, and the liberation of the Netherlands, to this very day, still plays a role in the everyday life of the Dutch people.

""Dancing with the Enemy,"" is an extraordinary story about a unique, intelligent, talented woman (Rosie Glaser) who survives a number of Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz, with her astonishing good looks, dancing ability, sleeping with the enemy, and her ability to speak four languages. Betrayed by her former husband and dance partner, then by her current lover, she and her parents are arrested by the Dutch authorities simply because she is Jewish. They are first placed in a number of holding camps, run by the SS, in the Netherlands. It is in these first camps that she makes her secretarial and organizational abilities known to an SS officer. Shortly thereafter, they start sleeping together, with the added benefits for Rosie of much more food, unlimited freedom to walk around the camp, and to be the highlight performer at a club where the officers gathered together to get drunk and where Rosie teaches them to dance.If this seems like a betrayal and siding with the enemy it just might be, except for the fact that the extra food she gets she gives to starving prisoners and the information she gets from her lover keeps her abreast of the real motives of the SS. Rosie is a survivor and not only does her techniques help her survive Auschwitz but, in turn, she helps other prisoners survive and, like her, eventually find freedom.I highly recommend this book. It not only highlights the different and creative methods survivors used to finally reach that place we call freedom, but in the real life character of Rosie Glaser the reader is introduced to a unique, captivating, highly unusual woman who this reader found to be truly heroic....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 13, 2023","Dec 18, 2023","Dec 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/129625090-dancing-with-the-enemy

We were discussing the Bronx, where I was born and raised, movies, Broadway, and a host of other topics. When they were getting ready to leave they invited me the very next day to a Memorial Day Party at their house in Malibu. I gracefully had to decline and when they asked me why I replied, ""Because on Memorial Day I always go to the Veterans' cemetery in Westwood.""They then asked, ""If I had anyone buried there?""I said, ""No, it's just a tradition.""Sadly, this very nice couple was not able to figure out why I would be going to a cemetery on a holiday in which so many people were throwing parties and celebrating the beginning of summer.The very next day, I went to the Veterans' Cemetery and laid flowers on a gravestone that didn't seem to have had any visitors in decades. Down from where I was standing, a veterans' day parade was taking place and there were lines of young children waving the American flag. I figured they were children of military personnel because beside most of the children were adults in uniforms.A few years ago, I thought back to those children and wondered how many followed in their father or mother's footsteps and went into the military and how many were probably killed or maimed fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.I bring this up because throughout Ms. Cheney's wonderful memoir she brings up many times how many men and women have died and were maimed fighting for the freedom that so many of us take for granted.I had thought I had known a lot about all the events surrounding the Jan. 6 attack but my God was I wrong. Ms. Cheney's memoir seriously enlightened me to many things I never even thought about and that alone is one of many reasons I so highly recommend this book.

But after the holidays are over and the gloom of January and February move in, I would strongly recommend picking up this book.I have read quite a few books on the Holocaust and Stalin's reign of terror and yet ""the horror. the horror,"" of these historical events has never failed to get me sick regardless of how many books I read on these two topics.I always refer back to a reporter's question to then Senator Harry Truman, ""Senator, what do you think of the Nazis declaring war on the Russians?""Senator Truman replied, ""The best thing that could happen is that they destroy each other.""At first the statement might seem kind of harsh, people forgetting that before Germany declared war on Russia, they were allies. I, on the other hand, think that if they did destroy each other millions upon millions of lives would have been saved, including millions of Russians and Germans.The one big difference between the Nazis' concentration camps and Stalin's Gulags, as Ms. Applebaum's points out is that the Nazis wanted to eradicate the Jewish race and a few others, while the Stalin's Gulags wanted to keep their prisoners alive because they were a source of free labor...but it's hard to keep prisoners alive and healthy for long when a hundred men or a hundred women are sleeping in a cell barely big enough for 4 prisoners and barely getting enough food for a day nevertheless for a week and working in temperatures 40 degrees below zero.To be one of the unfortunate millions of Russians who were sent off to the Gulags you did not actually have to be a political turncoat. You could be a tailor in Moscow and suddenly find yourself an enemy of the state and off you went, or a Russian soldier who was captured by the Germans (a POW) and after being released and going back home to mother Russia charged and found guilty of espionage and sent off to a Gulag. During Ms. Applebaum's research for this book she was in Russia during the 1990's and early 2000's. To her surprise when she asked elderly Russians who were alive during Stalin's reign of terror about the Gulags and the repression most of them said, ""Why talk about that, that was in the past.""Sadly, history has a way of repeating itself and the Russians now have as their president Vladimir Putin...at least until 2036....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 12, 2023","Dec 09, 2023","Nov 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/224379.Gulag

At the time I thought what a perfect piece of casting. In my mind, I always felt that of all the Hollywood starlets she was the one who looked like a divine, angelic, being.In 1993, at the age of 63, Ms. Hepburn passed away. For the previous 5 years I was following her new career as a UNICEF ambassador visiting war torn countries where children were starving, such as Ethiopia, El Salvador, the Sudan, Somalia, etc. She had not only played an angel but was a living, breathing angel.Mr. Matzen's biography, ""Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,""is a meticulously researched book about a young Audrey Hepburn, ten to fifteen years old, her family, friends, and all the people of the Netherlands living under Nazi occupation between the years of 1940-1945. It was never easy during any part of the occupation, but it was especially brutal during the last year.After the Normandy invasion in June of 1944, many people came to believe that the war was just about over. The Allies had finally landed in Europe and even though the fighting to retake Paris and France had been fierce there was even greater optimism that the war would end soon, especially in the Netherlands and Belgium. While the French celebrated their liberation, after previously forming the Vichy government in collaboration with the Nazis the war intensified as the Nazis tightened their hold on the Netherlands. (The French believed why fight while others will do the fighting for you. When asked about the sudden disappearance of all their Jewish neighbors, they simply replied, ""Well no one told them to be Jewish.."" Of course, I am only half joking. The French Resistance was very instrumental to relaying important information to the allies and without their help the bloody invasion of Normandy would not have happened. Many of the French Resistance groups were lead by courageous women)The Germans, ever resourceful, developed what they called the V1 and V2 flying bombs (vengeance bombs) that could travel 150 miles and were launched from the coast of the Netherlands and could hit targets as far away as Britain and France. These bombs were brutal weapons and the Nazis were going around telling everyone that the war would soon turn around and be in the Germans favor.They were right about one thing, they were brutal, but their malfunction rate was exceptionally high, exploding in mid-air and landing on the towns of the Netherlands causing tremendous and deadly damage. Dead civilians were spread out across the towns of Velp and Arnhem where Audrey and her family took to the basement for months. People were starving to death, yet Audrey and other youths like her carried messages from the hospital to individuals that the doctors thought the Germans were hunting down. She helped out at the hospital and took care of dying children and children whose families were wiped out. She continued to walk the streets until the Germans picked her up and threw her in the back of a truck with other young girls. Once the truck started moving she jumped out of the truck and ran back to the basement where they hid a British serviceman from the Nazis. What Audrey did during the war was exceptional but it was no different than what most children her age and younger did. But what she experienced during the entire war, along with everyone else, would stay with her for the rest of her life. Her older brother Otto, who she was very close to, was taken to a forest and shot with four other men in retaliation for a bombing at the railroad station which they had nothing to do with.I have had the fortune, sadly, to know many gentlemen who fought in World War II, survived Nazi concentration camps, fought in Korea, and Vietnam. Except for one, I had known them all for a long time before they ever told me about their experiences. I imagine their confidence in me came from our many talks about current events and my knowledge of history. When they finally did confide in me it was like they were transformed back to that time. Unless one has been in combat one has no idea what it is like. I don't care how many books you read, or monuments and historical sites you might have visited, you will never know what it is all about unless you have lived it.Ms. Hepburn never gave many interviews and she was quite adept at dodging any questions about the five years she spent under Nazi occupation. If forced to answer about her experiences, she would say that ""What I experienced so did many, many others.""...more",Notes are private!,7,11,1,"Nov 07, 2023","Nov 12, 2023","Nov 07, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51287793-dutch-girl

CassOver the ages, since homo sapiens started roaming planet earth there have been as many brave and courageous, brilliant and talented women as men. Cassidy Hutchinson, along with Liz Cheney, stand so prominently out because since the War of 1812 never has one political party, predominantly made up of men, exhibited such cowardly, subservient behavior as they bow down before a four time draft dodger, rapist, liar, tax cheat, insurrectionist, bully, illiterate, traitor, etc, as the former president and current leader of the Republican Party.I was a little hesitant about reading Ms. Hutchinson's memoir, ""Enough,"" simply because I thought I knew all I needed to know about this young lady, but I was totally wrong, which is not unusual.If one does choose to read her memoir, which I highly recommend, I think it is important to remember that this young lady, at the tender age of 23, was an eyewitness...in the center... of the political malfeasance known as the Trump years. She was in all practical terms, the assistant Chief of Staff, to the subservient, deeply religious Chief of Staff Mark Meadows who never so much as had an alcoholic drink in his whole life. Mr. Meadows, like many heroic figures throughout American history, decided on the day American democracy was at its most fragile, and innocent Capitol police officers were being hammered with the American flag, to do ""Nothing,"" he was in such fear and awe of the President of the United States. In all honesty, he was not the only one. There were plenty of others who could have prevented the insurrection on Jan 6, 2021 or at least put a stop to it but like, Mr. Meadow's, did nothing. (In a side note: In Dante's masterpiece ""The Divine Comedy,"" he places at the very bottom of hell, next to Lucifer, those that could have made a difference but did ""NOTHING.)But this is all old news, but what is not old news is how a 23 year old young lady, who in many cases put her blind trust in Mr. Meadows and President Trump, became the unlikely hero in this tragic story. Instead of prayers and denial of all alcoholic beverages, she possessed that most uncommon of traits in politicians, ""morals.""That is not to say she didn't have her doubts and wasn't scared shit, but in the end she looked into the mirror and decided she could not live with herself if she did not tell the unabridged truth about what she witnessed and heard previous to Jan. 6, on Jan. 6., and after.""Enough,"" gives us a full picture of Ms. Hutchinson from the time she was a little girl growing up in New Jersey, to her full out desire to succeed in Washington, D.C., to a realization and enlightenment that far too many republicans still have not accepted about Mr. Trump and his cronies.I highly recommend Ms. Hutchison's memoir. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 16, 2023","Oct 22, 2023","Oct 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/139988291-enough

It is simply amazing what idiotic ideas, that almost become reality, can happen when a few politicians and a Judge a little too high on his own power can come up with. (a 1970's version of the current Republican Party)Thankfully a few Preservations, most notably Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, intervened and saved the day. Since then the terminal has undergone a major restoration returning the terminal to its original glory, expanding it, and in my humble opinion making it more remarkable than ever. A city within a city.The book is filled with amazing pictures and just in case you don't have time to read the book you might want to go to: www.grandcentralterminal.com/info/aud...I highly recommend this book and like I said earlier, love it or hate it, one should visit NYC at least once in your lifetime.

There are many more individuals that I do not have framed pictures of during this period but who I also admire greatly, especially John Jay, Nathaniel Greene, John Laurens, John Adams, Lafayette, and Madison.And of course, I have a number who are quite famous and have monuments to their greatness in Washington D.C. who I feel are undeserving, especially Thomas Jefferson.""The Cause,"" written by framed historian Joseph J.

The highest rate in the world at the time. This is of major importance because even though it took months for articles, in Boston about Bunker Hill to reach places like Georgia, when it did pass through the colonies the majority of the citizens were able to read about the heroic militias who were fighting the brutal British (and make no mistake the British were brutal in ever sense of the word).Also Benjamin Franklin calculated that the American population from 1763 onward was going up by 25 percent every 5 years which is also an astonishing rate of growth. Add to this, the size of the 13 colonies combined and one might ask, ""Why not give into the Colonists' demands of representation and more independence and not go to war?""Well, a number of prominent British members of the Parliament and framed historian Edward Gibbon, who was in the process of writing ""The History of the Decline and Rise of the Roman Empire,"" pleaded with parliament not to go to war with the American colonies for the reasons stated above.But King George III and his puppets in the Parliament refused to listen.

Lara, the mother of three daughters all in their twenties, and her husband Joe work and live on their beautiful farm in Michigan. The farm has been handed down for generations on Joe's side of the family and because of the pandemic has seen all their workers leave and their three children come back to the farm to live and work.

A place where she acted in the play, ""Our Town,"" and at the same time carried on a romance with the male lead who later became a future Hollywood star named Duke.Duke in many ways reminds me of a number of actors I had the pleasure to know. Duke is handsome, talented, ambitious, and if given the choice between taking his girlfriend, Lara, to the hospital after she breaks her Achilles' ankle or going to rehearsals he naturally chooses rehearsals, doing the play that night, and then hooking up with Lara's understudy in the play.It is through the telling of her story, which dominates the novel, that we learn the contrasts that exist between her daughters' (now) generation and Lara's generation of the 1980's. It is also a confirmation of marriage and love. Despite her failed romance with Duke, she nevertheless finds true love with her husband Joe and their three children and doesn't regret ditching her aspiring and rising Hollywood career and possibly becoming as famous as Duke.Ms. Patchett's brilliance shines intermittently throughout the novel, especially at the very end where her narrative structure and analysis is so beautiful and life affirming that I was left somewhat dazzled.If only Duke didn't remind me ... ??...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 23, 2023","Aug 27, 2023","Aug 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63241104-tom-lake

I turned to my wife, who knows her history, and asked, ""How many Americans do you think know how significant this agreement is?""She replied, ""Maybe one percent.""I agreed with her. It is often forgotten what the occupying Japanese did to the Korean people before and during World War 2 (not to mention what they did to the Chinese and the Philippine people). It could easily be called a Holocaust or genocide.For a good part of my life, I refused to ever visit Germany, Japan, or Italy because of their crimes against humanity. I eventually dropped Italy from the list, mainly because they were fairly inept when it came to warfare, and partly because all my ancestors are Italian and they did not, from what I studied, participate in Mussolini's dream.Adiva Geffen's book, ""Surviving The Forest,"" is about a beautiful and happy young woman named Sarah, but called, Shurka, and her family having to move from their village, where supposedly the Jews and Gentiles, got along beautifully...celebrating holidays and birthdays together into a neighboring Ghetto and then into the depths of a forest to survive against the Nazis (and also the Polish turncoats) desire to eliminate all Jews.Shurka's story is similar but unique like all stories about the Holocaust. It examines the inhumanity that different races and religions can practice against other human beings...literally no different from them.What makes Ms. Geffen's story somewhat unique is that the story does not end with the end of the war but continues and examines the pogroms against Jews in Poland and elsewhere on the continent after the war...not nearly to the extent of what the Germans managed to do but they nevertheless existed.Israel did not exist as a country until 1948 and the British who controlled the area, refused to let Jewish refugees into what is known today as the country of Israel. It is especially during this time that the pogroms against many of the Jewish people continued as they waited to travel and live either in America or Israel.

I picked Many years ago, I was sitting in a bar in Burbank, drinking a beer, while waiting for a prescription to be filled next door at the pharmacy. I picked up a discarded magazine and started reading an interview with the great music producer, George Martin. At the end of the interview he used a saying I heard many times before but coming from him it affected me differently. He said, ""If you have heroes, do yourself a favor and never meet them because you will only be disappointed.""I worked at a very famous/infamous restaurant where I came in contact with famous people from all walks of life, but especially the movie business. Whether greeting people at the door or waiting tables I met famous people all the time. I had many conversations with a few of them over many years. My conversations with Ray Liotta were so great that when he died it was like I had lost a close friend. The same with Sam Shepard, and Don Rickles. I would say, that 98 percent of the so-called famous people I came in contact with were polite and nice. The two percent that were far from nice or polite, I lost all respect for, regardless of their accomplishments.I have never been star struck nor have I ever asked for an autograph. In truth, all my heroes...except for a few...have been dead for awhile and in some cases nearly a thousand years. When a friend of mine asked me if I would like to meet Martin Scorsese I politely said ""no,"" the words of George Martin ringing loudly in my ears. First impressions can seriously be long lasting and I wasn't going to take a chance. When given an opportunity to meet Frank Sinatra I almost gave in but George Martin's wisdom won out, again.So you must be saying what does this have to do with a biography on the late Rod Serling. Another thing I very, very seldom do is read biographies on movie people, dead or alive. But of late, I have made a few exceptions. I read a biography on the late Mary Tyler Moore because for over twenty years I walked by the studio her husband and she made famous, MTM, nearly every day. I learned a lot about this amazing lady that I had no idea about and was happy I read the book.Rod Serling has been an individual who has fascinated me nearly my whole life and there are three reasons why: 1) The brilliance of The Twilight Zone. 2)His military service during World War 2. He tried to enlist but was turned down because he unknowingly received his draft notice. He could have asked for a deferment because he was accepted at a number of universities but declined. When he told the Colonel in charge that he wanted to be a paratrooper he was rejected because of his height. He was 5ft.5inches tall. He continued to harass the Colonel until the Colonel finally gave in and said, ""if you want it that bad, go ahead. You're in."" He passed basic training and was assigned to the 511th paratrooper infantry division. Being a paratrooper is the most dangerous job you could have in the military, even more dangerous than being a regular infantry combat soldier. Rod Serling was sent to the Pacific arena where he and the rest of the 511th division saw some of the worst combat in the entire war. The 511th was spared the attack on Japan when the Atomic bombs were dropped and the war ended. Ironically, later in life he became a strong advocate against the use and building of nuclear weapons. 3) When asked what he wanted on his tombstone after he had become famous he simply replied, ""He left friends.""Joel Engel's biography, "" Last Stop, The Twilight Zone, The Biography of : Rod Serling,"" was the first biography to come out about Mr. Serling ten years after his death at the age of 5o. It is a comprehensive look at a complex individual who grew up in Binghamton, N.Y., fought in World War 2, graduated from college where he ran the college newspaper, and went to New York City and found success on Kraft Television Theatre with a play called ""Patterns,"" and at Playhouse 90 television theatre with ""Requiem for a Heavyweight."" Before and in-between these two successes there were many rejections of material he had submitted for publication. Rod Serling started his career when Television was in its infantry and companies who advertised on these programs literally had final say on what was acceptable and what wasn't. Without their advertising dollars there was no programming. This would be a sour point with Mr. Serling throughout his career, even when he became a spokesperson for many of the companies that controlled what the audience saw or didn't see.As television grew Mr. Serling moved his family to Los Angeles where most of the T.V. shows were now shot. He was a prolific writer, and when I say prolific I mean prolific. He literally hit it out of the ball park when it came to submitting material. With the success of ""The Twilight Zone,"" he was able to easily sell many of his rejected scripts that he had piled up throughout the years. He wrote two-thirds of ""The Twilight Zone,"" episodes over its five year run which is simply astonishing.Mr. Serling adapted fairly quickly to Hollywood. In no time he was sporting a tan, driving around in convertibles, and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, even though he was warned numerous times by his doctors that he had to stop smoking. The smoking got so bad that he lost his circulation in one of his fingers and couldn't type anymore. From then on, he tape recordered his scripts and plays and his longtime secretary Majorie Langsford would transcribe the recordings.The success of ""The Twilight Zone,"" made Mr. Serling very possibly the most famous writer in America at the time. One reason being that he narrated parts of each show and was on camera for the audience to see. Mr. Serling was a very generous individual who gave to many charities, picked up almost every check when out to dinner with friends, left three-hundred dollar tips, and never turned down a person who asked for an autograph.Despite the success of ""The Twilight Zone,"" he continued to write scripts, plays, and adapt other writers' novels for the movies or T.V. at an unusually fast pace. He was naturally paid handsomely for his work but very little of it ever made it to the big screen or T.V., and if it did it was heavily edited by another writer.Mr. Engel contributes this desire to continually write at such a fast and prolific pace, sport a tan, drive beautiful cars, and always wanting to be in the spotlight to an ""Inferior Complex,"" because of his height...5 feet, 5 inches tall, and a latent knowledge that he was meant to die young like his father who passed away while he was in the military.Mr. Serling would never again reach the peak he hit with ""The Twilight Zone."" ""Night Gallery,"" was a very short lived show which the author attributes to lack of good material. Strangely, this reader at times seemed to get the impression that Mr. Engel, the author, got a certain satisfaction out of Mr. Serling's failures. He put a heavy emphasis on his failures, and his constant need to be recognized, and what he perceived as an 'inferior complex,' coupled with an obsessive compulsive disorder.After finishing reading this book, I wished I had continued to follow Mr. Martin's advice about meeting your heroes...or in this case reading biographies about people who you greatly admire.After a little time passed, I realized that what I read and which disturbed me was the author's impressions of Mr. Serling. Mr. Serling suffered from insomnia, and his compulsion to constantly work might not have been so much the effects of an 'inferior complex,' but his experiences during the war which were gruesome. Even though he wrote about the insanity of war quite a bit, what he and his buddies experienced fighting the Japanese was never far away and when he did get some sleep he dreamed of his military experiences but strangely enough most of the dreams had a happy ending.Mr. Serling was a great talent, undeniably flawed, and who lived with many regrets but in his short life he contributed handsomely and a person who actually lives life will always have their share of regrets like Mr. Serling had. Even in ""The Twilight Zone,"" regrets among many of the characters played a major part in driving the magnificence of the show....more",Notes are private!,2,7,1,"Aug 10, 2023","Aug 18, 2023","Aug 10, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24058758-last-stop-the-twilight-zone

I didn't expect it to be any better than the previous mentioned novel, but I was hoping for something almost as good, compelling, and enlightening and My God did my wish come true.""Songbirds,"" by Ms. Lefteri is based on a true story which takes place on the Island of Cyprus against the backdrop of the Greek and Turkish war over forty years ago. The novel takes place in the present, and it takes a sobering and heart throbbing look at female migrant workers, indentured servants, maids, and waitresses, who the authorities look upon as barely human and when they disappear under unusual circumstances don't bothered to investigate. The migrants are not only there to hopefully pursue a better life and save money to send home to their poverty stricken families, but because the citizens of the island want them there because they are a source of cheap labor which its citizens don't have no desire to do.The story centers on the beautiful Nisha, a native of Sri Lanka who leaves her mother and daughter behind and sends the money she makes working as a maid for Petra, a widowed mother, and her young daughter Aliki. Nisha is not only a beautiful lady but she has the heart of an angel, and in no time Alika thinks more of her as a mother than her own mother.Petra accepts this fact and is amazed at Nisha's knowledge and patience. But it is not until Nisha vanishes on a Sunday night, leaving behind all her valuables and passport, that Petra realizes how very special Nisha really is and how important she is to her and her daughter. Petra goes to the police but they just brush her off and say that she probably went back to her native country, disregarding the simple fact that she left everything of value behind. Unable to accept this nonsense, she starts her own investigation, with the help of Nisha's boyfriend.It is during their investigation that she discovers the dehumanization of the migrants by the authorities and citizens of the Island.""Songbirds,"" is a powerful, eye-opening story that will simply keep you reading. Like, ""The Beekeeper of Aleppo,"" it leaves you with a disturbing look at humanity with occasional glimpses of hope. In many ways, it reminded me of the political, ugly, and disturbing insanity that is coming out of the mouths of our politicians right here in the U.S., and being cheered on by a large percentage of our population.

Civics is a dying ""subject"" in schools across our country.Civics teaches us about the three branches of government, The Declaration Of Independence, The Articles of Confederation, The Constitution , The Bill of Rights, and all the additional amendments which have been added. It is a study guide to how our country functions as a democracy, and when individuals have never taken a civics course is it any wonder that they would cheer on an illiterate, egoistical, person who puts himself above his country?

She has been told that, unlike her sister Lillian, she is not the pretty one in her family. When the influenza virus kills everyone in her family, she is left with a huge inheritance.She decides she needs a change. After all, at forty she has not been anywhere and she dresses like an old maid. She goes to an upscale clothing store in Cleveland and a young saleswoman Mildred literally does a complete make-over of Agnes. Out with the old and in with the new and suddenly the not so pretty Agnes turns out to be quite pretty.She books a trip to Egypt. The year is 1921.

In just a span of a couple of weeks she becomes witness to the haphazard redrawing of the Middle East and the foundation of a treaty that has been labelled: The Peace to End all Peace. One hundred years later, one could still point to that map as almost every reason for all the wars and insanity that have taken place in the Middle East.

It's not that I have anything against actors or actresses, movie executives, writers, and directors because I don't. I was simply around them all the time.Back a very long time ago, I read a couple of s for ""Ordinary People,"" which won the best picture, director, and supporting actor awards at the Academy awards (beating out the great ""Raging Bull). Mary Tyler Moore also received a best actress nomination but did not win.A number of ers who praised her performance also went out of the way to say that the Mary Tyler Moore we saw in the movie, a stand offish and unlikeable mother, was more like the real Mary Tyler Moore in real life. I thought to myself, at that time, that that was pure bullshit. That Mrs. Moore in real life was more like Mary Richards on the great, ""Mary Tyler Moore Show or more like Laura Petrie on the Dick Van Dyke Show."" The reason I came to this conclusion was because of the authenticity Mrs. Moore brought to both those roles. The Mary Tyler Moore in ""Ordinary People,"" was an actress giving a great performance.For nearly 25 years of my life I lived right down the street from 'MTM' in beautiful Studio City, Ca.'MTM' was the very successful company started by Mrs. Moore and her husband at the time Grant Tinker. MTM was a very small studio compared to studios like Warner Bros. or Disney but it had a charm and beauty and closeness about it that no other studio I had ever been on possessed. In a way, it was representative of the many wonderful T.V. sitcoms that were shot there.""Mary, The Mary Tyler Moore Story,"" by Herbie J. Pilato did clarify one thing for me and that was that Mary Tyler Moore in real life was more like Mary Richards and Laura Petrie, and not the mother in ""Ordinary People."" Mrs. Moore also exemplified the one principal that President Teddy Roosevelt often talked about in his speeches. The principal that if one is fortunate in life to possess large sums of money or notoriety, one has an obligation to give back and Mrs. Moore not only gave back with large contributions of money to the causes she believed in, such as animal rights, stem cell research, women's rights, juvenile diabetes (which she suffered from) and childhood diseases but she also gave of her time, despite working all the time.I enjoyed Mr. Pilato's book but I'm certain there are better books out there about this amazing woman and icon....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jun 12, 2023","Jun 27, 2023","Jun 12, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53103294-mary

They are more interested in their stock holders than their workers and the best way to get what you want is to buy off our less than holy politicians. The late Senator John McCain, the last republican I had any respect for, said, ""it's getting to the point that the only people who are going to have a vote in this country are the rich."" Well, I hate to disagree with Senator McCain but the rich people, the big companies, have controlled the vote for hundreds of years in our lovely country but it is getting worse which seems almost impossible but true nevertheless.Ms. Russell's book thoroughly explores the many aspects of a big company and their control over workers, fear of stock holders, and politicians doing what many do best and that's taking the contributions and turning the other way.Her heroes, in contrast to many depictions of union disputes, is mostly the women (wives) of Calumet, Michigan who go to bat against the Copper Company that employs most of the men of the town and whose unfair and deadly practices their husbands' are subject to for such meager salaries.Ms. Russell's characters are simply fantastic, her writing sublime, and one could easily read this 300 page book in one or two sittings it moves so quickly.

Father Emilio Sandoz asked of his fellow companions as they explore the distant plant of Rakhat, a few light years away from earth, and orbits around three suns.Mary Doria Russell's ""The Sparrow,"" is like a 360 degree turn from the two previous novels I have read by this amazing author. The one thing it has in common is its brilliance.I've read where other ers have compared it to the works of H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury and I can definitely see the similarities but I will take it a step further and say that Ms. Russell's novel goes to a place where few authors have been successful. She makes inquiries into the very 'essence' of religion...of Christianity, Judaism, and God's place in the universe. She joins that elite group of authors, Yeats, Joyce, T.S. Elliot, Dostoevsky, and Graham, who have had the courage to question the dogmas, principles and tenets of religions.I would be amiss if I did not say that this novel might not be for everyone. It leaves you pondering questions that could be quite disturbing and unnerving.

The keeping of statistics on returning veterans who have committed suicide after fighting for their country is a relatively new thing...so we have have no statistics of suicides among veterans after returning from Vietnam, Korea, World War 2, etc...Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) wasn't considered a psychological disorder until the early 1980's. Ms. Leaming's, ""Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: The Untold Story,"" is a fascinating analysis of Mrs. Kennedy's behavior after the assassination of her husband, President Kennedy, in Dallas on November of 1963. Relying on interviews, first hand accounts of her sudden mood changes, and her behavior for most of life after the death of the President, Mrs Leaming's makes a convincing, yet very sad case, that she suffered from PTSD for most of her life and up until her death at the age of sixty-four.Her marriage to Mr. Onassis, which many saw as a gold digger going after a rich, older man's immense wealth, is explained in a way which contradicts the notion that Mrs. Kennedy was a gold digger. First, Mrs. Kennedy was quite wealthy and secondly, she had a number of extremely rich, younger men who had previously proposed to her. What these younger rich men didn't have was their own island like Mr. Onassis. One of the signs of PTSD is one's desire to be alone, to be in areas that are viewed as safe and Mrs. Kennedy throughout her life after the assassination desired safety and being left alone or among people and situations that she deemed safe.If one had told me that I would be reading a biography on Mrs. Kennedy, just six months ago, I would have said that is highly unlikely.

The Germans, true to form and not wanting to disappoint the Führer, continued their genocidal policies in Italy like they did everywhere they went...even when it cost them battlefield loses such as in the Ukraine.The Italian Catholics and Jews formed 'cells,' among themselves in the northern towns of Italy to fight the Germans, to survive until the allies finally defeated the Nazis. Rabbis gowned the vestments of priests, Jewish women wore the garments of Catholic nuns and taught in Catholic schools, Jewish mothers housed and fed the Italian partisans fighting the Germans and Communists. Jewish children and adults were given Italian last names and forged identifications.Religion did not divide these two groups. In a very real sense, it provided cover and safety.

His response was, ""If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible, although I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.""I have pondered this question and answer for most of my adult life and I have usually arrived at the hypnosis, that if Hitler and his group of madman did conquer Russia they would have killed Stalin and eliminated his group of madmen. Then the allies, at a great cost of human life, would have defeated Germany, occupied Russia, and there would never have been a Soviet Empire, or as President Reagan so aptly called it ""The evil empire.""Back in the early to mid-eighties when I was living in Los Angeles many of my friends thought that President Reagan would most certainly start World War 3. That he was the worse possible thing that could ever happen to America which is saying a lot since President Nixon and LBJ had not been out of office that long.I disagreed with many of President Reagan's foreign and domestic policies, but when it came to the Soviet Union I was one-hundred percent in agreement. Many of my friends were rich, spoiled, children, and unlike poor little me from the Bronx, they had been to Russian occupied countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary and they thought they were wonderful, not much different than the U.S. Of course, they never travelled outside of the capitals or to the parts of the capitals that the governments of these countries steered travelers away from...concerned for their safety.I on the other hand, had the good fortune to have professors who searched for the truth, and not illusions. Who went against the popular myths about the Soviet Union and opened my eyes to the atrocities carried out by Stalin and members of the communist party, and the ones that were the most horrifying to me were the inhuman, brutal, premeditated, conscious policy of forcing Ukrainian peasants off their land and into collective farms and as a result creating a catastrophic famine from 1931-1933 that killed 4 million Ukrainians and another one million Russians, Polish, and Germans who lived in different parts of Russia.Anne Applebaum's, ""Red Famine,"" is the best book I have ever read about the Red Famine of 1931-1933 and explicitly states that the 4 million Ukrainians who perished were not accidental victims of poor policy but the deliberate wish of Stalin and the communist to kill them and to wipe out the entire Ukrainian culture, language, and history.Warning: This book is graphic as it should be, exceptionally researched, lucid, and very, very powerful....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Apr 30, 2023","May 06, 2023","Apr 30, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39947758-red-famine

The Serhii Plokhy's, ""The Gates of Europe (A History of Ukraine)"" is a comprehensive, informative history of Ukraine covering a period of 1500 years. The book is around 370 pages, whereas in my view it would have been a much better book if it was about 800 pages. If one wants to cover 1500 years of a country's history, especially one as complicated as Ukraine, longer is definitely better.In short, the first 150 pages of Mr. Plokhy's book are nightmarish to get through. The reader encounters so many different regions of the country, individuals, ancient religions, emperors, Kings, Cossacks, invaders, and different languages etc. etc. that it is nearly impossible to follow the narrative which was really unnerving to me because I have studied Russian history which is so intertwined with Ukrainian history.Suddenly around the beginning of the 18th century the cloud is lifted, and the cast of characters are more familiar, such as Catherine 2, Napoleon, Emperor Alexander 2, Hitler and Stalin (What history of any European or Slavic country would be complete without the mention of these two madmen and their henchmen) Brezhnev, Gorbachev, Putin and Zelensky.And the invading countries, well, they're familiar also, such as Poland, France, The British, The Germans, Russians, and every country that seemed to border Ukraine. And let us not forget the rivalry between the religions and their aspirations to convert, such as The Roman Catholic Church, The Greek Catholic church, the orthodox Greek Church, Protestant denominations, and of course the Jews who weren't trying to convert anybody but when all excuses fail, blame the Jews.It is quite amazing to me how the Jews, who currently make up 0.2 per cent of the world population, could be the cause of so many problems. You see, it doesn't always pay to study hard, get an education, and do research that benefits all of humanity, help heal the sick, and seem to cause very few or no problems. Ukraine, until recently or just before the invasion of Crimea and now the entire country by Putin and Russia, was never truly in charge of its own country. Poland controlled part of Ukraine as did Lithuania, Hungary, Austria, Germany, and of course Russia. The Russians actually tried to rid Ukraine of their language, and make Russian the official language.When the country finally became whole after the end of the cold war, few saw it surviving because of all the different cultures, religions, and languages but to the surprise of everyone they did survive as a diverse country with the vast majority of its population considering themselves Ukrainian regardless of their backgrounds.Putin read into the myth that the Ukrainians were divided, and that when he invaded the Russian population of Ukraine would welcome them as liberators.

She becomes a leader, and teaches the ever growing number of refugees how to survive and how to keep out of the sight of the Germans who occasionally patrol the forests.The story is fictional, but it is heavily based on the true life experiences of the Bielski Group of Jewish refugees, who numbered as many as twelve hundred members, who escaped the genocide inside the surrounding ghettos and lived in the forests until the end of the war, fighting the Nazis, and surviving on the food the wilderness had to offer.Ms. Harmel is an excellent writer, and I highly recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 31, 2023","Apr 06, 2023","Mar 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711683-the-forest-of-vanishing-stars

For me, his works of literature have had the greatest of influences on me.After about thirty years of reading mostly the 'Classics,' I decided about ten years ago that it was about time I started reading more modern writers.

The great thing about reading a book three or four times, especially when the book is one by Dostoevsky, is that you always learn new things. ""The Idiot,"" highlights the great comic touch in his writing that is often overlooked and I laughed throughout large segments of the novel. The characters, like in all his novels, are so fully realized, never one dimensional, and always unforgettable. Of course, the Prince is not an idiot but suffers from epilepsy and possesses a soul and a conscience that many of the other characters do not and so they have no problem calling him an idiot because isn't life all about prestige and money.It is the character of the prince that is at the center of Russian society in the mid-to-late 1800's, and it is through him that we experience spiritual compassion, caring and love for the sick and dying, class differences, and the enigma of beauty that can lead to deadly consequences.Over the years some critics have said that Dostoevsky is too Russian. Of course they are totally wrong because if he was too Russian his popularity would never have achieved its world wide acclaim.

In the short story, 'The Shape You're In,"" Sarah, a young twenty-five year old artist, takes a job at a Montana University and at first the new environment is so different from the environment that she lived in back in Atlanta that she is fascinated by all that she sees. Slowly, the fascination turns into a deadly, paranoia, where behind every tree she feels danger and with every conversation with another person she tries to figure out their motives and what they truly intend on doing with her. This short story has remnants of Hemingway, especially the way it ends. ""The Death of Julius Geissler,"" is an absolutely beautiful short story about the magnificence of music. It is lyrical, enchanting, and heart throbbing.My favorite of all the stories is the final one titled, ""The Disobedience of Water."" It is in this story that she reaches the pinnacle of her craft. The one thing that distinguishes a good writer from a great writer and that is ""HONESTY."" The honesty in this short story is so powerful that at times it tears you apart. It is in this gem of a story that we discover the writer, Ms. Naslund. The writer who differentiates herself from Hemingway, Capote, and all the great short story writers I mentioned above....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 14, 2023","Feb 17, 2023","Feb 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/100966.The_Disobedience_of_Water

The clock and watches glow in the dark and so do the girls. They use a process known as Lip-Dip-Paint where they place the tip of the paint brush into their mouths to get a more perfect, neat, and tidy layer of paint on the dials.When some of the girls start getting deadly sick and dying, the company heads start a cover up denying any association with the sickly and dying girls and hailing the benefits of radium which at the time was not classified as a poisonous chemical. They have their doctors doing the autopsies and examinations and coming up with results such as the girl died from syphilis or the girls they examined were perfectly healthy.It takes the courage and tenacity of very sick girls, and two lawyers, to fight the corporations and their lies and expose the deadly nature of radium, and in so doing they lead the charge that would eventually lead to regulations, and ultimately saving the lives of thousands of innocent women.Ms. Moore's depiction of the afflicted girls, some testifying from their death beds, is nothing short of brilliant, eliciting emotions that even the most stoic readers would find hard not to shed a tear. This book raises the age old question: Is there really equal justice for all in America? The answer, in my opinion, is a resounding NO. Despite the millions of deaths caused by the tobacco industry each year, cigarettes are still legal. Despite all the mass shootings, one can still purchase a semi-automatic gun with no problem. Yes, there are settlements but that doesn't bring back the victims, and barely touches the bottom lines of these corporations.There is so much dark money in our politics that the idea of equal justice for all sounds totally insane. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 31, 2023","Feb 04, 2023","Jan 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31409135-the-radium-girls

It is a projeI have read quite a few books on the Kennedys but, in my opinion, nothing compares to Ms. Goodwin's, ""The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys."" It is a project that took her nine years to complete. The writing, insights, analysis, and the totality of the book is truly amazing which shouldn't surprise me since Ms. Goodwin is one of the great historians of our time and her biographies on Lincoln, LBJ and Theodore Roosevelt are among my favorite biographies.The biography begins with the Fitzgerald family arriving from Ireland in the 1850's and settling in the North End of Boston where conditions were so bad that thirty five out of every one hundred children died before the age of five and the prejudice against Catholics and Irish immigrants was despicable, as was the prejudice against the Italians, Blacks, and Jews.The Fitzgerald's moved up in Boston society as a result of John Fitzgerald, Rose's father, who became an employee of one of the big bosses in the district and who oversaw the young Fitzgerald's gradual climb up the ladder of politics and eventually becoming the mayor of the city.Rose would eventually marry Joseph Kennedy whose ambition was insatiable and whose business successes and wealth would make his family's name synonymous with those of J.P. Morgan and the Rockefeller's. The details that Ms. Goodwin's many characters, especially of the Kennedy family and their children, is done with such clarity and personal recollections that by the end of the biography you feel like you have a personal relationship with all of them.In the truest sense this is a biography of the immigrants who arrived on the shores of America and were treated, in many ways, in such a manner that one could only describe it as inhumane, and by the time Jack Kennedy becomes president these same immigrant groups would become the foundation that built the greatest industrial nation on earth.Ms. Goodwin toward the end of the book quotes Melville who said, ""We are the heirs of all time, and with all nations we divide our inheritance. On this Western Hemisphere all tribes and people are forming into one federated whole; and there is a future which shall see the estranged children of Adam restored as the old hearthstone in (an American) Eden ...

If anything I have become more embittered and disgusted by the actions of the Germans...about the inhumanity they showed they were capable of against fellow human beings.Back in the 80's when I still had grand plans about visiting as many countries in the world as possible, the only three countries I said I would never visit were Germany, Japan, and Italy. The atrocities they committed against fellow human beings I could never forgive.When people would ask me that if I was German or Japanese, and put into the same circumstances, do I actually think I wouldn't have followed the orders to kill? My answer was always the same, ""That one never knows but I would hope to God that I would have the courage to say 'no,' and let them take my life before I killed innocent women and children.""The idea that all German and Japanese citizens were not complicit in the actions of their country men and leaders does not fly with me. Unless you were among the resistance groups against these heartless bastards you were most certainly complicit.As I got older my stance against these countries softened because I didn't think the younger generations should have to pay for the crimes committed by their ancestors. And another factor was my advance knowledge of world history during the last 120 years. Sadly, the atrocities committed by the Germans and Japanese were not isolated. There was Turkey's Holocaust against the Armenians, Stalin's Holocaust against his own people and the Ukrainians and the Poles. Russia and Syria's atrocities against Syrian dissenters and innocent children, women, and the elderly, and of course the European colonization of Africa as so brilliantly written about in ""Heart of Darkness,"" by Joseph Conrad.And of course, America's embrace of slavery that lead to a Civil War, and even after emancipation the prejudice and murder of blacks across the south and the introduction of the ""Jim Crow Laws,"" that limited blacks from voting and attending the same schools as whites.Finally, a word about Roxane Van Iperen's novel, ""The Sisters of Auschwitz,"" which in my opinion is one of the best books I have read about the Holocaust. It centers around two sisters, Janny and Lein Brilleslijper and their families and friends who form a network of resistance against the occupying Nazis who have invaded the Netherlands.The book is an extensive look at how families are split up in the hope of surviving, children living apart from their mothers and fathers, friends of the resistance hiding out in different houses trying to escape the Nazis' brutality. The hope that the Brilleslijper family and Jews throughout the country put into the Allied liberation of their country which seems like it might never come, and finally the deportation of the family and friends to Auschwitz. The scenes in the concentration camps are so real and horrifying that even this veteran of Holocaust history simply cringed with disgust and pity. Ms. Iperen also shed's light on Ann Frank's family and how her and her sister died in the Bergen-Belsen camp, and how Janny and Lein were their friends and witnessed their deaths. The novel is based totally on facts, documents, letters, and interviews with the sisters and surviving members of their families and the resistance.

Tolstoy told how he entertained the eager crowd for hours with tales of Alexander, Caesar, Frederick the Great, and Napoleon. When he was winding to a close, the chief stood and said, “But you have not told us a syllable about the greatest general and greatest ruler of the world. We want to know something about him. He was a hero. He spoke with a voice of thunder; he laughed like the sunrise and his deeds were strong as the rock….His name was Lincoln and the country in which he lived is called America, which is so far away that if a youth should journey to reach it he would be an old man when he arrived. Tell us of that man.”The above quote is taken from Doris Kearns Goodwin's, ""Team of Rivals:The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln."" In my opinion one of the greatest biographies on the Sixteen President of the United States. It is telling tale of how famous President Lincoln had become, but unlike the other men Tolstoy told the chief about, Lincoln's ""deeds were strong as the rock.""Jon Meacham's ""And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle,"" is more like a memoir, a diary, written by this flawed but greatest of all presidents. It is so personal, that it left me shaken and next to tears. The research that went into this book is a testimony to Mr. Meacham's love and awe of this one of a kind president, leader, and commander. 260 pages of this book are simply reference and index notes.Unlike any book I have read on Lincoln, this book explores the inner workings and beliefs of Lincoln. He possessed a moral compass that might sway occasionally, but in the end it always landed on the righteous and virtuous nature of the man... righteous and virtuous nature we wish in all our leaders and find in so, so few. That is not to say that Lincoln was not an acute politician and depending on the audience swayed from some of his profound beliefs. He understood politics as well as anyone.He was a man profoundly influenced by the Bible and Christianity, and often quoted from the Bible when making speeches, yet one could not for a fact say that he believed in a God, yet it was passages from the Bible and the Declaration of Independence that formed the foundation of his humanity: That all men are created equal, and in the eyes of a all forgiven God that all men regardless of race, religion, and education deserved to be treated the same and should never to be shackled and involuntarily detained as property.When greeting the famous, once enslaved, Frederick Douglass at the White House, Mr Douglass said, ""That President Lincoln stood up and shook my hand as an equal.""While reading this great biography, I seriously wondered if any presidents of the United States even came close to the moral convictions of President Lincoln, or was he simply one of a kind like Babe Ruth. The only presidents that I could think of that even came close to Mr. Lincoln, were Presidents Washington, Teddy Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter, and Joe Biden.

Whether it be her nonfiction, fiction, or essays, her work contains the one quality that all great writers are able to achieve and that is 'honesty.'Her insights into human behavior and how we humans interact with the environment we are a part of is reminiscent, in the strangest of ways, to Joseph Conrad's works. Their styles of writing are completely different, but the affects of their work is very similar. Joseph Conrad is my favorite writer, and when I compare someone's works to his that is the highest compliment I can pay to a writer.Their is not an essay in Ms. Patchett's collection that I did not like, but there are quite a few I found to be outstanding, such as the one titled 'These Precious Days,' which deals with Tom Hanks' assistant Sooki Raphael's fight with pancreatic cancer, during the Covid pandemic, and the amazing friendship that springs up between Ms. Patchett and Sooki over a three year period.Another is ""To The Doghouse,"" which is about Peanut's cartoon character, the amazing Snoopy and his transformations into Joe Cool, and into a World War 1 flying ace and his dogfights with the Red Baron, and his love of reading such classics as ""The Heart Of Darkness."" Snoopy is a writer who often ends up on top of his doghouse with his typewriter typing ""it was a dark and stormy night.""Ms. Patchett started reading Peanut cartoons when she was still a child, but like Snoopy she followed his example that one does not have to write in a beautiful studio to be a great writer but anywhere you might get inspiration like on your kitchen table, and that even though Snoopy got rejection notices from publishers he never gave up and why, because like Mr. Patchett his imagination is too great and his brain is full with too much information and stories not to put down in writing.Ms. Patchett seems like the kind of person you would meet and come away with the impressions of her, she leaves you to believe in these essays: a caring, loving, dedicated lady, with a big heart.Sadly, if I ever did have a chance to meet her I would decide not to unless I could be around her for an extended period of time. I worked in a very famous restaurant (which was more like a saloon) with the best food in town. When given a chance to meet two of my idols, Paul McCartney and Frank Sinatra, I decided not to and the reason why is because if they seemed standoffish or unpleasant that experience would have an affect on me every time I heard their music. I simply could not take that chance.Yet, some of the best pieces of writing I did were about superstars like Sam Shepard, Don Rickles, and Ray Liotta but with them I had the pleasure of talking to them for long periods of time and over years.""These Precious Days: Essays,"" are a must read for those familiar with Ms. Patchett's works, and even for does who are not....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 21, 2022","Nov 27, 2022","Nov 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56922687-these-precious-days

They are the the personal memoirs of a celebrated Victorian soldier, Harry Flashman, who was born in the early Eighteen twenties and died in 1905.Those collection of papers have been turned into eight novels by writer/ editor George MacDonald Fraser.

As I would soon learn the book was much more fiction than actual history and it, more or less, covered Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and Nikola Tesla, but I did come away with a small understanding of the difference between AC and DC electrical currents and enough interest to pursue the topic further.I went on to read a number of nonfiction books that covered the history of electrical science which also dealt with the three main people associated with the science: Edison, Westinghouse, and Tesla. But, it was not until I read ""Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse and the Race to Electrify the World,"" by Jill Jonnes that my interest peaked.So, from there I decided to read biographies dedicated not to the three men, but biographies on each individual, and I started with the most fascinating of them all, Nikola Tesla.""Wizard: The Life and Times of Nicola Tesla/ Biography Of a Genius,"" by Marc J. Seifer was where I started and believe me I was not disappointed. The word 'genius' is often thrown around quite easily, but throughout this book I kept going through famous names who I thought were comparable with the genius of Mr. Tesla. After reading two-thirds of the book, I came up with two names who I thought Nikola Tesla was comparable too: Leonard da Vinci and Ben Franklin. And in a strange occurrence, a couple pages further into the book, a number of magazines and distinguished individuals said, ""That Nicola Tesla deserved to be included in the select group of da Vinci and Franklin.""Nicola Tesla was born in Croatia and was of Serbian decent. He was able to speak up to ten different languages, and was profoundly affected by literature and poetry. Aside from being the genius behind the Niagara Falls Project that send electricity over greater areas than ever before imagined and lighting up much of the Chicago World's Fair in the middle 1890's, he also invented the first robots, wireless telegraphy, the radio (which was originally attributed to the Italian inventor Marconi who literally stole his ideas and was forced by courts in Europe and America to acknowledge his theft) and laser bean technology which the U.S. government refused to buy the patents for but was quick to get hold of the 87 trunks stored in Manhattan after his death. Eighty years later, much of that material in those trunks are still considered highly classified and the material and designs have never been seen.Mr. Tesla lived a life a luxury, residing at the Waldorf Astoria for over twenty years and other famous hotels throughout Manhattan. His only problem was his inability to keep up with the payments at these hotels. His associates included Mark Twain, John Astor, J.P. Morgan, George Westinghouse, the Rockefeller's, and the list goes on and on. But, it was J.P. Morgan who caused him the most headaches and destroyed his biggest dream The Wardenclyffe Tower that he built on Long Island and promised to deliver wireless telegraphs across the Atlantic. Tesla, out of generosity, simply gave Morgan 51 per cent of the Wardenclyffe project for his investment, but once Morgan figured out that such a powerful device would cost some of his current businesses to go bankrupt he held back much of the investment and it was never completed and eventually destroyed.Nicola Tesla was a complicated genius, generous, trusting, and was the first to admit that all inventions were simply the byproduct of ideas and creations that came before. He was a conservationist whose inventions he felt would keep the air and nature clean and would lessen the hard labor of the working class.In summary Goethe's lyrics from ""Prometheus.""Cover your heaven, Zeus,With cloudy vapours,And test your strength, like a boyBeheading thistles,On oaks and mountain peaks;Yet you must leaveMy earth alone,And my hut you did not build,And my hearth,Whose fireYou envy me.Did you supposeI should hate life,Flee into the wilderness,Because not allMy blossoming dreams bore fruit?Here I sit, making menIn my own image,A race that shall be like me,That shall suffer, weep,Know joy and delight,And ignore youAs I do!...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Oct 25, 2022","Nov 16, 2022","Oct 25, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/494.Wizard

Sadly, after the war it was mostly the men that were recognized as heroes, and Madame Fourcade and her network were virtually left out of the spotlight and it wasn't until recently that her and her network of spies are receiving the recognition they so richly deserved.A SIDE NOTE: For those who believe it's no big deal that our former president took highly classified documents down to Mar-a-Lago, let me remind you that it is the information in those documents that put the lives of our agents in jeopardy, and the security of our country and our allies at risk.

Granted,Jill Jonnes' ""Empires of Light,"" Is by far the best book I have read about Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse and the electrifying of the world. Granted, I have only read a few books that cover all three of these geniuses.Like so many people, I have been captivated by geniuses and by the types of lives they led, their social encounters and groups of friends, their heroes, and what makes them strive so ardently to achieve what they achieve. Not surprisingly, it is very seldom about money. It is usually a fascination with nature, with making the world they live in a better place (but not always), a burning desire to explain the unknown and to find answers to it, and they are usually very competitive. Electricity has been around since the beginning of time, and was probably mentioned over a thousand years ago by a Greek inventor. Electricity, very simply, is part of nature and is witnessed anytime you see a thunderstorm. Neither Edison, Tesla, or Westinghouse were the first to come up with the idea of harnessing electricity and making use of it, but they were among the first to successfully shackle it's energy safely and to light up the world and make night into day and to forge ahead with what many consider the second industrial revolution.The three men were quite familiar with each other, fighting over patents, occasionally working together, and in the case of Tesla and Westinghouse forming a partnership and creating the machinery to harness AC (alternating current) and lighting up the World's Fair in Chicago, and then using the power of Niagara Falls (AC and DC/Direct current) to light up the city of Buffalo that was over thirty miles away and by doing so changing the world, and making possible the reality of one main power station lighting up tens of thousands of businesses and homes miles and miles away.The contributions of all three men can not be overstated, but without the talented engineers working for them none of this would have been possible so quickly. Edison and Westinghouse literally housed many of their workers and in the case of Westinghouse he treated his workers like family. Tesla was more like a loose cannon and when he first came to America from Serbia he worked for Thomas Edison who at that time was considered the greatest inventor of his time. He asked for a raise and was fired by Edison. He became a free agent and was picked up by Westinghouse and together, and with a group of highly talented engineers, they picked up where Edison left off. Edison refused to acknowledge the advantages of AC over DC current, and where he continued to use DC current to light up single homes and small city blocks it was AC current and the engineers' ability to transform it into direct current as it entered work places and homes that transformed the world.Both Edison and Westinghouse died rich but the really big winners when it came to money was the WALL STREET INVESTORS who bought out their companies and made billions, if not trillions. Inventing is a costly business and without investors you are not usually going to have much of a chance.

It's about love, and it reminds us that the way we deal with death is by living.This in not ""The Dovekeepers,"" nor ""The World That we Knew,"" but it is powerful, spellbinding and pure Alice Hoffman....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 10, 2022","Sep 12, 2022","Sep 10, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/177515.The_Ice_Queen

In fact, it is more depressing than it is up lifting. It is work of fiction based very much on actual events: The Russian slaughter of Jews in Ukraine in the late 1890's, the wave of Jewish and Italian immigrants to New York where they are forced to work for nothing and have no rights which is perfectly okay with the corrupt politicians running Tammany Hall and the bought off policemen, children working 12 hour days in factories with little ventilation and the threat of deadly fires, and a disregard for human life, unless one is lucky enough to be rich.""The Museum of Extraordinary Things,"" is run by the sinister impresario Mr. Sardie who was once a famous magician in Europe until he was forced to leave and come to America where he decides to trade in magic for science and to open shop on the ever expanding amusing park known as Coney Island in Brooklyn. The museum thrills the public by showcasing human beings with deformities, such as a man who is cover with hair and is called the Wolfman or a girl with no arms but when made up looks like a Butterfly. They are paid very little, but since it is the only work they can get they have no choice. Looking for bigger and better attractions to compete with larger and newer attractions on Coney Island, Mr. Sardie will stop at nothing to keep in business and make more money, including taking the corpse of a young lady killed by a nefarious killer who was hired by an attorney that represents the owners of the factories down in lower Manhattan. The young lady was causing problems and bringing to light the abuses, poor wagers, and horrible working conditions the employees were forced to endure.Mr. Sardie, the scientist, drains the body of blood and fills it would embalming fluid with the sole intention of cutting off her legs and using it as an attraction (half woman, half fish). This act of inhumanity is one of many stories that carry this hair rising novel to its conclusion.Ms. Hoffman's depictions of turn-of-the century New York are as truthful as any novelist writing about this time that I have read. In truth, like I said earlier it is horrifying, yet mesmerizing and educational. Her characters are marvelous and her storytelling, like always, is spellbinding.

His future is bright and he has just been accepted at a highly acclaimed school, but like so many black teenagers he is arrested unfairly and sent to juvenile reformatory called the 'The Nickel Academy.'The Academy is the worse nightmare that one could impose on a teenager. The men in charged are racist, mean-spirited, cruel, and in short, run a chamber of horrors. Elwood survives by reciting quotes to himself from Martin Luther King, and reading anything he can get his hands on. He is not the type to cause trouble and he forms a relationship with another boy, Turner, who thinks Elwood is naive and doesn't see the world for how crooked it really is, yet despite this they do look out for each other and their bond is strong.Elwood, despite being a quiet and obeying student, is nevertheless tortured by his white superiors in charge and is left with scares on his legs that are grotesque and mind altering.It is the ramifications from this type of cruelty, that lead Elwood and Turner down a path that is both riveting and terrifying and takes the reader on a journey of discovery ... that there are two Americans, especially in the south right up through the 1970's: one for the privileged whites and one for the lowly blacks and how that discrimination is passed down from one generation to another.

López, “Cooperstown Picasso.”During the 1990’s, it became commonplace for me to travel to New York the second week of October. OneReview of Andrés G. López, “Cooperstown Picasso.”During the 1990’s, it became commonplace for me to travel to New York the second week of October. One reason was simply to visit my family, and the second reason was because it was during the weekend of the second week that my brothers, friends, and I, all originally from the Bronx, would travel to this enchanted little town in Central New York called Cooperstown.Naturally, Cooperstown to most baseball fans and even non-baseball fans is the home of The Baseball Hall of Fame. Strangely enough, if you didn’t know the Hall of Fame was in this beautiful and magical town you could easily walk by it and not even notice this so-called monument to the greatest baseball players of all time and that is ideally the way it should be, in my opinion.When you walk through the town, nestled alongside the picturesque Lake Otsego, it is hard not to imagine that once upon a time most of America was similar to this town with quaint restaurants and bars, bookstores, colonial homes, adjacent farms, lake side homes, friendly and courteous citizens, and happy and cheerful children playing baseball while their parents look on. You doubt that any movie studio could re-create the enchantment of such a place, possibly the façade, but never the heart and soul of the people who live here or visit.“Cooperstown Picasso” captures vividly the ambiance and vitality of this lovely town. Novelist Andrés López takes us behind the façade that we see when we walk the streets of Cooperstown, visit its restaurants and bars, and admire its glorious architecture and pristine natural beauty. It is a gripping, suspenseful, and emotionally rich tale wrought with lies, scandals, marital infidelities, and much, much more. The main character, Dr. Tobias Pi, a divorced literature professor teaching at Pleasant Hills College, is the unsuspecting witness, and eventually a target, of many unseemly activities taking place in Cooperstown.The novel opens up with Dr. Pi teaching Shakespeare’s sonnet 55, a poem with great relevance to the story because it explores the romantic imagination, outlook, and the basis of genuine inspiration. While marble and golden monuments, the speaker claims, will be destroyed in war and savaged by time, the written poem, the “living record” of love, will live on in the fair memory of the young, preserved eternally by language that is masterfully wrought:Not marble nor the gilded monumentsOf princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,But you shall shine more bright in these contentsThan unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.When wasteful war shall statues overturn,And broils root out the work of masonry,Nor Mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burnThe living record of your memory.Gainst death and all-oblivious enmityShall you pace forth; your praise shall still find roomEven in the eyes of all posterityThat wear this world out to the ending doom.So, till the Judgement that yourself arise,You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.A powerful theme in the novel is thus that great art is life affirming, enriching, and that it elevates and sustains humanity through its darkest and bleakest times. Like the character Jay Gatsby in Fitzgerald’s tragic novel, Dr. Pi is an optimist who tries to move beyond a debilitating past with courage and conviction because he believes that love can work miracles, fill one with hope, and that the good in people far outweighs their human frailties.Pi is fifty -one years old and lives in a large, old Victorian home in Pleasant Hills, and once a week he goes up to Cooperstown to teach a writing class to nurse practitioners. The distance from Pleasant Hills to Cooperstown is about an hour, and the hilly terrain, narrow roads, and wintry weather makes for some very exciting action scenes. Mr. López knows this country and terrain very well, and he uses it to perfection, and, in a sense, it symbolically becomes an important character in the story.Except for Dr. Pi’s visits to Cooperstown, he lives a fairly simple life. He lives alone. His daughter, Constance, has moved to NYC and his son, Christopher, lives in Vermont with his family. Each night before falling asleep he texts each child a “Good-night, Love you, Dad.” His ex-wife whom he still loves lives in San Diego where she takes care of her parents. During the many quiet hours Dr. Pi spends alone he often thinks of his sister Maria, a gifted pianist, who was tragically killed in an accident when she was just sixteen. He used to love hearing her play music, and, as a nine-year-old, would sit next to her and turn the pages of her music book as she practiced. These are haunting memories, along with the loss of his mother, Miriam. Dr. Pi is also a musician and plays the guitar and many of his original compositions to relax. He usually falls asleep watching scientific shows on TV.Like so many lonely men, Dr. Pi falls into an online relationship with a beautiful and talented young Russian woman, Katerina, who is twenty-four and now lives in Poland. They text and post pictures of themselves on Instagram, and he depends on her texts and pictures to cheer and inspire him. He knows the idea of a fifty-one-year-old man and a twenty-four-year beauty ever having an intimate and loving relationship is insane but that does not stop him from seriously thinking of going to visit her in Poland, or inviting her to his home, all expenses paid.During his once-a-week trip to Cooperstown to teach the nurse practitioners, he arrives early and sits on a bench close to the water. He is totally alone until out of nowhere an attractive lady, Janet Brayden, sits on the bench beside him. They exchange pleasantries but that’s about all, and after about fifteen minutes she gets up and leaves. Pi doesn’t give it much thought until a few weeks later, while in Cooperstown and eating at a bar and restaurant, she approaches his table and reminds him of the night they were sitting on the bench. He invites her to sit down, and they converse about themselves. She tells him that she’s a painter and invites him to her house to look at and possibly buy some of her art.It doesn’t take him long to visit Janet. She’s not only an artist but is very pretty and in her mid- forties, much closer in age than Katerina. Janet shows him her studio, and eventually her gallery, which was once a barn, and now is a showcase for her beautiful paintings. Pi buys a few paintings, and after another visit they start sleeping together, and she invites him over to Christmas dinner to meet her gifted son, Phillip, who is a talented pianist and loves playing the music of the masters.It is during these visits to and from Janet’s house that Pi becomes embroiled in a mystery, and he ponders whether his own life is in peril. The more that Janet’s turbulent past becomes the narrative’s central focus, and the greater the number of her lies that are uncovered, the more and more thrilling and suspenseful this beautifully crafted book becomes. Pi’s mysterious Russian beauty, Katerina, meanwhile, lingers in the background, and keeps a reader guessing, wondering what role she’ll ultimately play in Dr. Pi’s fate.Mr. López’s novel reads as gracefully and beautifully as seeing Joe DiMaggio playing centerfield in the old Yankee Stadium. The numerous artistic references made throughout the story are as enchanting and spell binding as the uplifting movements of Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 18, 2022","Jul 23, 2022","Jul 18, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61576281-cooperstown-picasso

Eleanor was the favorite niece of President Theodore Roosevelt, and if one were to ask who she was most like it was, in my opinion, her uncle Teddy. They possessed limitless amounts of energy, fought tirelessly for progressive causes, and believed that since they were lucky to be born rich they owed their country and the less fortunate much more, and they both left behind a written and oral history of their thoughts and ideas that historians are still and forever finding and ing.David Michaelis biography, ""Eleanor,"" is a comprehensive history of this extraordinary woman whose childhood was anything but normal. Her mother died when she was five years old and her father Elliot, who she adored, died from alcoholism at age fifty. She lived with different relatives and her grandma on her mother's side until her late teens. At a very young age, she possessed many of the prejudices of her relatives calling blacks and Jews by repugnant nicknames, but all this would slowly change as she visited the drenches during World War 1 and sat beside wounded soldiers and it would really take off during the husband's long presidency and never let up. Whereas, her husband lacked empathy, she made up for it in a way that even FDR was hopeless to do anything about it.She made it known that the internment of Japanese Americans during World War 2 was unconstitutional and Un-American. That the segregated US army represented everything, we as a nation were fighting against in World War 2. She was appalled by the lack of sympathy showed by her husband's administration and both political parties when it came to the Nazi extermination of the Jews, and our country's unwillingness to take in what amounted to nearly nothing when we could have taken in millions of Jews who died in concentration camps.After her husband's death her crusade for a United Nations that kept countries from going to war was unrelenting if not futile, but that did not stop the Soviet representatives and other countries unfriendly to the US from getting up and applauding this amazing woman's efforts. She fought tirelessly against segregation and the Jim Crow south, for the rights of women and fair wages, and went after Senator Joe McCarthy and his committee on Un-American activities. What I have written here is just a small part of this woman's life that the author Mr. Michaelis' writes about. He writes about the many intimate relationships her husband had with other women, and in turn, her many intimate relationships while married, and after the passing of FDR. He also writes about the strange relationship between her husband's mother, Sara, and Eleanor.It's as though she lived three lives and I can honestly say she drastically help transform America for the better and she is undeniably one of the most important Americans our country has ever produced....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 10, 2022","Aug 03, 2022","Jul 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892435-eleanor

At one point the National league beat the American league like 19 out of 20 games. Statistically, it literally seemed impossible, especially since a pennant winning team who won 100 games, lost 62 games. Throughout most of the 20th century it was said that baseball was a reflection of the country at the time, and in many ways it was, as were many corporations.In 1947 the great Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, and the Dodgers went on to sign a number of outstanding black ballplayers and after awhile the rest of the National league caught on and started signing the likes Willie Mays, Hank Arron, Bob Gibson, Lou Block. Wille McCovery, Curt Floyd, and the list goes on and on. Now, there was no secret how great the potential these ballplayers possessed and the Yankees could have signed Wille Mays but past on him simply because he was black and the Yankee front office was racist, as were most of the many American league teams.Despite cries from the legendary Babe Ruth and Ted Williams that it was a disgrace that more black ballplayers weren't in the majors it seemed to fall on deaf ears in the American league front officers.The Kansas City Monarch's of the Negro league, at certain times, had so many future major league superstars on their team that they could have easily competed against nearly any team in both the American and National league.As I learned more and more about baseball, a sport I truly love, I came to realize that it wasn't such a surprise that the National League won so many All-Star games. They possessed the cream of the crop, the very best in either league, and they were mostly black ballplayers who the American league passed on.David Halberstam, one of my favorite historians, dissects the aging and ailing Yankee team in 1964 and the great black stars the St. Louis Cardinals had on their team...top among them Hall of Framer Bob Gibson and Lou Block.But, he goes much further than just that series and gives us a disturbing look at the history of baseball. A history fulled with a profusion of racism, and corrupt ownership that tried to steal any penny they could from the players.He also gives us a portrait of ballplayers like Bob Gibson, Lou Block, Mickey Mantle, and Whitey Ford that shows their competitiveness, humanity, and a willingness to play severely hurt that would sideline 95 percent of the players of today.

Many were the recruiters who went out and got other blacks involved through out the southern states and Northern Universities, the organizers behind the boycotts, the integration of the schools, the right to vote, fund raising, and who put pressure on Washington D.C. to do something about the 'rights' they were guaranteed and were denied by the white supremacist Senators, Governors, mayors, school boards, and police in the southern states. A few of the names of these tenacious leaders are: Diane Nash, Ella Baker, Septima Clark, Eleanor Roosevelt (who did much more than her husband to desegregate the army, the schools, and fighting for equal rights for all men and all women, black, or white) Dorothy Zellner, Donna Richards, Virginia Durr, and Rosa Parks who was famous for not giving up her seat on the bus but who had been active in the civil rights movement ten years previous and many years after.This is the most important book I have read this year, and what I have written about is a tiny sample of the scope of this book and the civil rights movement, which, in turn, paved the path for the women's movement, the gay movement, etc.In closing, I just want to share a story. I cannot count the amount of people who have complained to me about how sick and tired they are of blacks and women in general always complaining, and they always seem to add and, ""My God, they've already had a black president.""And my replied is always the same, ""Well, they have only been here for 400 years. I wouldn't consider one in 400 very good odds. Whereas, it only took Catholics, who did not come in great numbers until the late 1890's, only 70 years to elect a President.

I would go there about twice a week and marvel at the beauty of the ocean and the sea life, occasionally catching a glance at one of the beautiful young ladies passing by.I would always bring a book, and a copy of that day’s New York Times. The New York Times has been a stable in my life for over fifty years and despite what many of my conservative friends believe: It is not a liberal rag. Yes, its editorials and opinions might lean toward the left but its reporting of the news, and its reporters are simply the best. At least, in my opinion.On this particular day, I was reading an in-depth interview with Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia. When asked about ‘reparations’ for the surviving families of former slaves he replied, “My Italian grandparents came to this country at the beginning of the century. They had nothing to do with slavery. Why should I or my children, or the children of other Italians, Irish, or Jewish families have to pay for a crime they had absolutely nothing to do with.”I was never a very big fan of justice Scalia, especially in his later years, but that quote some forty years later has always remained with me. So, you ask, “what does ‘reparations’ have to do with Mr. Cash’s book. The answer is everything, and nothing at all.“All Will Be Revealed,” is the third in the series, but it is not necessary to go back and read the previous two to understand the narrative. The author nicely intersperses quotes and references from the main character in the previous books into the current book, so the reader is never left in the dark.The book opens with Stardom, a half alien and half human, addressing The United Nations, reporters, and people throughout the world. He has travelled the earth since the very beginning of time and is an emissary to God. He reports back to God on the progress of the human race, and just as God is ready to give up on humans, he convinces him to give him one more chance at straightening out humans and the ‘woke’ culture that has infested so much of the world and especially the United States.Trinity, a young female reporter for a small news outlet, and a ‘woke’ enthusiast is chosen by Stardom for a one-on-one interview. At first, she is shocked to be picked, and then she realizes that this is the opportunity for her to make a name for herself and possibly win a Pulitzer. What she did not realize at the time, was that the interview was going to be unlike any interview she could ever have imagined. Stardom takes her on a physical journey across time. In a sense, it is like Virgil guiding Dante through the different circles of hell. He takes her back, to the frontier days when men and women worked hard, never asking for handouts, and who in the end became the backbone of what would become a great nation. In contrast, in today’s world you have people living on the streets, not working, and asking for handouts…such as welfare and food stamps.He takes her back to times of trauma in her childhood and teen years and how she alienated lifelong friends who she tried to convince to join the ‘woke’ culture and disowned them when they didn’t go along with her.He shows her the concentration camps, in operation this very day, in modern China where the communist are literally killing millions of Uyghur Muslims because of their religious beliefs, and yet the ‘woke’ culture that has taken over in the United States has simply turned a blind eye to it because it is not in their interests. He shows her the twenty thousand illegal aliens crossing the southern border of the United States without being tested for the covid-19 virus or being forced to take the vaccine like millions of Americans, and how critical-race theory is adversely distorting present day America.Stardom transports Trinity to a place outside of earth’s orbit where the Nemensiums live. Creatures so disgusting that they sit on top of their excrement and urine, while they slouch down large quantities of slop brought to them every three hours by slaves…those humans so depraved by the manufactured pandemic that all they did was look at their cell phones and complain 'that anything would be better' than the lives they were currently living. They have forgotten about God, and his teachings, and now their 'anything would be better' is being slaves to these fetid creatures that live in caves while they look at computer screens and the dastardly happenings on planet earth.Mr. Cash has softly trodden the line between dogma and fiction, and his use of extraterrestrials (aliens) actually enhances the bold and controversial positions he shines a bright light on. In a sense, he uses them and the presence of a God as witnesses to the destructive nature of liberalism and the ‘woke’ culture. Unless one is willing to listen to opposing views, one can truly never know the truth about one’s positions. Mr. Cash has boldly stated his views, and whereas those positions might not correspond with my positions they have given me an insight and understanding into positions that a large portion of Americans adhere to. I have read all three books in the series, and each one left me pondering questions about the direction of our country and that was what I have loved so much about the series, and why I strongly recommend his current book and the two previous in the series....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"May 14, 2022","May 19, 2022","May 14, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/61050619-all-will-be-revealed

""Drive Your Plow Over THE BONES OF THE DEAD,"" by Nobel Prize winner Olga Tokarczuk is different to say the least, 'weird,' to quote another er. At times I felt it difficult to continue to read, because I just didn't care. Janina, the main character, is an older lady who lives in a remote Polish village where most of the citizens flee during the winter because it is so unbearable. She is the narrator, and at times I found her the most annoying of all the characters. She is an extreme animal rights' advocate and seems to prefer the company of animals over humans.A number of murders are committed and Janina, with the help of astrology, is certain she knows who is responsible. So the novel turns into a murder mystery. The only problem being that even I figured out who the murderer was early on, and when it comes to murder mysteries I seldom solve the mystery.For me, the most interesting thing about this novel was the quotes from William Blake, and one quote from Dante's 'Inferno.'

In the fog of war, mistakes are made on the battlefield, in the military command structure, and in the governments that pay and sponsor their militaries.Yet, there are certain acts of betrayal that I find unforgivable and President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill committed acts of betrayal against Poland and the Polish military, who fought beside the British and Americans forces, that were not only despicable, traitorous, and cowardly but in Dante's ""Inferno"" would land them in the final circle of hell with Lucifer. In 1939 Poland was attacked by the Nazis and by the Russians. The Germans took control of one half of the country while their friends in arms at the time, the Russians and Stalin, took control of the other half. The U.S. and Britain promised the Polish government support but none showed up. The U.S. still didn't have its act together and Great Britain was trying to hold off the Germans from taking over their country.Shortly, thereafter, the French surrendered to the Germans without so much as a whimper. If you have ever wondered how Paris remained so much intact during the war, it's because the French did not fight back and for all practical purposes handed their country over to the Germans.While the French were doing the 'two step' the frame Polish pilots of ""The Kosciuszko Squadron"" made their way to Britain along with many in the Polish navy and infantry. But it was this Squadron of fighter pilots that would help the British win the the 'Battle of Britain,'... so much so that without them it is very likely the English would have lost the battle and the Germans would have rolled right into Great Britain. The Hit (how many enemy planes you shot down) to Kill (how many of your planes were shot down and flyers killed) was as high as 10 to 1 in favor of the Polish pilots. In short, ""The Kossciusko Squadron,"" was superior to the British and German pilots and one could only imagine how many English lives this Squadron saved.Their expertise continued throughout the war flying alongside the Americans and British. After being frustrated in their attempt to obliterate England, that madman of all madmen, Hitler, decided to attack his buddy Stalin. Hitler would have very likely conquered the Soviet Union if not for President Roosevelt sending him an abundance of arms and deadly weapons which the dictator did not even have the courtesy to thank our President who for unknown reasons seemed to be in awe of the dictator.Throughout the first half of the war, Churchill and Roosevelt promised the Polish government in exile, over and over again, that part of their war plan was to liberate Poland from the Nazis and Soviet forces. Actually, according to President Roosevelt the sole purpose of winning this war was to make sure every country in Europe would be liberated and able to choose their own form of government.The French, who did not give up a fight, were liberated and given a place at the table with the Americans and British. But Poland, was handed over to the Russians, in one of the most underhanded betrayals of an ally in the history warfare. The country, who was arguably the most influential in helping win the war, besides the American and British was tossed to Stalin like a piece in a chess game and for the next forty-five years was under the totalitarian regime of Communist Russia.President Roosevelt, out of ignorance and lack of empathy, went out of his way to appease the butcher of Moscow, and Churchill, the great orator, followed the President's lead and went so far as to have articles printed in the British newspapers that were unfavorable toward the Polish while praising the leadership and sacrifice of Stalin and the Russian people.A remarkable book, in a series of remarkable books I have read, that sheds an ugly light on the so called legends of World War 2....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 30, 2022","May 08, 2022","Apr 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/652024.A_Question_of_Honor

Mr Hamilton, turned to the jury that was made up of Christians and asked, ""Don't you find it ironic that you are judging the guilt and innocence of my client for being Jewish while at the same time you worship your God (Jesus Christ) who was a rabbi and also Jewish? Do you dare judge the innocence of Jesus Christ?"" Mr. Hamilton's client was found not guilty.Secondly, many a year ago at a Christmas Eve party I was sitting at a table with a number of men and women, all devout Christians, quoting this passage and that passage from the Bible, and at the same time expressing their disdain for Jews and how they wished that the school that their darling children attended had not hired a couple of Jewish teachers ""because God only knows what disgusting things they were teaching them."" After listening to this bunch of hypocrites I could not take it anymore and more or less told them the same thing Mr. Hamilton had said. They argued and told me what I said was not true. Yes, he might have been a Jew once but it was he who showed the Jews the errors in their beliefs and tried to convert them. I simply replied, ""He died a Jew, and the Christian religion did not come about for another three centuries after Christ's death."" I then got up and left and went to a seedy bar where I felt more comfortable.Ms. Hoffman's ""The World that We Knew,"" is a tapestry that weaves together similarities between Judaism and Christianity and delinerates between science and the supernatural that creates a world of wonder, love and sacrifice, cruelty and evil.Hanni Koln sacrifices her life for her twelve year old daughter, Lea, and sends her away from her home in Berlin to save her from the Nazi regime. In desperation, Hanni turns to Ettie, the daughter of a rabbi, who has been eavesdropping on her father and learns the secret to creating a rare and unusual golem that she names Ava, who is sworn to protect her daughter, Lea.This takes Lea and Ava on travels through France, to mountain villages, convents, a home of a doctor, a home of family relatives where they are thought to be safe in Paris, until the French puppets of the Nazis' follow their orders and start rounding up all Jews and sending them either to labor camps or concentration camps. Ava, who is a thousand times stronger than any humans, protects Lea but it is on their journey to find safety that they meet fellow Jews also on the run from the Nazis and are simply trying to survive and to fight back against the evil, soulless Germans. Strong relationships form among this group and even though they travel different paths they always seem to be connected through love and caring and the hope to be free from the German menace.Ms. Hoffman has brilliantly crafted a novel, with amazing characters, a myriad of stories and mysteries, that literally leaves the reader glued to the book and the idea that love is never-ending.

My usual response to most of these complaints was simply, ""if you think what you are going through right now is terrible, you should have lived in London during the German blitz of that city during World War 2.""If you have been fortunate enough to read numerous books on World War 2, by reputable historians, as I have, you learn that not one book tells the whole and the true story about many of the key players. It is only now, after reading many books, that I am getting a fuller understanding of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, Prime Minister Churchill, General Eisenhower, Stalin, General George Marshall, etc.At times the ineptitude, lack of knowledge, lack of empathy for fallen soldiers and civilians, the ugly display of egos that cost tens of thousands of lives is astonishing. At other times, the light shines brightest on the real stars of World War 2, the men and women, who most Americans have never heard about.Lynne Olson's, ""Citizens of London,"" shines brightest on the brave citizens of London, who throughout the war lived with the prospect of death at any moment, going homeless, going without food, losing friends and relatives who one second you were talking to and the next second they were dead from explosives from German bombs that ripped them apart. And yet, the citizens of London never thought of surrendering to the Nazi machine and Hitler. They fought on as gallantly as the soldiers on the front lines.The British were the last defense against Hitler before they crossed the ocean and attacked the United States. By 1940, they already had submarines patrolling off the eastern seaboard of America, but for the majority of U.S. citizens they continued to live their lives as though the war was happening on another planet. Winston Churchill, who did not bow before many men, begged President Roosevelt for help but the U.S. Congress did not want to hear about it, and President Roosevelt did not seem to prioritize the situation. The polls showed little support to go to war.Joseph Kennedy, the Ambassador to Britain at the time, quit his post in 1940 and came back to America and declared the British finished. The Blitz was a little too much for him, even though he had moved to the countryside that was much safer. He was replaced by the shy, idealistic, former Governor from New Hampshire, John Gilbert Winant, who by the end of the war was the most admired American in Britain, not only by government officials, the royal family, but with the common hardworking British citizens. Unlike his predecessor, he stayed in London, walked the streets of that battered city, got to know the brave people of London, and fought like hell to get U.S. support pouring into Britain. He is the unknown hero of this story, and whereas Americans might not know who he was, the British people honored him with the highest accolades an individual could receive. He was also called a LONDONER (a citizen of London).Another American called a LONDONER, was the framed U.S. newsman Edward R. Murrow whose broadcasts from London gave Americans their first true understanding and insights into the horrors that the citizens of London were living with every minute of their lives. Fortunately, for all involved, even American politicians and President Roosevelt listened to his broadcasts.Yet, it was not until the bombing of Pearl Harbor that America joined the war against the Japanese, Germans, and to whatever extent the Italians played. Previous to joining the British and the allies, President Roosevelt picked the millionaire businessman Averell Harriman to run the Lend-Lease program set up by the administration that supplied Britain with much needed armament in exchange for British controlled land in different parts of the world. Mr. Harriman was also a citizen of LONDON but whose glamorous lifestyle was not all that affected, possibly enhanced, while living under the Nazi Bombardment.The U.S. military apparatus that was first set up in London, under the supervision of General Eisenhower, was so ill-equipped, ill-informed, and lacking in knowledge and well trained soldiers that the British soldiers, at first, thought of them as their answer to the ""Italians."" Naturally, this would change and if not for American involvement and engineering the Germans would have most likely won the war against the allies. But if not for Churchill's insistence that we start the British and American counteroffensive in Northern Africa and up through Italy it could have been a disaster. General Eisenhower, and the American military and the administration, wanted to immediately end the war by crossing the English channel and liberate France, in essence, start off with the D-Day invasion that would have been a bloody and devastating defeat for the allies.What I have written in this  is only a very small sample of this amazing, informative, and comprehensive book. Ms. Olson explores so many different aspects of the war and its aftermath that it is nearly impossible to pinpoint and highlight all of them.Besides Mr. Winant, she also highlights one other unknown American hero whose contributions and aviation knowledge would change the course of the war, and make the invasion of D-Day a success. Tommy Hitchcock, was recruited by his friend Mr. Winant, who both flew missions during World War 1. After he was turned down, at the age of forty-one, when he volunteered as a fighter pilot it was Mr. Winant who convinced him to come to London as an assistant U.S military attache and would act as a liaison between the U.S. Eighth Air Force and the British RAF's Fighter Command. After witnessing a new hybrid fighter jet with more speed and more nimble than any fighter jet Mr. Hitchcock had ever seen, he and Mr. Winant petitioned the administration to build the planes. They eventually gave in, and the new fighter jets accompanied the big bomber planes over Germany, and instead of 9 out of 10 bombers being shot down by the Germans, the German counteroffensive against the bombers was eliminated and finally the allies were able to hit their targets without being shot down and returning to base. The new hybrid fighter jets changed the course of the war and made the D-Day invasion a major success and bombing missions over Germany almost risk free. Sadly, Mr. Hitchcock died when he took up one of the fighter jets to check out a possible fault in its design and it nose dived and crashed. The fault was simply too much fluid in its tank.Not that it matters, but as of today this is the most important book I have read this year....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Apr 17, 2022","Apr 25, 2022","Apr 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6947702-citizens-of-london

As years progressed, he became very much a dove in the sense that he believed the race for an advantage in nuclear weapons between the Soviet Union and the U.S. was very dangerous and could mean the end of civilization. He also at times believed that the U.S. should stop building such weapons, and that eventually the Soviet Union would not think of us as an adversary and so not fear a first strike by the U.S.Mr. Nitze felt just the opposite, and felt that the U.S. should only negotiate an arms treaty if both sides eliminated nuclear weapons based on their weight, not on their speed and actual damage they could cause. Mr. Nitze was at the negotiation table when the Reagan administration and Mr. Gorbachev signed the first comprehensive treaty on the elimination of many nuclear weapons in Europe and Russia. Mr. Nitze could say that his strong stance, along with many others, eventually caused the collapse of the Soviet Union; and yet it was Mr. Kennan's article ""X"" that predicted the collapse and laid the groundwork for the policy of containment that was a footprint that the U.S used for over fifty years.Both Mr. Nitze and Mr. Kennan were born in the early 1900's and died in the early 2000's.

""Fields of Grace,"" is not a little gem, but a much 'larger, polished GEM.' It is a beautifully crafted book that covers seven decades (two in great depth), an abundance of great characters (enough for three novels), beautifully written and with multiple plots that are completely realized.Grace Fieldergill (shortened to Grace Fielder) is a starry eyed young actress from a small town (Devon) who moves to London to pursue her dream of becoming a star on the London stage. She finds fame fairly quickly as she is hired by John Gielgud's company to be an understudy to the famous actress Peggy Ashcroft who is playing 'Ophelia' in Shakespeare's Hamlet. Ms. Ashcroft misses a performance which gives Grace a chance to shine, and she shines like the brightest of stars, and is lucky enough to have a famous, extremely rich, actress and a well-known producer in the stands watching her performance. Needless to say, her career takes off like a rocket.Ms. Waters' fictionalized versions of Sir John Gielgud, Peggy Ashcroft, Sir Laurence Olivier, David Nivens and a host of other stage and film legends during the thirties and forties in London makes this novel even more delightful, and the author has certainly done her homework on the life and times of these legendary performers, on the impending war in Europe with the rise of Hitler, the war itself and its devastation, the murder of millions Jews, and the sin of being a homosexual in the 1930's and 1940's in Europe and the world.Grace Fielder and that famous producer in the stands during her first real break, John Hopkins-Reimer, who is both a homosexual and half Jewish, fall in love and it is this unusual love affair that becomes the center of the novel and where the many subplots stem from and that the reader becomes fully enthralled and mesmerized in. It is apparent that Ms. Waters is a lady of the theater. I was able to figure that out even before reading her bio. As a former theater major myself, I can tell you that only someone who loves the theater dearly, could right a book that deals with the theater so convincingly.At the end of each year, I make a conscious list of the most important book I read that year, the best novel I read, the best poet (which usually turns out to be Byron) and the most enjoyable novel I read that year. Last year the most enjoyable book I read was Pete Hamill's ""North River."" This year and, I know it is early, the most enjoyable book I have read so far is Ms. Waters' ""Fields Of Grace.""

Bix is a very detailed, and for good measure let me repeat, very detailed, highly informative, at times quite difficult to read, and throughout hints of America's complicity in everything that has gone wrong since the beginning of civilization.The biography on Japan's Emperor Hirohito, who at five feet, two-inches tall and sickly looking, was cultivated like former emperors as a living deity from early in his childhood. Strange, that if you look at quite a few of the war criminals during the 20th century, Stalin, Hitler, and Emperor Hirohito, they were all fairly small in statue...not that that means anything.Hirohito was fortunate enough to have members of his loyal court, military leaders in the army and navy, politicians and the press behind him in ways, that Donald Trump, would be envious of, and if he was able to read one might think he tried to follow his play book.The Japanese atrocities, all approved and sanctioned by the emperor, in China during the 1930's in which the total civilian deaths were as high as five million, the millions of indiscriminate deaths during the war in the the Pacific, especially in the Philippines, and the murder of his own subjects by inciting and training his pilots in the art of the kamikaze attack, and his lack of remorse when the atom bombs were dropped and his only worry being that if he surrendered he might be put on trail as a war criminal. Amazingly, it was emperor's subjects (citizens) who were the blame for the war and the lost of millions of lives, and strangely enough a vast majority of the Japanese population believed they were the blame. Yes, as the quote by Conrad above states, “It’s extraordinary how we go through life with eyes half shut, with dull ears, with dormant thoughts. Perhaps it’s just as well; and it may be that it is this very dullness that makes life to the incalculable majority so supportable and so welcome.”With the help from his loyal subjects, prime ministers, military, and that ever disloyal, disobedient, egoistical General MacArthur, Emperor Hirohito was never put on trail. Yes, he was stripped of all his power, but remained in the ceremonial position of Emperor until his death in 1990... never admitting to his hand in all the military atrocities and his sanctioning of the wars against China and the Allied powers....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 08, 2022","Mar 26, 2022","Mar 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/93959.Hirohito_and_the_Making_of_Modern_Japan

Doudna and told her that he had three sisters at the moment suffering terribly from a genetic disease that would shortly take their lives. He could not understand how anybody who has ever seen someone suffering from such diseases could find anything wrong with the gene editing process that by simply changing a letter in one's DNA to match its opposite letter could put an end to so many dastardly genetic diseases. The answer seems simple, at least to me, who like billions of other people have seen friends and relatives suffer and die from genetic diseases. Imagine a world where we could eliminate so many childhood cancers, cystic fibrosis, blindness, sickle cell anemia, HIV and God knows how many other diseases with a process that has come to be known as ""CRISPR."" CRISPR, a revolutionary technology that Dr. Doudna help create, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in chemistry in 2020, that makes heritable changes in one's DNA that would make a genetic disease like sickle cell anemia never infect a person who was destined to suffer from the agonizing disorder.Well, that technology has arrived and if you don't believe it just look up what the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, that have proven so effective against the covid-19 virus, are made up of and which has cured cases of HIV and sickle cell anemia. What is so amazing, is how simple it really is according to Dr. Doudna and thousands of other scientists and researches.But like the vaccines against Covid-19, there are many critics who say we should not mess around with the evolutionary process or that it's against God's will. I don't agree with them and the only real drawback to this amazing technology is the possibility that humans will use it to make 'better' offspring...more intelligent, muscular, and naturally more beautiful children.Last year, I said the most important book I read was Walter Isaacson's ""The Code Breaker,"" which was mostly about Dr. Doudna, the scientists, and researchers who have help create this technology.

The settings in London and Shanghai in the early to mid 1930's are so realistic that I felt like I had been transported there, and the British colonization of China and the flood of opium into China from British companies is both devastating and deeply unsettling.

The Question: ""Quick, name a woman -- any American woman -- who you think deserves to be memorialized on a on a ten dollar bill?"" Never did you see so many men dumbfounded by a question that had at least fifty possibly correct answers. One answered, Margaret Thatcher, one his daughter Ivanka, a couple their mothers (which was kind of sweet), and then the consensus answer was 'Rosa Parks,' not because they knew who she was but it sounded right. The year was 2016.Since that moment, the few Republicans who have showed any 'balls' during the insane reign of Donald Trump, are three women.... Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Liz Cheney.

The women, Mary Blair, Retta Scott, Grace Huntington, Bianca Majolie and Sylvia Holland. The five women's contributions to Disney Classics, such as 'Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Pinocchio, Fantasia, etc, and the famous Disney ride, 'It's a Wonderful World,' can not be overstated, and many of their paintings and designs are still being used in the Disney Animated blockbusters of the last twenty five years, such as 'Frozen, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.' Sadly, only a few of these women ever got a film credit and it is only in the last twenty years that the brilliance of Mary Blair has become legend.Despite their major contributions, the women made half the money the men made, were abused at story meetings to a point that some ran out crying and some refused to show up for the meetings. They were true trailblazers and many never had the luxury of using computers, which I doubt any would have wanted to use because they were more comfortable with a pencil and pad and thankfully their artistry still lives on.This is a wonderful book on so many levels: It not only explores the massive impact of women on animation, but the evolution of this painstaking art form, and how it almost died out but made a historic recovery....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 06, 2022","Feb 10, 2022","Feb 06, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50497277-the-queens-of-animation

The answer: a group of characters that are so unbelievable, interesting, and original that I never considered putting the book down and couldn't stop reading.I believe, that characters are what drive a story and in the end, as some time has passed, you remember the characters more than the story. I call it the ""Michael Corleone Syndrome.""

The Professor, for example, is a man who wants to cure cancer but since almost all his patients die he decides to embalm them and put them in a seperate room in the house that is like a museum.The plump but pretty sisters, who have thrown tradition to the wind, decide to fulfill their passions by a having threesomes with their cute cousin.

It actually starts off with the election of President Kennedy in 1960 where Mr. Kennedy was put over the top, most probably, by Chicago Mayor Daley by making sure Kennedy won by enough votes to carry Illinois and hand him the presidency. Nixon didn't dispute the election, possibly the only decent thing the man ever did. After the assassination of President Kennedy and the re-election of Lyndon Johnson in 1964 by a landslide, Johnson decided to seriously increase our presence in Vietnam and at one time there were over five hundred thousand U.S. troops in Vietnam and a President who didn't want to hear any bad news about the war and so his advisers fed the man made up facts that made us look like we were on the verge of victory.But the body bags kept accumulating and suddenly the ruse was over. The first politician to come out against the war was Senator Eugene McCarthy and with only the radicals on the left with him he decided to run for president against the current president who was of the same party which was unheard of. He came in second in The New Hampshire primary but performed 30 points higher than anyone imagined and he was actually looked upon as the winner. His momentum continued and his message was simple, ""Stop the War,"" (LBJ, how many Americans have you killed today). After much hesitancy, Robert Kennedy decided to run for president, and Johnson decided to drop out, not wanting to lose to another Kennedy. Kennedy immediately became the favorite and won a number of primaries as his message became closer and closer to Senator McCarthy's message of stopping the blood shed. After winning the California primary, Robert Kennedy was assassinated and until this very day the question remains that if he had not been killed and became president how different the landscape of American politics would have looked?At the Democratic Convention in Chicago, Vice President Humphrey was nominated for the Presidency; even though McCarthy had more primary votes which didn't mean all that much back then when only fourteen states held primaries. The Democratic machine controlled who won and they were not electing Senator McCarthy. In the streets of Chicago there was demonstrations and riots and police brutality that made as much news as the convention itself.Nixon was the Republican candidate and as the polls got closer and they had both candidates within one percentage point, Richard Nixon secretly interfered with the Paris Peace conference going on to stop the war. After all the parties had agreed to a plan to stop the war, Nixon convinced the South Vietnamese President to pull out of the negotiations because if he, Nixon, was elected he would give them a much better deal. That act of treason resulted in an additional five more years of war and an additional twenty-one thousand US deaths and God only knows how many civilian deaths. The consequences of Nixon's actions while in office forced the low-life to resign, and the primaries for both parties, taking place in all fifty states, became the new norm for choosing a presidential candidate. The candidate who achieved the magic number of votes would become the presidential nominee for each party.This book is a million times more detailed than this , but if one thing came across clear and simple and that was how corrupt democracy can be with the right players at the table....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 17, 2022","Jan 23, 2022","Jan 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34346496-playing-with-fire

""The Fifties,"" is the best book I have ever read about an entire decade in 20th century America. It actually starts off in the 1940's and the creation of the Atom Bomb and Robert Oppenheimer. And then after Mr. Oppenheimer expresses concerns about the creation of the hydrogen bomb, which was one hundred thousand times more powerful than the Atom Bomb, being called in to testify before the Senate by that crusader of all that is good and non-communist Senator Joseph McCarthy and in not so many words was accused of being a communist.It moves on to General Douglas MacArthur, a man whose ego had no limits and whose misinformation about the Chinese intentions in Korea cost the needless deaths of thousands of American soldiers. Thankfully, he was finally relieved by President Truman and after his farewell tour through the states was quickly forgotten.The author then moves on to the 'beat generation,' and the impact of Jack Kerouac and the poet Allen Ginsberg, followed by the phenomena of Elvis Presley and black musicians, and Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio.The above things mentioned are just a few of the topics Mr. Halberstam goes into deeply. He doesn't miss a thing, and his storytelling is mesmerizing.

Before picking up Julia Lovell's novel ""The Opium War,"" I knew virtually nothing about the subject and the little I did know was wrong. After finishing the novel I came away with a greater understanding , not only of the Opium Wars (there were two) but the Chinese mentality, the British greed, and the isolation of the Chinese Empire and their emperors.The British introduced the drug to the Chinese, and the Chinese were ready participants. The Opium came from the country (British colony) of India where it was harvested and grew rapidly. The British who had always wanted to open trade with the huge landmass called China, invaded ports along the coast and set up trading stations. In many of these port cities the trade was mutually beneficial to the Chinese and the Queen of England who could never possess enough money or land. But the biggest return came from the sale of opium and just because the Chinese emperor saw the harm it was costing his citizens...making them lazy and completely incompetent...did not deter the British desire to trade the opium with all willing buyers. After the Chinese destroyed millions of dollars of British opium, war broke out. What would follow was like a Woody Allen comedy and I had to remind myself that hundreds of thousands of innocent Chinese citizens, men, women, and children were killed or committed suicide. The Chinese were no match for the British. Yes, The Chinese build forts that housed hundreds of soldiers, and manned cannons atop the forts but the cannons were stationary and the British had no problem destroying the forts as many Chinese soldiers simply fled.At one point, A Chinese official in charge of military operations collected all the female chamber pots, put them on a boat, and send the boat toward a towering ship of war in hope that the smell and magical blood of the females would be enough to ward off the British advances. It didn't work.The first half of this book is a little difficult to get through because of all the names and the insanity, but the second half of the book was a real joy as the author dissects the way future Chinese governments would portray the Opium Wars as a imperialistic drive by western nations to take over the entire country. Mao used it to his advantage and in so doing killed 30 million innocent Chinese men, women, and children. After his death, future communist governments used the Opium Wars as a way to get the citizens to mistrust the Western Nations; even though at the same time they were building relations and trading partners with any western nations that wanted to trade with them.This is a really informative novel and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of China.

Very little infuriates me more than when I hear people call a person like the former, 45th President of the United States, a hero. In fact, he is the definition of a coward. ""A Woman of No Importance,"" is the story Virginia Hall. Despite a prosthetic leg, she helped light the flame of what would be called The French Resistance, which at the very start wasn't much of a resistance on the part of the French people. In fact, The Vichy government that was comprised of French political puppets, used by the Nazis to enforce their idea of a perfect state, had very little problems rounding up suspected French citizens of espionage and putting them in prison, shooting them, or sending them off to German concentration camps.It was the British government, at first and throughout, who dropped spies into occupied France and the free zone of Lyon, who built up groups of resistance to cause havoc against the occupying Nazis, and it was Ms. Hall, an American, working for the British, whose courage, spy craft, organizational skills and the ability to recruit that the Gestapo transmitted was ""the most dangerous of all allied spies. We must find her and destroy her."" Well, they never found her and her every day heroics for over four years helped win the war and was in many ways responsible for the successful Allied invasion at Normandy. The author, Sonia Purnell, has done a masterful job of not only telling the story of this extraordinary and courageous woman, but also in giving the reader a great history lesson of what it was like in occupied France during the war.Sadly, the post French government of Charles de Gaulle, like Stalin, never gave the British and the allies the credit they deserved for liberating their country.

He uses three types of narrative (a stream of consciousness, first person, and dreams) and in my life I have only come across three other authors who have been able to achieve this level of expertise using three different types. Those three authors are Toni Morrison, James Joyce, and Marcel Proust. ""The Unconsoled,"" is a literary achievement of the highest order. If this  appears small compared to the praise I have bestowed on other books, it is simply because I have a habit of ing the greatest novels I have read in either a few words, or a paragraph or two.

Whereas, it might not meet the structural brilliance of his later novels it is a novel well worth reading. In fact, after finishing the novel, I went back and re-read the first three chapters. The book is barely two hundred pages, and I was able to read it in two days which is quick for me.The novel, narrated in first person, is told through the eyes of Etsuko, a Japanese woman from Nagasaki now living alone in England. Her memories of her past life in Nagasaki are triggered by the recent suicide of her daughter. The novel takes place about five years after the end of World War II. American soldiers are being shipped off to fight in Korea. The influence of the American style of life has already taken hold among the younger generation of Japanese men and women and it clashes with the older generations' traditional views, which the younger generation blames for getting them into the war. American democracy is not easy for the older generations to accept.Nagasaki, the victim of the second atomic bomb dropped by the Americans, is quickly rebuilding yet the effects of the bomb are still felt; even though Mr. Ishiguro only allures to the 'bomb,' on a few occasions but the devastation and lost of life caused by the bomb is defined by the actions, physical disabilities, and emotions of almost all the characters in the book, including the children.Like in all of Mr. Ishiguro's novels, the messages he wishes to convey are not boldly displayed.

Mr. Kurtz, a Belgium Colonial director, also has a collection of sword off hands and other body parts.Toward the end of book Mr. Kurtz's final words are ""The Horror, The Horror."" Over the last century and into the 21 century, students and teachers have argued who Conrad based this crazed and insane character on. Some have argued, Rudyard Kipling, Marlon Brandon (Who played the character of Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now."" The worst interpretation of Conrad's masterpiece ever presented, but a great movie all the same), and some Winston Churchill. Adam Hochschild's ""King Leopold's Ghost,"" gives us three real possibilities. You see, Conrad's book which is fiction is based on the six months he spent in the Congo under the murderous leadership of King Leopold of Belgium. Leon Rom, a Belgium director who met Conrad while he visited the Congo is my choice of who Kurtz represents. To his credit he had the sunken heads of Africans atop the post to the gate surrounding his mansion and a wonderful collection of dismembered body parts.I mention Conrad's book so much because Mr Hochschild references the book and Conrad numerous times. ""King Leopold's Ghost,"" is about the brutal and inhumane plundering of the Congo by the King and his hired men. The torture of the native population could easily make one nausea. It is estimated that at least 12 million native Africans died during the reign of King Leopold. And even after his death, it continued to a lesser degree but it nevertheless continued. And while this genocide was going on the English and Portuguese governments were plundering and murdering the natives in different parts of the rich mineral continent. One needs to remember that these atrocious were allowed to go on right into the early parts of the 20th century, and in some cases into the middle of the century, and till this day a good part of Africa is at war with itself, sponsored by America, Europeans, and Asians.This is a really good book, extremely informative, with many villains and some amazing heroes.

In fact, I will go so far as to say it is a MASTERPIECE.A former professor of mine, Pulitzer Prize winning poet Louis Simpson was fond of saying, ""That Hemingway is a thinking man's writer. If you simply read his words and don't think beyond that, you will never appreciate the true greatness of Hemingway.""

It is barely two hundred pages, the writing is clear and simple, and the questions it poses are many and intellectually challenging such as, ""When is blind duty to one's job morally wrong? Are wars, such as World War II, often decided by a few powerful men and should they be held accountable for the terrible consequences of such wars?

The threat to democracies that have been simmering in the U.S., Hungry, and Poland are today's issues. Strangely, the threat to democracy in Spain is where this book starts in 1937 when Franco seized power with the help of the Germans and Italians, and the number of people killed, tortured, placed in concentration camps, and were forced to migrate were in the hundreds of thousands if not the millions.The two main characters, Roser and Victor, were lucky to be able to migrate to Chile. At first, they weren't so welcome, but over time they proved to be great additions like so many immigrants. Victor became a celebrated Surgeon, and Roser a celebrated musician. Yet in 1973, with the take over of the democratically elected government in Chile by General Pinochet and the army, with help from the Nixon administration, Victor and Roser are once again forced to migrate to Venezuela for nine years before being able to return home to the country they believe to be home which is Chile.This book is great on so many levels, it is a difficult story told effortlessly, the characters are unforgettable, the narrative neat, and the overriding theme of belonging and not giving up hope runs throughout.

It is not about baseball, or not really, but about her coverage of the 1988 presidential campaign between President George H.W. Bush and Governor Michael Dukakis. Ms. Didion has an eye for the 'unobservable' that almost everyone else seems to miss, and when she points it out you say, ""Holy Cow! How did I miss that?"" In the 1988 campaign she points out the absurdity of the whole process, the misconnect between the candidates and the voters, and how everything is so scripted that it's like a movie... right down to Mr. Dukakis playing catch with a staffer in 110 degree weather while waiting for their plane to take off. On a personal note I would like to unveil my idea of how we should choose a president. In a nation wide vote the top ten candidates should be relocated to an old style Western town, possibly on the Warner Bros. ranch where they used to shoot westerns. Each candidate should be given a rifle, a pistol, and enough ammunition to easily wipe out all the other candidates.The candidates should then be all separated, and the object of the game is to kill as many of his/her rivals as you can and be the last one standing...the only one left alive. The last surviving candidate should then take the presidential oath of office and immediately become president. (I having come up for a plan for the Vice President yet but I am working on it). By doing it this way, the American people can at least say, for once, that the president of the US wanted the job so badly he/she was willing to die for it. That's a lot more than we can say for the last president.I Highly recommend this essay....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 11, 2021","Sep 13, 2021","Sep 11, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/31924958-insider-baseball

The choice they made to put themselves in the middle of such a dangerous and humanitarian mission is heroic.Secondly, Even though the characters in this book often talk about how much better it would be to see and talk to each other together in a house or room, the fact that they wrote so many letters gives us one of the truest accounts of the two most prominent heroes in this amazing account of heroism and humanity.""At The Heart of the WHITE ROSE: Letters and Diaries of Hans and Sophie Scholl,"" is an intimate portrayal of two young Germans (Hans on his way to being a doctor) and (Sophie studying philosophy and art at the University in hope of becoming a teacher). They were raised in a loving German family with three other sisters and brothers. Politics nor class were not the reasons for their dissent. Their dissent is the product of a childhood and youth that were deeply rooted in the humane with religious manifestations.In both their letters to friends and family there is almost always mention of the beauty of nature. Sophie dreams of becoming part of a Birch tree and Hans talks about the beauty of the Russian landscape when he is fulfilling his military service at the front as a doctor. They marble at God's creation, and how each spring it brings forth new life. They love people, and don't discriminate against any one race. Hans talks about the friendliness of the Russian peasants and how they shared food and drinks and sang together.The 'White Rose Organization' put out pamphlets and bulletins describing the Nazi atrocious against Jews, against Germans, against humanity in every country they invaded. They did not blow up buildings or assassinate political or military leaders. For this terrible crime of uncovering the truth with words, Hans and Sophie Scholl and their friend Christoph Probst were sent to the guillotine a few days after they were arrested for distributing handbills at Munich university. Many of the remaining members of ""The White Rose Organization,"" were eventually arrested and put to death.Thomas Mann, Nobel Laureate remarked:“Good, splendid young people! You shall not have died in vain; you shall not be forgotten. The Nazis have raised monuments to indecent rowdies and common killers in Germany—but the German revolution, the real revolution, will tear them down and in their place will memorialize these people, who, at the time when Germany and Europe were still enveloped in the dark of night, knew and publicly declared: ‘A new faith in freedom and honor is dawning.”Thomas Mann, Nobel Laureate (Broadcasting from exile to Germany on the radio series “German Listeners”On a personal note: For most of my life I have refused to visit three countries, Germany, Japan, and Italy. Their atrocious against humanity, especially the Germans and Japanese, I cannot find it in my heart to ever forgive them. Despite, what one might read, only a small pocket...a tiny pocket...of Germans resisted the Nazis and Hitler. In fact, Sophie and Hans Scholl were arrested because a janitor who supported the Nazis went to the Gestapo and informed on them.HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Sep 03, 2021","Sep 10, 2021","Sep 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/270285.At_the_Heart_of_the_White_Rose

It goes into great detail how in countries like India, China and the Arab world women are looked down upon. In China and India baby girls are often killed, and how in the Arab world women are forced to cover up their bodies so the men won't be tempted.In countries like the wonderful U.S.A. where for the longest time politicians were almost all men, and in so being, made laws about contraceptives and abortion without any input from women. In fact, for the longest time women were blamed for being raped; and to think of it men are still passing laws that effect women's bodies such as in Texas and a number of other states. Male politicians, unelected Supreme Court Justices, and the Catholic and Protestant churches are trying as hard as ever to take the choices women make with their bodies out of their hands.

Ms. Grealy, who has had over thirty surgeries to reconstruct her face and mouth, and to look totally normal is obsessed with men finding her attractive, and despite a number of boyfriends, and numerous sexual encounters she never in her mind achieves the attractiveness that will allow her to walk into a room and not be looked at as the one with the deformity. Ms. Patchett is there for her friend every step of the way, through all the surgeries, insults, and addiction to drugs, as are a number of her other friends. But it is the friendship between the two authors that is at the very center of this heart wrenching, beautiful, and up close depiction of society's obsession with beauty.

Collecting the best of Gellhorn’s pieces on foreign conflicts and now with a new introduction by Lauren Elkin, The Face of War is what the New York Times called “a brilliant anti-war book” and has become a classic.""Bull Buford, Granta, writes ""HOW is it possible to have been so ignorant for so long of a writer who has written so passionately about the terror or war?""The first paragraph is taken from the short biography of the book on the book's website. The second  asks a question I have been asking myself since I started reading Ms. Gellhorn's works.""The Face Of War,"" is undeniably one of the best books I have read on the terror of war, the frightful propaganda machine behind wars, and the untold victims of war: The civilians, women, and children, and especially the poorest people in the countries where the combatants are fighting.Ms. Gellhorn's book, a collection of articles from more than eleven countries where she covered wars, is unlike any book on war I have read because while covering wars in so many countries she gives us a profile of how differently the citizens of those countries responded to the war that was tearing their lives apart. The citizens of Madrid went about their business of surviving the daily bombing of their city during the Spanish Civil War as an inconvenience, removing the dead, and then going to work so they could buy food and take care of their children.The Polish immediately set-up an underground to combat the Germans, while at the same time pretending to be their friends, farming the land the Germans confiscated from them, and handing over the food to the lazy, crazed Generals in charge.During the 'Six Day War' where the Arab countries invaded Israel, and the Arabs were spreading propaganda among their soldiers that one had to kill all Jews even if they gave up because they were all evil. After six days of war, despite the Arabs' superiority in soldiers {as large as 4 to 1} and with the best of Soviet equipment, the Israelis gave them a lesson in conducting a war that they are still living with the consequences to this very day. After the war was won, the Israelis soldiers stopped sending back Egyptian prisoners of war across the Suez canal because the Egyptian Generals were greeting their POWs with a bullet to the head. The Israelis could not believe such barbaric behavior and had to call in the Red Cross to finish the evacuations. And as Ms. Gellhorn is quick to point out it was not the average citizens going about the business of living and taking care of their children that started wars, but individual egomaniacs such as Hitler, or Arab Kings, or lying US Presidents such as Johnson and Nixon and Reagan, who started and continued wars with propaganda machinery that tricked the citizens of many countries to the very end. In one piece she talks about a young German waiter in Berlin after the war. A nice, pleasant young man who tried to convince her and her friends that Hitler was not at all bad. After all he said, ""Didn't you Americans also have at your disposal French culinary delights and Italian pastries?""...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Aug 20, 2021","Aug 28, 2021","Aug 20, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39218052-the-face-of-war

All and All, I have read seven of her books and the one thing they all have in common is fantastic characters, wonderful stories, and superb writing.One of the main features of Leonardo DA Vinci's paintings, a feature that sets him apart from almost all other painters and sculptors, is that there is nothing in a DA Vinci painting, whether it be a sleeping dog, a baby in a crib, the grass beneath a character's feet, or the blue of the sky above that is not alive and in motion. There is nothing stationary, everything has life and as you look at his works it is hard not to say to yourself what is that dog going to do next, or is the sky slowly going to turn grey.That is one of the great characterizations of Ms. Patchett's works. In ""Taft,"" a girl who walks into a bar, shy and with her head down, with skin so light that it is almost transparent, and who could probably be 10 or possibly 18 years old and seems completely harmless, but with the passage of a little time you are suddenly expecting her to do something crazy and when she doesn't you breath a sigh of relief. Ms. Patchett's characters, like a Da Vinci subject, is full of possibilities, despite appearances. I have often called her characters energized as though they are on steroids, and that is as true in ""Taft,"" as in all her novels that I have read.""Taft"" is a study of fatherhood with two parallel stories, one in first character narrative and the other in third person narrative, that brings to light the importance of fathers in the life of their children, whether they be boys or girls.It is just another example of the extraordinary talent that Ms. Patchett possesses, whether her novel is taken place in a bar in Memphis like in ""Taft"" or a home run by nuns for unwed mothers in Kentucky.

I talked to my parents, when telephone rates were high when calling long distance at least once a week if not twice. When the rates dropped, I might talk to them and my brothers 4 or 5 times a week. I made at least two trips home every year and sometimes as many as 5 or six. Some of my friends visited their parents maybe once every 4 or five years, but they always told me how much they loved them. Most of these friends I am talking about had parents who were divorced, some a few times over, and they all had stepbrothers and stepsisters.""Commonwealth,"" is about this dysfunction, and the effect it has on children and parents when they get older.

The publishers were constantly running into articles about refugees, and Ms. Gellhorn's book was about the refugees who had to flee from the part of Czechoslovak they lived, which Hitler had annexed under the Big LIE that the Germans in the Sudetenland had been mistreated by the Jews, Communist, and socialist.The refugees moved into Czechoslovak, into the the city of Prague, and were given very little time to find another country to live in or be send back to the Sudetenland where they would almost certainly be killed. Czechoslovak, for all practically purposes was ruled by the Gestapo, and the Czech. government followed the orders from the Gestapo. It is under these circumstances that Mary Douglas, an American journalist with a conscience, tried to help these refugees get visas and passports and find another country for them to live in not under the control of the Germans, not a very easy task considering that Britain and France by this time sold their souls to the Germans in the hope of avoiding war.This is a tragic novel and it is just another reminder of the brutality of the Germans, killing women and children, for absolutely no reason except that they were Jewish, Communist, or Socialist, and how the world's democracies turned their backs on these atrocious so as to appease Hitler and at a time they could of beat the Germans and possibly have stopped the slaughter tens of millions soldiers, civilians, the disabled and the elderly.Ms. Gellhorn is probably the most famous female war correspondent of the 20th century, a great writer, and a person who could easily decipher the good guys from the bad, especially since that line wasn't so visible, until the war became a world war.

She can't let go, and then it occurs to her that she knows very little of Parsiafal's younger life... just tiny bits and pieces that she quickly finds out do not add up.His so called family that he told her all died in a car accident, are mostly alive and living in Nebraska. His mother and younger sister come to visit Los Angeles when they find out he has passed away and he has left them a sizable chunk of money. Sabine meets them, and gets along so well with them that she visits them in Nebraska and it is here that she discovers the tragic history of her husband's youth, as told by his mother, younger sister, and his twin sister Kitty. Parsiafal is once again in her life through his mother and sisters and her love for him only grows, and the family's love for him has always been there, even though they have never seen him since he left at eighteen.

(Byron is my favorite poet of all times, and Yeats is my favorite poet of the 20th. century)Mr. Hamill’s novel is nevertheless the most enjoyable novel I have read this year. “The Code Breaker” was the most important book I have read this year, followed by at least four David Halberstam’s books. Mr. Hamill, in my opinion, knows more about the entire city of New York than any other writer I have read, Including James Baldwin, Capote, and Dos Passos.At the very heart of “North River,” is a love story between an Irish American doctor, and a veteran of World War 1, and an Sicilian immigrant. It is also a love story about a grandpa and his grandson, a love story about a doctor and his love for the neighborhood he lives and practices in and the ethnic diversity of the city.The ‘North River,’ is actually a part of the Hudson River and across from this part of the river is where General George Washington and his army had to cross to escape to New Jersey before the British wiped them out. I have no doubt, that President Washington would have loved this book because it is about the unselfish nature of Americans from all over the world, and the love for humanity and equal rights that he and his army fought so gallantly for to give to all Americans. His dream is still not fully realized but hopefully we are getting there.

I knew of the genocide, but not in great detail. I wish I could say that the horrifying images that the author brilliantly described made me want to vomit but they didn’t.And why not one might ask, and the answer is because I have read and talked to survivors of genocides for a good part of my adult life. Genocides are nothing new, especially in the last 150 years. Sadly, they are occurring as I write this short … they are truly a testament to man’s inhumanity toward vast majorities of innocent men, women, and children. There was Stalin (estimated 20 million killed), Hitler (estimated 20 plus million killed, including the war), Mao, the Khmer Rouge, Assad, The Turks, etc.What makes “The Sandcastle Girls,” such a great book is the heroic characters and the lucid, vivid writing. What makes it an important book is that most people have never heard of the Armenian Genocide and because of that it is a story that needs to be told before it is “denied” and it is a tragic historical event whose significance and aftermath is still being felt to this very day by Armenian people throughout the world.A big thank you to Maureen, a Goodreads' friend, who recommended this book....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jun 20, 2021","Jun 25, 2021","Jun 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13330603-the-sandcastle-girls

The title of theJust before I started reading this novel by Mr. Cash, I had just finished reading an interview by Maureen Dowd of The New York Times. The title of the article was, ""Ex-Commish with the Dish,"" a reference to the person she was interviewing, former New York and Los Angeles Police Commissioner, Bill Bratton. Mr. Bratton is the commissioner who is credited with cleaning up New York City in the early to mid-nineties when the city saw a huge decrease in crime and murder and became one of the safest cities in the United States. Years later, to a similar degree, he performed a lesser miracle with the city of Los Angeles.In my opinion, Mr. Bratton's theory of policing is the best theory since Teddy Roosevelt used a similar theory when he was police commissioner in New York in the late 1890's. In short, the police have to work with and understand the people they are trying to protect. And what better way to have the people you are trying to protect have faith in you, than having officers patrol neighborhoods they were brought up in. If you have a large presence of Latino police officers in largely Latino neighborhoods, the same with black neighborhoods, Albanian neighborhoods, and Irish neighborhoods the police officers, who grew up in these areas, naturally understand the culture, and the citizens are more likely to trust them and to help themThat theory, as Mr. Bratton noted in the interview, was set back probably thirty years by the murder of George Floyd by the now convicted felony Derek Chauvin, and the protests that followed, and the idea of defunding the police and the constant coverage of police brutality by the news media. The police, those who put their lives on the line every time they go to work, are now the enemy... Despite the fact that ninety-ninety percent of all police officers do a wonderful job.The interview by Ms. Dowd, could easily have been the prologue to Mr. Cash's, ""What Is To Come."" A book that is wildly entertaining, well written, and a work of searing political satire.Mr. Cash, Oliver, is the main character in this book and we meet him after just a couple of pages as a group rioters dislodge from a bus, walk through a quiet Vermont neighborhood, and to the house of Oliver Cash. Mr. Cash, a conservative writer who is famous for writing his fictional, conservative novel '2025,' is their target. First they burn down his house, and then they burn him alive, all in the pursuit of a better America, a more liberal country.Six months later, Oliver, who has been in an induced coma, wakes up in a hospital bed, in terrible pain, with his wife and two children in the room with him. By this time, the United States has succeeded and become two countries. The liberal country where Oliver is now stuck in, and the conservative country that looks more or less like the old USA.Quickly, he is told by his family that he is no longer allowed to call his wife, Mary, wife anymore, but Mary, and his children no longer son and daughter, but by their names. Both children, who constantly have their faces in their phones, are perfectly okay with this, whereas Mary is still skeptical.The liberal region that Oliver now resides in has big plans for him, first rehabilitating his burned body with numerous surgeries, and then transforming and re-adjusting his brain to become a great liberal novelist. Oliver, still as conservative as always, goes along with their plan. In truth, he has no choice and pretends to be a liberal. After finally leaving the hospital, and under close supervision he writes his first liberal novel for the region and it becomes a huge hit. It's like overnight, this once nothing writer, is famous and suddenly they move him and his family into a mansion to live, overlooking the Pacific ocean. He writes like five other novels, each a bigger hit than the last, and suddenly he finds himself living the life of a ""One Percenter."" He is the toast of the Liberal Country, and despite losing his wife to his female supervisor, and never seeing his children, his life is grand. In fact, there is little difference between the conservative USA and the Liberal country where he is as big as Stephen King. The politicians live in gated communities, away from all the homeless people, and celebrities like Oliver have everything at their disposal... Minus a wife, children, religion, and literary freedom to write what you really want to write. If you are a person with an open mind, this novel is for you. If you are looking for comedy, this novel is for you. If you are a political junkie, you're going to either love or hate it, but it will be very difficult to put down.

Few have written more accurately and passionately about the city.Yet, it is the first hundred pages or so of this novel that I found the most spellbinding and they take place in Northern Ireland during the middle of the 1700’s when the British have literally conquered this part of the country and have made the practice of all religions, besides the Protestant religion, unlawful. Only the Protestants can own land, find work, and truly live in freedom.Cormac O’Connor, the hero of this novel, sees his mother run over and killed by the Earl of Warren and later witnesses the murder of his father by one of the Earl’s men. His father practices the religion of “Irish,” that is deep in folklore and mysticism. Cormac, at the age of sixteen, is given the task of revenging his father’s death by not only killing the Earl but killing the last of his line. This takes him to New York City, where he is granted immortality as long as he never leaves the island of Manhattan. He plays a role in the Revolutionary War when General Washington invades the city at the very beginning of the war. He lives through the great fire of 1835 that destroyed most of Manhattan, he hangs out with Boss Bill Tweed, and is a witness to the bombing of the World Trade Center. Throughout this time, he keeps track of all the Earl’s descendents who travel to the city and take up residence. He is still bound by the oath of revenge, and cannot pass into the ‘Otherworld,’ where his mother, father, friends, and relatives now reside after dying unless he continues to revenge his father’s murder to the end of his time.Mr. Hamill’s novel is as much about the history of the city, as it is about the oath of revenge. It is the people he befriends and the lovers he takes that give this novel a flavor as rich as the city itself.

He was in his late sixties, maybe early Back in the early 1990’s a gentleman, in a suit and tie, walked into the Palm Restaurant on a Saturday night. He was in his late sixties, maybe early seventies, and he was the first customer in the restaurant that night. He sat at one of my tables, and was waiting on two more guests. He ordered a drink, and after bringing it to him, he asked me where I was from? I told him that I was from the Bronx, but that my father was from Lawrence, Massachuetts.He knew quite a bit about both places and he went on to tell me that as a political advisor, he had been in every state, and just about every city and town. I asked him who he worked for, and he answered Senator Robert Kennedy. He was his top advisor in the 1968 presidential campaign that ended with the tragic assassination of Mr. Kennedy.He went on to tell me that whatever anyone thought about President John Kennedy was one thing, and as for Senator Ted Kennedy he simply waved his hand and remarked, “That’s another thing all together.”He paused, as he looked out the window onto Santa Monica Blvd and then turned back to me with tears in his eyes and said, “But Robert Kennedy was the ‘best man’ I have ever known, and if anyone you know talks bad about him they didn’t really know the man.”Over the years, I have told that story to only a few people, usually only people who I know really liked Mr. Kennedy like my lovely wife.Mr. Halberstam’s book about the 1968 campaign, verifies all that the gentleman told me that night and Mr. Halberstam, in my opinion, is one of the great historians of our time. He gives you the facts, and does not sugar coat any of them.Robert Kennedy was a unique politician, and sadly there have been few, if any, like him since the time of his death. He evolved as a fairly conservative, anti-communist politician and trouble shooter for his brother the President, into a moral, intelligent, and compassionate human being the likes of which so few politicians in the history of this country have ever witnessed.He knew the world like few politicians ever had, travelled and talked to the downtrodden in the ghettos, the less educated in the distant mountain towns in many of our states, and helped the farmers and Mexicans at a time when it was not popular. He came out against the war in Vietnam, against his own party’s platform, and to the disgust of President Lyndon Johnson.He championed the causes of black Americans when his advisors told him it wasn’t a wise thing to do, and besides they didn’t vote anyway. Yet, in 1968 Blacks and Mexican Americans showed up at the polls in record numbers to cast their vote for the only candidate who truly saw and understood their suffering, talked to them, and made promises they knew he would keep.Like so many Americans, I have always wondered what the world would have been like if Robert Kennedy had lived, got his party’s nomination, and defeated one of the most corrupt, morally bankrupt human beings of all times. It certainly would have been much better, and the future of this country some forty years later I have no doubt a kinder, less bitter, place to live than it is now....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"May 16, 2021","May 20, 2021","May 16, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/391676.The_Unfinished_Odyssey_of_Robert_Kennedy

Basketball will always remain the sport I loved playing the most, playing it fifteen hours a day with my friends when we were young, but baseball has always been the sport I loved watching and listening to on the radio, and especially following the box scores. Growing up in the Bronx, I was originally a Red Sox fan, which stemmed from the fact that my father was from Boston and a Red Sox fan. The Mets were my favorite National League team, and as I got older I eventually went with my 'roots' and became a Yankee fan.I have read numerous books on baseball, and I actually wrote one that I was very proud of, even if no one else was. The three baseball books that stand out to me are 1) Field of Dreams (Shoeless Joe), 2) The Natural (I thought the movie sucked) and 3) The Summer of 49 by David Halberstam.And Now, another David Halberstam book, ""The Teammates,"" tops my list as the best baseball book I have ever read. It left me crying at the end. It is a profoundly human story, about four teammates... The great Ted Williams, Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky and Bobby Doerr... Who played together on the great Red Sox teams of the 40's and remained close friends for over sixty years. Williams and Doerr are in the Hall of Fame, and it is a mystery why DiMaggio and Pesky are not. But, as duly noted, Joe DiMaggio was the better player, but his brother Dominic (who was a hell of a player) was one of the best human beings one could ever hope to meet. The story starts out with Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky and a friend, David Flavin, driving down to Florida to see their dying friend Ted Williams. Bobby Doerr is unable to come because he is in Oregon tending to his wife of over sixty years who has suffered a second stroke. During the entire three day trip the radio is never turned on and Dominic and Johnny recall plays, at bats, a certain pitcher from sixty years ago as though it was yesterday. They relive the devastating defeat to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 46 World Series on a bloop base hit in game seven that would have been caught had DiMaggio not got injured the inning before and his replacement was an incompetent center fielder who misplayed the ball. And they recall, the crushing defeat to the Yankees in '49' on the last game of the season that would have sent them to the World Series.But what makes this book so great is what took place off the baseball field and a friendship that lasted over sixty years between the four men. Williams' generosity, and his love to preach and debate, and always looking out for his friends and the fishing trips. The way they were always at the bedside if one of them was sick or injured, and they were always in contact when one of their wives or children fell ill. Williams, who never missed a charity event that Dominic's wife Emily was sponsoring, and she sponsored quite a few.

Ann Patchett's, ""The Patron Saint of Liars,"" is beautifully written, superbly crafted and structured, with a cast of unforgettable characters.The Novel, written in first person narrative, is told by three individuals, Rose, the mother, Wilson Abbort, the father, and Cecilia, the daughter. It takes place in Habit, Kentucky at Saint Elizabeth's Home for unwed mothers. It is run by Catholic nuns, and the Home was originally a very fancy hotel who the owner left to the Catholic Church.The story mostly takes place in the 1960's and 70's when abortions weren't so commonplace, so young ladies who did not want to keep their babies went to Homes like the one in this book where they stayed, free of charge, during their entire pregnancy and once they had given birth at a nearby hospital they were very seldom seen again, and their babies were handed over to families that were looking to adopt a baby.Rose was one of these girls, but she decided in the end that she wanted to keep her baby, and marries the caretaker of the Home, Wilson Abbort...also known as Son. Rose works in the kitchen, with the lovable Sister Evangeline. Over the next fifteen years she becomes an expert cook, never taken a penny from the nuns.This is a story that explores so many human emotions, from the beginning of pregnancies to the time the mothers give birth.

Ricks, ""Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq,"" the song, ""How Do You Sleep,"" by the late John Lennon kept playing in my head.And Why Do You Ask? Because despite the warnings from military experts, historians, UN Inspectors, and former military officials against going to war with Iraq, our high level government officials disregarded such warnings and our Congress refused to dig deeper into the issues for fear of appearing weak.Yes, there was plenty of evidence that Saddam Hussein had 'NO' weapons of mass destruction, nor did he have anything to do with the 9/11 attacks and that going into Iraq could be quite costly, deadly, and never ending yet we went anyway.The hawks, President George W. Bush (spend the Vietnam war protecting the coastline of the United States) Vice President Dick Cheney (I had more important issues than Vietnam) Sec. of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (spend his time in the military as a flight instructor) and Under Sec. of Defense Paul Wolfowitz (was too busy in the world of academia to spend any time in the jungles of Vietnam) assured us it would be a piece of cake and we would be welcomed as liberators.Yes, these four armchair generals knew how easy it would be to just invade Iraq (on the cheap nevertheless, with insufficient manpower, and no plan after toppling Saddam, and a disregard for the culture of the land and the many different religious sects).So I ask, once again, how do you Motherfuckers sleep at night knowing that everything you told the American Public was a lie, that the cost of the invasion at last count would be close to a half trillion dollars or more, and the cost in human lives (American soldiers, reporters, and innocent Iraqi civilians) would total in the tens of thousands and still rising and after nearly 20 years we are still there.Mr. Ricks' novel is a rich, comprehensive, illuminating, instructive, and sad story about the war in Iraq.

Yet, it was the hardworking, tireless reporting of the Washington Post that made it all possible.This is the book that is referenced when students of the media are writing essays on the evolution of TV and the importance of print media and the steadfast desire of reporters to inform and enlighten the American public about issues that expose the depths of corruption in our government.This book is a masterpiece!!!!!!!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 07, 2021","Mar 31, 2021","Mar 07, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/75414.The_Powers_That_Be

""War In A Time Of Peace,"" deals primarily with the Clinton Administration's responseSimply stated, another great book from the late David Halberstam. ""War In A Time Of Peace,"" deals primarily with the Clinton Administration's response to the wars in the Balkans (the old Yugoslavia) and the genocide committed by the Serb and the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic against the Muslim population in Bosnia and then the Albanian Muslim population in Kosovo.Candidate Clinton ran his campaign against President Bush in 1992 on the premise that the President was more interested in foreign affairs than domestic, and it worked and he won the election and the phase, ""It's the economy, stupid,"" was made famous.Once President Clinton took office, he was literally obsessed with domestic policies, and his Intelligence and military advisors were lucky to get in to see him. The polls told him that the American people were interested in domestic affairs, and not fighting foreign wars. But, as many politicians and historians would tell him, eventually foreign affairs will intrude and take up sixty percent of your time.After nearly three years into his first term, and millions of Muslims killed in Bosnia his disinterest in foreign affairs came back to haunt him, as reporters started telling the stories, with horrifying pictures and videos of the slaughter. With American military power and the advanced technological accuracy of our airforce we brought the Serbs to the bargaining table and the Dayton Accords were signed and to some extent ended the genocide in Bosnia.But Milosevic was not finished, and after a couple of more years passed, he went after the prize he always wanted and that was Kosova, and just like that nearly a million Albanians were displaced and hundreds of thousands killed. Once again, The Clinton Administration was caught off guard and once again didn't want to get involved in this new blood bath. After much back and forth between NATO and the US, the Americans finally put together a bombing campaign with unbelievable accuracy that brought the Serbs, once again, to their knees.This book is so much more than just about the Balkans. It shows that nearly thirty years after Vietnam the Joint Chiefs and the president, and much of his staff, feared getting involved in this humanitarian crisis in the heart of Europe because of the fear of another Vietnam. Mr. Halberstam, as brilliant as any historian I have ever read, is able to go back and forth in such situations and analyze both the military and political side of military operations.

It more or less covers the period from 1981 to 2000, with a heavy emphasis on 1988 to 2000. There are roughly ten essays, the reason I can't give a correct figure is because so many of the essays have what you would call separate chapters. Out of the ten essays, there are five that are nothing short of outstanding, insightful, and riveting... So much so that the other five are somewhat of a disappointment.The one about President Ronald Reagan and his years in the White House is fascinating and funny. Mr. Reagan, in a sense, went from a motion picture actor and TV star, to literally playing the part of the President of the United States. In the evening he would receive a schedule of the things he had to do the next day, and as he went down the list he crossed out each one he had just finished, and when everything on the list was completed that was more or less the end of his work day. He performed the duties of the President no different than if he was following a script for a movie and what was expected of him that day... What shots he would be in, exchange of dialogue, following the directions of the camera person and director. In contrast to the one on Reagan, the one on the Central American debacle was nothing short of a moral and humanitarian disgrace. The Reagan administration at the time was trying to get more money from the Congress to support the army and government in El Salvador which was under attack from leftist communists. What would become known as ""The Massacre of El Mazote,"" where the Salvadoran army went into a Peasant village and killed between 750 and 900 innocent civilians, more than half women and children and babies, many burned to death and buried beneath a church. The optics and coverage of such a massacre would have killed any aid to the Salvadoran government. The administration, along with advisors from the American embassy, never verifiedThe massacre, and reporters could not get close to the scene, so it wasn't until six years later the true story came out, not the one put out at the time, that if it did happen it was the communists dressed in army outfits that committed the murders.It was essays like the two above, and three others that make this book of essays so worth the read.

Iago is the Shakespeare character in ""Othello,"" who is obsessed with power and control.The line is spoken by, Maria, the main character in the book, and she is one of the best female characters, in my opinion, that I have ever read in any book. Many scholars and readers will vehemently disagree, which is their right. Some will find her empty, pathetic, and mentally unstable, I on the other hand find her the embodiment of what we consider feminism. She is totally in tune with her body and during a back alley abortion, the book takes place in the sixties and was published in 1970, you feel the pain, both emotionally and physically, that such a procedure has on her and after a number of days after the abortion the bleeding gets worse and then on a pad she is wearing she notices, when she takes it off, that there appears to be a substance that looks like flesh. When it is examined by a doctor it turns out to be the placenta that was not removed during the abortion. In her dreams, and during waking hours, she sees a bloody baby being flushed down the toilet.She is obsessed with her menstrual period every month and she sleeps on a bed with totally white sheets and no protected pads, and dresses in light clothes, hoping to notice blood and relieving her fear of being pregnant. She is married to a Hollywood director, and she herself is a fairly famous actress. She lets herself go, losing so much weight that she barely clocks in at eighty pounds, her veins show, and her girlfriends become concerned about her as they complain about their hairdresser being out of town and gossip about this actress being a lesbian and this other one getting so old.Her husband Carter can't understand her and gets tired of the way she acts and at times how she doesn't communicate, yet he tells her that ""he loves her,"" even after they get a divorce and he is having affairs all over town and with his best friend's wife.She, in turn, sleeps with whoever she pleases, not in retaliation, but because she simply wants to in seedy hotels and wherever she pleases, and participates in some very kinky sex.Her answers to most questions concerning herself and others is simply, ""Nothing."" But unlike Iago, she is not obsessed with power and control, but in her silence, she sees the people and the society around her obsessed exactly with power and control, which they show in their egotism, sexual prowess, and luxury homes. She is a character fully realized in a way few characters ever are. She represents a female in a way that is more true to the actual biological and emotional feelings that women face, that are alien to most men. She in an even larger sense is a spectator and witness to the society of the 60's that actually existed and few acknowledged....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Feb 06, 2021","Feb 08, 2021","Feb 06, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/428.Play_It_As_It_Lays

Throughout, it brought me to tears when I thought of the ignorance, lies, incompetence, dismissal of facts, and egos in the American government and military that cost the lives of fifty-six thousand American soldiers and quite possibly a million or more lives of civilians living in Vietnam.In 1961 the new administration of President Kennedy was supposed to represent a new and glorious period in America. The handsome and young president, the Harvard and Yale educated eastern elite that made up his staff and who surrounded him. All brilliant, the best and brightest, who in reality knew very little about running a government as big as the US government and controlling the military. In fact, instead of shedding and putting to rest the ugly period of McCarthyism and his hunt for Communists, they embraced it. They were dead set on eradicating Communism in any country where such ugly principles were taking hold. First, there was Cuba and the Bay of Pigs fiasco, and eventually the sending of thirty-five hundred advisors to Vietnam to help the faltering government of South Vietnam against the communist insurgents in their own country, and the North Vietnamese sponsors of the insurgence and the crossing of their troops into the south. The Kennedy administration didn't learn anything from the Korean War, and the ugly lessons of the French in trying to hold on to Vietnam for over eight years. By the time President Kennedy had second doubts about Vietnam, he was assassinated. In one word, the author of this amazing book, sums up President Kennedy and his administration as ""timid."" They did not want to be seen as soft on Communist, how very sad.In comes President Johnson, and the complete takeover by the military in Vietnam, under the guidance of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, whose chief fame up to this point was his connection to the Kennedys and one week as President of the Ford Motor Company. He was a numbers man, and knew nothing about running a war, nor did he bother to understand the culture of the Vietnamese people and the ineptitude of the South Vietnamese government. Along with him and a presidential staff that was afraid to tell President Johnson any news about the war that would upset him, like the countless reports and studies by the intelligence departments and the CIA about the war in Vietnam being a lost cause, and that we should not bomb or send any ground troops.Instead, they showed the President the military assessments of fighting a war in Vietnam and how we could easily push back the communists. Johnson, unwilling to go down as a President who lost a war, simply went along with all the suggestions of General Westmoreland and the military brass and in a few years we had over 560 thousand troops in Vietnam, and bombed the country and the Communists into so called oblivion, but like the Phoenix in Greek mythology they always seem to rise back up and continue to fight.The Johnson administration was quite adept at lying, rewriting reports by the intelligence departments that told a different story, and blaming the negative reports about the war on false reporting by the press. The Pentagon papers would reveal the level of corruption, misinformation, and the lack of understanding on the part of the military about the people of Vietnam and their culture.President Johnson, his staff and advisors, were knowingly complicit in the deaths of countless people, more concerned about their egos and reputation than about the country and citizens they swore to protect... Disregarding the morality that supposedly made America so great. If there is a hell, they all deserve a special place next to Lucifer.And finally, there is President Nixon and Kissinger and, need I say more. Mr. Halberstam only deals with their immorality and evilness in the last few pages of the book that was published in 1972. The author deals mainly with the sixties and the administrations of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.Like I said earlier, by far the best book on the policies involving Vietnam that I have ever read. It is a very long and detailed analysis of the war, and it it pulls at the strings of one's heart when you think of the tragic consequences of a war we should never have been involved in....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 28, 2021","Feb 06, 2021","Jan 28, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/414062.The_Best_and_the_Brightest

The book centers around the 1949 baseball season that eventually lead to a one game playoff between the NY Yankees and the Boston Red Sox for the American League Pennant. The rivalry between both teams was legendary for way over eighty years.Mr. Halberstam takes us through the entire season, with background from previous seasons and commentary on the future of the game after the 49 season. He gives us insights into many of the most famous baseball icons of all time: Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Allie Reynolds, Tommy Henrich, Ted Williams, Dom DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Bobby Doerr.He gives us an unbiased look at the management and owners of each team, how television changed the fans' perspectives, and how the switch from traveling by train to airplanes changed the comradeship between players that existed on the long train rides compared to the one hour flight from one destination to another. He talks about the abrupt transformations that announcers had to go through to adapt from the medium of radio to TV.In one telling and sad story, he tells how both the Yankees and Red Sox had been scouting this amazing, young talented black player by the name of Willie Mays. And even though, they had no doubt that one day he would be great they both passed on him because he was black and they didn't think their fans were ready to accept a black player.Both the Yankees and Red Sox were among the last teams to recruit black players, and many other American league teams weren't that willing either. This would lead to the disparity between the National League and the American League in the 60's and 70's and nearly two decades of National League dominance.

And why was that, because President Truman knew every staff member by name, asked about their families, and took a personal interest in their welfare. He complained about them playing, ""Hail to the Chief,"" everywhere he went. He understood that he was no better than anyone else. After taking over as President after the great FDR's death, he turned to Eisenhower, who was one of his advisers and said, ""In 1948 you should run for President and I will be your Vice President."" President Truman grew up on a farm his father owned and every morning, despite the weather they got up at 5:30 am and went to work. His father and mother stressed that the work he did at the farm was no more important than what the employees who worked for his father did, or for that matter the work his father did.He is the only modern President not to attend college; yet he was an avid reader of history. At the age of 37 he joined the army and fought in major battles during the end of World War I. He should never have been accepted into the army, his eyesight was terrible, but he memorized the eye chart before he took the exam.As President, he surrounded himself with some of the greatest Chief of Staffs, Secretaries of State and Defense. He knew that if he was to succeed he needed great men around him. He was the most loyal of all men, even when it was not a politically popular choice.Today, he is considered by most historians as one of the three greatest Presidents of the 20th century... Alongside FDR and President Teddy Roosevelt. He brought an end to World War II, his administration recognized Israel at a time when it was not a popular choice. He put into motion the Marshal plan that helped save Europe from Starvation after the war. He helped put together NATO, and encouraged work with the United Nations. He desegregated the military.President Truman, as much as anybody, in this wonderful collection of articles written by ten famous historians on the ten Presidents from FDR to George Bush is the definition of CHARACTER.""Character Above All,"" follows the pattern that I laid out for President Truman written by the great David McCullough.

If Hemingway when alive wanted those unpublished novels, published, he easily could have, but he didn't feel they were ready or up to his standards. To have other writers edit the unpublished novels, and finish the half written novels and then publish them as though Hemingway approved of the edits, and would be happy with someone else writing the final chapters of his incomplete novels is morally wrong and a disservice to a writer who was so disciplined when it came to his writing. It was all about making more money off the Hemingway name, and whereas literary scholars should be allowed to look at his unpublished novels and pieces of the other novels, they should not be published as books by Hemingway but, if published at all, as a collection of Hemingways incomplete works.I bring this article up after reading Ms Didion's brilliant novel, ""Blue Nights.""

Baker III,"" by Peter Baker (no relations to James Baker) and Susan Glassner is an extraordinary, comprehensive, well-written biography about arguably the most accomplished, successful, Secretary of State in the post World War 2 era. I know people will argue that it was Henry Kissinger (and Kissinger would have no argument with that) but when you start adding the plus and minuses that each man's career produced I give the nod to Mr. Baker.What is most amazing about Mr. Baker's career in politics is that he had little to no interest in politics until his friend President George H.W. Bush sort of nudge him into the President Ford's reelection campaign, which would forever have the ghost of Watergate and Nixon hanging over it. He was already in his forties at the time, and yet he managed to make Ford's race against President Carter a lot closer than anyone would have imagined. He then went on to run President Bush's unsuccessful campaign against President Reagan in 1980, and yet was influential in President Reagan picking Mr. Bush as Vice President. Reagan was so impressed with Baker, that he let Mr. Baker run his hugely successful Presidential campaign from the end of the convention to the election. President Reagan then picked Mr. Baker as his Chief of Staff, and many to this very day will say that he might have been the best Chief of Staff in the post World War 2 era. He was often referred to by outsiders as the real President, behind Reagan's major successes.In President Reagan's second term, burned out as Chief of Staff, he became Reagan's Secretary of the Treasury and was confirmed by the Senate 96-0, and was amazingly successful.In 1988, he ran President Bush's campaign, which was hugely successful and became President Bush's Secretary of State and would manage the unification of Germany, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Middle East, and the uniting of world leaders against Saddam Hussian's invasion of Kuwait in the first Iraqi War. The dexterity with which he handled all this is a an accomplishment of such beauty and patience that to me it is mind boggling.This biography is a must read for anyone seriously interested in world affairs, politics and government. It is an unbiased look at a great but flawed diplomat, and a very sad commentary of how very low we have come from the time of James A. Baker III and President George H.W.

Their mother, father, and friends are also vividly portrayed.The story starts off with the impending approach of a devastating hurricane, and the reader is almost led to believe that, like in so many predictable movies and books that the story is going to center around the heroic attempts of the family trying to survive such a disaster, but guess again. The hurricane strikes and it is devastating in every way possible, wiping out the community they live in and killing many citizens and injuring many others. This all takes place at the beginning of the book, and it is the aftermath of such devastation and witnessing a family that seemed to have everything suddenly struggling to survive both emotionally and physically... Depending on the help of strangers for shelter and food and the desperate attempt to keep the family together as it seems to be breaking about.Ms. Crouch's writing is clear and lucid, and there is no doubt in this reader's mind that the author lived through such a devastating hurricane and suffered the aftermath. Her descriptions are poignant, the characters are real, and there is never a moment in this gem of a book that I felt that the emotions being displayed were anything but real. I highly recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 25, 2020","Dec 08, 2020","Nov 25, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49383502-against-the-wind

It is the type of book, that will satisfy lovers of the old Hollywood with glamorous stars like Clark Cable and Carole Lombard, Bogard and Bacall, and Errol Flynn and Oliva de Havilland and the new generation with such stars as Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Scarlett Johansson. At the very center of the story is Mercy Wilde, a beautiful, classy, private detective who wears Stilettos to both murder scenes and Hollywood parties, but has the sense to take them off when she is kicking ass on a basketball court. She is tough, yet sexy... Playful, yet brilliantly analytic and madly in love with her debonair husband, Joseph Luce, who is a Defense Attorney and together they investigate crimes. Joseph, no fool, is also madly in love with Mercy.Mercy’s sister, Lucienne, is an LAPD homicide detective and whereas she might not be as well dressed and stylist, she is just as pretty running around in sneakers, cagey pants and a sweat shirt as she arrests criminals at an impressive rate, and has the highest percentage of convictions in the whole LAPD.The mother of both these supercharged women is Francesca Wilde, an award-winning actress whose talent and beauty are legendary in tinsel town, and though over forty she is still in high in demand and on the cover of all the entertainment tabloids.When Francesca's friend, another legendary Hollywood actress, Dana Montgomery, throws a party, murder is on the menu, and because of their mother's celebrity both Mercy, Lucienne, and Joseph are also invited, along with a 'who's who' in Hollywood. Mercy and Joseph (Luce and Wilde) investigate the murder, with help from Lucienne, and along the way we are introduced to an array of fantastic characters, and it was fun for me to figure out who theses characters might be based on in real life. I did not figure out who did it to the very end when it was revealed, but it was a fun ride all along with witty dialogue, two adorable cats, fragile egos, glamorous settings, and an extremely well developed plot. Melissa J. L. Smith, a veteran Hollywood insider, has written a book I highly recommend.

John Lewis meets my definition of a hero, not just once, but so many times that I lost count. He believed in the gospel of non-violent protest that Dr. Martin Luther King preached. They were friends and he would grieve when Dr. King was assassinated, and when Robert F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, President Kennedy, and so many others who died in some measure because they believed in the simple statement, ""That all men are created equal."" That blacks should be able to sit at a lunch counter and be served, that blacks should be allowed to vote without worrying about getting their heads beat in, that segregation in the schools, transportation, and housing was wrong, dead wrong. That the ""Jim Crow Laws"" were disgraceful, insulting, and an injustice that was allowed to survive over a hundred years since the end of the Civil War.John Lewis is a Civil Rights icon and deserving so. His body is a testament to his belief in non-violence and justice for all. He was beat up so badly so many times that it is a miracle that he wasn't among the dead heroes mentioned above. Inside the very movement he led, he was occasionally criticized for being too nice, but he never gave in to the splinter groups that said it's time to fight back with force. He was steadfast in his beliefs and in the end he was victorious, even if that victory is still not complete.People will argue that America is not the prejudice society it once was, that we have had a black President and I am quick to remind them that blacks were among the first race of people to come to America over 350 years ago. If allowed the freedom that other settlers had, there probably would of been many black Presidents.

Wells, and Rod Serling, all havORWELLIAN, BUT NOT QUITE THAT FAR INTO THE FUTURE The greatest science fiction writers, such as Orwell, Bradbury, H.G. Wells, and Rod Serling, all have one thing in common… their greatest works, even though considered science fiction, have the very real possibility of coming true if not in a few decades, but certainly in a century or so. Mr. Zman, whose two previous novels that I have read, “Mind of a Madman,” and “The Living Reminder,” were two of my favorite science fiction novels I have read over the last couple of years. His latest novel, “2025, The Divided States of America,” is a bold, brutally honest, controversy piece of writing that will have some cringing and others cheering, and despite what one might think, it takes a certain amount of courage on the part of the author to lay so bare his beliefs. To say that this novel is science fiction would overly simplify the author’s intentions. It is as much a political manifesto, a political opinion, and literary fiction as it is science fiction. It is also satire at its very best. The characters, Madame Beldamski, the late President Winn, Androthia O’Corinth, and Ilhaanna, are realized and portrayed in a certain way that one could have a lot of fun guessing who their characters are based on… if they are actually based on real individuals? The author is no political neophyte. In fact, Mr. Zman shows an acute knowledge of political history and geography, which make his observations all the more fascinating. The year is 2025, and the United States, under the directive of the late President Winn, has allowed the United States to be divided into separate states (countries might be a more appropriate description). They are “The West Coast, The Northern Border, the East, and what would be called Washington DC. Accept for Washington, these three successional regions are run by ‘Liberals,” with the promise to their populace that they will live in Paradise with a police force that is not allowed to use weapons, monthly allowances whether you work or not, communal food trucks, the destruction of statues that might offend one group, race or individual, and with little incentive to create and modernize. In short, the offspring of Communism and the eventual power struggles that are to follow because, like all communist countries, present and past, they have no real plan of how to pay for all the promises and so men like Stalin and Lenin and Hitler emerge, and in the case of this book the horrifying prospect of an AOC in charge. It is obvious to the reader, that Mr. Zman is painting a portrait of America, that at this moment in time, might very well be heading toward a geopolitical nightmare. Where peaceful protestors are shielding criminals who are taking advantage of the chaos by looting, raping, and killing. Where tabloid journalism is painting a different picture than the reality-taking place on the streets, where one’s right to free speech is curtailed by recriminations from certain groups who feel offended and discriminated against, and sadly, but true, where far too many people are trying to white wash our history to the detriment of future generations. Whether one agrees with the authors’ beliefs and ideology is one thing, but what is obvious to this reader is that the writer has described what he honestly sees as America’s future. I have always told writers that the most important thing any writer could do if he wants to be taken seriously is to be HONEST. And if one truly wants to be educated, a reader needs to listen and learn what they might not want to hear or necessarily agree with. Mr. Zman’s novel is quite controversial, but his voice and opinions deserve to be heard and debated. I could only hope that enough readers take the time to read this novel. It might not change your opinions, but it might enlighten you in ways you never thought possible. I highly, highly recommend this book and applaud the author’s willingness to put into words what he honestly believes.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Sep 06, 2020","Sep 06, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55213741-2025

At a mere two hundred thousand dollars the sec. of states, election board members, and governors had no qualms about changing the vote tally, and declaring the loser the winner. Yes, 1876 was undeniably one of the most corrupt moments in our country's history, but compared to the present day insanity it seems like a lot of nothing.Mr. Vidal, when asked about his portrayals of such real life figures as Grant and Hayes, and the many inaccuracies in his portrayals simply says, ""It's the way I see them.

In fact, it was originally written for children. But, don't let the simplicity of the style fool you. This novel, about this extraordinary, courageous woman, is quite powerful and educational and important.Ms. Tubman helped free over 300 slaves from Maryland plantations during the 1850's, traveling mostly at night, silently drudging through forests, wading rivers, and stopping at safe houses set up to shelter and feed the runaways on their way to freedom in Delaware, Philadelphia, New York and Boston, and eventually Canada when the Courts in the United States and the government passed ""The Fugitive Slave Law"" which made it a crime, even in the free states, to help and hide escaped slaves. The Safe Houses, were run by Quakers, free slaves, and white men and women of conscience who understood that slavery was wrong and sacrilegious. During the Civil War Ms. Tubman served as a scout, a nurse, and gave speeches on the subject of slavery, and after the war fought for the right of women to vote. She was never able to read and write, as a slave the plantation owners did not want their free labor educated. It could only cause problems, which makes Ms. Tubman's accomplishment the more remarkable.In our current time of social unrest, with movements like Black Lives Matter and the ME TOO movement, it is important to remember the sacrifices made by such individuals because without their courage and foresight such movements might not exist. Social Justice in America has been a slow process, but if things seem bad now, they were a million times worse back two hundred years ago when Ms. Tubman's was born, property of a plantation owner.

At a time where the term, fake news, has become popular, Mr. Hearst's brilliance, lack of morals and willingness to make stuff up to sell newspapers and himself is almost in the same league with President's Trump's ability to write his own narrative with little or no facts. Mr. Hearst's ability to do all this is because his super rich mother gives him all the money he wants. She is the money behind all the newspapers that he owns, and whether she actually knows what he is doing with his newspapers is never outlined in the book. The power of the press, as described by Mr. Vidal, is all consuming and as powerful as the Presidency of the United States.Mr. Hearst is just one character in this book, whereas the characterization of President Theodore Roosevelt is almost cartoonist and an insult to my intelligence. T.R. was very likely the smartest President in the history of our country. He read on the average two books a day, wrote numerous novels, was an expert on numerous subjects, and above all else he was one of the first Presidents to break-up cooperate monopolies and trusts in the U.S. In Mr. Vidal's version of the man, he is a war monger, empire builder, loud and boisterous and whose accomplishments don't add up to much, such as the successful negotiations by Secretary of State Hay to end the Russian and Japanese war, the building of the Panama Canal, and the building up of our military and especially our navy are minor accomplishments in the grand scale of things.""Empire,"" despite the depiction of President Roosevelt is a compelling narrative and its depiction of Washington, DC, and its underbelly of corruption is mesmerizing, and the depictions of historical figures such as Lincoln, President McKinley, Henry Adams, Sec. John Hays, and Henry James are masterful.Vidal is a treasure, even if I don't agree with his depiction of President Roosevelt....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 24, 2020","Aug 06, 2020","Jul 24, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/88867.Empire

The American public has always had a mistrust of its politicians.... Mark Twain has more quotes on their corruption and stupidity that he could have easily come out with a sizable book on simply his political quotes.But, before this novel was published the American public's mistrust was simply that, mistrust. The level of corruption and at the highest levels of our government might have been discussed within the Washington social circle and in New York, but the public as a whole had very little knowledge.Mr. Vidal's novel takes place during the FDR, Truman, and the Eisenhower administrations, and the names of prominent politicians, Secretary of States, and Military Generals are mentioned quite abundantly throughout the novel. The fictional characters, Senators Day and Clay, and the publishing tycoon Mr. Blaise Sanford, are fictional in the sense that Mr. Vidal does not use their real names, but anyone with a passing knowledge of political history would have little trouble figuring out who he is talking about. It is these characters who make up a big part of the story, but it is the wives, the hookers, the media, the alcoholics, and the parties constantly being thrown that gives this novel so much energy and so much brilliance. In the hands of a less talented writer, this novel, might seem obsolete considering the circus currently going in Washington and the growth of the media, but in the hands of Mr. Vidal it is a classic without a shelf life.

The book, titled ""Passing,"" was written in 1927 and according to the summary it was about light skin African-American women who could pass for white, and so were accepted in clubs, eligible for better paying jobs, and if really beautiful like the character Clare Kendry marry unsuspecting rich men who had no idea that they were black.After reading the summary, I was instinctively thrown back in time to 1985 and the city of Los Angeles. One night sitting at a bar a very attractive lady sat beside me. She loved my NY ascent. She was from Los Angeles and had not travelled at all. She had the most beautiful, bronze skin with dark, penetrating eyes, and wavy dark hair. I figured that she was either southern Italian, Greek, or Spanish, but I did not ask because I didn't think it appropriate when meeting a person for the first time to ask what nationality they were... Besides, she sounded like a valley girl. We talked for a long time, and not only was she beautiful, but extremely intelligent and vigilant. She left early. She had another appointment she could not be late for and just before leaving, she said, ""I come here quite often, hopefully we'll run into each other again. Another beautiful girl leaving me stranded at a bar. The story of my life.I thought about her for a few days, and could not get out of my mind her dark eyes, and lovely olive skin. Just about a month had passed, and I was once again sitting at the same bar and she sat down beside me. She said, ""I was hoping and praying I would find you here.""""And why is that?"" I asked Jokingly.""Because you're not like the other guys I know. They're only interested in getting into my pants, and you're not like that.""In truth, that very thought about getting into her pants had crossed my mind quite a few times, but I was so shy that unless a girl made the first move I never saw the light of first base. We talked for a while and then she, once again, had to leave for an appointment that she was late for. The bartender bend down beside me as we watched her leave through the front door. He said, ""I wouldn't waste my time with that stuck up bitch. She's as unlikely to put out as a corpse. Personally, I think she's black and doesn't want anyone to know about it... Might hurt her chances auditioning for commercials or movie parts.""I didn't say anything. The idea that she was trying to pass herself off as white was beyond anything I could imagine. She was gorgeous, smart, and very nice. I couldn't give a shit what race or nationality she was. After all, I grew up in the Bronx and half my friends were black and it was a common sight to see black and white couples. Besides, there were plenty of bi-racial movie stars, newscasters, and politicians. This was 1985, not 1920.We got into the habit of once a week meeting at the bar, but she would insist that we go to another place as quickly as possible. She just didn't feel comfortable anymore in that bar... So we started going to this small French restaurant with excellent food and wonderful service. It was also very dark and one could barely make out the food in front of you; nevertheless the beautiful girl across from me.We would talk for hours, and occasionally we would go back to my place and have a few nightcaps. She insisted that I keep the lights dim... More romantic like that... Even though the most we ever did was kiss, but considering how beautiful she was, it was like hitting a home run for me. She never stayed the night, but we did exchange phone numbers.Then one night, I got a call from the police saying that such and such had been arrested for being drunk and disorderly at a restaurant. That they couldn't release her on her own, but if I came down and got her they could release her into my custody. I drove down to the station, paid the fine, and an officer went and got her out of the jail. She looked dishevel, darker than usual with her make-up removed, and embarrassed. We drove back to my place, mostly in silence, and once we got into my apartment she asked me to call a cab for her. I told her that was silly, I could drive her. She remarked, ""It wouldn't be safe for a nice white boy to be seen in the neighborhood I live in. Now that you know, surely you understand.""""No, I don't..."" but before I could say another word she stopped me, called the cab, and immediately left my apartment and waited for the cab to arrive. It was the last time I saw her. It was 1985, in the city of Los Angeles.Nella Larsen's, ""Passing,"" is a real gem. Her writing is powerful, her characters unforgettable, and the story so realistic that it is frightening. It takes place in Chicago and New York in 1927. Some will say that blacks have made great progress and the story I told was just an anomaly...

Naturally, the one thing they all have in common is their thirst for booze and sex, and the biggest victim of these vices is Julian English, whose father is a doctor in the town, and his grandfather who is now famously remembered as a man who committed suicide. Julian is a member of the richest group, but has no problem socializing with all the groups, especially since he owns a car dealership.It is through his demise, that we get a total picture of the town and its citizens and what a tantalizing picture it is.

I didn't know what to think. The title didn't really help with my first impression, ""A Bolshevik Christmas,"" but let me tell you after reading the first few pages I was hooked.Mr. Bereket's writing is clear and lucid. The type of writing that is all too familiar with me being an Agatha Christie fan, but which I do not see nearly enough from many authors. His characters, especially that of the Red Elf, Soviet strongman Nikolas Sokolov, and a fictitious President Kennedy, are superbly detailed, charming, and quite frankly scary.The story takes place in the North Pole, as one might suspect, in the early 1960's when the Cold War was at its height (Mr. Bereket's knowledge of history is quite impressive, even though it is mostly used as satire). Santa's elves are overworked, underpaid, and working in horrible conditions trying to meet the Christmas deadline, while Santa sits comfortably in his office admiring pictures of his wife and him on vacation.Suddenly, the Red Elf, a communist spy, shows up at the factory, and stokes the elves' frustrations with their terrible working conditions and lives, and persuades them to the overthrow Mr. Claus with the promise of better lives and equality. They rebel and overthrow the not so jolly Mr. Claus, which leads to a confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union.An unsuccessful, Pay of Pigs, style attack is orchestrated by the United States and the exiled elves, still loyal to Mr. Claus, are sadly killed and imprisoned trying to take back their homeland. The Communist takeover of the North Pole is now complete, and immediately the communist go back on all their promises and the conditions revert back to as bad as they were under Santa Claus. I will leave it at that, and only say that the ending is a real surprise.Mr. Bereket has used satire in a way that even the great Lord Byron would be impressed with. He spares no one, the traditionalists, capitalists, communists, so on and on. This a very impressive piece of writing and I highly recommend ""A Bolsehevik Christmas.""...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 19, 2020","Jun 23, 2020","Jun 19, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48723693-a-bolshevik-christmas

What a fascinating, imaginative, entertaining, thought-provoking, and exceptionally well written book. That's quite a descriptive sentence, but then that is truly the descriptions that ran though my mind, while reading Mr. Zman's ""The Living Reminder.""The Prologue to the book, attributed to Mnemosyne reads, ""When a wrong is committed there are always consequences. So, in order to not repeat that same wrong and suffer those same consequences, there needs to be A LIVING REMINDER, something that will always be present, always be part of one's life so as to ensure the wrong is never again repeated.""It is ""a living reminder"" that is always present in the works of such great science fiction writers as Ray Bradbury (The Martian Chronicles and Fahrenheit 451), H.G Wells (The Invisible Man and War of the Worlds) and Rod Serling (The Twilight Series). Mr. Zman, in his latest novel, has masterfully interjected this essential characteristic throughout his novel and has touched upon many of the world's greatest problems, such as the current pandemic, climate warming, religious zealots, racial injustice, rogue governments, and the moral question surrounding abortion.Elijah, the main character (and make no mistake his name and actions are very much in alignment with the biblical prophet Elijah in the old and new Testament) is first introduced to us as an eight year old boy having a dream about a mysterious, unearthly character named Stardom who speaks about a locust bringing destruction upon humanity. The dream and its meaning haunts him throughout his life, and after a series of apocalyptic disasters strike the world, and his hometown in Oklahoma, he is the last human left on earth. Wandering through his vacant hometown for days, he is discovered by twin aliens, who are literally attached, and after some awkward moments they become friends. Ironically, the twins, know everything about him and it was their Spaceship... Before crashing... That delivered the final deadly blow against his town, killing his wife, his in-laws, and friends.Elijah goes with the aliens when the Mothership comes to rescue them and it is on this journey to a new planet that Elijah realizes that he is ""The Living Reminder,"" of the good that exist in humanity, but yet when the human race ignores and fails to learn from the past, allowing Atomic warfare and climate change and allows for dictators to take over, it is looking at its annihilation. I read this wonderful book in one seating. Mr. Zman is brave enough to touch on subjects that many authors would shy away from, especially in today's heighten atmosphere of discontent. By doing so, he gives the reader a lot to ponder. I strongly recommend this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 16, 2020","Jun 19, 2020","Jun 16, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53792950-the-living-reminder

So much so that I brought my lovely wife there a few times while visiting New York, but never did I think of going across the street to ""Carnegie Hall.""

In fact, I never even thought about ""Carnegie Hall,"" or the man responsible for building the music hall, Andrew Carnegie, until some forty years later when I read David McCullough's ""The Johnstown Flood"" and Mr. Carnegie and his Steel company were mentioned in the book.It was after reading Mr. McCullough's book that I decided to pick up the highly praised, extremely large biography named ""Andrew Carnegie"" by David Nasaw. To say that Mr. Carnegie was different, would be an understatement. At one point in his life he was considered the ""richest man"" in the world... The Steel business and a few shady deals paid really well. To say that Mr. Carnegie was generous would be a large exaggeration. At the time of his death, he would have given away what would amount to the fortunes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezo's combined. And who are those that benefitted from his largess: Libraries, he built over two thousand across the United States and the world... Museums, Schools, Music halls, Convention Centers, The Carnegie Foundation for World Peace, The Carnegie Foundation for Scientific Research, The Mount Wilson Observatory...

He was far from a perfect man.

An old earth dam, miles above the town, that was hastily rebuilt to create a lake for fishing and sailing for an exclusive summer resort that catered to industrial tycoons like Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick.Warnings about the safety of the dam had been circulating around the area and the nearby towns for years, but very little was done about it. They simply became rumors, until May 31, 1889, when torrential rains savaged the area and the dam broke and the destruction was a catastrophe, uplifting buildings and homes and hundred year old trees like paper machetes and smashing them to pieces... Along with the remains of thousands of people.The tragedy made headlines throughout the country and there was an outpouring of help from people and organizations from all parts of the country and the world.It was at the time of the industrial revolution in the United States, and as Mr. McCullough carefully details the dam, the clientele belonging to the resort, and the destruction of the natural barriers that would have prevented such a tragedy were all part of the revolution that would transform the United States and the world.

His 2004 biography ""Alexander Hamilton"" sparked an interest in American history, especially the Revolutionary period, that has provided me with countless hours of enjoyment and a never ending appreciation and amazement for just how much our Founding Fathers achieved against formidable odds. In the meantime, Alexander Hamilton has become one of my heroes and beside my desk I have a large, framed photo of this amazing human being. And no, I have not seen the Broadway play.Mr Chernow's, ""The Warburgs,"" is an amazing portrait of a German Jewish family who rose to prominence in the world of banking as far back as the mid-nineteen century and continued against great obstacles... Hitler and his love and fun band of Nazis'... Until the dawn of the 21st century. It is a family whose banking expertise extended way beyond the financial world and also produced an astonishing number of philanthropists, scholars, artists, politicians, and military figures who played important roles in World War 2 fighting with the Americans and the allies and whose generosity and influence spread across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and especially America.The book spans nearly two hundred years, and Mr Chernow's inclusion and insights into many of the historical events... Such as World War 1 and 2, the Russian pogroms of the Jews, the founding of the state of Israel, the depression... During this time is quite an achievement. Yet, it is the antisemitic theme that runs throughout this book that is most disturbing. Despite everything this family did to better the lives of all people throughout the world, especially the German and American people, the abuse and displacement of much of the family during World War 2 and beyond is almost beyond belief... If it wasn't so terrifyingly true. In the half decade I have lived on this planet, I have had the privilege of knowing and befriending people of many different races, nationalities, and religions. It has made my life much richer, colorful, and more enjoyable than any possessions or amount of money could have given me, yet the one theme that has run throughout most of my relationships is the prejudice and bigotry against the Jewish religion and culture. It is appalling and reprehensible that a group of people who have contributed so much in the field of medicine, science, technology, humanity, and the arts, just to mention a few, can still be affronted to this very day by so much prejudice. To think that so many Christians could be so antisemitic is even more baffling, considering that Jesus was Jewish. My best guess, is that anti-Semitism springs from a well of jealousy that far too many people drink from? A jealousy at the great success that the Jewish people have achieved, but what people seem to forget is that their success comes from hard work, education, and drive and thirst to make the world a better and safer place.That being said, ""The Warburgs,""is a reminder of the resiliency of an amazing family, and I highly, highly recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Feb 07, 2020","Mar 03, 2020","Feb 07, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30688001-the-warburgs

The poet, adventurer, satirist, and romantic whose poems, epic and otherwise, have been, for me, a gift that just keeps on giving. Besides Shaperspeare, I have never read another poet, writer, whose works I have more respect and love for. When I first moved to Los Angeles, and was dead broke, I used to go to this wonderful bookstore in Westwood Village and sit there and read for hours; and it was during that period that I decided to put to memory the works of my favorite writers, so that regardless of my situation in life I would always have within my brain a library so that I could easily recall the works and words that had so influenced my life. No writer's works filled that library more than Lord Byron. Tessa DE Loo's, ""In Byron's Footsteps,"" is a real gem. Ms DE Loo's book is a chronicle of her adventures through Albania, after the fall of Communism. She and her colleagues follow the very path that Lord Byron and his entourage took two hundred years earlier when very little was known about the area, and it still did not have a national identity. Throughout the book, she follows the map and journal that one of Byron's associates left behind as a historical reference. At each stop she writes in her own diary, addressing Byron himself, her impressions of the villages and towns that he passed through and how they had changed and in some ways stayed the same two centuries later.In so doing she gives us a history of the country, historical facts about the great poet, and at times using his own words, poems, to describe her feelings and emotions throughout her journey. For a fan of Lord Byron, this book was like a great discovery, an absolute treasure. For people, who have never read Byron, and plan to in the future, I would hold off on this book. Ms DE Loo, author of ""The Twins,"" is now one of my favorite new writers.

It is satire at its best, and the author Scott Johnston masterfully weaves a story about a fictional University, Devon, and takes on a subject matter that many people would be afraid to touch, especially in this age of sensitivity, and that is progressive policies on the campuses of universities that have gone overboard and instead of enhancing the learning experience have managed to stifle that very experience.Devon, a fictional Ivy league school, is a university with a long history dating back nearly 3oo years. It is supported largely by rich donors who graduated from the university, successful business people, and by federal grants. The student body is more diverse than ever before, meeting racial, gender (58 genders in all), income standards and disregarding SAT scores... All to meet the requirements of Title IX, which on the face of it seems fair and logical but in reality has created less creativity, diversity, and has seriously limited the teaching abilities of so many Professors and educators.""Campusland"" is full of wonderful characters, but to me none more well developed, funny, and realistic as LuLu Harris, a rich Manhattanite, whose father went to Devon and has in a sense forced this 'hell' of a place on her. She is the most unlikely of heroines... Rich, entitled, uses her looks and beauty to her advantage, and yet she sees right through the 'bull' and insanity that has come about because of all these regulations and plays it for what it's worth. She is an amazing character that some might describe as a cliche, but I describe as a colorful and true representation of today's youth on many of the campuses of our colleges and universities.

The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and ""The Second Founding,"" by Eric Foner is many things: Historically relevant, glorious, despairing, sad, and promising. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments are examined and dissected with unusual clarity and precision. The three Amendments combined make up what one would consider the Reconstruction era, directly after the Civil War, where slavery was abolished, male blacks were given the right to vote, citizenship was based on being born in the United States, and the federal government stepped into the forefront to stop the bigotry and racism practiced mostly in the Southern states and a few Northern States. It was, for all practical purposes, a glorious 7 to 8 year period in American history, but like most things that seem way too good to be true, The Supreme Court of the United States quickly started to dismember the amendments and as the democrats took control back in many southern states blacks, once again, were disenfranchised, racism bloomed, segregation was a God send, and the states were once again in charge and the amendments' original meanings and intents, except for the 13th, were revised and distorted for nearly an entire century since the Civil War ended.In the mid-1960's The Warren Court (The Supreme Court) and The Civil Rights Crusade fought back and some resemblance of the American ideal was restored, but as history will attest never underestimate the stupidity, bigotry, and partisanship of the Court as new members take their place, and once again we seem to be moving back as a nation into the good old days before the Civil War where one's skin color is a defining character and the racial divide in our nation seems to be bigger and better than ever... How sad!President Theordore Roosevelt said many years ago that, ""words and 'talk' are meaningless, unless accompanied by action."" The Supreme Court and our spineless government employees would be wise to take notice of TR's advice, but then there are so few that even cast a shadow beside this great man that I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for constructive and meaningful action.Thank you Bradford for this wonderful book....more",Notes are private!,0,4,2,"Jan 07, 2020not set","Jan 13, 2020not set","Jan 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43726565-the-second-founding

In that rarefied category with DOS Passos', ""Three Soldiers,"" ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" ""The Naked and the Dead,"" ""A Farewell to Arms,"" and ""The Book Thief.""""The Twins,"" by Tessa De Loo is told in the third person narrative. It is two separate stories, told by twin sisters... Anna and Lotte... Who are separated at about six years old after their father passes away. Lotte is taken in by relatives that live in Holland, and Anna is taken in by relatives living in Germany. Between the time they are separated, and then meet as old ladies at a spa where the water supposedly has rejuvenated effects, they have only seen each other twice.It is during their treatments at the spa, that they tell their harrowing but different experiences during World War 2. Anna, a volunteer nurse and Red Cross worker, tells her story through the eyes of a German woman trying to survive, and still support her country and its wounded soldiers. In one horrific scene, she walks into a room of a hospital that has been sealed off and on the floor soldiers are rolling around like beach balls with no limbs.Lotte spends her time during the war sheltering Jewish families and friends from the SS. She looks upon the German people, even though she herself is German, as though they deserved everything that happened to them. Anna's stories about the devastation of Germany has little effect on her, at least not to the very end.They both have very tragic stories... Personal stories about loved ones that were killed on the battlefield and gassed to death in the Camps. There are many characters, all that are wonderfully developed. The writing is sublime, and there are passages in this book that remind me of Joseph Conrad and that is the highest praise I could ever bestow on a writer.This is not a book for the faint of heart. There were times I had to put it down because of the horrific inhumanity being described. Lotte and Anna's experiences during the war are different, but the one thing they share, in my opinion, is their humanity. When giving a chance to help, they reach out and do just that, despite the deadly consequences. According to Dante, doing nothing when you could help gets you a spot right next to Lucifer in hell, whereas helping when it is the most difficult gets you a spot in Paradise.I want to thank my friend Hans for this wonderful gift.

The first number of stories deal primarily with girls working in clubs making thousands of dollars a week dancing, flirting, giving lap dancers and having the men buy them drinks. The strange thing, is that most of these young women are highly educated with master degrees and some actually working on PhDs and paying off their student loans.Some of the other women are put up in luxury apartments in Manhattan and paid as much as twenty thousand dollars a month by men who want a 'kept' woman that is not their wife. Others, literally blackmail their clientele and earn an additional four to five thousand a month simply by not releasing footage that is quite compromising to say the least.If any of this seems preposterous, it is not, and that is another reason I love this series of short stories so much. Ms. Crane's writing is HONEST and that's what every writer should strive for and few master. After working in a high class restaurant in Los Angeles, I can attest to almost every detail that the author writes about. High Class Call Girls frequented the restaurant on a daily basis, and they were the most beautiful of all the girls I ever met there, making glamorous actresses and models look pale and plain. They were almost all very smart, educated, and charming. One movie mogul once told me, ""I would rather pay these lovely girls, with no ties attached, ten thousand a night than have to pay out 20 million in alimony.""The book, consists of about 10 stories, a few related, and a few that could easily be extended into novellas... The characters are that well developed. The stories deal with the pro and cons of working in such a business, and also marrying men simply because they are rich.

Davis, remarks that this is her first novel and to put it quite simply she has made quite a first splash. ""Guardian of the Dead,"" is very much a character driven novel, and as anyone who knows me, I love novels that have strong, well-developed characters. But it is much more than that, the narrative and plot are intricate and Ms. Davis is able to neatly tie the entire story together so that the reader never feels lost, and just as importantly the reader never loses interest.The story starts with Ariana, the six year old protagonist, and her mother Alana being terrorized by their mother's boyfriend who stabs the mother five times and before much harm is done to her daughter, Ariana, she is saved by a thirteen year old boy, who appears out of nowhere, and has a scar on his forehead (Davis). The boy disappears and doesn't reappear until about the middle of the story.The mother survives, but both her and Ariana, have to move into a trailer owned by their grandmother on a large piece of property with a pond and a lot of history. At first, the grandmother does not seem to get along with them and would like to see them move out... A little later much more detail is given for why she wants them out.One night, Ariana, looking out a window, sees a man hanging from an oak tree (Eugene). That night she goes to sleep, and has a dream that she leaves the trailer and walks pass the oak tree and down to the pond where she witnesses a brutal murder. Eugene, the man hanging from the tree, drowns a seven year old girl, named Betty, and her mother while the father is tied to a tree and is forced to watch the whole thing.Ariana runs back to the trailer and when she wakes up the next morning she notices that her feet are all dirty from the adventure the night before. Soon it is revealed, that what she saw was not a dream, but something that actually happened 60 years ago. Soon Ariana, possessing unusual abilities, meets the seven year old girl, Betty, who is a ghost and is the one protecting the property from the murderous Eugene. Betty tells Ariana, that she Ariana, has unusual powers and that she must go away with her mother and will be called back when her strength has increased, on a birthday, and help fight off the evil ghost, Eugene.Her grandmother, confides in Ariana that all that she has been told is true and that she must listen to Betty and go away until the appropriate time. The powers that Ariana possesses were the same type of powers her grandmother's mother possessed. The characters of Betty and Eugene are so well developed, and that of the grandmother that even though they are gone for long parts of the novel they are never forgotten.You can call this novel supernatural, science fiction, but to me it was an amazingly poignant novel that was more like a suspenseful thriller.

At the time, I asked her if she meant hoarders, but she said no. Preppers, she went on to explain are people who are preparing for the end of the world and how they are going to survive. ""Great,"" I responded and didn't give it much thought since then. If you think you are going to survive a nuclear war all the power to you.""Mind of a Madman,"" is many things, but one of the dominant themes in this well crafted novel deals with Preppers. All the signs of the end of the world, the Apocalypse, is right there. An earthquake has hit California and the state is now an island, fire is running rampart, climate change and the polar caps are melting, and the weather is more severe than ever.Steve Coleman (Max) has been missing for ten years and then suddenly shows up at his family's home in Nevada. An air force pilot believed to have been killed, he has no recollection of the last ten years. Jeannie (Traci) the wife, is a former prostitute and is now running a brothel. David (Connor) the son is stoned all the time, and the daughter Sandy, 17 years old, has run away with her boyfriend and apparently is travelling east according to David. The family tries their best to help their father remember, but to no avail.Jeannie, addicted to the internet and drinking too much, is downtrodden because the internet is down because of all the catastrophes, the TV only broadcasts bad news, and Steve, who loves Google maps has memorized the road he shall take to get his daughter back. Cell service is only intermittent, and David is helping himself to his father's meds, when he is not buying them illegally.Steve takes off in his truck to find Sandy, and unbeknown to him, Jeannie and David hide in the back trunk because they are scared of what he might do. If the story seems a little out there, it really isn't. Mr. Zman has woven multiple stories into one cohesive, riveting narrative. The story is told by four people, in first person narrative, and the author in third person. That is not easy to do, but what is even more fascinating is that he is telling multiple stores side by side, getting into psychotic character of Steve while presenting a more normal story about Steve.Like Mr. Zman's other works, he mixes brilliant science fiction with the real world and what is currently happening to our planet and how we are destroying it. There are layers and layers of astute observations in this book and I was very impressed. I might not have thought of preppers much before reading this book, but I will after having read this amazing novel and where our world is heading if changes aren't made.

Riley, a twelve year old girl, sits alone on a school bus. Her usual friends, a group of other girls her age, sit in the back of the bus and barely recognize or acknowledge Riley's presence. Riley is a fragile girl with very curly hair, and she had to beg her parents to allow her to go on this field trip.The bus stops at a state park in Utah and the students quickly run off the bus and form into groups. Riley, expecting to join her friend's group, is suddenly left alone as her friends take off without inviting her. Liam, the school scholar and a leader, asks her if she would like to join their group, and with no other option left she decides to go along with them. She quickly falls behind, unable to keep up, and she finds herself totally alone and lost in an area where coyotes and other wild animals are known to roam about.Frightened, she tries to call her friends on her cell phone, but no one answers. Finally, she gets in touch with her mother who is at work in another state. They talk and communicate through a video app on Riley's phone. The mother, Angeline, watches as her daughter struggles to survive. Her friend, Cindy, joins the conversation and tries to calm Riley down. They give Riley directions and tell her to walk in the opposite direction from where the sun was in the sky when she started trailing Liam's group. Suddenly, Angeline spots a dark figure in the background who seems to be stalking her daughter. She decides not to mention the figure because she is scared to frighten her daughter anymore than she already is. The figure starts to get closer, and the relationship between the daughter and mother hits a feverish pace. Angeline's maternal instinct to help her daughter get to safety and be saved takes over and Riley's desperation to escape leads to a dramatic and intense conclusion.

She is attractive, but her following is small but it's definitely growing as she ventures in the world of ghosts. She especially gets more attention when she spots a couple of ghosts caught on camera.She decides to go big on Halloween, scouts a so-called haunted house dating back to the civil war, with a history that includes tragedies to anyone who buys the house and tries to fix it up. Kayla goes all out on this project, learning Latin through Google translate, buying ritual books to summon the dead, and inspects the house thoroughly, except for the basement, which is locked solid.On the night of the shoot, she dresses up for the occasion by putting on a really tight corset that would make Victorian ladies faint, a long flowing dress that shows off her breasts, and blood dark lipstick and 5 inch stiletto shoes. She enters the house, just before sunset, and it seems exceptionally clean for a house that has not been lived in since the civil war. She walks through the dark hallway with the help of a candle and stops in a big room that was probably used for entertaining. She places her ritual book on the table, and before she starts reciting rituals to summon the dead the book changes into another book while rain starts to pour down outside. So far, she is off to an auspicious start and it only gets better when Thurston Blackstone appears, a roguishly handsome ghost who she is ready to do anything for, including going over to his side and live with him forever, but before that they have to perform a ritual in which Thurston becomes human and he collects a cup full of her tears and this is where the kinky takes over: whippings by Thurston to gets tears to flow from his love; his cold 18 inch erect penis penetrating the virgin vagina of Kayla, and then his erect penis, still cold, slamming into her anus.The novel is told in the third person, and Ms. Summers' writing is quite clear and graphic, with bits of humor thrown in throughout.

Mr. Franklin was of the Enlightenment era, yet one could easily toss him into Renaissance era. He is the closes individual that I have read about that is in the same company with DA Vinci. They both were amazingly curious individuals, hundreds of years ahead of their time with their scientific studies and inventions. In fact, a number of their inventions and discoveries are still used by NASA and the US military. They were both exceptional social individuals and whereas DA Vinci was a great painter, Mr. Franklin was a great story teller, newspaperman, and satirist.Franklin is considered the first American diplomat, and whereas he might not have been as adept as Rudy Guilliana, he did do his best. Whereas Washington, with the help of the French, won the war on the battlefield, it was Mr. Franklin who won the battle to finance the war from the French government. At 70, the man had more woman admires, than Valentino could ever have dreamt of. He was the first American superstar, known around the civilized world for his intellect and inventions. He was the Muhammad Ali of the 18th century, and just as witty and charming.It was his insights and his willingness to compromise that finally allowed the US Constitution to become the guiding doctrine of the land, and the envy of the world over. Sadly, no doctrine has been so abused and trashed about and stepped on by our politicians and judges than this miraculous doctrine... Even with all its flaws.Mr Franklin started the first reliable Postal service in America, his electrical rod and innovative construction of stoves saved millions of buildings worldwide from burning, and his nautical observations are a thing of wonder.

Sarah and her seven year old daughter, Clara, live in a ten bedroom, nine thousand square foot manor on a hundred and thirty-one acres of property. They grow their own food in a little garden that Sarah keeps. The manor has been in the family for generations, and somehow Sarah is able to keep it up as she waits patiently for her husband, James, to return who left in search of work 3 years ago. He left through the front gate and each day she hopes he will walk back through the gate and into their lives. For fear that she might lose her daughter, she forbids her daughter to ever walk through the front gate.Her only visitor, outside of the bank manager who is ready to foreclose on the manor, is her childhood friend, Evelyn, who comes over each morning at nine o'clock to have tea. The conversation usually centers around the subject that Sarah should move from the manor and give up on the idea that James is ever coming back. After all, not only has he not returned, but she has not heard from him in those three years. But, she believes so much in their love for each other and her love for the manor that she can't accept the idea that her husband would leave her and their daughter and never come back. He promised he would come back with money to help pay off the bank and keep the manor in the family.Evelyn never stays for very long and she is the only one that leaves through the front gate. Her daughter plays on a swing all day that her father built for her, and she has made friends with a make believe boy named Johnny. Each night they go through the same ritual: Clara takes a bath, puts on a nightgown, gets into bed and her mother reads a story to her but before Sarah ever finishes the story her daughter falls asleep. Sarah then sits before a mirror and combs her long hair and hopes that her husband will come up behind her and touch her like he used to do.It is not long before Sarah starts hearing noises in the manor, and seeing shadows of a woman in a ball of bright light and a man in dark, deep shadows, walking down the hallway passed the bedrooms and into her husband's Study. At first, she thinks she is dreaming, but then they become way too real. It is at this point that the reader asks, ""Why doesn't she pick up a phone and call the police, or turn on a light, or get into a car with her daughter and drive away?"" And it is also at this point that the reader realizes that there is never a ""date or a year"" mentioned and that there is no electricity or modern day appliances and never no meat served for dinner, lunch, or breakfast.""Inside Stone Manor,"" is an engrossing psychological profile, a mystery and suspense story that is literally at times quite chilling. Secrets are revealed that are only too real, depths of loneliness and regret are explored that are frightening. The author, Ms. Krause, has stripped bare the surroundings and left us looking into a mirror and not seeing what is there, keeping the front gate closed for fear of what we might encounter on the other side.

She states that this if her first novel, and let me just say that this reader thinks Ms. Smith is off to a hell of a start.The book is labelled fantasy and there are fairies, vampires, and hybrids (part human, fairy, and vampire), but it could also easily be labelled a mystery, or a suspense thriller. The main characters, Aurora, Analyne (Ava) and Ivi, are so well developed and the writing so clear, lucid, and engrossing that at times I thought I was reading an Agatha Christie novel.The story is told in first person, with the three main characters taking over the narrative at different stages of the book, and yet the author's ability to keep the story together is seamless and quite an accomplishment. The book centers around the idea that magic does not exist anymore among humans because so many have become so corrupt, evil and vile that it caused the magic to dissipate and when one dies the soul of the human is reincarnated as a different human but with the same vile instincts. Aurora, a beautiful fairy with golden blond hair and breathtaking wings, is warned never to mingle with humans, but like a biblical tale out of the Bible, she is tempted by the sight of a handsome man and she becomes pregnant and this leads to consequences that are both dire and joyful and the reader deeply involved.""Magic Sleeps"" is a short novel...

Maybe, President Trump's name was mentioned 3 or 4 times and not in a negative way. One of General Mattis' heroes is General George Marshall (Sec. of Defense, Sec. of State, and one of the architect's behind the ""Marshall Plan,"" The European Union,"" and NATO).Marshall, like Mattis, spend a long time in the military, and one of the codes that military men abide by is not questioning the decisions of a President (Commander in Chief) that they served under, and certainly not in public and not after they have left the service and their Commander in Chief is still alive. That being said, ""Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead"" by Jim Mattis and Bing West is one of the most important books I have read this year, and maybe the most important book I have read by a military man. General Mattis served in the Marine Corps. for over forty years during every war over that time and at the front lines in each of those wars, deployed numerous times to Iraq and Afghanistan. The lessons he learned during that time are explained clearly and it would do every military leader, CEO, grunt, and politician a world of good if they read this book.Just a few salient points Mr. Mattis emphasizes: A military leader who does not read books is not doing his job. Just not military books, but books by Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Conrad, and Kipling. Books teach us about history, and about the things that work and don't work. 2) One has to encourage initiative, independent thinking, from all subordinates... from the grunt, to the Corporal, and upward. 3) A soldier should never be reprimanded in public but in private. 4) Trust is most important and there is no substitute for person to person communications with every member, regardless of rank, in your unit, or battalion. 5) Our allies are most important and we are reminder throughout that after 9/11 attacks 39 countries join the fight.I highly, highly recommend this book. It is a novel that will help keep a soldier alive, instead of being send home in a body bag. It is about leadership and it is an evocation of humanity under the most stressful of conditions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Sep 23, 2019","Sep 30, 2019","Sep 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46037714-call-sign-chaos

At times, it is repetitive and in the opinion of this reader it could have used have serious editing. Putting aside those concerns, it is an engrossing novel, with richly developed characters, and a plot that is both relevant and edge of your seat mesmerizing.The story depicts the conflict between the army and the Guerrilla groups in Colombia and the horrifying recruitment of children into these groups and the insane violence they encounter. The story, though fictional, is based on interviews the author conducted with these child soldiers, and the descriptions are so vivid and the story so compelling that one cannot imagine the author relied on just the interviews. Writing like this usually, if not always, comes from real life experiences.The protagonist is 15 year old Pedro Gutiérrez. He is the son of a farmer, who he loves dearly, and loves helping out on the farm and one day hopes to inherit the property. He also has a girlfriend named Camila who he also loves. In short, he is a happy fifteen year old, but all that changes when his father is executed in front of him by Guerrilla soldiers, and to make things worse he and his mother are banished from their farm and left with no income. Pedro swears revenge and together with his best friend Palillo, they join a illegal Paramilitary black ops organization and, in turn, it turns him into the killer he needs to be in order to revenge the death of his father. We follow Pedro as he moves up the ranks in the paramilitary organization, experiencing one crazy, intense mission after another, but it’s his determination to revenge and kill those who took part in his father’s death that carries this fascinating story to its conclusion.This is a really good book and it is hard not to get emotionally involved, and it is not all violence and killing, but at times quite tender as Camila is always somewhere in the background.I was asked if I would like to  this book by Lily Green at Havelock & Baker Publishing.

I did not read the first novel in the sequel, but I had no problem following the plot and characters from the very beginning, and there are quite a number of characters, especially Trace, Beauty, and Caleb, that are quite unforgettable and mysterious. If characters are what make a good novel, which I believe is true, then this book is overflowing with them, and if one believes that story is what makes a good novel then you will also not be disappointed.The story opens with Beauty and her estranged husband Caleb making passionate love. The following morning she throws him out. She cannot forgive him for disappearing for over a year and her thinking he is dead. Caleb is not one to give up easily. He loves Beauty and their children, and from the start the reader suspects that Caleb's disappearance and supposed death have something to do with his job, and by not telling his wife he was protecting her and their children. Beauty throws a birthday party for her sister Kyra and at the party Kyra is kidnapped and this sets the whole novel into motion. Searching for Kyra, sets up a fascinating drama that reveals the life and work of Beauty and Caleb's family, friends, and network. It is a violent life, no matter how much they try to hide it and they will do anything to protect their interests and network of family, friends, and associates.The characters in the story are almost all black, and the author gives the reader a fascinating look into the culture of black America and the differences between what is referred to as the ghetto and the mobile, upward moving aspects of the people who have made it out of the ghetto.The book ends with a haunting poem that is separate from the story, but nevertheless quite relevant.

And any novel, that could leave you thinking and wondering what you might have done means that the author has done a really good job.Tara, the narrator and the main character, and Lisa her best friend walk out of a movie theater at the beginning of the book and go and eat at a deli where they sit down to talk. Lisa, a member of AA, tells Tara that she is pregnant and that she thinks a dark skinned man, whom she had a one night stand with while she went off the wagon, is the father but she doesn't remember anything else about him. Ryan, her boyfriend for over a year and white skinned, have been trying to get pregnant for some time but with no luck. The time she had the fling matches up perfectly with the amount of time she has been pregnant. Tara, a member of WAR (or as she likes to say a member of women against all men) warns her about Ryan's past as an abuser of women. That was the last time she sees Lisa, at least for a long time, as she goes missing. A manhunt for the missing lady quickly is arranged, and it is against this background that a number of fascinating story lines are developed. Both Lisa and Tara are 39 years old and will turn the dreaded forty this year. It is the struggled that Tara has with getting older that really pulls you into this story... From her perception of losing her sex appeal, to the bad choices she has made so far in life, to her weight, diet, and the change of her clothes to fit her changing body. If this seems trivial it is not.

His Biography on ""DA Vinci"" is one of the greatest biographies I have ever read about another human being. In fact, his revelations about DA Vinci go hand and hand with ""The Innovators"" and his name is brought up repeatedly and the final picture in this amazing book is a DA Vinci drawing of the Vitruvian Man.DA Vinci, unlike Michaelangelo, loved to collaborate with other artists, musicians, actors, and scientists and that is one of the reasons he is considered one of the greatest, complete, geniuses who has ever lived and Michaelangelo, a loner, is a mere shadow in the presence of DA Vinci.""The Innovators"" is a story that began over 150 years ago with Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, whose interest in both science and the humanities, foresaw what would eventually lead to the digital age (computers, the internet, the web). Her interest in calculating machines, algorithms, poetry, and music and her collaboration with Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor would be the genesis of the digital age and the vision and foundation that would eventually morph into the world wide web.Over the next 150 years there would be notable names as the military (government) Academica (MIT, Yale, Stanford, Harvard) and entrepreneurs (Gates, Allen, Jobs, etc.) contributed to this amazing revolution in science but it was never one individual but a collaboration of thousands of gifted men and women. There was never a great leap, but a steady, at times painstaking, process from rudimentary computers to high speed computers to personal computers, and then to the software and operating systems, and finally to the world wide web and companies like Google.Computers were originally seen as machines that would create communities of people in which they would make it easy to exchange ideas. It was to be free, and in fact the creator of the world wide web never patented his creation. Of course, over time the free exchange of ideas and inventions were patented and individuals like Jobs and Gates became billionaires, creating empires.Mr. Isaacson's book is like an encyclopedia, mixed with the poetry and music, that Mrs Lovelace first envisioned. It is about the creative process, teamwork, and contributions and insights from many different fields of science and the humanities.

Madison is a ""Healer"" and she is on the run after escaping from a band (HAND) of weresnakes who kidnapped her over three years ago and used her to heal them when they went into battle against rival bands (HANDS) such as werewolves and got wounded. Madison possesses the power to heal, and senses when someone is suffering and is drawn to them to help and heal them.A HAND consists of 5 members and whether werewolves or weresnakes, they each have an ALPHA, a magician, A HEALER, and two other members who transform into snakes or wolves. The ALPHA also transforms into a snake or a wolf and is the leader of the HAND, but the HEALER is the most important member because she can heal and prevent death during and after battle.Madison's good deed at the beginning of the novel, is rewarded when an ALPHA member, Alex, of a werewolf ""Hand"" comes along to thank her for saving the puppy wolf earlier. Madison falls in with this group, which are really the good guys and live like one large, extended family. This sets up the story that follows, the good guys (the werewolves) and the bad guys (the weresnakes).The story of survival made this book a real page turner, the characters of Madison, Alex, and Daniel, and Nonnie, were brilliantly developed throughout the story, as are all the characters. The writing is crisp, lucid and exciting and the author has set-up the two opposing HANDS like military style camps which adds extra magic and suspense to the plot, and it also has some great romance.

Mr. Bradbury's novel that takes place in 2054, depicts an American society in which books are burned, and homes that possess such items are burned down along with the books and at times so are the occupants of the home. The Fire Department, instead of putting out fires, are the ones that burn the books, homes, and occupants.The book, published in 1950, evolved originally from a short story written by Mr. Bradbury titled ""The Fireman."" It was a time in America when Senator Joseph McCarthey decided to make a name for himself by hunting down invisible Communists hiding in every closet in the United States, it was the height of the Cold War with both the Soviet Union and United States in possession of Atomic bombs, and it was the time when Stalin's crime against humanity were coming into full view and his totalitarian state was banning everything from a free press to books.All of the above factors influenced Mr. Bradbury's novel. What is truly amazing, to me, is the relevance that this book has to today... Nearly 70 years after it was published. It's as though the author literally saw the future in which books were replaced by big screen TVs, computers and cell phones replaced communal gatherings such as sitting on porches and conversing on subjects such as politics and friends, and libraries are becoming extinct.

And the love of money, above God and country, and comfort above hard work.In an appendix to my edition of the book, Mr. Bradbury writes ""I've always been afraid of belonging to groups.

Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural address he famously asks, “And so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country?”In the heightened political environment we are currently living in and with a Presidential election a little over a year away I will ask the presidential candidates, in a slightly deviated take on President Kennedy’s question, “What have you done for your country that you deserve to be President of the United States?” And after I calculate your contributions to our country, the one who comes close to 10 per cent of what General George Marshall contributed to his country that is the individual I will be rooting for to become President.David L. Roll’s biography on George Marshall is undoubtedly one of the best biographies I have ever read on any individual. It is a detailed, engrossing, unbiased and exceptionally well-written account of his life, from his birth to the time of his death in 1957. With the possible exception of George Washington, George Marshall’s contributions to our country cast a long and inspiring shadow that span more than a half a century and three wars… a 5 star General, chief of staff of the armed forces during World War 2, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, the architect behind ‘The Marshall Plan’ and one of the visionaries behind the formation of NATO and that’s just a few of his contributions. Apolitical, unselfish to a fault, loyal, and generous in his praise and humility toward his country and its citizens… seldom has a better man served his country. “America has a built-in advantage in the quest for peace,” he said. “Immigrants now constitute an organic portion of our population.” As a consequence, he argued, “Americans have acquired a concern for the problems of other people, a deep urge to help the oppressed, a readiness to cooperate with other nations in preserving peace, and our attitude is one of the great and hopeful factors of the world today. (George Marshall on accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.)”Sadly, a whole generation of Americans have grown up with no sense of our history, with no appreciation for the sacrifices that have went into building this great country and our role in preserving world peace. In the long and deserving shadows of great men like George Washington, President Lincoln, TR, and FDR, far too many men and women who sacrificed so much have been forgotten, such as President John Adams, Alexander Hamilton (previous to the Broadway play), Nathan Greene, General Theodore Roosevelt JR., Eleanor Roosevelt, and MR.

She rents an old Victorian House and suddenly finds her new life almost to perfect to believe. She falls in love with Andrew, a handsome real estate agent, who is both a gentleman and a great lover with an inexhaustible sex drive that is quite satisfying to Annabel, and who seems to always show up at the right time whenever Annabel needs help and always opens the passenger side door when driving her around town and parking at a restaurant or at his mother's house.

She starts to see an image of a young thirteen year old girl in a beautifully decorated mirror, that she and Andrew finds in the attic and bring down to her bedroom. At first, she believes she is imagining things, and not so convinced anymore, she starts to do research on the house and finds out that the girl in the mirror is actually the vision of a girl who committed suicide in the house nearly fifty years ago. But the parents of the girl, don't believe that their beautiful, lively girl would ever have a reason to commit suicide and believe she was actually murdered, but since they are no longer alive, Annabel cannot question them and so her curiosity leads her to question other people in the town about what they might know about the house and the girl.

It could easily have ended his career, but thankfully it launched one of the great literary careers of the 20th century. The subject of homosexuality is dealt with head on. Mr. Vidal's style is hard, terse, and demanding. It follows the life of Jim Willard, a young, good-looking athlete, from a small town in Virginia, where he falls in love with his best friend Bob, who just graduated high school and is getting ready to leave the town to join the Merchant Marines and to be a sailor. Just before leaving they travel to a cabin in the woods, beside a river, to spend the weekend. They make love to each other, an experience of such joy to Jim that when he graduates from high school the next year he also leaves the town in the hope of finding his one true love, Bob. He joins the merchant marines, but has no luck in finding Bob. In his hopeless longing for Bob, Jim finds himself living in Hollywood, New York, New Orleans, joining the army. He becomes well connected in the rich gay communities of New York and Hollywood and lives with celebrities and writers that the general public has no idea are gay. It is through this journey that Mr. Vidal paints a vivid portrait of the gay lifestyle that to many readers at the time must of been shocking.This book is important on many levels: first, the writing is superb, and the characters unforgettable. Second, it presents the human side and needs that all people, whether gay, or straight, or bisexual, feel and want out of life. It is not sentimental in the least, but its message is clear and straight forward. Thirdly, Mr. Vidal, James Baldwin, Capote, and other notable gay and lesbian artists of this era opened the door to a world too often looked upon from the outside and never truly understood. The world owes all these artists a round of applause. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 27, 2019","Jul 29, 2019","Jul 27, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/88884.The_City_and_the_Pillar

The idea of actually helping rebuild Germany as a way to further European recovery after the destructive and deadly war they started, sounds almost like a plot for a science fiction movie. But in essence that was the sales pitch the Truman administration sold to reluctant countries and allies like Britian, France, Austria, Italy, Greece, etc. In return for the aid the Marshall Plan provided to our desperately starving and bankrupt allies, they agreed to this strategy that would reshape the world, stop the spread of Communism, and ultimately defeat the Soviet Union.In retrospect the plan was ingenious, a very difficult piece of legislation to get passed through the Congress of the United States, but in the hands of the very capable Senate Majority Leader, Arther Vanenberg (R, MI) it passed. Germany was the economic key to western European recovery. Its resources and industry, even after the war, was essential if the allied countries had any hope of recovering in a matter of years and not decades. The sister to the Marshall Plan, which was strictly economic aid and a refute of communism, was the creation of NATO... A military organization with the stated purpose that if one of its member nations was attacked, it was an attack on all of them. The Marshall Plan and the creation of NATO were direct renunciations of FDR's vision of a ""One World Concept"" after the end of the war. It, along with the United Nations, were utopian ideals impossible to implement because of the behavior of the Soviet Union and the murderous Stalin.President Truman, who I have long considered one of the greatest Presidents, General Clay, Sec. Of State George Marshall, Senator Vanenberg, and under Sec. Of State Dean Acheson were the men who had the foresight to implement a policy that to many Europeans is still viewed upon as their salvation.

Individuals that are not one-hundred percent black and because of their lighter skin color are looked down upon... And whites are literally considered the enemy and for good reason. They are a community that takes care of its own and they frown upon the younger generation that doesn't necessarily want to follow the rules and have a desire to move away from the ""safe haven of Ruby""and see the outside world.The first step to that outside world is a large house, about ten miles outside the town and it's called ""The Convent."" Originally owned by bootleggers, catering to the sexual and perverse desires of men and women, and then owned by a convent of Catholic nuns who are brought to the house to set up a school for the Indian children in the surrounding area and with no more money left to support the school and the nuns, it is literally left to one of the orphans, Connie, that the nuns were taking care since she was nine years old.

Often working in the private sector as bankers, Wall Street Insiders, and Railroad Tycoons they immediately responded to the call whenever their government and president sought their advice and council... Taking government jobs as Secretary of State, Ambassadors, Secretary of War, and National Security Advisor... Working for Presidents FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, Johnson, Kennedy, Nixon, Carter, and Ronald Reagan. They differed in political philosophy, some leaning left while others leaned right; yet together they were the chief architectures of the Marshal Plan, convincing President Truman about the importance of rebuilding Western Europe after World War 2, despite Congressional and public reluctance to the idea, keeping lines of communication open with the Soviet Union, despite its aggressive takeover of Eastern Europe, building the alliance that came to be called NATO, and which was a major deterrant to Soviet aggression and fighting Communism wherever it spread leading us into two unpopular wars in Korea and Vietnam.The six men, Averell Harriman, Dean Acheson, George Kennan, Robert Lovett, John McCloy and Charles Bohlen are hardly household names, even to individuals who think of themselves as knowledgable about American history, but their contributions to American greatness and America's status as a World Power is undeniable and as a nation we should be thankful for their unselfish duty to country... even if at times their philosophy and policies lead us down the wrong path.A must read.

Johnson would have been considered one of the greatest presidents, If it wasn't for Vietnam... Johnson would have been..."" It is a refrain that one often hears when discussions about President Johnson are brought up and to a certain extent it has some validity.President Kennedy sowed the seeds in Vietnam, President Johnson... Far from an expert when it came to foreign affairs... Watched it mature and turn into a deadly virus, and President Nixon, used it for political advantage and sacrificed an additional twenty-six thousand more US lives and hundreds of thousands of innocent Vietnamese lives. How Presidents Johnson and Nixon were able to live with themselves after leaving office is hard for me to fathom.Doris Keans Goodwin's, ""Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream"" gives the reader some amazing insights into the mind and psychic of President Johnson and how he was able to rationalize his oversight of a war that was never declared a war by Congress... A Congress who nevertheless contributed mightily to the war effort by supplying almost unlimited funds without asking any questions.And yes, if it wasn't for Vietnam, President Johnson might very well have been considered a great President. His legislative achievements in his first three years in office are still to this day unmatched by any other administration, including FDR's New Deal. President Johnson's ""Great Society"" legislation and the speed in which the legislation was made into laws is a feat of astonishing cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. The fact that President Johnson was a legend and greatly admired Majority Leader in the Senate for twelve years had a lot to do with it. Sadly, the speed in which these domestic laws were passed left little time, in most cases, to put into place the structure necessary to implement and help the people it was intended to help. Mrs. Goodwin's book, like everything else this great historian has written, is a must read. She brings to life one of the most complicated, intelligent, and flawed Presidents of all time. It is an amazing and stunning look at a president who, until this very day, a very small percentage of Americans truly know about, and yet his impact and accomplishments are still felt throughout the many cities and communities that make up our country....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 16, 2019","Jun 22, 2019","Jun 16, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89346.Lyndon_Johnson_and_the_American_Dream

This extraordinary individual died at the relatively young age of sixty, and yet it is no exaggeration to say that within those sixty years he lived three or four lives. He was known to read two books a day, he wrote numerous books (a few best sellers), adventured down the dangerous Amazon into territories previously unknown to much of the world, was credited with writing between one-hundred and fifty thousand letters to two-hundred thousand letters and that is just the beginning of his story. Asked recently who she would pick if she could pick a vice presidential candidate dead or alive, Senator Elizabeth Warner, without hesitation, said Teddy Roosevelt. Asked who he thought were the three most important American presidents, FDR, a democrat, listed his distant cousin Teddy as one of the three.

And to drive the point, even further, let me repeat that it is GREAT.Mrs. Goodwin is an American treasure, her contributions as a historian are extraordinary. Whether she is dissecting Lincoln's Presidency in ""Team of Rivals"" or Teddy Roosevelt's friendship and rivalry with President Taft in ""The Bully Pulpit"" or her heartwarming tribute to baseball and the Brooklyn Dodgers in ""Wait Till Next Year"" or her amazing, detailed, and poignant portrait of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt in the above ed book, one is always left breathless and in awe of her writing and certainly more educated and studious about our history and the amazing people who have contributed to our greatness as a country.""No Ordinary Time"" is a historical look at President Roosevelt's accomplishments as a leader before the war, during the Great Depression, and throughout the war as he oversaw the greatest military and industrial build up in the history of the world. It is hard to imagine any other President in the history of the 20th century who could have mustered and guided our country and its citizens and the world anymore masterful than this extraordinary, yet flawed, individual. It is not a far cry, and Mrs. Goodwin alludes to this in her book, to say that President Franklin Roosevelt is chiefly responsible for the freedom enjoyed today in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the world. That being said, if one is looking for an unknown hero to emulate one should look no further than Eleanor Roosevelt. During this extraordinary and difficult time, she led the charge against racial discrimination in the military, in the work force, and against the living conditions that black Americans were forced to survive under. Her pressure on the President, his cabinet, the military and labor was one of the chief reasons for desegregation in the military, work force, and urban housing. (The Civil War might have ended slavery, but it did not free black Americans) She also championed women's rights in the work force, fought against the Japanese internment during the war, helped to set up the first child care centers for the millions of American women who entered the workforce during this period, and forced the President to include women in the politics of the time and that is just a few of the things this amazing and tireless woman did for our country and citizens... At no financial cost to the American public.Besides, the wonderful portraits of these two incredible individuals, Mrs. Goodwin skillfully integrates the complicated relationships the President and his wife had with Churchhill, Stalin, their children, their confidants and everyday American citizens. Truly an amazing book and no surprise the winner of the The Pulitzer Prize. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"May 08, 2019","May 25, 2019","May 08, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18728.No_Ordinary_Time

She is a successful model who has lived in New York and Paris and around the world and has been extremely well educated and supported to a large extent by the candy manufacturer, Valerian, who treats her like his own child. Son, a back fugitive, enters the picture and is immediately welcomed by Valerian into his home, even though he is dirty, found sleeping in his wife's closet, and has been stealing from the kitchen... All things known to the owner and the residents of the house.Against this background, Ms. Morrison builds an explosive and revealing look at love, class warfare, bigotry, paternal mistreatment, and colonization. In many respects this extraordinary writer reminds me of Conrad, Baldwin, and the Bronte sisters. The realism she depicts is frightening. And on the other hand, she reminds me of Truman Capote and the way he was able to introduce mysticism and magic into his novels, while never scrolling too far from the truth. Ms. Morrison is an amazing talent, and ""Tar Baby""is just another reminder of how great a talent she truly is....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Apr 05, 2019","Apr 12, 2019","Apr 05, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11359.Tar_Baby

The final part of the essay had to do with why you liked the book or didn't like the book. I thought about the question and was ready to come up with the usual reasons why I liked the book and then I decided I'm not going to do that. It was my last year in college and the grade I received for the class really didn't matter to me. In answer to the question I wrote, ""I loved this book. It might very well be the greatest book I have ever read. I don't know why, but while reading this book I just felt like I was reading a great work of literature, something better and beyond anything I have ever read.""

Don’t be fooled by the title “Christmas Holiday.” Mr. Maugham’s novel has very little to do with Christmas, except for a dazzling scene at a Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. In fact, if you are looking for happy, or if you are in a good mood, I would strongly recommend staying as far away from this book as possible.Charley, a young British gentleman, of moderate means decides to go visit his childhood friend Simon, who lives in Paris, working as a newspaper reporter. To say that Simon is different is an understatement. He eats one meal a day, and not because he can’t afford to eat more, but because he wants to train his body and mind for the upcoming revolution he expects to play a major part in. Charley is supposedly Simon’s only friend in the world, and one could easily see why he is lacking in the friendship department.Simon brings Charley to a brothel where Charley is hooked up with a prostitute named Lydia, who is a Russian immigrant and married to a Frenchman who is currently serving a 15 year prison sentence in Brazil for killing a man. Yes, her love for her husband is nevertheless unaffected and she has decided that during his imprisonment, she will suffer like him as a sort of penance for her husband’s sin… That’s called love.Russians play a large part in this story and anyone who has read Russian literature will immediately realize why this story is not one to lift your spirits. The novel is really a poignant study of four individuals with contrasting views on life and in some respects the only thing they have in common is that they are part of the human race, or so we think.What makes this novel, so worth reading is W.

I had seen the movie many of years ago, and what I remember of it was that I was not thrilled with it. As a big baseball fan, it just didn’t do it for me, yet all my friends seemed to love it.Mr. Malamud’s novel is another story altogether. It is a novel whose hero, Roy Hobbs, is in many respects its anti-hero. Only a writer with extreme courage and brilliance can pull this off and Mr. Malamud’s novel is a testament to his courage and brilliance as a writer.Roy Hobbs, the natural, is an extremely, once in a lifetime slugger, whose promotion to the big leagues is halted in its tracks when he is the victim of a shooting at the age of 20. At the age of thirty-five he suddenly shows up in the dugout of the last place NY Knights as a rookie. The manager and ballplayers don’t know what to make of him. After all, most ballplayers have retired at the age of thirty-four (the book was published in 1952) and here is this rookie at thirty-five. From the time of the shooting, until he shows up 15 years later in the dugout, the writer tells you nothing about what Roy has been up to.Once Roy is given his chance to play, he is naturally this phenomenon the likes of Babe Ruth, but better. In lyrical, breathtaking dream and flashback sequences, bits of his past are revealed to us but never the whole picture. In fact, except for the manager, Pop, none of the magnificent characters in this novel are fully explained and described to the reader. Their past, like in real life, is scrawled in mystery.Baseball is at the center of this novel, but at the heart of this amazing book is the struggle, despair, failures, regrets, accomplishments, dreams and the part that pure chance and luck play in all our lives…Day after day, year after year, over a lifetime… Whether that lifetime is short or long.

The sections of the book dedicated to the conversations (letters) exchanged between Presidents Adams and Jefferson and the part of the book dedicated mostly to President Washington are nothing short of amazing. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are literally dissected in such a way that one could easily come to the conclusion that both documents were written by men deeply flawed, uncertain, biased, and to a large extent racist, yet in the end there is no denying how brilliant both documents are and how disgracefully they have been interpreted and by our modern day politicians and Supreme Court Justices for political, ideological, and greedy purposes. The second amendment, as written by the Founders, was not intended to give all citizens the right to bear arms but only those serving in militias. So for all those gun-ho gun advocates, who skipped serving in Viet Nam because of bone spurs, but take great pleasure in killing unarmed animals you cowardly few, according to the correct reading of the Constitution should not even be allowed to own water pistols.Joseph Ellis, along with a handful of current historians, have literally re-written American history and to them we owe a great deal of gratitude. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,Feb 2019,"Feb 04, 2019","Feb 01, 2019",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/38251364-american-dialogue

Howell, MD is a comprehensive, detailed, easy to understand guide that takes you through the entire process of diagnosing, treating, and surviving cancer. I learned a sufficient amount, and whereas I might never be able to properly pronounce the names of most of the cancers, my appreciation and dedication for those involved in the field of pediatric oncology continues to grow and grow.As the author says, ""In an ideal world the words cancer and children would never go together."" Sadly, that is not the case, but thankfully over the years the cure rate for children with cancer has reached 80 percent or better.Dr Howell, explains virtually every type of cancer, the treatment procedures, and the procedures available to make sure that every child cured of cancer has the real possibility of living a long, productive, and happy life.Whereas, I cannot recommend this book to everyone simply because it is a very difficult subject to approach and at times I found it hard to read on, but I was so happy I did.One very important point I feel I need to pass along is the importance of parents paying close attention to their infants and children's bodies and social behavior. If while changing an infant you notice an unusual lump you need to take action, if your child is suffering from fevers, viruses, or rashes, just don't wait and hope it's nothing. If your child suddenly seems tired and has stopped playing with his siblings and friends these are all signs that something is wrong and should be looked at by a doctor. In most cases, they won't turn out to be cancer, but if your worst fears are realized, the sooner you take action the quicker and better chance your child has of being cured and living a healthy and happy life. Regular appointments with pediatricians is a great way of staying on top of your game and providing the best care for your children.Books such as ""My Child has Cancer,"" is a constant reminder of who the real heroes are - the doctors, researchers, nurses, support groups. They don't play in the world of make believe and make millions of dollars.

One girl in particular was so caught up in her painting that nothing else in the world seemed to matter. Many of my friends thought she was just rude and stuck up, but I used to think to myself that if I had that ability to concentrate and be so focused on my work I would be so further along in my career. She was a pretty girl who at times desperately needed to wash her hair and all I ever saw her eat was plain pasta with butter. Many people with characteristics of  Asperger's Syndrome have been some of the most creative and innovative individuals the world has ever known, and without their expertise it is quite likely the world would be a much different place and advances in technology, medicine, film, and engineering would be nowhere close to where it is presently at.Yet, many of the people with Asperger's Syndrome have difficulty socializing, dating, becoming fully independent, and being able to read between the lines of what a colleague might be saying to them. Blythe Grossberg's ""Asperger's and Adulthood: A guide to working, loving, and living with Asperger's Syndrome"" is a wonderful guide and self-help book that helps those individuals with the syndrome to better integrate and live a fuller life. The book is really written for people with the syndrome, but as someone not living with the syndrome it greatly increased my understanding of this fascinating gift and some of the difficulties it presents....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 21, 2018","Nov 26, 2018","Nov 21, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/26842458-aspergers-and-adulthood

Both sisters have not lived in the house since their parents were killed in an accident 4 years ago on Christmas Eve.Needless to say, they do not have the money and when they finally get together to drive to the home they find it in very bad shape after 4 years of neglect. Determined to keep the home, they enter a contest to win the best decorated Christmas house in the town. The winning prize is $25,000. Their problem is that they only have 5 days to fix up the house that is in terrible condition, and then decorate the house.To their surprise, they are helped by people in the town who still remember their parents and especially their father, a bank manager, who gave many of the citizens in the town first time business loans to start their now thriving businesses.

In early November, 2000, I stopped off at an early voting place in Beverly Hills before driving to the airport to go visit my great friend, Frank, in Spain. I waited, with my wife, for a long time in a very long line. After we finally got to vote, my lovely wife asked me, ""So who did I vote for?""I replied, I wrote in John McCain's name because neither of the two men on the ballot deserved to be president, in my opinion. It was the first time in my life, that I voted for a person I strongly believed had all the qualifications to be President. Many people simply thought I wasted my vote.In 2008, I finally got to vote for John McCain for President the old fashion way. I simply punched in his name since he was the Republican nominee. He lost that election to President Obama and in so doing gave one of the greatest concession speeches ever given by a Presidential nominee. He acknowledged that with the election of President Obama our country had finally come a long way. As he said, ""It was just over a 100 years ago that an African-American was not even allowed in the White House and today we celebrate the election of the first African-American as our President.""The Restless Wave"" by John McCain and Mark Salter was published shortly before the Senator passed away. It is a wonderful look at a senator who in many ways never stopped being a navy officer, and who put country before party and the ideals of America forefront in the hope that the rest of the world would emulate the great democracy all of us Americans are fortunate to live in.Mr. McCain reached across party lines all the time, especially when travelling to some of the most dangerous countries in the world whose repressed populace were looking toward America as the symbol of what they hoped to achieve and the hope to have our support. He travelled, along with Lindsey Graham, Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clinton, Russ Feingold, and a host of other democrats and republicans, to places like Epypt, Tunisia, Syria and Iraq during the ""Arab Spring"" in support of those democratic movements and the Ukraine, while the Russians and Putin were threatening to invade. Senator McCain, back in Washington, reached across the aisle and worked with his friend Senator Ted Kennedy on immigration reform, campaign finance reform (along with Russ Feingold) and other issues important to all Americans while never losing sight of American ideals and laws and always putting country before all else.Senator McCain understood that politics do not work without compromise; an idea he stressed throughout this book. He was also a Republican and when asked by Senator Kennedy to join the democratic party he gratuitously refused. Yet, when he ran for President in 2008 he asked Senator Lieberman, a democrat and an independent, if he would consider being his running mate. He felt that by having Mr. Lieberman on the ticket that would help break through the stiffening partisanship that had overtaken Washington. ""The Restless Wave"" is a reminder and a guide of why we send people to Washington to represent ""we the people."" Sadly, far too many of our representatives are so beholden to rich donors and afraid of party bosses that little gets done and, in the end, many of these representatives simply enrich themselves while pretending to care for ""we the people."" Thankfully, we have been fortunate enough as a nation to have someone as special as Senator McCain. Hopefully, more elected officials will emulate all that Senator McCain stood for and the risks he took to make America the beacon and hope of the world....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 04, 2018","Nov 11, 2018","Nov 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36254351-the-restless-wave

Dr. Waldman, an American Jew, with strong family and religious ties to Israel relocates to Israel to work at the Hospital where the patients and the staff are a mixture of Jews, Muslims, and Christians and together they form a unit that works together to help and support children of all religions who are suffering from terrible cancers.

Asperger's Syndrome is a milder form of autism characterized by an impairment in social behavior with symptoms such as repetitive behavior, bluntness, rituals, restricted interests and abnormal obsessions. The author is hesitant to note, but some of the greatest geniuses and inventors were most probably on the Asperger's spectrum, but were never diagnosed. In fact, as I was reading this book and looking back on some of my friendships I was astonished at the amount of people I have known that exhibited many of the symptoms.Asperger's Syndrome in no way restricts a person from living what we call a normal life, but it is important that one is diagnosed and one's partner, whether that be husband or wife, understands the syndrome and is willing to accept and work with the Asperger partner. The rewards for the Non-Asperger partner can be quite astonishing and open up a whole new world of knowledge and creativity.There is no medication to treat Asperger's Syndrome and that is why support groups and counseling are so very important because, like all of us the individuals on the spectrum are sensitive to the way people perceive them and are prone to depression.I highly recommend this book, whether or not, you know someone with the Syndrome or not.

The Founder Fathers would be appalled at what Mr. Beschloss has uncovered, and considering that one of the ill-prepared Presidents who rushed to war is a Founding Father (Madison) is amazing.The only wartime President who truly shines in this book is President Lincoln (what a surprise) and to a much lesser extent President Franklin Roosevelt, more because of the way he handled the war than how he got us into the war.President Nixon, instead of being almost impeached, should of been hung as a traitor. President Johnson should of been imprisoned, and President Truman (who is one of my heroes) got us into Korea because of diplomatic mismanagement by him and his state department. Truman, the President, behind the Marshal Plan, NATO, and desegregating the armed forces failed in an area he was a specialist in and the result was tens of thousand US deaths and countless wounded.President Polk expanded US Terrority during the Mexican-American War by literally fabricating a lie, and in so doing added Texas, California, and New Mexico to our ever expanding country. And in an ironic twist, he captured those areas from the Mexicans who had been there long before us, and now are being called criminals when they try to cross over into the United States.The Presidency of the United States is supposed to represent one third of our government, yet every wartime President has amassed enormous power, disregarding the role the Congress is supposed to play in declaring war. Such a culmination of power was just what the Founders feared most because as the author reiterates throughout, the Constitution was written to protect any one individual from having such power like the Kings and Dictators throughout the world.An amazing book....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Oct 14, 2018","Nov 03, 2018","Oct 14, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37792766-presidents-of-war

After reading that piece, I never read another novel by Hemingway published after his death, except of course for ""A Moveable Feast.""I had read ""A Moveable Feast"" a number of times before reading this article and never once did I doubt that every word in that amazing memoir about Paris in the 1920's was all Hemingway. Recently, I received as a gift a restored edition of Hemingway's classic and my first instinct was simply to read the first nineteen stories which made up the original book published three years after his death in 1964, and to skip the other stories which seem to have magically appeared after 40 years.A Hemingway enthusiast, like myself, swore to me that he had read the restored edition and he had no doubt that the new stories were definitely Hemingway, all Hemingway. Reluctantly, I gave in and read the additional stories and to my surprise, I had to agree with my friend. I thoroughly enjoyed them and they were most definitely all Hemingway.  ""A Moveable Feast"" is truly one of the outstanding memoirs written by any writer. The stories involve some of the most famous writers and personalities of the 20th century ... Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, Ford Madox Ford, Gertrude Stein, and Sylvia Beach yet at the very heart of all these stories is Hemingway's undying love and remorse at leaving his first wife Hadley. She is the heroine at the heart of this wonderful collection and Hemingway makes that perfectly clear.It is impossible to read many of these stories without shedding tears. It is as truthful and honest as anything I have read, and there was nothing more important to Hemingway as a writer than honesty. ...more",Notes are private!,1,18,1,"Sep 05, 2018","Sep 06, 2018","Sep 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4631.A_Moveable_Feast

Camus' ""The Plague"" is a breathtaking, scintillating, philosophical journey that I will not soon forget. It is a writer at the very top of his game. It is a brilliant piece of literature that a Professor could spend an entire semester teaching. It is a metaphorical masterpiece that can be debated and analyzed to the end of time like Dante's ""Inferno.""

The translation byThomas Mann's, ""The Magic Mountain"" is a tour de force, a masterpiece, a novel whose uniqueness and imagination left me breathless. The translation by John E. Woods from the original German to English is as good as it gets: a work of art in and of itself. The novel is just over 700 pages, but if one was to do a normal word count the book would easily be closer to 1,000 pages. After reading about half the book, I decided to read just 20 pages a day and to savor the brilliance and to give my full attention to every word and paragraph.The hero of the book, if one wants to call him a hero, is Hans Castorp. There is nothing extraordinary about Hans. If nothing else, he is simply an ordinary young man as the narrator frequently reminds the reader. He goes to visit his cousin in a sanatorium who is suffering from an ailment which is keeping him away from his dream of rejoining his regiment and moving up the ranks. Hans' original plan of a three week visit turns into a 7 year stay, most of his own doing with the comfort that he has been diagnosed with a minor ailment that could naturally turn deadly.The sanatorium, high in the Swiss Alps where the 'air' is very much part of the treatment, is no ordinary sanatorium, but is more like living at the Plaza Hotel: 5 gourmet meals a day, alcoholic beverages available just for the asking, lovely rooms... each with a balcony... after all, the air is part of the cure. And of course, its own cemetery for those poor patients who failed to be cured; their bodies wrapped in a blanket, placed on a sleigh, send down the snow covered mountain and directly into their graves.The patients, more like guests, are from all over Europe, a few from America, and even a gentleman from Mexico. The place is so great that many of the patients, even after being declared cured and released, come back on their own in six months or a year. If all this sounds too good to be true, take my word for it, it's not... just ask our hero Hans.Mr Mann has given us an array of characters that make the characters, ""In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,""look totally normal. In essence, they represent the countries that will soon be entering into Word War 1. He exposes the reader to ideas, theories, God, and science that are so deep and meaningful, that once you stop laughing, you are left with questions that we are still asking ourselves one hundred years later.The only other novel that I can use as a comparison to this masterpiece is ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" and yet I don't even know if that is an apt comparison. ""The Magic Mountain"" is so unique, so gloriously imaginative and creative, that it stands mighty tall alongside the greatest novels of all time....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 03, 2018","Sep 16, 2018","Jul 03, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/88077.The_Magic_Mountain

It is both a psychological and sociological drama, set in Paris, France with a lingering commentary on American morals running throughout the book. It was published in 1956 and it is definitely one of the first novels that addresses homosexuality in a mature and intelligent manner. The characters are portrayed so honestly that the reader, despite one's sexual orientation, is able to identify with the confusion the characters feel over their sexuality, the bigotry they encounter when they venture outside their communities and the loneliness and isolation they suffer as they come to grips with their uniqueness.  Mr. Baldwin's novel is bold and powerful, superbly written, and I strongly recommend this amazing piece of literature....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"May 28, 2018","May 30, 2018","May 28, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38462.Giovanni_s_Room

The lone priest left in the area, a person all to human with a woeful record of debauchery, is hunted down throughout the book by the Red Shirts and a reward has been placed on his head.

In truth, it just might be the most unpleasant and objectionable novel I have read from such a distinguished and brilliant writer. The book reeks of anti-Catholic sentiment, British nationalism, it disparages other nations such as France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. And yet what is most striking is its anti-female sentiment that runs throughout this book like a tidal wave. Considering Ms. Bronte's gender, it is hard to fathom.William Crimsworth, the main character, narrator, and British exile, teaches at a French bordering school for girls, along with teaching at a boys school. In describing the girls, who are mainly Catholic, you would think that all girls from the ages of fifteen to the day they die are unworthy, selfish, and despicable creatures. Mr Crimsworth, considers himself a God loving Protestant, a moralist, and a man of superior intellect. In short, he is an obnoxious and rude character who this reader had absolutely no sympathy for and wishes he never has to encounter such a main character so deplorable, and self righteous, ever again.In respect to authors and their works, I always try to put them in perspective to the time they are living and writing in. This was Ms. Bronte's first book and it was repeatedly rejected by publishers. It was not until after she died that this novel was published.

It would be like disregarding the atrocities that took place during World War 2. Not forgetting history is very important to the survival of the human race.

Thanks to Hollywood and other media outlets.After reading Poe for the first time, I was greatly impressed. His writing style I found to be very similar to my favorite writer of all time, Joseph Conrad, and to another writer I greatly admired, F. Scott Fitzgerald. All three writers were very descriptive; even though their subject matters were vastly different.A few days ago, while looking through my library at home, I picked up the ""The Great Short Works of Edgar Allan Poe"" and flipped through it and read the notes I made in the margins. I then decided to re-read the entire collection, which is comprised of his many poems and numerous short stories and tales. I found a few stories too long with sentences that seemed to run on for eternity, a few of the stories and tales very good, and the vast majority of short stories, tales, and poems extraordinary works of literature.""The Assignation,"" ""Berenice,"" ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" ""The Oval Portrait,"" ""The Masque of the Red Death,"" ""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" The Tell Tale Heart"" ""The Premature Burial,"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"" are works of pure literary genius... All studies in the art of great storytelling, character development, and the poetry and beauty of words. I can only hope that today all students of literature are being taught and exposed to these wonderful works ... If not, that is a real crime. Back to my adolescent connection to Mr. Poe ... When I was just a mere teenager, drunk and high on certain drugs .... My friends and I used to walk up to ""Poe's Cottage"" just off the Fordham University Campus in the Bronx. The place was in total disarray and there were more people inside the cottage and on the grounds partying than I think Mr. Poe, with his wonderful imagination, could ever have imagined. I used to think, even back then, what a crime it was that such a landmark was allowed to be so run down and disrespected in so many ways.Today, I am happy to report that the Cottage and surrounding grounds have been restored to their once grandeur and there are no longer any loiters, drug addicts, or alcololics like myself hanging around but students passing through on school trips.When I moved to Los Angeles in 1982, I went for quite a long time without a job and naturally had very little money to buy food; nevertheless books. Thankfully, in Westwood Village where I lived there were many wonderful bookstores. One bookstore in particular, was so huge (with two levels) that it looked more like a Library. On the second level, they had tables where one was allowed to read. Naturally, this little Heaven on earth is where I used to hang out and read books that I so wanted but could not afford. It was in this bookstore, that I decided to memorize my favorite poems and passages in books so that, regardless of where I was or under whatever circumstances, they would always be with me. The first poem I put to memory and have recited almost everyday since was Poe's romantic masterpiece, ""Annabel Lee."" According to my lovely wife, it was when I recited this poem to her that she fell in love with me.In closing, let me recite the closing stanza:For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreamsOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyesOf the beautiul Annabel Lee;And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the sideOf my darling - my darling - my life and my bride,In her sepulchre there by the sea -In her tomb by the sounding sea.Poe ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,"not setJan 11, 2018","Jan 18, 2018Jan 18, 2018","Jan 11, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36311.Great_Short_Works

An hour later, I read another forty pages, put it down and thought to myself do I really want to read this book? An hour later, I once again, picked it up and read the entire book in one sitting.Ms England cleverly connects four married couples to each other, either through school, work, dinner parties, or childhood friendships. The characters are literally laden with doubts, secrets, denials, and lies. Ms. England's writing is clear, and crisp, not overly descriptive, but just descriptive enough. Her ability to keep your attention and interest in so many characters is quite a feat, especially since the four couples are in a sense all main characters, with lesser characters thrown in... But even the lesser characters, the children, barmaid, mothers and fathers are fully developed and also quite interesting.The writer is quite adept at creating suspense and there are a number of turns and twists in this book that are seriously unexpected but add so much to the story. The one thing I would suggest to the author is the need to add more humor because even under the most intense situations humor plays a very important role.In the end, this book seriously held my interest and I greatly enjoyed the writing, the plots, and especially the characters.

The characters, and there are many, are well defined, especially the main characters of Carter, Monica, and General Hicks.The novel takes place in the future, roughly one hundred years from now, and the world is at war. In many ways, it is a simulation of World War Two, which is mentioned throughout the book. The United States and its allies are under siege and at the very start of the book one could easily say they are losing the war: parts of the United States have been taking over, along with all of Europe, by a socialist, tyrannical regime that one could easily relate to the old Soviet Union or to Hilter's Nazi Germany.The United States and its allies find a way to activate a 'paragene,' present in some of its soldiers, which turns them into genetically enhanced soldiers with paranormal abilities. The enhanced soldiers are grouped into teams of ten and together with regular army, navy, air force personnel and guerrilla fighters on the ground launch a D-Day style invasion.The weaponry and technological advancements envisioned and mentioned are quite amazing and the author's knowledge of technology is fully on display throughout this book, but what makes this book truly exciting and interesting is the human and emotional connections between the characters and the true cost of war.The book is long, and this reader felt it would have benefitted if about 20 to 30 pages were cut out, but besides that it delivered on all fronts.

The size of a work does not matter, only the contents, characters, and style of writing.Since my junior year in college, which was nearly forty years ago, I have tried to read Truman Capote's short story, ""A Christmas Memory"" at least once a year...either on Thanksgiving or Christmas and occasionally, on both Holidays.It is in my opinion, one of the greatest pieces of literature I have ever read. It is one of the few short stories that I put on the same level as a Hemingway's short story; even though their styles are so, so different.Mr. Capote was one of the greatest writers of the second half of the 20th century.

It is writing at its very best. The characters, including Queenie, the dog, are beautifully realized and the Alabama back woods have never been better portrayed and depicted.

Walter Isaacson's ""Leonardo DA Vinci"" is a brilliant, spellbinding, analytic, informative and a breathtaking biography.Before reading this book, I always though of Mr. DA Vinci as arguably the greatest genius of the Renaissance period.After reading this book, I can arguably say that he just might be the most extraordinary human being of all time.After reading the first twenty pages of this book, I made the conscious decision to put everything else I was doing aside, and concentrate simply on this book and the wonders it presented. That is not to say this is a difficult book to read ... Just the opposite. Mr Isaacson's writing is clear and lucid, but the observations about Mr. DA Vinci's works are so enthralling that I found myself looking at the same sketches as much as twenty times.Leonardo Da Vinci was so much more than a great artist. He was a scientist whose discoveries and experiments were centuries ahead of the very men and women who received the credit. The scientist is what made the artist so extraordinary. He was one of the very first to link science and artistry and what he left behind is a collection that the world has marvelled over for five centuries and will be marvelling over for the rest of time. His curosity was limitless and his imagination knew no limits.Who would I recommend this book to? Anyone who is thinking of becoming a doctor, a civil or military engineer, a biologist, anyone interested in anatomy, mathematics, aviation, evolution, theater, and, of course, painting. Anyone who doubts themselves and anyone niave enough to stop being the curious eight year old child they once were.This is a much read book but only if one is willing to give it the time it deserves. The patience it so richly deserves and, if one does that, one will be left pondering the wonders of a brilliant mind and one will never look at the ""everyday events"" the same ever again.

About six months ago, I decided to change all that. First, I read ""The Players,"" ""Libra,"" ""White Noise"" and eventually every book this fantastic novelist has written. He is, in my opinion, one of the greatest American novelist of all time. His name belongs right beside the names of Faukler, Hemingway, Dos Passos, Merville, Fitzgerald, and Capote. His novels paint a portray of the world over the last fifty years that is unmatched by any other author over this same period of time. Many novels like ""The Players,"" ""White Noise,"" ""Great Jones Street"" and ""Ratner's Star"" have a prescient effect that is at once frightening and awe inspiring. Others, like ""Underground,"" ""Libra"" and ""Running Dog""are sociological and historical masterpieces. I count at least five books by Mr. Delillo that were worthy of a Pultizer Prize. They are ""The Players,"" ""Libra,"" ""White Noise,""""Underground,"" and ""Great Jones Street."" His cumulative work is worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize for Literature but I doubt he will ever get one. At least, not until the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, is replaced by knowledgeable and informed individual without a tendency to look more favorably on authors who possess a preference for Communism and socialism.Maybe my love for Mr. DeLillo's works is due to the fact that he was raised in The Bronx, like myself, and is a New York Yankee fan. Or maybe, I recognize great literature and Mr. DeLillo is the best novelist of his generation.

The novel opens with a glimpse of Nick Caggiano, a sweet, aspiring writer from the Bronx who is just trying to make it in Los Angeles while holding on to his morals and Catholic faith. Things start to spiral out of control after he encounters the troubled Nicole Weiss, a 21-year-old beauty with endless money and drugs and a whole past’s worth of trauma. The two head into a whirlwind of passion and instability as they navigate the turbulent ocean that is their relationship.While this may sound like the traditional ‘good boy meets bad girl story,’ it is much more than that. The book delves into the worst parts of Hollywood culture, including sexual abuse and drug addiction. Additionally, readers are privy to many characters’ perspectives, including that of Nicole’s father, a former soldier and current movie industry tycoon, Richard Weiss. Apart from his thoughts on and reactions to his daughter’s rash behavior and harmful decisions, Richard brings the realities of WWII, and war in general, to light. As the book develops, other soldiers’ stories begin to shine through as well, adding yet another layer to this unique novel.One of the things I liked most about this book was that it gave me many intense emotions while reading it, even if those emotions were largely anger, disgust and frustration. I’ve always stood by the idea that a novel should make you feel something strongly, and this one did just that. I appreciated that the story didn’t shy away from difficult subjects but rather attempted to portray the darker moments in an honest way. The novel itself was well-written, with but a few unobtrusive typos. I rate this book 4 out of 4 stars because I think it successfully reveals a story that, while so unlike anything most of us will ever experience, gives us insight into Hollywood in the 1980s (and today, in my opinion). As for the type of reader this book will appeal to, please note that there is a high level of graphic adult content related to abuse, sex and drugs. A large portion of the book is dialogue between Nick and Nicole interspersed with long scenes from the past and some looks at the lives of the other characters. I felt that these many fast-paced dialogue scenes echoed the drug-addled minds and unstable feelings of the characters, but do keep it in mind when wondering if this is stylistically the right book for you. Personally, I enjoyed this rare glimpse into Hollywood and its many victims and villains, but also into the lives of people who have endured far too much. I believe Sciuto did his homework on the subject and has presented an accurate portrayal of the times and themes. Interestingly enough, I believe the content and style of Hollywood Riptide would do well if turned into a screenplay—though perhaps that’s just the theme making me biased—and I would love to see it as a movie someday!******Hollywood Riptide View: on Bookshelves | on Amazon...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,not set,"Sep 17, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36258939-hollywood-riptide

Otherwise, I would have been robbed of some of the greatest and most enjoyable literature ever written.” I bring this up because Mindy Elwell’s novel, “Defy and Conquer,” is very much about the choice that many cancer patients face. The choice between living and dying…and the choice is not always as black and white as it might seem. At first, I was hesitant to read this book. Like millions of other people, I have seen too many of my friends and family die from this terrible disease and I tend to shy away from the subject as often as I can—but in the end, I did pick it up and I am very, very glad I had the opportunity to learn about the courageous journey the author takes us on, from the initial diagnosis of terminal brain cancer to the removal of the tumor, and finally to the “diet” that has kept her cancer free. The novel is autobiography but for this reader a good portion of the book reminded me of a diary. It is immensely personal and to Mrs. Elwell’s credit she does not shy away from any topic related to and affected by this “beast” of a disease, including the problem of intimacy with her caring and loving husband Rich. She shares letters that her three children wrote when they were confronted with the real possibility of losing their mother. She shares the helpless and debilitating feelings she experiences as the once-simplest of chores becomes difficult and her ability to walk and speak are compromised. The brain controls the body and when this all-important organ is hampered and intruded upon by a deadly tumor, a biopsy of the tumor, chemotherapy, removal of the tumor and forty-five treatments of radiation, the brain is not going to react very kindly. As Mrs. Elwell is quick to point out, all the physical therapy in the world does not guarantee a complete recovery… but it is better than dying, and for this very courageous lady it presents her the opportunity of seeing her children grow up and continue enjoying the company and unconditional love of her husband, family, and friends. Mrs. Elwell is also quick to acknowledge the amazing support her religious beliefs played in her recovery… as well as the wonderful doctors, nurses, community services and Internet research that provided her with invaluable information. The book is a survival kit and a useful option and choice for brain cancer patients and, for this reader, it provided an intimate look at how the human body works in simple, precise, and clear language.The last part of the book is dedicated to the Ketogenic Diet, that has been around for some time but has gained a lot more attention of late in medical journals and major newspapers such as the New York Times, which did a piece on it just a short while ago. In short, the diet starves the cancerous tumor of its main energy source that is SUGAR and, in turn, stops the cancer from spreading… shrinking the tumor… and after removal of the tumor stopping any reoccurrence of the cancer and killing off any cancer cells that might have survived the chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It has worked for Mrs. Elwell and hopefully it can also work for other cancer patients. The diet is detailed quite thoroughly but Mrs. Elwell is quite insistent, and rightfully so, that the diet should only be implemented under the guidance of trained professionals. JZ Bingham is also credited with writing the book and her editing of the book, like always, is wonderfully crafted.

Freud was greatly influenced by Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Greek and Roman mythology, and his greatest books (“The Interpretation of Dreams” and “Civilization and Its Discontents”) rely heavily on the mythology handed down from the Greeks to the Romans. Cy Stein’s “The Medicus Codex” is at its very core a reaffirmation of all of Freud beliefs and much, much more. It is a riveting, entertaining, educational novel and if one day it is adapted for television it will most likely be produced by the History Channel and not by any of the major networks. It is a down and dirty look at the Roman Empire with a cast of characters, lacking any Super Powers, whose heroics is in their ability to survive from day to day. Empires, like the Roman, British, and Ottoman, were not built on the generosity and benevolence of their Emperors and Empresses but on the brutal repression and rapacity of their conquering armies.Aaron bar Akiva, the protagonist and narrator of this story, is a young medicus (doctor) from Palestine who travels to Rome to hopefully one day practice with the famous, yet aging medic Galen, whose very words and practices on medicine are hailed throughout the Empire. Numerous events ensue that lead to the epic bent of this sweeping novel, educating readers about the realities of life in the city of Rome during that tumultuous period of time. Some passages are wrenching reminders of what the Jews and Christians actually went through at the hands of Roman rulers, reminding this reader of memoirs and books I have read by former holocaust survivors. Today, The Roman Empire is often alluded to as this great period in time but by putting names and faces to the actual common people who lived during this time Mr. Stein has brilliantly and accurately painted a picture of the brutality and danger that existed throughout this period in history.In short, during the protagnoist’s duties as a medicus, we are given a first-hand look at the imploding of the Great Roman Empire which is as enthralling to read about as the rest of this wonderful novel....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 29, 2016","Jan 30, 2016","Jan 31, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26717282-the-medicus-codex

I don't know how big an audience there is out there for it but I seriously hope it catches fire and becomes a best seller. It asks many questions...many important questions...but it wasn't the questions that so excited me but the characters and the stories and the wonderful insertion of the classics. The author, and the editor, are extremely knowledgeable. Very well done...very impressive. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jan 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26717284-the-island

At least, that is what his momKlyde, the eleven year old narrator of this wonderful novel, is introduced to the reader as a ""remarkable human being."" At least, that is what his mom has been telling him for a long time. He was named ""Klyde"" because at the moment his mother told his father that she was pregnant with their son he was looking at a New York Giant football game and a commercial for his favorite beer, Budweiser, was airing on the TV. It was around Christmas time and the Clydesdale horses were doing their inspirational appearances for the ""Anheuser"" Busch company. Like any expecting father, he started putting together names that would incorporate the name of his favorite beer. ""Bud, Dale, and Bee (short for beer) and BAM the name Klyde.Bonney, Klyde's ten year old cousin and best friend, is a precocious little girl who is an equally remarkable human being. She skipped a grade and so at the tender age of ten is in the same classes as her older cousin. In short, they are a young version of Bonnie and Clyde. They have managed to save a small fortune...mostly by Klyde doing the homework for some of his lazy classmates. At first, they see their small fortune...six hundred dollars....as a way to continue eating at McDonald's after school. Klyde's mom is a health food fanatic and so McDonalds' for these two children is like paradise and beyond.Back at school, the children are asked to come up with their own science projects. Klyde and Bonney...not ones to disappoint...decide to study the eco-system of a very deadly species of piranhas. Naturally, they are going to need a large fish tank...not to mention the out-lawed species of piranhas. At first, they are rebuked by Bonney's mother who refuses to have any other pets besides her beloved, over-weight, cat. But as luck with have it, the solution to their problem is settled when a customer and rich classmate of Bonney and Klyde invites them up to his apartment/mansion where he lives with his father and second mom named Gricelle. Seldon, the classmate and customer, is a shy young man who still shows signs of being traumatized over his first mother's sudden and unexpected death. In the apartment/mansion two workmen are putting in a 2500 pound aquarium which Seldon has been put in charge of by his father who is away on business. Bonney and Klyde, quick to catch-on to the possibilities before them, convince Seldon to take part in their science project; and more than that talk him into getting the out-lawed species of piranhas.It is against this background, that this clever, witty, and emotionally rewarding story and adventure takes place. Ms. Bingham, the author of a number of well-received children books, has courageously ventured into an area and demographic which has largely been annoyed...or totally misunderstood...by authors. She triumphantly tells the story of these three pre-teen children in a way that is awe-inpiring and truthful without the use of magic wands or witchcraft. The writing is clear and crisp and never do you feel that the narrator is any older than he is...a trick that other authors would be wise to emulate. Like any wonderful work of literature, the only problem I had with this book is that it did not go on forever. I highly, highly recommend. Joseph SciutoComment Looking for voting buttons?
