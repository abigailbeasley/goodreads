Do I  the method of delivery (graphic novel), the theme (Holocaust), or the vehicle that the story is told (Animals). I know I am not going to do it justice, and the following are my thoughts upon finishing this book. We are, each of us entitled to our own opinions, and that is what my  is. I’m not trying to convince anyone that the Holocaust happened or not, that animals depicting humans was right or not, or who the audience for this book should be. I’m late to the party reading a graphic novel. I was read this for my “challenge” book club, and I’m glad I did. Graphic novels, or at least this one seem to be multi-layered with not only the story but also with the visualizations of the surroundings, and the storytellers themselves. So much so, as a new graphic novel reader, I spent more time looking at the graphics than reading the story. I think graphic novels are a great way to introduce non-readers to reading. For this particular novel, I think it’s a brilliant way to tell about the Holocaust. Using animals to tell about personal experiences, helps tell who was who, much like the bad guys wear black and the good guys wear white. I can also understand why so many people were upset about that very issue. The Holocaust is not an easy subject to tell about without showing how awful different ethnicities were to each other, and the things they did. No one likes to be named, even if it wasn’t them personally, but rather their heritage connections. On the other hand, I still can’t understand how or why there are Holocaust deniers, or why this novel was banned in Tennessee. As rational, thinking adults, this novel should be acclaimed (as it is) as an excellent book to present the material to young adults (not necessarily young children) in a less threatening way than film but perhaps an easier way of understanding what happened....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 06, 2023","Jan 10, 2023","Jan 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15196.Maus_I

Willowbrook was an actual institution, and I remember the public outrage after Bobby Kennedy visited there, and brought to light all the abuse in institutions. Mental health issues are still not dealt with properly today, but hopefully the reasons to institutionalize someone have changed. It’s not an easy story to hear (I listened on audiobook). I needed to stop numerous times because the descriptions of abuse were repetitively awful and things of which nightmares are made. There was no sugar coating to anything. I rated it a 3 after much consideration. It’s a powerful story of survival, but like many other ers, I found the writing style annoyingly simplistic. Perhaps that was purposefully used for impact, but i found it annoying. Overall it’s a book worth reading, but be prepared to cry, get angry, and wonder again and again how people can inflict so much anguish and physical pain on others. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 03, 2023","Jan 10, 2023","Oct 04, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59530862-the-lost-girls-of-willowbrook

This one was ok but I had the hardest time reading it. It certainly could have used editing; there was a lot of repeats. I think the storyline was complicated by the number of main characters and jumping back and forth in time. The premise of epigenics (the study of inherited trauma not transmitted through DNA) is interesting, but it wasn’t made clear that this was the central core of the 7 daughters. Instead it felt like 7 distinct stories of 7 distinct women who happened to have an ancestor who had a story. Perhaps it was the method of weaving around in time and people that made this a less satisfying read for me. Interesting concept though. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 13, 2023","Jan 24, 2023","Oct 04, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59429066-the-many-daughters-of-afong-moy

I’ve been to two of her in person events, and she is so well spoken and honest about her writing. BUT something happened with this book. Is it a Romance, did she want to politicize regimes, is it feminism? Where did it take place? Who was the intended recipient of the narrators “letters”? What was the point?The characters were flat, even though Violeta described herself and her endeavors ad infinitum and did more things in her lifetime that would have been impossible to accomplish. I never really saw her as the protagonist-just a narrator. It became boring to read, you know like the guy in your conversation who has done everything and knows everything? There didn’t seem to be a cohesive plot, I was bored a lot, and it was a chore to keep going. At one author event, Ms Allende was asked how she wrote her stories, such as outlining the book, knowing ahead of time how the characters would interact etc. Her reply was this (or something close): I don’t outline my stories. I sit quietly with a thought of my character and then the magic just flies through my hand to the paper. That’s how I felt with her other books. I loved how her culture was always interwoven with the characters (as in House of Spirits). This book had no magic for me at all.

I read one of Goodreads s that mentioned the Tree of Life on the cover is representative of Jewish Kabbalism of which I know nothing. The mysticism is there, not in the book, except for the prophecy and the “knocks”. Im not pretending to understand Kabbalism, but at least here is an answer to the premise of this book. Had I not been curious, I wouldn’t even had known that this was part of the story.I’m sure discussions will center around “if you knew the date and time of your death, what would you do.” I’m not sure that was supposed to be the premise or just the vehicle to discuss other things. Whatever it was though, the characters and the gratuitous sexual inserts (mandatory now for literary Fiction?) didn’t get any point across to me. Usually a book read, even a bad one, gets better as it goes, but this one, for me only got better when it ended.If I am following the Goodreads rating system, I should rate the book as a 1 because a 2 means it’s OK and it’s really NOT OK....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 21, 2020","Jan 28, 2020","Jan 21, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30288282-the-immortalists

It starts off fairly slowly, but stick with it for at least the first hundred pages or so. The writing is so good, and the author's insights about human emotions are so spot on, that you just get caught up in it all. You feel you have to follow along. You become invested in Eileen’s tale. One of the best things about this book Is how well the author has captured small moments of an individual's life that really equates to all of us.The realization that Alzheimer's had a part to play in this story seemed to creep up on me just as it comes upon Ed's wife, Eileen, and son. Even though there is nothing spared about the cruelty of this illness, the writing doesn't seem cold or unfeeling. You really get to understand Ed's personal struggle - pay attention: the King Lear quote at the beginning of the book is prophetic.Even though the subject is depressing, and there are areas where I was tearful, the book isn’t ultimately depressing.

The pages seemed to turn themselves, and the writing was so quiet, the events just sort of snuck up on you. It's not a glamorous story by any means, and it's not a story that romanticizes war. It's a composite of many women's stories of choosing to be a soldier and a fighter in the Civil War. Not to be with their loved one, but rather to ""soldier"", no matter the ugliness, the cannon deafness, madness of fevers and illness. It's about the very real stories of walking through and on bodies of people and animals and bones left bloating in fields and forests, and the truth of how ugly war is.I loved the word smithing of the time. It was not intrusive, but made me feel as if Ash was actually speaking and thinking. It is written in a clear, straightforward manner and a no-nonsense style, just like Gallant Ash.

My rating actually falls somewhere between 3 and 4. To put it simply, i LOVED the book, until I didn't. At a whopping 700+ pages, it stung even more to be singing the book's praises just before the ""crash"" came. I often wonder why this happens. Several books I've read in the last year are like this: starting out with strongly developed characters and situations. I become deeply invested in the narrative - BOOM! Somewhere along midway (in this instance 2/3 of the way), you almost feel as if you are reading a totally different author from when you put the book down a few hours ago.Did they have a brain transplant? Was the story so long, and written over such a long period of time, the writing style matured, or disintegrated? Did the author forget where they were going?I once heard John Irving (The World According to Garp, Prayer for Owen Meany) say he knew the last sentence of the book before he knew the first. That certainly wasn't the case in the Goldfinch! I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2/3, and even some of the twists and turns in the last part. AND, I realize this is a debut novel. But, really- could not a good editor have spotted the change of tone and character that really threw this book off? Why did they allow this to stand?I still think it's a good read, and will recommend it with some reservations. I will definitely look for future books from this author as well. I just hope the editor will help reign in any urges to expand on the story in the last 150-200 pages....more",Notes are private!,0,1,0,not set,not set,"Feb 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

I wanted to like this book ever so much more than I eventually did. The first half was like an amuse bouche, tantalizing anf wetting your palate for more. More never came, and it actually soured while I was waiting and hoping for more.The reason, in my opinion, that Anchee Min's previous work has been so outstanding is that they were written so very differently than this, her memoir/autobiography. In an author statement she says she always wants to portray the Chinese as they are, whether despicable or lovable. She uses facts first then develops the fictional story around those facts as her anchor.In this book, there was no anchor. She told me things I had never dreamed could happen or ever did happen to people and children in China during the Cultural Revolution. In this, she only gave glimpses, however. About halfway through the story, the style changes and she tells her story only from an emotional viewpoint. This viewpoint was one I didn't understand, and I was even quite shocked at her lack of emotion toward her child. This story would have been much more successful had she written it like her others. Using the facts of the circumstances of herself as the main character and then weaving some fiction through it to tie it together would have given a far better picture of life with all its hardships. With all that said, she is one ""tough, headstrong"" lady who managed the impossible. Give me more historical fiction and I will read every word of what she writes....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 28, 2014","May 03, 2014","May 14, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17898858-the-cooked-seed

In the end, however, it added nothing solid to the discussion of this topic. As a matter of fact, the approach is what made this not work for me. The style is closer to chick lit than a serious look/thought about sustaining life after death, whether for a singular person or for a fetus in utero. By making the characters so very not relatable (doctor, nasa engineer, etc) I had a hard time relating to them. There was more time spent on trying to flesh out those characters instead of the agonizing choices to be made.This just didn't work for me....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 15, 2014","Jan 15, 2014","Mar 08, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15818343-the-promise-of-stardust

There is a chapter on how to make your own stamps from different media. Stenciling techniques, nature printing, printing with plants, and many other types of prints are explained and shown for the reader.

Is it her, because of her breast cancer diagnosis at an early age; is it the family of Somalians she befriends; or the little girls of that family that are invisible?This was not an easy read because of all the disjointed ideas and fragmented thoughts. While this is a her account of her experience with medical issues, I found it difficult to believe/understand some of the claims. I, too, am a breast cancer survivor, but I never once felt "" invisible"" becuase of it, and I never once felt less than compassion and caring and true concern from all levels of the medical profession with whom I had contact.The final point of this book was Ms. Thebarge's concern about who was going to help the little girls go to college. What a naive leap was made here. These are children who didn't know what toilet paper was for, have beds; they didn't know what silverware was, or even have chairs to sit in. The mother still couldn't speak or understand English without her daughter translating by the end of the book. And Ms. Thebarge worries who will pay for college? What about who will help them with their basic daily needs and socialization? This may have been a blog jounal of interest, but it doesn't merit a book. At least not a book where so many thoughts have been intertwined just to try to make a link between two separate and distinct stories. I do applaud the author for stepping outside her comfort zone and befriending these people.

Most all the other Goodreads ers are gushing over it, but I cannot.At first I thought it was going to be an interesting take on an old story , but in the end there was nothing new about how women were treated in the Victorian era, and decisions made by men (their husbands) kept them captive in their homes or asylums.

I think the author had far too many ideas to that were not crystallized about women in this era, and by allowing them all to come into play, it distilled them into a less powerful read. It would have been far more interesting to develop the idea that mental illness could be diagnosed with photography; instead, this was used as a throwaway idea with a throwaway character. There are other books about women and mental illness that are far better than this, but if you want a light read, then this will do just fine....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 13, 2014","Sep 16, 2014","Jul 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13233587-the-painted-bridge

It's a well paced saga of a family of pioneers moving across the country to Montana and Wyoming. There's some pretty darned exciting tales, and some moving accounts of illness, and how people managed to live in these extremely rugged and harsh areas. I truly enjoyed the tales that were tied together through time by 4 different rivers. What made it even more enjoyable was after I read the author's notes at the back of the book.

This murder is only the first in a string of violent events that include bombings in Miami, and the murder of the Moores, a couple who worked to bring the vote to Florida's African-American population. This is an amazing book that is an honest and insightful view into the thoughts and lives of those in the early days of the Civil Rights Movement and a foresight of changes that were to come.

The first part of the book was very tedious, and seemed to fall flat. It read (to me) more like a chronicle of suburban life from the viewpoint of a very self-indulgent and boring character, Mary Beth. I kept wanting more of Mary Beth's character to be built, but it never happened. Most of the other characters in the book were one dimensional, predictable and disposable. There were mixed messages all along the plot about motherhood, identity, grief and relationships. None of the messages carried any weight and seemed out of place, or perhaps out of sync; never quite meshing. I was truly disappointed with this book.

Byrdie Lamb lives on the mountain forever and a day, who has a way with herbs, roots,This tory is told in the voices of several different characters. Byrdie Lamb lives on the mountain forever and a day, who has a way with herbs, roots, and some say is magical. She is known as a 'granny woman' and people come to her for her special gifts. Byrdie births and raises many children, but it's her grand-daughter, Myra Lamb, who is her ""heart child"". Myra is special too and has what many call 'haint blue eyes'. Myra loves her Granny and her life on the mountain. She runs wild and free, has her family and friends, and most of the boys that know her come to fall in love with her. There are many characters, each adding their own story into the stories of the other characters whose lives are all entwined together -- some in good ways, others in horrible ways -- through each other. There's the Cotter men, handsome John Odom, his brother, Hollis, the twins, Johnny and Laura. There's Carolina, Ford, Clint, Sunny, Zelda; all the characters have their own and distinct personality and add so much to the story. The names are wonderful and fit in perfectly with the mountain genre. This book caught me up from page one and quickly turns into one of those books that you just can't put down.

We begin in the world as anagrams of our ancestors.I really, really, really liked this book. At first, I wasn't sure because of some abrupt turns in the writer's voice, but soon enough, that was explained. While there were some sub-plots that were superfluous to the overall story, the main story itself was woven together beautifully. Told from the bits and pieces of a broken memory/mind of an alzheimer's patient (Kitty the sister), real and imagined memories from the broken sister (Esme). The time and place also added a great deal to the story line - the ""imagined"" mental illness, the ""madhouse"" treatments of the 1900's. Nice twists and turns all the way through, and even though the reader sometime supposes what is going to have happened, does, it doesn't intrude on the overall feeling of the story.I would have rated this 5 stars, except for the abrupt ending - just a couple more pages would have taken care of a couple of questions.

It does have some great writing, and at times it comes close to some revelations. Close, but no cigar. The opening chapters seemed tonever and I an put the book down more than once, thinking I would never return. I was really tired of the tragic, your life stinks and it probably won't get better story.When the plot actually gets going, the story isn't too bad. There is some great writing, and I realized that this was actually before the Book Thief. It's a plot is weak idea, nothing really new, and it seemed that Zusak was depending on the twist of the idea to carry the book. It just rolled along with nothing to carry me along with it, though.I'd say I am probably going to be one of the few that won't rate this book highly.

With that said, though, aIf possible I would have rated this 3.5 stars - it just isn't as good as some of his other books to receive a 4 star rating. With that said, though, as usual, Bohjalian beautifully explores how human relationships are tested by the pressures of life.The setting is rural Vermont. The focus is on a troubled couple, Laura and Terry Sheldon, whose 9 year old twin daughters die tragically in a flash flood. They are grief-stricken and their sorrow spills over into their marriage, threatening to tear it apart. They then decide to foster a ten-year-old child named Alfred, who is African-American. Alfred is a gentle boy, somewhat removed, and he is hesitant to bond with anyone, since he has been moved around regularly from one home to another over the years.Bohjalian brilliantly describes the constantly changing dynamics in Laura's and Terry's relationship. Laura seems to relate to the boy while Terry holds back. Fortunately, Alfred is befriended by a wonderful and warm neighbor, Paul Hebert. Paul introduces Alfred to the history of the famed Buffalo soldiers, an African-American regiment that fought in the late 1800's. He also teaches Alfred how to care for and ride a horse. It is heart-warming to watch this reserved child blossom as he begins to form new friendships and as he learns more about himself and his heritage. I actually enjoyed the relationship building between the ""grandfatherly"" man more than I did the Sheldon's view.Bohjalian switches perspective from one chapter to the next, which allows us to get an intimate knowledge of what each character thinks and feels. Occasionally, the dialogue is a bit stilted and there are a few scenes that border on the melodramatic and almost unbelievable. I thought the ending was somewhat rushed, predictable and not as satisfying as the care with which the rest of the story was told....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Feb 09, 2010","Dec 11, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/126816.The_Buffalo_Soldier

From the cover art to the title, to the short synopsis of the story, it seemed like it would be a wonderful experience. But, alas, I have to say that it was a chore to read, AND to finish.The story just didn't live up to what I thought it would be. This is the story of Jonathan Cobb and Mary Fury, a woman who has Huntington's Disease. It's the story of their relationship and and the people around them as well as various descriptions relating to nature; crows and turtles, water, moose, woods etc.The descriptions of anything to do with nature were very well done, and at some points I could close my eyes and feel the breeze, or smell the water. An interesting vehicle of the mythology and study of crows (corvids) was used to develop Mary's character. It's just that all of the tools Monninger used were disjointed, and ill fitted. The time warp was also not believable. Mary and Cobb meet, they fall in love, they spend time on the river, they go to Indonesia, they get married, find a house, remodel it, save a teenager from suicide, return to teaching - all in a short period of time but in many pages of the book. Then (it seems) suddenly in fewer pages than saying hello, she declines, they call everyone together, everyone says good by and she ends her life. I also intensely disliked they use of literary quotes to make their ""love"" dialogue believable. I also intensely disliked the use of a ""sick girls"" club to thread together ""eternal on the water"" and Mary's love of crows, her disease, and finally her demise.In the acknowledgments, Monninger hopes that his book ""presents with accuracy, and with compassion the effects of Huntington's Disease"". I learned absolutely nothing at all about the disease except that it is genetic and you die early and painfully. I would advise Monninger to write what he knows - his intense love of Maine, the river, and nature that surrounds him. Ummmm, like his book ""A Barn in New England, Making a Home on Three Acres"".

The epigraph from Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary:Grave: A place where the dead are laid to await the coming of the medical student""sets the theme for this time period of the adversities of an early 19th-century industrial city.The 15 year old protagonist, Gustine, is a potter's assistant by day, and prostitute by night. An interesting vehicle to tell the story is a startling blue dress. Her pimp explains the dress: ""it works on this basic principle: a cheap whore is given a fancy dress as a higher class of prostitute, the higher the station of the clientèlle; the higher the station, the higher the price."" The dress captures the eye of Henry Chiver, an ambitious young surgeon who has had to leave Edinburgh because he was implicated in the convictions of pioneer anatomists Burke and Hare for murder and grave robbing. The Anatomy Act, which allowed doctors to get corpses legally, hadn't passed Parliament, and a suspicious public was terrifying itself with stories of murderous ""burkers.""I kept trying to feel compassion for the characters, but I just couldn't. I've learned that the style of narration plays a large part of whether I like the book or not. This particular story is told by a narrator who is not involved in the story asking questions of the characters for the reader. I found it irritating and intruding, and I found myself skimming a great deal of the book to by pass the narrator.It is definitely Dicksonian, gritty, and dark, a bit weird and interesting at times...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Nov 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15807.The_Dress_Lodger

It would build slowly like a roller coaster going up, up, up....but then it would coast a bit before building up, up, up again. The interim periods emphasized the bleakness of the families conditions in Canada as homesteaders, poor and foreign as well as outcast. I would have to say that as a debut novel, this one takes the best ribbon! The story of Teodor and his sister Anna, along with their families struggle on the northern Canadian prairie in 1938 is fraught with turmoil. Drought, starvations, prairie fires and a family divided provide a lot of fodder for the imagination. It's a story of love and greed (nothing new here), desperation and pride.

(These are some videos on many After hearing John Irving speak about how he writes, I now understand why there is so much meaty detail in his novels. (These are some videos on many of the book sites with his descriptions) For some, that might be tedious, but for me, it enriches the characters, the locations and the entire story. It was enjoyable to see the echoes of his past themes and his own career in this story of Daniel Baciagalupo, aka Danny Angel, a novelist who scoffs at the media obsession with sorting the autobiographical elements of his fiction from that parts ""that were `merely' made up."" Surprise, surprise, here's a fictional character who had much the same academic career as Irving (wrestling, prep school, university, Iowa Writer's Workshop, teaching venue), achieved best sellerdom and prosperity with his fourth novel, tackled explosive political issues like abortion in his subsequent novels, got involved in movies, lived part-time in Canada, and so on. Even the ominous ""undertoad"" from The World According to Garp is in this story as a blue Mustang automobile. The bears that figured so prominently in his early novels are waiting in the wings here. The novel seems to be more deliberate what I remember, and he dangles meaty morsels of plot but then diverts and eventually circles back to fill in the blanks. The slower pace adds to the richness of the experience, though, and Irving's trademark vivid characters, earthy dialog, and baroque plot twists do not disappoint. The middle of the book is somewhat choppy in the way the characters and the stories bounce back and forth and forth and back. Overall, the book has a gorgeous structure, with an end that leads right back to the beginning.

I actually was prepared to dislike it because I had read elsewhere that it is a fantasy, and I don't do well with that type of narrative.BUT - as I continued to read on, the magical became real and accepted not only by the people in the story, but the reader as well. I was not bothered by the mist or the bees, or the fireflies or the ""ghosts"". Instead I saw them as allegorical for desire/emptiness, hatred, and personal reflections. The ""ghosts"" reminded me of Allende's House of Spirits, though not quite as well executed.I was bothered a bit by not knowing where this story of two families took place - perhaps I missed it in the early pages. I had to go back several times to read the first 20 or so pages to get some people and events straightened out in my mind as well. Understanding the cultural intricacies might have helped it flow a bit better.All in all, a very nice book that I had a hard time leaving when it was time to sleep.

""When the Queen, in pursuit of her wandering corgis, stumbles upon a mobile library she feels duty bound to borrow a book. Aided by Norman, a young man from the palace kitchen who frequents the library, Bennett describes the Queen’s transformation as she discovers the liberating pleasures of the written word.""There are laugh out loud moments in these short 160 pages, too. When the Queen loses all interest in her duties, those who govern her life start to get involved. Books are hidden and lost in transit, Norman (her page for books) is transferred to University because he introduced her to gay writers. Concerns are even expressed that the Queen may be developing Alzheimer’s Disease: ‘Thus it was that the dawn of sensibility was mistaken for the onset of senility.’This is a nice little book for people who love to read. I can imagine anyone reading it would find themselves nodding their heads in agreement with the Queen's thoughts about reading....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 18, 2010","Jan 19, 2010","Apr 08, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1096390.The_Uncommon_Reader

Rash doesn't deviate much from the typical progression of such stories (guess how it ends and you're probably not far off), which makes for a rather predictable read from start to finish. Rash has created memorable characters who drive the book, from the title character and her husband, George Pemberton, to Serena's henchman, Galloway, to the Greek chorus of lumbermen who provide running commentary to this tragedy; however, Rachel, the strong-willed former lover of George, is totally stereotypical. The backdrop of aggressive lumbering in Depression-era Appalachia suits these characters perfectly. I just wish Rash would have used a thesaurus to find a more terms for sexual intercourse than ""coupled"" since he used it this word often - it became quite annoying.I would call this book a very American tragedy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 16, 2010","Feb 26, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2815590-serena

Sometimes it's choppy, other times serene, and at the end of the journey you can smile or laugh or cry, then step out of the canoe for another ride with someone else. Not so with the Ballad of Trenchmouth Taggart. In this story, you follow along the stream banks, then jump in the canoe for the ride. At times you think you are the oarsman, other times a passenger. Lots of twists and turns in the river make you wonder where in the world are you going next? You become attached to the characters in the canoe, not wanting to see them get hurt or lost or left behind. And at the end of the ride?

I was so disappointed in it after I had heard Kim Sunee on NPR and then found the book recommended in my Bookmarks recommendations. Ms. Sunne, while having a horrible start in life (left on a bench in Korea with crumbs in her hand), managed to have fantastical relationships with men in Sweden, France and the U.S. She does nothing to elaborate on her beginnings except to whine about her adoptive family, continue to whine about her relationships, and ends the book very unsatisfyingly with more of the same. I kept wanting her to ""wise up"" like so many adopted children and investigate her origins - not necessarily to find her birth mother, but to find out more about her culture and perhaps the reasons why she was abandoned. There's little hints here and there that she drops that maybe she's not even Korean, but she does nothing to elaborate on her own life. Instead, she allows the men in her life to direct her, and then even complains about that. The life she leads (as young as she was in her 20's) almost sounds too fantastical to have occurred. I have to wonder if she was not so beautiful (from the picture on the jacket cover), would she have been the partner of the wealthy founder of L'Occitane? Or the mistress of a poet? For someone who cries about being abandoned, she abandons many people in her own life. There's innuendos about the treatment by her adopted parents, but nothing is made clear there. Somehow she skips over that (except to whine about her mother wanting her to come back to the States and have a stable life), and develops a close relationship with grandparents. In the end, she even abandons them.This must be one of those stories that you either love or hate.

It's a pretty easy read, but not quite my style - and disappointing in that it was Amy Bloom.After reading it, I discovered that the heroine is based loosely a true person (Lillian Alling) who was described in Cassandra Pybus's novel, The Woman Who Walked to Russia: A Writer's Search for a Lost Legend. Bloom has added her own version of why the original Lillian would have walked ""home."" The idea for the book is great, just not executed well. Now, I will try to read the Pybus story since it is so interesting; perhaps the truth - what is known of it - will be better.The characters were not well developed, nor very likable (not even Lillian). I felt almost like I was reading a Harlequin romance without the romance.....From Pybus' book:	""Desperate with homesickness, Lillian Alling, a recent immigrant to the United States from the Soviet Union, haunted the New York Public Library, studying the atlas to establish the most direct route home to her native Russia. Her English was poor but she understood the hieroglyphics of cartography. In the spring of 1927, aided only by a hand-drawn map, she started to walk home. Pybus searched for clues about this enigmatic pedestrian. When her historical sleuthing yielded little, she set out on her own trek to trace Lillian's route through the wilderness of northwestern Canada and subarctic Alaska and Siberia. The result is an entertaining travel narrative that pieces together Alling's journey through the natural beauty and rich history of northwestern North America - a story never before told.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 10, 2009","Jan 06, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/217086.Away

Many ers found it to be a quick, fast paced read. I did not. Woodrell's view of life in the Ozark hills is that it is already written: how the world sees you is how you come to see yourself. Failure is built in, and violence, petty crime, and jailtime are just expected part of life. Too depressing, and nothing of value for me here.""Shuggie Atkins is a lonely fat boy of thirteen. His mother, Glenda, teases him with her sexual provocations. His father, Red, is a brutal man with a short fuse who mocks and despises his son. Into this mix comes Jimmy Vin Pearce with his shiny green T-Bird and his impeccably smart clothes. It isn't long before he and Glenda begin a torrid affair.

The description of the father materializing in the rain is one of the best pieces of writing I can think of! I very rarely read books more than one time, but I plan on reading this one again!Added note on November 3 2009 - Just got to meet and hear the author tonight. I found it out that it took him 15 years to write the book; that he is/was an IT type, and he tried to explain the symmetry between computer code and writing; and that the book will be made into a movie - to be announced at the end of this month.He articulated one of the reasons why I think I enjoyed this book so much. I often use the term ""richness"" or exquisite wordcrafting to describe some of the attributes of the novel. He explained that he considered his writing as a ""braid"" with some of the elements surfacing, going under, going over, going around....and this describes the complexities very clearly for me.I still plan on going back and reading this book, but probably not for another year....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Dec 2008,"Jan 06, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2731276-the-story-of-edgar-sawtelle
