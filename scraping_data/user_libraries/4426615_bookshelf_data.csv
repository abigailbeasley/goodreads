Couldn’t put it down, he says. I could’ve probably put it down, but I promised him I would read it and read it IMy friend found this book intriguing. Couldn’t put it down, he says. I could’ve probably put it down, but I promised him I would read it and read it I did. In Sex at Dawn, Christopher Ryan lays down a slew of what he believes to be persuasive arguments for our prehistoric ancestors being sexually promiscuous. Considering that we are most closely related to the bonobo (a ‘pygmy chimp’) in the evolutionary sense, he draws parallels between the bonobo’s behavior and anatomical particularities to those of humans in order to suggest that our two species are sociosexually similar, as well. (Not to give anything away, but apparently bonobos are insatiable whores!) The point of Ryan’s point, I guess, is to point out that we humans—as a general rule—commit to monogamous relationships because doing so is socially accepted and expected, but that we may in fact be damaging ourselves and our loved ones by acting in discordance with our innate, biologically-programmed sexual needs.There wasn’t anything I inherently disliked about this book—though the casual language likely meant to foster a ‘connection’ with lay readers leaves something to be desired—I wasn’t interested enough in the subject matter to be swayed by Ryan’s arguments. Even if our prehistoric ancestors were polygamous, what does it matter? Somewhere along the line it became more worthwhile for humans to live in committed, monogamous relationships (whether for social, economic, or perhaps other reasons entirely), and as with any choice made by anyone anywhere ever, it will always be at the expense of something. Perhaps this does leave us more sexually frustrated at times than our ancestors were, but I’d like to believe that the return on this investment provides us a reward that is greater than the sum of our frustrations.At least I fucking hope so....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,"Jun 29, 2018","Jun 24, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9522254-sex-at-dawn

I think the problem is this: the world has turned to shit. How can one allow himself the luxury of distraction when all the things that used to matter (e.g. facts, words, truth) no longer do? I feel as though...as though disconnecting from reality, even temporarily, is akin to complicity. Remember when you were taught that witnessing an evil act but doing nothing to stop it made you just as guilty as the one committing the wrongdoing? Well, broaden that concept and that pretty much sums up my life. I can’t do anything without worrying what horrible things are happening that I don’t know about, and which of course I need to know about, and ultimately do something about or else I’m a failure, which is clearly a vicious cycle because it is something over which I have no actual control—this shit is way too big for me to do anything about on my own, except to stew and seethe and writhe and tweet. So a few pages of a book, or a few minutes of a sitcom, is about all I afford myself. And not becauses I don’t want more! It’s just that...the world might be falling apart (and likely IS FALLING APART!!!1) and here I am reading about a couple of soul-suckers luring prey into their orisons and lacunas, whatever those are? What kind of person willingly gives up everything that has ever mattered to him just to lose himself in a fucking daydream?Except that’s just it. I’m stuck in this hyper-vigilant, wide-awake world where it’s high-octane coffee allthefuckingtime or else Earth implodes on my watch, so I’d super better be watching.About a month ago I got into a fight with this asshole who tried to tell me that I was making too much of things, that “none of this really affects me.” Jesus. AYFKM? I didn’t even know how to respond, partly because I wondered if he were right. What if all this stress, this fear, this expectation of impending doom, is nothing more than a manifestation of my own self-righteousness? Well, you know what? It isn’t. This is my world and my country and my goddam life, and it matters to me so therefore it affects me. And somehow I found the opportunity to distract myself just enough to read this tiny book and you know what? I liked it.

Actually, the second half of this book is great, but still not great enough to resurrect the full work to anywhere beyond its three-star label of mediocrity.Often with mystery novels there is a slow but steady build of intensity, a momentum that gathers in a such a way that the reader remains riveted to the end. That occurs here, as well, so I don’t ascribe my disappointment with the first half of the book to any lack of momentum on its part. Instead, I think I was turned off by the writing. In fact, I’d say that the plot drive in the second half was so well executed that it overcame what I would otherwise have to describe as naïve, whimsical writing. But in the author’s defense, he was (at the time of this book’s initial publication, anyway) a naïve writer. The Other was Thomas Tryon’s first novel, written after having spent much of his early adulthood as a Hollywood film actor.The Other is a frame story, but the identity of the narrator is unknown until the book’s denouement. The story involves two twin boys, one of whom is a vicious evildoer while the other acts as his doe-eyed apostle. Of course, every evil deed performed is accompanied by telling amounts of circumstantial ambiguity so one could probably see “The Big Reveal” coming a mile away, especially if he’s seen enough M. Night Shyamalan films. Still, the reveal (and the events which occur after it) are well executed, as I stated earlier, which makes this book—all being said—ok....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,not set,"Nov 13, 2015","Sep 18, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13414715-the-other

In fact I love every member of that early two-thousands (the decade, not the century) female Saturday Night Live cast ensemble: Poehler, Fey, Rudolph, Dratch.  [image]I often mentally include Kristen Wiig in the mix, too, because she’s fantastic, but she was sort of late to the party, having joined SNL a year before Dratch and Fey left.But as I was saying, I think highly of Poehler. I enjoy her comedy, her intelligence, her personality overall. But I didn’t like this book.To me, Yes Please reads more like a scatterbrained diary than the well-crafted memoir I had been hoping for. Very little of the book seems to have been composed with any forethought; it’s as though Poehler were performing improv in “lit” form. Except while she may be a master of the art on a stage, her improvisational talent doesn’t really migrate to the written page. Her stories meander along without any real segue between them, each having a very “oh and by the way” aspect to it. Maybe it was meant to be random and incoherent but it just didn’t work for me. At one point in the book Poehler mentions her addiction to self-googling, so in many ways I am hoping she doesn’t stumble across this  because I’d hate to imagine her feelings being hurt by it, so maybe it’s best that no one votes for it.In other words, do what you guys normally do....more",Notes are private!,1,400,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2014","Oct 22, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20910157-yes-please

The scope of the discomfort is a bit broader in this Albee play, though. Instead of the focus being solely on the married couple, other bystanders get sucked into the fray. There’s even a slap across the face in one scene, which is something I always get a kick out of. Face-slapping scenes are the best, aren’t they? Sometimes I’ll tune into a soap opera when I’m home sick just to see if any faces are being slapped.I’m not sure who Harry and Edna are meant to represent. Probably they aren’t meant to “represent” anyone and I’m just being overly analytical as usual, but their presence in the play and their bizarre interactions with Agnes and Tobias are just a trifle too…weird…not to possess some sort of subtextual meaning. Plus, with dialogue like “for fear of looking into a mirror” and “our lives are the same,” I had to wonder whether Harry and Edna aren’t mere extensions of Agnes and Tobias themselves.Oh, you were expecting something deeper than that? Sorry, but that’s as far as I got. This ain’t AP English class, kids.I’ll be seeing this play on Broadway next month with some fellow Goodreaders. Glenn Close and John Lithgow will be assuming the roles of Agnes and Tobias. I think Glenn Close will make a great Agnes, too—being subtly antagonistic toward her fellow characters on the one hand while on the other trying to maintain a sense of order in a life that seems to lend itself only to chaos. It’s as though a school of hungry piranhas were threatening to close in on her and it’s her job to prevent a feeding frenzy while simultaneously keeping at bay the anxiety that gnaws at her from within.Tough job....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,"Sep 30, 2014","Jul 17, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/135503.A_Delicate_Balance

In The Winter of our Discontent, Steinbeck once again proves himself a master at the craft of characterization, but whereas in prior novels his protagonists find themselves up against a litany of circumstances beyond their control (but which ultimately dictate their fate), his star character here is a little more sinister. Not to say that this isn’t a fatalistic novel, because it is, but certainly Ethan Allen Hawley takes matters into his own hands a bit more than his Steinbeckian counterparts. Though, maybe that’s the point—that the circumstances of Ethan’s existence are so stacked against him that taking matters into his own hands is Steinbeck’s version of ‘but he had no choice’.I’m not going to write a lot here because it’s my first time ing in a while and my fingers hurt but I did just want to say that I thought this was a really beautiful novel, and I found myself (not surprisingly) drawn to these characters in a way that’s fairly typical of John Steinbeck novels. Ethan’s self-rationalizations after (view spoiler)[exploiting Danny and duping Marullo (hide spoiler)] and the subsequent realizations of his own complicity in Allen’s moral upbringing were themes I found especially poignant....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"Jun 30, 2018","May 16, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56071.The_Winter_of_Our_Discontent

The jacket description of Hamilton’s The Slaves of Solitude mentiOnce again I am guilty of loving a book for what are probably all the wrong reasons. The jacket description of Hamilton’s The Slaves of Solitude mentions an oppression brought on by World War II, a population redistribution into the rooming houses of London’s suburbs (to escape the Blitz, among other things), and a feeling of claustrophobia that results from this migratory shift, bringing strangers from different backgrounds into close proximity but without the sense of relief that a larger city (like London) would otherwise afford its inhabitants. [There were at most one or two “public houses” in these suburban settings. If you needed to get away from your roommate for a few hours you could enter into one of these establishments but there was a good chance your roommate would end up in the same place.] The premise of Slaves takes its cue from this description of wartime Britain and brings us a character whose own stifling experience living in an English boarding house is one we become intimately acquainted with. Except instead of the book being about these English boarding houses or about wartime oppression in suburban London, and even while it mentions these things repeatedly, for me this book was a voyeuristic peep show into the dramatic tribulations of a single middle-aged woman over the course of a two-month period in late 1943.And it was fantastic.It is hard to articulate what it is about a book that qualifies it for me as a “page turner”—whether it’s plot pacing or humor or internal musings that somehow hits the nail right jolly square on the head, I don’t know. But this book has all of those things. It has a slow but steady build to a glorious showdown that left me shaking in empathetic rage and excitement. When Miss Roach wants to punch something (or someone), SO THE FUCK DID I! And when her stomach gets caught in her throat for injustices that she cannnot believe are happening to her, I also could feel my pulse racing, the heat of fury rising to my cheeks. The gall of these people with whom Miss Roach has the unfortunate luck to become associated. Who do they think they are? Their impudence, their self-righteousness, their utter impropriety. We identify with Miss Roach so deeply that we feel each of these outrages personally, acutely. That is the nature of this book that spoke to me. That, along with Roachy’s own sense of self-awareness—she is honest with herself and open to the possibilities of her own faults even while most of us would have difficulty being that way under similar circumstances. Whether the book embraces any larger, overarching context, I have no idea. Nor do I even care! And I do not mean that flippantly; I’m just saying that this book worked well enough for me on a personal level that it could have happened anytime or anywhere—the “wartime-in-Britain’s-suburban-boarding-houses” thing was just a vehicle for the magnificent drama within....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,not set,"May 17, 2014","May 05, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1304697.The_Slaves_of_Solitude

It really is that good.Last week I saw The Grand Budapest Hotel and even though I was majorly disappointed, there was a blurb at the end about how the movie was based on the writings of Stefan Zweig, whom I had heard of but didn’t know a great deal about. Then someone (I forget who) told me that Wes Anderson is a fan of Zweig in general, and that many of his works have been influenced by him in some way—not just Grand Budapest.So I read Chess Story, because...Amazon sale! And I thought it was great. It begins with an idiot savant named Czentovic who becomes a world chess champion despite his inability to maintain a grade school–level conversation with anyone. Czentovic is on a cruise ship to Brazil for reasons I don’t remember exactly but while he’s there he makes the acquaintance of a presumed “layman” who demonstrates surprising chess skill against him. Upon further inquiry by another passenger on the ship (who also happens to be the story’s narrator), the layman reveals his background, which is both fascinating and highly disturbing. This revelation sets the stage for a glorious mental breakdown that had me riveted which if I have to remind you again that this is a story about chess and how can that possibly be riveting, well that just speaks to the vibrancy of Zweig’s writing.After having read Chess Story, I can’t say that I see any obvious connection to Wes Anderson’s characters, nor is any Wes Anderson plotline recognizable in it, but maybe such a connection can be found in other Zweig novels. HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW? But irrespective of this, Chess Story is a perfect little piece of literature....more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,not set,"Apr 06, 2014","Apr 01, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59151.Chess_Story

With the exception, of course, that This Is Water is not a collection of letters, does not discuss poetry or writing, and is not addressed to a single individual but to a college’s entire student body. Other than that, though, they’re pretty much the same thing.What I mean is that there’s something very inspirational (for lack of a better word) in these texts whose words seem to have been composed on-the-fly, were not intended for publication, and are delivered to a person (or to a group of persons) in a manner that is simple and direct, essentially conversational, but which have the unintended consequence of breaking out beyond the scope of the limited audience for which they were intended. Others discover these “gems of life” (ugh, I sound like Mitch Albom now) and they become words of wisdom for the masses.Spoken as the Kenyon College commencement address in 2005, This Is Water is about David Foster Wallace’s assertion that perspective, a necessary absolute in the life of the well-adjusted individual, is a conscious choice (albeit not always an easy one to make), and that the greatest thing we can do for ourselves as humans is to forcibly extricate ourselves from the natural thought-path of viewing every situation as inherently ABOUT MEEE!, which is natural only by the fact that we exist in a perpetual state of self-centric experience—everything that happens to us happens, of course, to us—but which subsequently limits our ability to be happy. I mean there’s something rather lonesome about the “me” perspective, isn’t there?Well, DFW’s argument here is that the ultimate goal of higher education is less about learning how to think than it is about learning the value of the thought process itself, realizing the importance of putting ourselves in one another’s shoes, acquiring an empathetic point-of-view, not just for the benefit of any kind of global betterment (though I suppose that could be a nice secondary effect) but for the benefit of each of us living our mundane, daily lives. Waiting in a excruciatingly slow checkout line, for example, and concluding that the “this sucks FOR ME” attitude, while understandably the default attitude most people would assume in such a circumstance, isn’t the only attitude, and is certainly not the best attitude for maintaining a happy internal disposition. Maybe the line is slow because someone is holding it up with all her coupon scanning, coupons she has been saving out of desperation to make ends meet after the loss of her husband’s job, and maybe if you knew this you’d understand that things are possibly worse off for her than they are for you, and maybe it will seem less of an annoyance that you’ll be home seven minutes later than you had planned to be.I mean it’s also possible the line is slow because the checkout guy is being a complete dumbfuck, but the point is that it is not going to help you by getting upset at how the situation is inconveniencing you. Your overall and long-term happiness depends more on scrambling out of that depressing “it’s all about me” trap which, admittedly is not always possible to do, than it does on satisfying your immediate need to get out of the checkout line as soon as possible....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,"Mar 30, 2014","Mar 30, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5986375-this-is-water

And yet maybe I am becoming one because after reading this book I want as much of this centripetal gravity, atmospheric pressure regulating bullshit as I can get.Weir’s book is about a Mars reconnaissance mission gone wrong, a mission for which a two-month visit could turn into two years for crewmember Mark Watney. Watney is inadvertently abandoned by his team during a dust storm that forces them to abort their mission early. Survival skills come into play here, as well as science and engineering—MacGyver on Mars! And the science is great. It is a reminder that there is more to it than undatable dudes in orthodontic headgear blowing shit up in erlenmeyer flasks (though it certainly can be that if that’s your thing). There is a logistical nature to the science that just warms my cockles: how to recreate a growing environment for crop sustainability, how to manipulate atmospheric gases for water reclamation. AND MUCH, MUCH MORE.Andy Weir is a scientist. Actually I don’t know what he does, nor do I know a single thing about him, but he has to be. It is impossible for someone to have written this book and not be a scientist. The only thing I know about him is that he self-published this book two years ago and on account of some great success he had on Amazon, his book was picked up earlier this year by a subsidiary of Random House, the biggest publisher on Earth. So that’s cool.And it’s also understandable. This book combines all of the technical details needed to explain Watney’s attempts to survive on Mars until rescue with the kind of humor that somehow grounds it all, allowing us to relate to Watney—irrespective of our never having had to fight for our lives on an abandoned planet—with a huggable sense of humanity. Because yes, I often did want to hug Watney. At one point, after NASA tells him he can begin drilling (in an attempt to modify a rover for long-range transport), he replies: “That’s what she said.” Seriously, who says something like that to NASA? You can picture them all back at Ground Control tapping their pens against their orthodontic headgear in nervousness, completely at a loss as to how to respond. If I am ever facing a situation I have little chance of surviving, I hope that I too would have enough perspective to whip out an LGM joke here and there. Because why not?I learned recently that Ridley Scott of Blade Runner fame will be directing a movie adaptation of this book starring Matt Damon, scheduled for release next year.

However, that doesn’t mean that I haven’t bumped into poems here or there that have affected me somehow, and it is usually (which is the thing about poetry, I think) not what the poem is about per se so much as it is about how it makes you feel. Which then circles back to my point about not being overwhelmed by it in general because that part of me that is supposed to be susceptible to the feeeeeeling of poetry is, clinically speaking, 90% necrotic.But as I said there are exceptions. One of my favorite poems, for example, is T. S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” which even to this day I quote sections of to myself from time to time because it really is just that awesome. Of course, admitting that may out me as a mere commoner—“Prufrock” is a highly popular poem, after all. So next I’ll mention a more obscure poem, something I read once in high school and I loved it so much (for whatever reason) that I memorized it, which maybe isn’t that big of a deal because it’s a short poem, but it was a big deal to me because, remember? Necrosis.The threefold terror of love; a fallen flareThrough the hollow of an ear;Wings beating about the room;The terror of all terrors that I boreThe Heavens in my womb.Had I not found content among the showsEvery common woman knows,Chimney corner, garden walk,Or rocky cistern where we tread the clothesAnd gather all the talk?What is this flesh I purchased with my pains,This fallen star my milk sustains,This love that makes my heart's blood stopOr strikes a Sudden chill into my bonesAnd bids my hair stand up?                    —W. B. Yeats, “The Mother of God”I actually read a lot of Yeats poetry during that time of my life and I even went to check out his grave in Sligo when I lived in Ireland, which I realize sounds rather morbid but I swear it’s a thing and people really do it.Sorry for that long intro, but the reason I’m writing this  is because Love & Misadventure, a book of poetry by someone named Lang Leav, has been popping up on my feed a lot lately. It is one of the highest user-rated books of poetry on all of Goodreads, right up there alongside Emily Dickinson and William Shakespeare (whose poems I’ve also enjoyed, by the way) and so I thought maybe I should check it out.I played it smart, though, by searching online for her material which, thank god I did because I would have been massively irritated if I had wasted $7.69 on this crap (the price of a Kindle edition), let alone on one of the first-edition signed copies which are going for over $300 on Amazon.So here’s some Lang Leav for ya...decide for yourself if you think I’m being unfair:There is a love I reminisce,          like a seed          I’ve never sown.Of lips that I am yet to kiss,          and eyes not met          my own.Hands that wrap around my wrists,          and arms          that feel like home.I wonder how it is I miss          these things          I’ve never known.                    —Lang Leav, “A Stranger”Ack! But oh good lord there’s more:Before I fell          in love with words;          with setting skies          and singing birds—          it was you I fell          in love with first.                    —Lang Leav, “First Love”If I wasn’t necrotic before, somebody please begin the amputation before I so septic on your asses. Here’s another:There was a time I told you,          of all that ached inside;          the things I held so sacred,          to all the world I’d hide.But they became your weapons,          and slowly I have learnt,          the less that is said the better,          the lesser I’ll be hurt.Of all you’ve used against me,          the worse has been my words.There are things I’ll never tell you,          and it is sad to think it so;          the more you come to know me—          the lesser you will know.                    —Lang Leav, “Poker Face”I feel like she spends more time working on her margins and tabs than she does on the poetry. Didn’t Lady Gaga do a way better job with this material?So then I was wondering how something that to me seems so transparently saccharine could be so highly regarded. And that is when I came across this:[image][image]That is a screenshot of Lang Leav’s personal tumblr blog, and if you have trouble reading the text there, this is what it says: “Competition time!
