Moody, a preacher during the 1800s.I’m intrigued by Daniel. He was uprooted from his home, country, and religion as a young boy and yet he is so grounded in his faith, that even when immersed in a life of idol worship, he is still solely devoted to the one true God. This book would be a great one to go through with your kids. It’s a book to be read with your Bible open so you can consult back and forth.*this book doesn’t include anything about the prophecies of Daniel in the last chapters.QUOTES FROM THE BOOK“And God will exalt us also when the right time comes. We don’t need to try to promote ourselves; we don’t need to struggle for position. Let God put us in our true places. It is better for a man to be right with God, even if he holds no position down here. Then he can look up and know that God is pleased with him. That is enough.”“(Daniel 2:28) Daniel took his place as a nobody; he himself was nothing. He did not wish the king to think highly of him. That is the very highest type of devotion – when a man hides himself out of the way, and seeks to exalt his God and lift up his redeemer, not himself.”“Remember, no man can be true to God and live for Him without at sometime or other being unpopular in this world. Those men who try to live for both worlds fail miserably, for at some time or other the collision is sure to come.”“Aren’t there some of us who have so little backbone that we would have counseled these three to just bow down a little, so that no one would notice – to merely bow down, but not to worship?”“He would rather be in the lions’ den with God than out of it without Him.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 14, 2024","Mar 21, 2024","Mar 14, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41555621-daniel-man-of-god

It seems this book series is everywhere I look and I LOVE their classic covers in macaron colors.What’s so special about them, you may ask? I’ve only read this one so far, but Emma’s journals are witty, smart, and as unhinged as a girl in 1883 London could be. She’s unique! And so are all her friends and enemies and her house and especially her town! (Is there some magical realism going on in this book?)The book is super short and it’s clearly just a set up— it’s as if we are reading Emma’s journal as she writes it. I’m seeing so many fun possibilities of romance and adventure.I would say it’s a feistier Downton Abbey, though obviously not the same time setting.

But I guess the reader just sounds an awfully lot like the actress.)A fourth of the way in I got confused and wondered if I’d missed something. I researched and read a quote of someone calling parts of the book a “puzzle,” so I got excited. Some of this book is a puzzle indeed!The story is told in a unique way, so that the reader is unsure of what the true story actually IS. There is a lot about finance/stock that flew over my head, but what I loved was the depth of the writing, the story told from different perspectives, the themes of our priorities in this fleeting life, and the ending. I’ll include the quotes below and in the comments so you can read some for yourself!Barely any mature content. A little profanity. I think you will like this if you like profound literary books like Steinbeck or Ishiguro. I think a good movie comparison is The Father with Anthony Hopkins for tone, not subject matter. That’s a great movie by the way! Quotes below and in comments.Intimacy can be an unbearable burden for those who, first experiencing it after a lifetime of proud self-sufficiency, suddenly realize it makes their world complete. Finding bliss becomes one with the fear of losing it. Silence between two is always shared, but one of the two owns it, and shares it with the other.My job is about being right. Always. If I’m ever wrong, I must make use of all my means and resources to bend and align reality according to my mistake so that it ceases to be a mistake.I know the days ahead of me are fewer than those I have left behind. There is no escaping this most basic fact of accounting. A certain amount of time is allotted to each of us. How much, only God knows. We cannot invest it. We cannot hope for a return of any kind. All we can do is spend it, second by second, decade by decade, until it runs out. Still, even if our days on this Earth are limited, we can always, through toil and industry, hope to extend our influence into the future. And so it is that, having lived my life with an eye set on posterity in the hopes of improving the lives of later generations, I enter these remaining years of mine not with nostalgia for all that is gone but with a sense of excitement for what is yet to come.She was unable to stop thinking about her thoughts.

PACKER⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️FIVE STAR READThis book is considered a Christian classic, and now I understand why. Each chapter seems devoted toKNOWING GOD BY J.I. PACKER⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️FIVE STAR READThis book is considered a Christian classic, and now I understand why. Each chapter seems devoted to a separate theological subject, but they are definitely woven together and address the same themes. What are the themes, you may ask? I would say the dual nature of God is a definite theme. Packer explores the wrath of God, how God is a judge, and how God’s goodness is displayed right along with his severity in the Bible. See the quote below that describes how we are to understand God based on what the Bible says, not on what we think God should be. Another theme is wisdom. In his chapters on guidance, wisdom, and the Holy Spirit, Packer puts forth a view of God’s guidance that is very different from our culture’s habit of praying for feelings and peace to guide us toward God’s specific, narrow path. And of course, a theme is KNOWING GOD. How do we truly know him? Jeremiah 9:23 says “Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches, but let him who boasts boast about this: that he understands and knows me.” Below are a few of the many quotes I jotted down from this amazing book. On the subject of how our God is called jealous:  “The first step in answering this question is to make it clear that this is not a case of imagining anything. Were we imagining a God, then, naturally, we should ascribe to him only characteristics that we admire, and jealousy would not enter the picture. Nobody would imagine a jealous God. But we are not making up an idea of God, by drawing on our own imagination; we are seeking instead to listen to the words of holy scripture, in which God himself tells us the truth about himself.” (Other quotes in comments.) On the subject of why do we study theology: “…to be preoccupied with getting theological knowledge as an end to itself, to approach Bible study with no higher a motive than a desire to know all the answers, is the direct route to a state of self-satisfied self-deception. We need to guard our hearts against such an attitude, and pray to be kept from it.”  “… [a mistake that is commonly made] to suppose, in other words, that the gift of wisdom consists in a deepened insight into the providential meaning and purpose of events going on around us, an ability to see why God has done what he has done in a particular case and what he is going to do next. People feel that if they were really walking close to God, so that he could impart wisdom to them freely, then they would, so to speak, find themselves in a signal box; they would discern the real purpose of everything that happened to them, and it would be clear to them every moment how God was making all things work together for good.” “’Our thoughts of God are too human,’ said Martin Luther… Our thoughts of God are not great enough; we fail to reckon with the reality of his limitless wisdom and power. Because we ourselves are limited and weak, we imagine that at some points God is too, and find it hard to believe that he is not. We think of God as too much like what we are.”...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 10, 2024","Mar 05, 2024","Feb 10, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/139855.Knowing_God

The Letter for the King would make a perfect read aloud for any age, though it may take a while at 500 pages. This protagonist is one you can let your kid aspire to be. He’s strong, smart, and above all, he’s just so good.I can’t remember who told me to read this Dutch classic! This edition with the metallic letters and the snow is so pretty. I don’t read sequels but I may read this next one! The two others are The Secrets of the Wild Wood and The Song of Seven. They are in the same Pushkin Children’s Book series and they match this one.I tried to watch the Netflix series adaptation of this book but I couldn’t do it.

Jiles wrote three books: News of the World, Simon the Fiddler, and Chenneville (in that order) and they aren’t a series, they’re “companion” books, and I read them in the wrong order. Simon the Fiddler is next for me.Chenneville is a western novel (see my last reel on my defense of westerns!) and the synopsis gives away too much of the book! Don’t read it. The story is about a wounded civil war soldier who comes home to find it different than he left it, so he embarks on a journey of “murder, loss, and vengeance,” as the tag line says.A civil war soldier on a journey, his isolation and despair, his adventures along the way, all are reminiscent of the classic Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier, which is not a favorite of mine. You might say Chenneville is “Warm Valley.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 13, 2023","Nov 16, 2023","Nov 13, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/112975135-chenneville

So I’m just not watching much television (or when I do, it’s All Creatures Great and Small!) and I’m reading BOOKS LIKE THIS ONE.I loved it. It’s the story of two girls growing up in the 40s. If you are looking for a suspenseful read, this isn’t it. It’s not edgy. It’s how these girls were impacted by McCarthyism, grief, and just growing up. One is a girly, precocious reader, one is a confident baseball player. The writing shines in its simplicity and slipped me completely into the mindset of what life was like as a kid during that era.Things I loved about this book: It’s written by a Christian author but nothing felt forced about the story, the author didn’t insert 2023 ideals into 1940s characters, the author showed how girls can be girls in many different ways (some more girly and some more masculine), the relationships and situations weren’t sugar sweet—I loved how subtle the love was between the family members.I would compare this to one of my favorites, The Boston Girl by Anita Diamant, and if you liked Tom Hanks’ A League of Their Own, you will love this one. The audio was great too—I especially loved the reader for Bertha. Honestly, I just smiled through this whole thing.Read it! Look at that red cover! It’s beautiful.

The setting: a dilapidated mansion in 1940s England. The characters: the family who live in the house and a country doctor who befriends them. Except the house becomes a major character too!It’s a slow, creepy, gothic, story on the surface, but when it’s done, there is so much more to examine.It reads just like an old classic. It is so hard to believe it was written in 2009. I could. Not. Put. It. Down. Though when I revisit that, I’m struck by how slow the story is? So I don’t know why I was so caught up in it, and I hesitate to assure you that you will feel the same!As far as mature content, there is just fright. There are a few curse words written with a dash in the way of old classic books! There are a few sentences of an awkward love scene, barely worth mentioning. I couldn’t wait to read more of Sarah Waters books, but I discovered they are all LGBTQ suspense/romances, which isn’t a genre I want to read.Books and movies The Little Stranger reminded of: the movie The Others, Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle, du Maurier’s Rebecca maybe, Lockheart’s We Were LiarsI  books on Instagram @read.fine.print...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 20, 2023","Oct 26, 2023","Oct 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40672569-the-little-stranger

Trust me, it is easy to read and doesn’t seem like a book written so long ago. The author is so passionate that I teared up many times as I read.Each chapter is a separate subject with titles like:Sin— “We may depend upon it, men will never come to Jesus, and stay with Jesus, and live for Jesus— unless they really know why they are to come, and what their need truly is.”Counting the Cost— “Now let us make this serious inquiry: What does your Christianity cost? Very likely it cost you nothing. Very probably it neither cost you trouble, nor time, nor thought, nor care… Such a religion as this will never save your soul. It will never give you peace while you live, nor hope while you die… A religion which cost nothing is worth nothing!”The Ruler of the Waves— “Had my savior been God only, I might perhaps, have trusted him, but I never could have come near to him without fear. Had my savior been man only, I might have loved him, but I never could have felt sure that he was able to take away my sins. But my Savior is God as well as man and man as well as God. God, and able to deliver me; man, and so able to feel with me. All mighty power and deepest sympathy are met together in one glorious person, Jesus Christ, my Lord.”I’ve thought about different aspects of this book every day since I read it. I’m sad that I can’t find a prettier hardback of this because I know I will reread and buy a copy for both my kids. However it doesn’t matter what copy you read, I suggest you just find one and read it!...more",Notes are private!,1,3,1,"Sep 25, 2023","Sep 25, 2023","Sep 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38580433-holiness

His “science” is just hard enough to be cool, just easy enough to grasp. The “science” in this one was hard. I kept reading though, and I never wanted to quit. I had to know what happened!

Until the absolute worst happens.There are occasional curse words, including the f word, a couple sex scenes that are not descriptive. Some more thoughts on the theme— it’s dangerous to think about the many possible ways your life could’ve ended up. God wasn’t mentioned in this book but the idea that He has an ultimate plan for our lives (He does, Psalm 33:11) vs. how He made us with free will… well, these concepts sometimes battle in our brains, right? Ultimately, I know He wants me to pray for wisdom (James 1:5), I’ll face consequences when I do wrong (Romans 6:23, Galatians 6:7), and that even though I can’t comprehend it—he CREATED time. For him there is no time (2 Peter 3:8-9.) Beyond these biblical concepts, it’s hard to know.It’s hard to imagine what kind of God He would be if it was easy to understand. He made me and he made my brain! If I could grasp all the ways God worked, then He wouldn’t be God.

I won’t forget the perspective it gave me of drug addicts and prisoners and single moms just scraping to get by. I was saddened at the many ways the author sought peace. She speaks of improving her self-esteem and finding her identity in something other than the crimes she committed, which are good lessons to learn, but ultimately I hope she can find her identity in the fact that she is made in the image of Christ.

I've read Bel Canto, Commonwealth, The Dutch House, and this one, Tom Lake. All are so beautifully written--elegant, simple yet piercing (see quotes in the comments.) I loved The Dutch House. I liked Tom Lake.As they work a cherry field during the 2020 pandemic, farm wife Lara tells her three adult daughters about her past relationship with a celebrity. My favorite part of this book was the Covid aspect, believe it or not! I remember 2020 the way Lara experienced it-- the rest of the world falling apart, and me somehow capturing time in a bottle with my college kid home again.I loved the cherry farm setting, the family, the alternate setting of Tom Lake where she met the celebrity they are all fascinated with. But as much as I related to the position Lara was in, somehow I don't think I grasped who she truly was. She shares her actions in her past, but many times I couldn't understand her motives. The things she does seem purposeless. She just flowed with whatever circumstance came her way, as if she had no agency at all. A scene towards the end of the book seals the deal for me-- who is Lara? Wow. I have no idea.Maybe some will argue that was the point? If so, then I guess I can say I didn't like her character very much.Comparisons: if you like Tom Lake, I know you will like Back When We Were Grownups by Anne Tyler. Rebecca is also a woman looking back at her past. Another comparison would be the movie Splendor in the Grass.

She grows up in a Colorado peach orchard in the 1940s, she experiences love, heartache, family trials, and all the hardship of owning a farm in the brutal Colorado climate. I didn’t read the synopsis before diving into this one, and I’m glad I didn’t, so I won’t tell you any details either. Just know the writing is superb! Wow. I’ll put a few quotes below.I loved this book for the story and the descriptions. I didn’t feel like I knew the main character as well as I would have liked and there were long parts of the story where nothing happened. As I peruse the book now, I realize most of the story takes place in the first half. I guess I need a conversation now and then to keep me interested! I had to intentionally resist skimming nature descriptions if they weren’t peppered with a character’s thoughts or actions. But despite those minor aggravations, this will definitely be a memorable book for me and I think so many of you will love it too! Because of the rich descriptions of nature, life, and love, I would compare this book to Where the Crawdads Sing, though I didn’t care for that one as much as many of you do. Also maybe The Great Alone? As far as mature content, there is sex but it is not very descriptive, curse words but not very many.   Just as a single rainstorm can erode the banks and change the course of a river, so can a single circumstance of a girl’s life erase who she was before. Go As a River quote: I couldn’t fathom it then, standing there suspended by his gaze, but I would come to learn that Wilson Moon didn’t experience time the way most people do, or few things for that matter, He never rushed or fiddled nervously or found a length of silence between two people an awkward vessel to fill with chatter. Go As a River quote: He rarely looked to the future, and to the past even less, but gathered up the current moment in both hands to admire its particulars, with no apology and no sense it should be otherwise. Go As a River quote: How does one live for seventeen years without ever considering whether she is known?...more",Notes are private!,1,5,1,"Jul 10, 2023","Jul 24, 2023","Jul 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63922274-go-as-a-river

In this book, Jinger intentionally didn’t use the word “deconstruction, she described her re-examination of her faith as a “disentangling.”Jinger’s parents followed the teachings of a man named Bill Gothard, and though the foundation of their faith was based on biblical teachings, Gothard had added many more rules and strict teachings to the Duggar’s idea of Christian faith. Some may say what Gothard leads is a cult. In this book, Jinger shares how she studied God’s Word to disentangle herself from these false teachings.I have so much respect for Jinger! It took courage and wisdom to study the Bible further instead of throwing away her faith along with the Pharasaical teachings of her past.

When I read your books, I think harder than I’ve ever thought before. A few times in this one (if I grasped what you were saying correctly) I THINK I disagreed with you! But maybe not.What is pain? What is love? If God loves us why do we have pain? Why do bad things happen to good people? You answered these questions so thoroughly and honestly! I’m so glad I didn’t give up attempting to understand you. I forced myself to keep reading even when I didn’t grasp every part, and then you would blow my mind with something. The deal is, now we are so accustomed to quick quotes, memes, tweets— this is not you. You take me on a journey of thought that is hard for me to explain to others once I’m done.Thanks for the memories, Clive. Can I call you Clive? Maybe not. I’ll stick with C.S. Since technically I don’t know you well. Out of your 25 or so works, I’ve only read 5. I plan to change that. I wonder which one is your favorite?Sincerely, MistyP.S I know you probably don’t care, but here are some of my favorite parts of your pain book. I guess sometimes you ARE quotable! (Continued in the comments.)We can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word ""love"", and look on things as if man were the centre of them. Man is not the centre. God does not exist for the sake of man. Man does not exist for his own sake. ""Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."" We were made not primarily that we may love God (though we were made for that too) but that God may love us, that we may become objects in which the divine love may rest ""well pleased"".We are, not metaphorically but in very truth, a Divine work of art, something that God is making, and therefore something with which He will not be satisfied until it has a certain character. Here again we come up against what I have called the “intolerable compliment.” Over a sketch made idly to amuse a child, an artist may not take much trouble: he may be content to let it go even though it is not exactly as he meant it to be. But over the great picture of his life—the work which he loves, though in a different fashion, as intensely as a man loves a woman or a mother a child—he will take endless trouble—and would doubtless, thereby give endless trouble to the picture if it were sentient. One can imagine a sentient picture, after being rubbed and scraped and re-commenced for the tenth time, wishing that it were only a thumb-nail sketch whose making was over in a minute. In the same way, it is natural for us to wish that God had designed for us a less glorious and less arduous destiny; but then we are wishing not for more love but for less.We want not so much a Father but a grandfather in heaven, a God who said of anything we happened to like doing, 'What does it matter so long as they are contented?...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 16, 2023","May 29, 2023","May 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13650513-the-problem-of-pain

We read Christian classic books, apologetics, and Christian parenting. Next on our list is The Problem of Pain by C.S. Lewis! In his book Family Driven Faith: Doing What it Takes to Raise Sons and Daughters Who Walk With God, Voddie Baucham lays out what happened after he and his wife reached a point where they felt they were too busy, too pre-occupied, and hadn’t been prioritizing God in their daily lives. I love how they became so intentional about what activities their children did, what they studied, and what they did at church. As we raise our kids, are we worshipping the gods of academics? Sports? Worldly success? I gleaned a lot from the author’s wisdom in raising his family. I enjoyed seeing the picture he paints of his family—their morning and night family worship times, their home schooling, their family-integrated church. I have many things I would do differently if my kids were little and I was starting all over. BUT, the family model he describes is one type of family model. I think at times he veered into an attitude that if you want your kids to grow up into adults who are used by God daily, you must follow his instructions perfectly. You must make the same decisions he has made. He had many things to say about churches and student ministries and so many of those things are very difficult for a family to change. He proposes “family-integrated church,” but what if that type of church isn’t available to you? Sometimes it seemed like his model worked perfectly only for a perfect family. I recommend this book, because it made me think. That’s the ultimate goal when we read!  I have great respect for the author. But frequently I did not reach the same conclusions the author did when it came to solutions to problems facing Christian families today.

First of all, I want to mention I listened to it as an audio book and the reader, Caroline Lee, is the best reader I have ever listened to. She has a beautiful Australian accent and she does individual voices without it being distracting in any way. Usually I listen to audio books out of convenience, but in this case I think the book was actually enhanced by the reader.The book alternates between events that took place after the barbecue and events that took place the day of the barbecue. The event was a turning point in all their lives, but the reader doesn't understand why until about half way through the book. At one point I got really tired of not knowing what happened at the barbecue. I felt like the author took it too far, because I was beyond curious or interested, I was almost annoyed. Then after I found out about the barbecue I thought the book slowed quite a bit due to lack of suspense. I decided the book was just ""okay.""Then as the book went on, and I thought it was going to be over several times because it seemed ""wrapped up"" to me, the longer it went the more I enjoyed it. One of the themes that the book accentuates in the end is, ""I choose my marriage."" There is a conversation between a husband and wife (I don't want to give anything away) where they both ""choose their marriage,"" and the conversation is the most poignant little conversation but it exemplifies all that a marriage should be: fun, silly, yet intentional, and hard.The characters are so memorable. I loved them all but my favorite is Vid, a loud boisterous Russian man whose outlook on life is positive and enthusiastic. I identified most with the character of Clementine, who is a little free-spirited and able to cruise through life easily, and sometimes has a hard time realizing others take things a little harder. But I also loved Tiffany, and Sam... anyway I guess I liked them all.There are many issues addressed in this novel, through the various characters and their vastly different lives, so I learned a lot. Hoarding, stripping, cello playing, infertility, CPR, and foster parenting to name a few, but parenting in general is probably the main theme. As an author I might be afraid to include so many issues in one novel, but Moriarty does it seamlessly. There is unnecessary profanity in this book (is it ever necessary?) and her curse word of choice is the f-word. I did tire of hearing it but to me somehow the quality of the writing overshadows the language.I have now read What Alice Forgot and Truly Madly Guilty by Moriarty and in both books she captures marriage so well. It's hard, and it's work, but it's not restraining. She paints a picture of marriage as something that must be allowed to grow and blossom before it can be fully appreciated. Now I plan to read all of her books. I see life through the same lens as Liane Moriarty and I'm positive we would be good friends if we could only meet and get to know each other. I will work on that.Quote I want to remember: You can jump so much higher when you have somewhere safe to fall....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Mar 20, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27831371-truly-madly-guilty

I have no memory of who told me to read it, but whoever it was (was it you?!) they didn’t know how much I hate profanity in books! This book has a lot, especially in the intense moments of the book, and there are a lot of intense moments. I really hate that media now is so filled with f words. It’s become a norm!So all that said, wow did I love this book. (See my stories for more ruminations on why this book receives mostly four stars.) The cover gives the impression of a thriller? But it is so much more, and maybe not even suspenseful enough to be called a thriller? I don’t even know. I feel like I just exited a roller coaster that also allowed me to stop and see some peaceful, amazing views. And what sticks in my mind are the views, and not the suspense. Here are some quotes that don’t give anything away about the plot.“They, mother and son, are a zipper, slowly separating as the years rush by.” “He (her son) isn’t something made, he isn’t an object. Here he is, right in front of her, telling her who he is, and she’s let her own insecurities about being stupid turn his intellectualism into something to be laughed off. Laughed at.” There is so much tenderness in this book about motherhood. Motherhood guilt, hopes and dreams for our kids, learning how to parent our kids that are becoming adults. I teared up numerous times. The time travel plot allows a unique glimpse into motherhood—and also marriage!-- that got me right in the heart.“With no idea of the bullet she’s just dodged; there but for the . . . We only think of the bad things that happen, rather than those that, through fortune, pass us by.” “How segmented life is. It splits so easily into friendships and addresses and life phases that feel endless but never, never last. Wearing suits. Dragging a changing bag around. Falling in love.”The quotes above reflect the depth of the book and I’m trying to tell you this without giving away any of what happens. The plot is intricate but I had no problem keeping up on audio. There are so many twists and turns in this roller coaster which I also LOVED.It is interesting how in one of those quotes the author leaves off before saying grace of God. The author says “fate” in this story where I insert “God’s hand,” but believers become adept at doing this in our culture today. The truth of that statement says so much about God though—we daily notice the illness, the death, the depression, when we brush right by healing, new life, contentment. And if you had an editor edit out all the f words, the only mature content left would be a few crass moments—no descriptive sex. I know this isn’t a consolation to those of you who, like me, can’t stand the profanity! I felt this one was way worth the push through, but you will have to decide for yourself. I hate that maybe one of my favorites of the year is one I will always have to back with, “but the language is terrible.” It seems that is what will be....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 06, 2023","Feb 13, 2023","Feb 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59947696-wrong-place-wrong-time

It greatly impacted my thoughts on God, our bodies, culture’s view of our bodies and gender/sexual issues. I had some thoughts before I read it. Maybe you are having these same thoughts:THE TITLE SOUNDS LIKE IT’S ABOUT LOVING YOURSELF?It is not about loving yourself, in the typical way we see this idea. It’s about how we should value our bodies because God created us.THIS BOOK LOOKS LIKE A DIFFICULT READ?It is. And it’s not a short read, but I have thought about the concepts in this book every day since I read it. It has literally reshaped how I think about many issues.I NEED A BRIEF SUMMARY SO I’LL KNOW WHAT I’M GETTING INTO.Ok, here’s the premise: Popular culture today views our bodies through a dualistic lens. They separate our bodies—our physical body—from who we are spiritually/emotionally/mentally. From hook-up culture to abortion to gender, many pretend the body can be detached from who the person actually is. God made our bodies to be one with our whole person, and He made us exactly how we are. See what I mean? It’s not an easy concept to explain. Now you see why it took Nancy Pearcey a few pages to do it.WHAT’S WITH THE PICTURE ON THE FRONT?I don’t know.

They talked about James’ intention with The Turn of the Screw, how he wanted it to be unsettling and it allowed the reader to interpret the story for himself.So… it seems Henry James did exactly what he intended! I especially enjoyed noting how plot lines and settings in this 1898 book paved the way for so many gothic movies and books today. It could be said that he shaped the way we sense fear. This book isn’t a favorite, but I do enjoy a good deep dive into a book’s meaning and author intent....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 20, 2022","Oct 20, 2022","Oct 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12948.The_Turn_of_the_Screw

Marcellus is a Giant Pacific Octopus who lives in an aquarium where Tova is a cleaner. Tova is a widow still in grief over the death of her son, and the book also follows Cameron, Tova’s total opposite, a young man who can’t keep a job or a girl but how did I end up liking him so much? And then there’s Ethan… and the cast of characters reminds me a little of a few of Backman’s books. It is heartwarming and sweet like his books, but it has a little mystery too. One of the characters happens to be an octopus. Did you know how smart GPOs are?! I didn’t either! But since reading this book I have watched many youtube videos on them and what this author writes about is not a far stretch of the imagination. For mature content, there are some curse words. I would compare this book to A Man Called Ove, The Authenticity Project, and as far as movies… you know those animal movies that revolve around a sweet dog or something? This isn’t like that.

I’ve read Rebecca McLaughlin’s “10 Questions Every Teen Should Ask and Answer About Christianity” (uses Harry Potter and other illustrations to help teens grasp spiritual truths) and I want to read her books “The Secular Creed” and “Confronting Jesus: 9 Encounters with the Hero of the Gospels.”This book asks twelve confrontational questions about Christianity. (I’ll post the questions in the comments.) The questions are about a range of issues like slavery, suffering, sexuality, and taking the Bible literally. I felt like the book found its stride near the middle, though maybe that’s just because I was more interested in those particular subjects. I was captivated by the last two chapters— on suffering and hell.McLaughlin confronts the question of why God allows suffering by taking the reader step by step through the story of Lazarus being raised by the dead. These words were so powerful: “Martha longs to have Lazarus back. But Jesus looks her in the eyes and says, ‘I am the resurrection and the life.’ As you stand here in your desperate grief, your greatest need is not to have your brother back again. It’s to have me.’ … The question we must always ask of suffering is this: What could possibly be worth it? Jesus’ flabbergasting claim is that he is.”Whoa. Good stuff. This book is scholarly and sometimes hard to grasp, but more than once my eyes pricked tears at the author’s words. I hope the ladies in the book club were able to finish it!

As it described the theft of the violin and the possibilities of who took it, it reads like a mystery suspense book, but indeed it really isn’t. The rest of the book is back story, and it’s actually the story of a man’s experiences as one of the few Black men playing classical violin. His family is against him, everyone is against him, yet he perseveres. He learns to play the violin very, very well despite racism and just haters in general, the book describes numerous concerts and classes where he plays, and eventually—you guessed it—his violin is stolen.  I found the parts about the violin interesting! I’ve always been fascinated by Stadivarius (Stradivari?) violins and the discovery of this one is fun to watch. I felt like the characters were a bit one dimensional, and I guessed the thief very early on so that always makes me feel like I’m smarter than the people in the book. I enjoyed the pieces of music at first, but after a while the many concerts got monotonous. There is profanity in this one for sure but it isn’t overwhelming. As far as comparisons I don’t know?

It’s broken up into those conversations and some letters that Brother Lawrence wrote.•I read this in college and all these years I’ve continued to think regularly about the way Brother Lawrence worshipped God even as he went about doing mundane chores. This short little book about Lawrence’s devotion to God made an impression on me as a college student, and when I read it again it made the same impression on me as an adult.•Tozer (I’ll post about his book The Pursuit of God tomorrow) explores the topic of secular versus sacred, and that is what Brother Lawrence spoke of too: a life so full of worship of God, that there is no break between the secular and sacred. Not worship BETWEEN your thoughts of laundry and errands, worship IN THE MIDDLE of it all— your love for others and God so entwined in your actions and words that it all becomes worship. Brother Lawrence grasped so well Tozer’s “inward gaze upon God” and I, too, seek to gaze upon Him throughout my day, no matter what I’m doing.•Quotes: We ought not to be weary of doing little things for the love of God, who regards not the greatness of the work, but the love with which it is performed.•He has bestowed on you, in the midst of your troubles to take solace in Him as often as you can.

One need not cry out very loudly; He is nearer to us than we think.Let us occupy ourselves entirely in knowing God. The more we know Him, the more we will desire to know Him. As love increases with knowledge, the more we know God, the more we will truly love Him.

Mira ends up in a car with four other strangers, on a long trip, in a storm. I had to keep reading through thoughts of, “Would Allie Jane ever do this?

These strangers could all be crazy!” And sure enough, it ends up, SOMEONE IN THE CAR IS CRAZY.•But I could not figure out who. I thought it was a good mystery!
