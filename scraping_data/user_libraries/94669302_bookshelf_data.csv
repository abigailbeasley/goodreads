I decided to find some other works of hers, and on picking this - I expected such same experience from her best-known work, but I was disappointed, several times I wanted to abandon it but kept reading I had to finish it, always expecting something might happen, an action, a surprise. But nothing!On one hand, the characters are very well built and believable, the novel makes a good portrait and criticism of the New York society of the last quarter of the 19th century. Also, it has refined and beautiful writing, lofty (but not pathetic) language, and is also very sensitive.Apart from that, I thought there was something off about the whole book and I couldn’t point out what exactly. I found the conclusion very disappointing, although I honestly don’t know what kind of an ending would make me think again about this book.

I'm looking forward to read every other book he's written.Here is my favourite passage;""You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns and steel plating half a foot thick: you come at them unmenscingly on your own ten toes instead of tearing up the turf with your caterpillar treads, take them on with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the ""brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them, while you're anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of ""other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on instead a significance that is ludicrous, so ill-equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? Is everyone to go off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely writers do, in a soundproof cell, summoning people out of words and then proposing that these word people are closer to the real thing than the real people that we mangle with our ignorance every day? The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway, it's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know we're alive we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you can do that-well, lucky you.""...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Nov 05, 2021","Nov 09, 2021","Jul 23, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/386378.American_Pastoral

ShIn this slim volume, Ayn Rand de-mysticizes writing and maintains that writing is a rational sphere governed by rationally identifiable principles. She says, ""What you need for nonfiction writing is what you need for life in general: an orderly method of thinking.”She goes on to provide a clear guide to the process of writing from choosing a subject and theme to creating an outline, first draft, and editing. One of the most interesting parts was her psychological analysis on the different roles played by the conscious mind and the subconscious in the process of writing i.e writing under the direction of the subconscious and then later consciously edit it. Also, how thinking objectively can help in problem-solving and performing complex tasks i.e by considering the epistemology and psycho-epistemology aspects of the mind.A short and quite insightful book that will help one become a better thinker and hence a better writer....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 07, 2021","Jul 04, 2021","Jun 05, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2112.The_Art_of_Nonfiction

The book is tiny less than 200 pages but it has taken me almost two weeks to finish it.The character of Oedipa Maas will stay with me for a long time, I thought she’s by far the most interesting female character I read in a long time. Always finding patterns and assigning meanings through series of coincidences. The other characters names are nothing short ludicrous I mean how on earth does someone names a male figure Mucho Maas, Dr Hilarious, Pierce Inverarity, a rock band The Paranoids? Just to mention some.Pychon uses a sort of magical lucidity akin to a psychedelic trip to paint Oedipa's journey in such a confusing story filled with unusual coincidences, places, symbols, relationship in so many layers which are subject to many interpretations. But his descriptions feel alive, it is as if he's not really speaking about things of this world but rather some sort of mirror image with dark, sort of magical ominous undertones to it. I didn't even know how to distinguish important details but I surely had a great time with it.Do you want answers? A clearly defined plot with direction and clarity? A satisfying conclusion? If yes, then you won't like this book. This book is cryptic and mysterious. There are no real answers to be found here. There's no moral, no lesson, no real reason to anything in this book, just a search for truth that gets more slippery as the pages tum.I will need to read this one again and some other work form Pynchon as well....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"May 16, 2021","May 28, 2021","May 15, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11062401-the-crying-of-lot-49

Together with Judas - Ana's step brother, and when Jesus is pictured in the book we mainly see his human side not divine side of him.Although the story is imagined but the research into the cultural, political and religious backdrop is incredible. There is an abundance of strong female characters in this novel, their tenacity, friendship and courage is inspiring. Emotional and powerful, this novel is perfect for fans of historical fiction.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 03, 2021","Apr 06, 2021","Mar 23, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/48739558-the-book-of-longings

He is worse educated, and nature has not gifted him so generously. He reads for his own pleasure rather than to impart knowledge or correct the opinions of others. Above all, he is guided by an instinct to create for himself, out of whatever odds and ends he can come by, some kind of whole — a portrait of a man, a sketch of an age, a theory of the art of writing.Virginia Woolf. The Common Reader: First SeriesI too am a common reader and I felt in great company with her when reading this. Her hunger for books is not much unfamiliar to mine, and as far as reading is concerned this felt like a conversation with myself about my relationship with the books I own, have read, have abandoned, inherited, borrowed or forgotten.The Common Reader is a slim collection of 18 essays about her lifelong affair with books. While some essays went over my head, her take on writers and subjects I'm familiar with was really thrilling. I enjoyed her pieces on Montaigne, Austen and the Brontë's in particular, also her writing on literary criticism and contemporary art really interested and it felt just as relevant and insightful now as it must have been at the time. She is as sharp and illuminating as always. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 22, 2021","Apr 04, 2021","Mar 20, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1178493.The_Common_Reader

As it happened to me this time.Initially, I thought that this book would be about the sea, a lonely life on the shore, a leisurely narration and diary entries about the everyday life of a former theater director, who decided to retire and escape from his former life in the theatre. At first it really was so, but then the book took a queer turn and strange things started happening in the house as more and more people come to visit.True, I did not expect and was amazed at the impression the main character made on me, his memoir narration, the discourse on the life he had lived and especially his obsession with the love of his life. With extraordinary psychological insights Murdoch describes all the agonizing and tormenting ideas that keep a tight and uncontrollable grip of the narrator's mind, driving him deeper and deeper into a state of wild jealousy.The book is confusing as it is great, it reads like a surreal dream sometimes but yet realistic in its descriptions. It is strange, moving and enigmatic. It is memorable, above all, because of its strange atmosphere - a past that is inevitable, the nightmare that is everyday life....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,Mar 2021,"Mar 22, 2021","Oct 31, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12126557-the-sea-the-sea

There was comfort in the fact that whether sober or not, it largely followed the same trapped routine! Shuggie Bain takes place in 1980's Glasgow under the constraints of Thatcherism. A city that has been absolutely decimated by loss of industries - as a working-class city, ""Glasgow was losing its purpose."" Laid out as snippets cast over 1981 to 1992, the story focuses on Agnes Bain and her family - her husband, Shug; her daughter, Catherine; and her sons, Leek and Shuggie. In 448 pages, we largely follow Agnes and her youngest son Shuggie living beneath the strain of poverty. Shuggie Bain is not an easy read, often uncomfortable and filled with heartbreaking depiction of alcoholism, of poverty, of loss of agency, of coming of age, of abuse. Despite all of these heavy themes, the strongest theme of all is love. Love despite someone choosing alcohol over you, love in the very smallest moments of hope and love in a lasting friendship that begins with acceptance.Probably the best novel of 2020...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 23, 2020","Dec 29, 2020","Oct 23, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55504502-shuggie-bain

In the novel Pasternack brings us up to date with the factors that triggered the Russian Revolution of 1917, the scenario where the events took place, as well as the psychological drama that affected the people at the time, their disillusions to the tsarist political system, the hopes deposited in a new government system (socialism), as well as the intense fighting between the White Army (Mensheviks) and the Red Army (Bosheviks) after the overthrow of the tsarist imperialist system.Zhivago is a doctor who serves as a volunteer in the First World War, where he meets Lara and there he meets another side of his capacity for love, a passion that overwhelms him anxiously.

A bit   “Good heavens! why did I marry?” - Emma BovaryMadame Bovary is a true novel of life, a writing reflected by a sad soul drowning in illusions. A bit slow in the beginning but all its charm is revealed when every word or sentence penetrates the soul of the reader and leaves a notch there.A classic, multilayered novel that engross the reader with the lessons it offers (a critique of dangerous and uneducated bourgeoisie, a critique of the clergy who can not understand Emma's real pain etc etc.) and the realistic way in which events are presented; bad things happen and then life goes on.Emma is portrayed as a tragic figure who can not escape from her social class and consequently from her own fate that stands painlessly in-front of her, while Charles who is presented as a kind of idiot early in the book, is a plain kind of a man with very plain tastes. Hes satisfied the life he carves out for himself and thinks that his wife is just as happy as he is.A man, on the contrary, should he not know everything, excel in manifold activities, initiate you into the energies of passion, the refinements of life, all mysteries? But this one taught nothing, knew nothing, wished nothing. He thought her happy; and she resented this easy calm, this serene heaviness, the very happiness she gave him.   At bottom of her heart, however, she was waiting for something to happen. Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of the horizon. She did not know what this chance would be, what wind would bring it her, towards what shore it would drive her, if it would be a shallop or a three-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to the portholes. But each morning, as she awoke, she hoped it would come that day; she listened to every sound, sprang up with a start, wondered that it did not come; then at sunset, always more saddened, she longed for the morrow. 5-Stars, definitely one of my favorites....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 12, 2020","Sep 19, 2020","Feb 15, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2175.Madame_Bovary

Not because it is bad but on the contrary, the bastard is too good that if I sink a little more into his books they end up making me sad and disgusted; he makes me hate the world. When I finished reading The Road all I wanted was to cry, when I finished reading No Country for Old Men all I wanted was to be accompanied. When I picked up Blood Meridian, I realized, after few pages that this book will require a very special effort reading it and several times I thought of abandoning it and when I finished it, well it's hard to know what he wanted, but what I did want was to stop reading McCarthy a bit.The bastard took such a remarkable job of describing the wild west, reflecting Evil, violence, war by/on man that I think he got a little out of hand. The book is slow, but on purpose, everything is completely premeditated. I don't want to tell you what you will read if you decide to venture into this book, what I will say is that you will learn the meaning of excessive violence.The McCarthy characters are without a doubt unforgettable and The Judge I think is the most unforgettable of all.

It almost seems to be like sitting at the table with a drunk and hearing him talk about his life for a whole night, on one hand you are interested in the other you wouldn't want to listen to him because he unmasks all that is more atrocious, petty and rot in him.It is a fascinating, intoxicating book of sublime melancholic clarity. It decisively and directly describes a supposedly autobiography - (twenty years of the life) of a person who has nothing good to offer; a misanthrope, a coward, a misogyny, violent and an egoist. Surrounded by characters who have nothing better to offer, difficult to classify, everything is unexpected and diffuse.However, we recognize a thousand details and hundreds of reflections that ring true even if they are excessively pessimistic. Reflections on anarchy, on heroism, on nationalism, on capitalism; the reverse side of everything that makes up our society is brought to light. It also, in large part of the book, portrays the existential bewilderment and vital anguish in time of war, in absolute crisis, with overwhelming sensitivity. The grim reality, that which inevitably resembles to the darkest night, the one we intend to avoid despite being hidden but omnipresent: The loneliness of man and the meanness and misery of his spirit.The end of the book allows us to hope that our journey does not end at night....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 23, 2020","Mar 11, 2020","Jan 05, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12395.Journey_to_the_End_of_the_Night

In concise anecdotes, covering the French Revolution to the Russian Revolutions, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, Lenin, Nietzsche, The Marquis de Sade and Surrealism; easily moving from large historical context to the individual and back again. I could not recommend this book enough to the right kind of reader....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 03, 2020","Sep 15, 2020","Dec 18, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19003904-the-rebel

That The religious stage requires passionate, subjective belief rather than objective proof, in the paradoxical and the absurd.So, what’s the absurd? That which Christianity asks us to accept as true, that God became man born of a virgin, suffered, died and was resurrected.According to Kierkegaard Abraham was the ultimate “knight of faith”. Without doubt there is no faith, and so in a state of “fear and trembling” Abraham was willing to break the universal moral law against murder by agreeing to kill his own son, Isaac.I don't believe in God, I'm one of those people Kierkegaard wrote about who discards religion because of science and I cant get passed reason, but disagreeing with a writer is not the basis for my enjoying his/her writing. And i would like to comment just a bit on this little work.Kierkegaard writes;""...passion is necessary. Every movement comes about by passion. And no reflection can bring a movement about.""  1. Is irrationality necessarily illogical or does it have its own logic; is the law of non-contradiction inherent in human nature? In a sense (as Kierkegaard writes of Abraham and Isaac) where the sacrifice of his son is both murder contrary to morality and faith according to divine will, hence the significance of anxiety/anguish/angst amongst the existential philosophers. Abrahams intent is irrational; and that it is both murder and sacrifice according the human mind and hence is irrational in different fields of Philosophy i.e Ethics resulting to contradiction.  2. Must all areas of philosophy cohere or must we take the either/or position of logic-either Ethics or Metaphysics, yet not both? I found Kierkegaard's writing really accessible.

It’s equally interesting to think about how people think about immortality and how much good looks get you out of trouble. It is not the events that really mattered to me in the narration but the moral, social, philosophical and psychological commentary that was what really interested me.

What book about genocide can be called interesting book. This book is a comprehensive account (in great writing and superb journalistic skills) of what happened in Rwanda while the rest of the world sat back and did nothing during the 1994 genocide.The book is a series of journalistic accounts of the Rwandan Genocide. In many ways, it is horrific, but of incredible importance. Highly recommend this book for anyone interested in history and want better idea about what really happened in the genocide. Unlike any movie I have watched about the massacre, the author gets the reader to see or imagine the true insanity of the Hutu's systematic slaughter of the Tutsis. I think this is one of those cases where no book is better than any book about it.
