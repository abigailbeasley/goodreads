The first is when neither the detective nor the reader knows who the killer is so we folMost police/detective novels fall into one of two categories. The first is when neither the detective nor the reader knows who the killer is so we follow the investigation together, through the inevitable dead ends and red herrings until the criminal is tracked down. The second is when the reader knows who the killer is and we watch the cat-and-mouse game between the dogged detective and the killer who isn't as smart as he thinks. (In both of these, the killer is almost never a woman, unless it's an Agatha Christie novel, for example; typical sexism…) In any case, this book falls into the second category.The plot pretty much falls into the typical pattern, a gloating killer who in this case actually begins to taunt the retired detective, Bill Hodges, to add a little sport to the “game.” Of course, through the usual dogged police, the detective begins to close the distance because we all know that right will triumph and these taunts will turn out to be valuable clues, whereupon the killer begins to become frustrated and starts to panic, etc., but what sets this novel apart is the quality of the writing; this is not the usual hack writing with a bunch of clever wordplay wrapped around incredibly lucky breaks and coincidences, this is Stephen King. It’s true that this isn’t the other-worldly horror of his earlier works but isn’t the horror of the world we live in, with serial killers and mass murderers, enough? This killer is twisted in other ways than we’re accustomed to, and we can see how he was formed, but the development and evolution are master works. Added to this, there are the twists that can’t be easily predicted and those we can see coming and hope to put the brakes to, that we hope we’re wrong about, that some miracle will save us from; sometimes we (or the characters) are saved and sometimes not, but we are hooked on the suspense. (Alfred Hitchcock, the “Master of Suspense” talked about this; instead of surprising us with an explosion, it’s better to tell us that there’s a bomb under the desk that’s about to explode and then have us wait, wait, wait, to see if it will be discovered in time.)I have to say that I didn’t like the end so much because I thought King put too much into it; less might have been more. I know that there are two more Bill Hodges novels and that one of the characters, Holly Gibney, has her own series, but I don’t feel either great rush to read them nor I not want to read them; if I come across them used, that’ll be great but if not, there are other books. I enjoyed this book and that’s enough for me....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 02, 2024","Feb 06, 2024","Feb 01, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18775247-mr-mercedes

As a lifelong Yankee fan, I had to read everything about my childhood heroes, including all the ghost-written autobiographies. Of course, at the time, I didn't realize that my heroes weren't actually sitting down with pen and paper, nor did I know they were completely sanitized, but I gobbled them up like M & M's.This of course changed when Jim Bouton wrote ""Ball Four"", which showed my idols to be more like flawed jocks, even more subject to human failings than most of us because their revered status protected them from scrutiny. (At the time, this was true, but now much less so with reporters scrambling for sordid details.) Joe Pepitone featured in Bouton's book and it was not at all flattering; the era when I first began following baseball with stars in my eyes - Mantle, Maris, etc. - showed my stars to be not all that shining. This brings me to Joe Pepitone, who died last year.The story here could be seen as a tragedy becuase the truth is that Joe Pepitone ruined his own career fighting his devils - trying to live up to his father, being Italian and playing in his hometown while really being a weak individual - but even in a time when the personal flaws of athletes were not always in the headlines, he was known as a pathological liar and whiner. Nothing was ever his fault, he'd been damaged by all this pressure, he couldn't help being the way he was and doing the things he did. The truth is that he wore on people so I saw this as a book which showed the real Joe Pepitone, a potentially great ballplayer who just never took responsibility, and why he was the way he was. I have no doubt that parts of this book are true - but which parts? When Pepitone came up to the Yankees, did the Mafia really offer to break Bill Skowron's legs so that Joe could be a starter at first base? Did he really smoke marijuana with Mickey Mantle before an exhibition game? Was he really a sex addict who would wander the streets all night looking for a woman - any woman - so that he could relax? The list goes on. (Not in the book but... in later years, he was in a car which was stopped by police and in which were found a substantial quantity of drugs; he denied knowledge, of course, but went to prison anyway.)There was no love lost between twice (New York and Houston) ex-teammates Bouton and Pepitone which may be why Bouton took such delight in his portrayal of Joe but I got the impression that he didn't have many friends anyway, or at least none that would do him any good. Bouton's portrayal of Pepitone as extremely vain was accurate, I think; he admiited to having two toupees, one for games and one for private life, and I remember he did commercials for The Hair Club for Men, a hairpiece company. This is probably one of the reasons I liked the book, thinking back on it in later years; I had a better sense of what the book said about Joe Pepitone, possibly without his even realizing it, his often false narrative revealing the failure within....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Jan 1976,Jan 1976,"Jan 30, 2024",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22390059-joe-you-coulda-made-us-proud

Although the story takes place in a more modern era, post-Gulf War, the details (as we know or suppose them) remain the same: a bright young woman meets the senator at a party, they leave together for an encounter at a hotel, he drives off a bridge – possibly under the effects of alcohol – but escapes from the submerged car while she’s left behind, trapped, to slowly drown. It was a horrible story of a horrible death, that was never completely clarified but it pretty much ended any Presidential aspirations for the senator. Joyce Carol Oates was as caught up by the story as everyone else in the country at the time and this book is the result of it percolating in her brain over time.This novella confines itself to the accident, mostly in a series of flashbacks as the young woman, Elizabeth Anne (“Kelly”) Kelleher, is trapped in the car, waiting for the help which she is sure will arrive at any moment, as the water rises. She is a great admirer of “The Senator”, even having written a paper about him at university and articles about political views they have in common (i.e. the death penalty) for a left-wing newspaper, and is thrilled when he shows up at a party she’s been invited to by a friend from Brown University with whom she’s staying for the weekend. He makes romantic overtures to her, which she doesn’t exactly reject, and she leaves with him even though she isn’t sure she’s ready for that kind of relationship and in spite of her friend asking her not to leave but before leaving, he has one drink more then another, plus one more he carries with him in the car, they have to rush to make the ferry off the island, he makes a wrong turn, winding up on a disused road, and off the narrow bridge they go. All this is not told sequentially, but as a series of flashbacks as she recalls different parts of the narrative which has resulted in her being in this predicament. She imagines help arriving at any moment, “The Senator” swimming back to help her, the trip to the hospital in the ambulance, and all the while the water is rising. (We also find that the “Great Man” is not so great but more bent on survival; he also knows very well the political importance of covering one’s ass.)Joyce Carol Oates is never easy to read because she insists on making the reader uncomfortable as women suffer, usually at the hands of men who prove untrustworthy; she has said that the book was not specifically about Chappaquiddick but about a young woman putting her trust in an older man who violates that trust. The book was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and has also been adapted into two separate operatic works – not surprising as the story is very powerful and has the traditional classical elements of that type of work. The audio version, read by Amanda Plummer, was considered by one New York Times critic to be “the best book-on-tape ever recorded. So, there’s a lot to recommend here. I always have mixed feelings about Oates because she makes me uneasy – it all feels so hopeless - but she’s someone who I come back to again and again. She’s not for everyone but I can relate to anguish. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Dec 29, 2023","Dec 31, 2023","Dec 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15974.Black_Water

Even my wife and were divided on this as she hated it and finished out of pure stubbornness with gnashed teeth and smoke pouring out of her ears while I eventually entered the flow. It’s definitely ambitious and definitely not for everyone so if you haven’t read it yet, beware!The first thing that you have to remember is that in many cultures, mental illness is thought of as evil spirits invading the body and fighting for control – and that’s who narrates most of this story, evil spirits, sometimes separately and sometimes in conjunction. The body – “the Ada”, as they refer to her – is only a vessel, tossed to and fro at the whim of these spirits. These are rooted firmly in Nigerian Igbo tradition of “ogbanje”, reincarnating malevolent spirits who enter the body in order to cause it grief and pain,, similar to the Jewish “dybbuk” ; in the case of Ada, she has a split personality, one half shy, timid, conservative and the other a virago that seeks out and seduces men with an equally amoral and evil streak, only in order to destroy them. And by the same token, the aim of the spirits is to drive Ada to the point of suicide.It’s easy to dismiss this as superstitious nonsense but as I pointed out with the “dybbuk”, the idea of spirits exists in the Judeo-Christian tradition as well – if there’s a Holy Ghost, why not an unholy one? I live in a Catholic country (although the Evangelists are becoming more dominant) and I used to argue that if Jews and Christians can believe in a god they can’t see, and if one feels the spirit of Christ, why are other belief systems less valid? There is no shortage of books where people are “moved by the Spirit” so why discriminate because this is based in Igbo beliefs? Nor does the book dismiss Jesus as He makes an important appearance, albeit under a different name, and is regarded both respectfully and cynically by the other spirits.Furthermore, most mental illness is little understood; it usually has no physical manifestation so often we can’t REALLY say what causes it, and for that reason it’s often dismissed as a lack of character. (Ask anyone who’s suffered from clinical depression or addiction.) We live in an age where if you can’t produce some physical proof, like a tumor, people frequently aren’t willing to accept that there’s something there, so there’s no reason to dismiss out-of-hand “evil spirits.” Ada converses with her “ogbanje”, which brings to mind schizophrenia, and this spirit tries to dissuade and intercede against any sort of outside help, such as a psychiatrist or social worker, not unlike we’ve heard of schizophrenics abandoning treatment due to paranoia. For me, there were a lot of talking points in the book but I could also see why my wife didn’t like it; it’s often repetitive, depressing and plain frustrating to read but I found it worthwhile all the same. Recommendable for anyone willing to go with the flow.By the way, this is not your typical African book but so many Nigerian writers are out there now so there’s no reason to expect them to be alike. This author that doesn’t exactly fit into the Western mold: African and binary, which caused some problems with the committee for the Women’s Prize for Fiction since that’s obviously only for women and they didn’t realize that she didn’t identify as a woman and as one person put it, would a transgendered person who converted from being a male be considered? Not likely as there’s no category for “transgendered”. When “The Death of Vivek Oji” was submitted for inclusion, the committee asked for Emezi’s “sex as defined by law”, Emezi withdrew and accused the committee of being transphobic. So be it, Emezi is talented writer and all the rest is just noise....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 04, 2023","Dec 08, 2023","Dec 04, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35793147-freshwater

She spends all her time wondering why she can’t connect with people in quite the way she’d like but the truth is that she’s a square peg looking for her round hole while trying not to offend anyone and longing to make this connection while sunk in her own “inadequacies.” Most people describe this book as about loneliness but I also think it’s about a lack of courage, pure cowardice towards her own true self. Thoreau preached to march to our own drummer but Sonja just prefers to sit on the sidelines, tapping her toes and desperately hoping to find the beat.The main thread of the book is Sonja’s driving lessons where she “accepts” that she will never learn to drive, mainly because her first instructor, Jytte, more-or-less tells her so. She won’t let Sonja shift gears for herself and spends the entire lesson relating her family saga and chain-smoking, while yelling instructions at Sonja and belittling her student. Good strategy in a sense because Sonja, at 40 years old, is easily intimidated and having almost zero self-confidence. Instead of confronting Jytte, she quietly changes instructors to the owner, who seems to have an interest in Sonja beyond teaching her to drive. His approach gives Sonja more confidence in her driving but the added attention is unwanted. At the same time, Sonja can’t adjust to Copenhagen and desperately misses the countryside of Jutland, especially curling up with her mother, while wondering why her sister, Kate, won’t talk to her; to the reader, it becomes obvious that they are just on completely different wavelengths but Sonja frets about trying to reconnect to Kate’s while failing to understand that her own is perfectly good. There’s also the quirky New-Age masseuse that she goes to who offers good advice about standing up for herself while trying to get Sonja to try some of her own remedies, such as meditating in woods with other women.I spent this whole book waiting for something significant to happen; it’s a good thing it was short because the wait was in vain. This isn’t a bad book but I didn’t find it particularly good, either. It becomes obvious that Sonja will never confront anyone or accept who she is (except briefly at the end); Sonja doesn’t fight, she surrenders. This is not necessarily bad because we all have to accept sometimes that the fight is futile – e.g. irremediable relationships – but Sonja just whimpers, in my opinion. If she were one of my students, I’d give her a C- and maybe up it to a C put of pity....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 06, 2023","Nov 09, 2023","Nov 06, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/34457985-mirror-shoulder-signal

And maybe that’s how literature ought to be, open to individual interpretation because not all things mean the same things to all people.The book begins with introductory premise from the first lines: a man in traffic stops his car because he’s suddenly and inexplicably been struck blind; one moment he can see and the next moment all he can see is a field of whiteness, blank like an unpainted canvas or a movie screen before the film starts. His wife takes him to a doctor, an ophthalmologist, and in the doctor’s office, we meet other patients who are waiting to be attended; the doctor can find no medical explanation for this sudden loss of sight and sends him home. From this point, it becomes bizarre because one-by-one, the man’s wife and everyone connected to this waiting room also becomes blind – except for the doctor’s wife. The easy answer is that somehow all of these people have “caught” something, but then this blindness begins to spread through the general population which understandably creates a panic. They are rounded up and put into camps, divided into two groups, those who are already blind and those who’ve been exposed to the blind. The doctor’s wife pretends to be blind as well in order to accompany her husband. From this point on, it becomes something of apocalyptic tale of horror with the ugliest sides of humanity exposed and the hopelessness felt by all those who have no answers to their situation, leaving them with no desire to go on. There has been a total breakdown of civilization.There are a couple of things that I took out of this. Many of today’s readers seized on the “epidemic” and compared it to the worldwide COVID crisis but I disagree. I compared it to the AIDS epidemic because we all knew what caused COVID even if they couldn’t (and possibly never will) pinpoint its precise origin; we knew it was a virus and it behaved like a virus so it was just a question of how to fight it. AIDS was a completely unknown virus that didn’t behave in the same form, particularly in its incubation period and I remember the sentiment of some at the time to round up all those who were affected or had been exposed in order to isolate them. I also remember black (and white) ministers who called it God’s judgement against homosexuality but when it began to hit the black community particularly hard, the conspiracy theory I heard was that this was a disease cooked up by the government to eliminate black people. (Welcome to the USA, home of the conspiracy theory – and since I was living in San Francisco at the time, any sort of paranoiac anti-establishment theory had fertile ground to prosper.) This is what this reminded me of, how scared people will leap at any explanation for the inexplicable.My other thought is similar to many others’: why was the blindness white instead of black? We think of blindness as everything going black, the total lack of sight information to the brain. I think it’s an allegory on today’s society because in the past, we were often blind to the everyday world because information didn’t reach us but now EVERYTHING reaches us and it can be like a giant beam shone in our face where we can’t distinguish between all the information we receive. Mushrooms in the dark being fed bullshit to a world of information overkill. Only a thought.Obviously a book I’d recommend, if you can get past imagining a world wallowing in excrement because the sanitation system has also broken down – but that’s “not seeing the forest for the trees” because there are more important points to be considered here, and to spark debate. (P.S. The doctor’s wife, my heroine, leading the women, sacrificing herself and saving the day when the men can´t!) ...more",Notes are private!,3,7,1,"Oct 14, 2023","Oct 20, 2023","Oct 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40495148-blindness

When I cruise places to download books, I like to look for writers from other parts of the world so My attraction to this book was the author’s name. When I cruise places to download books, I like to look for writers from other parts of the world so the African name stood out, especially since she was someone I knew nothing about, and reading about her, I saw that rather than English, she had written this in Dutch, the first Flemish author of a novel who was of African origin, and that she’d won awards with this book so I thought it worth a try.So… I liked this book, it was well-written and well-developed, but the plot devices were nothing new to me. The story centers around four prostitutes in Antwerp who had all arrived from Nigeria, through a “procurer” in Lagos. (“Pimp” isn’t exactly the word I’d use because he found and financed the passage of the women to send them to a madam in Antwerp. The brothel is on Zwartzezusterstraat, which means “Black Sisters Street.” This name isn’t explained but I had enough German to figure it out.) One of them, Sisi, is murdered early in the book – it didn’t explicitly say “murder” but it didn’t seem likely she fell over from a heart attack – and so it becomes a murder mystery as well as the chance for each, as she grieves, to tell her story of how she arrived there. Sisi’s story is also told, as well as the events leading up to her murder, as well as the murder itself, so the reader isn’t left hanging there.The problem for me is that although the stories are tragic and far too common in this world, they are also far too common plot devices in a lot of books, and easily recognizable. Sisi is at a dead end where she lives because although she has a university degree, no one will hire her. Her boyfriend is in a dead-end teaching job, her father in a dead-end civil service job, and she can see that neither she nor anyone else will ever achieve what they’ve dreamed of, so when she’s offered a job as a “nanny” in Belgium, she leaps at it. When she finds out what it really is, she’s not particularly surprised and just gets on with it as a way of paying off her debt to the procurer so that she can begin to live her dreams.As for the others, there are the usual stories: the young girl who is the kept woman of a rich man until he dumps her when she becomes pregnant, the daughter of a minister who is less than holy with her, civil war and rape, the young woman who’s not accepted by her lover’s family, and while all this is obviously tragic, it’s nothing new or shocking; you can see where each story is going to end up well before it finishes. Nor is any of them maltreated in her work even if they may not like the work or their clients; for them, it’s a means to an end. It’s as if they have changed one dull, hopeless life for another. (This might be compared to “Purge” by Sofi Oksanen where the life of an Eastern European woman tricked into prostitution is really an unimaginable nightmare.) Another niggling point is that when the book tells how each ends up in the future, it sounds as if the world hasn’t changed at all, they’re just 20 or 40 years older. Finally, the murder was not as mysterious as I’d hoped; it was more-or-less what I’d suspected.In the end, I found this to be a well-written book but not something to rave about or particularly recommend, nor anything to dissuade someone from reading. It tells its story, it entertains, but it doesn’t inspire....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 09, 2023","Oct 14, 2023","Oct 09, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/10851296-on-black-sisters-street

She says that I'm not ""zen"" enough and I suppose she's right; I grew up in New York City and although many think the ""zen gene"" was eliminated there as a genetic weakness, I think Darwin would have found it reinforced as a coping survival mechanism. The problem is that this gene reacts to stress as opposed to savoring and enjoying the beauty. That said, I can't wax exhuberant over this book as it's more like a prolonged haiku. I know that the Nobel Prize committee cited this book specifically as what they found most notable in Kawabata's work and although I agree that he evokes something tragically beautiful in this book, I just couldn't get into some of the characters, particularly the principal. The main character, Shimamura, is a dilettante who returns to this part of Japan, leaving his wife behind, and enjoying the company of geishas. The story revolves around a provincial geisha, Komako, with whom he had a relation the last time and who is now looking to get out of that work since she's older and won't be able to compete much longer; she'd like a more permanent arrangement. She only became a geisha to pay for the medicine of a local young man, who is now dying and accompanied by a younger woman. She falls in love with Shimamura but he is somewhat diffident and inconsistent in his feelings, which causes her to feel frustrated. The relationship and her background story are what drive this short novel.The book is beautiful, no doubt, but it didn't involve me in the way it should have and I accept the blame.

The book starts with Landreaux Iron who’s been patiently stalking a large deer for some weeks, observing the buck’s habits, and when the moment comes to pull the trigger, he accidently kills his neighbor’s five-year-old son, Dusty. This sets off a chain of events – or better said, unchains events which have been simmering underneath for a long time and waiting to happen. These events unfold in part on an Ojibwa Indian Reservation in North Dakota – the author is also Ojibwa and lives on the reservation so she knows her setting – and involve not only Ojibwa life and traditions but the relation with the neighboring community. The first event is that Landreaux and his wife, Emmaline, feel obligated to offer their own son, LaRose, who was Dusty’s best friend, as a replacement to the grieving parents, Peter and Nola, the estranged half-sister of Emmaline. There are a lot of characters in this book, each with his or her own story, and this covers a lot of ground. A reservation is a closed community not so different than a small town, where relationships go back a long way and are somewhat incestuous in that not only does everyone know everyone else, and are often related somehow, but they know the history behind all of these relationships. There are smoldering grudges and resentments here but there’s a new generation with one foot in tradition and another in the usual tribulations of growing up. There’s a parallel story within about the first LaRose and how this name continues with its power to subsequent generations. This adds a mysticism in this book which gives it an added dimension without subtracting from the more material parts. I really became attached to the characters - there's so much heart there - and look forward to the books which preceded it. (“LaRose is the third part of Louse Erdrich’s “Justice Trilogy”, beginning with “A Plague of Doves” and continuing with “The Round House.” I understand that characters repeat but it’s not a continuing story.) For those who read her Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Night Watchman”, this is not a book to be missed.

Byatt, who won the Booker Prize with the excelMargaret Drabble has the misfortune of not only being the sister of an even more acclaimed author, A.S. Byatt, who won the Booker Prize with the excellent “Possession” – and with whom she has a distant relationship – but also of being a feminist ahead of her time but not far enough ahead of her time to be “rescued”. The reason I say “ahead of her time” is that when she wrote this, in 1965, feminist novels were mostly in their infancy and soon tended to be more strident (in my opinion), victimizing women and heaping all the blame on men and a male-dominated society. (I won’t deny that these accusations were mostly true…) Drabble’s feminism is more in tune with the mood today of self-empowerment, which owes a lot to those feminists of earlier days; while men could be seen as the oppressors back then, in this book they become irrelevant to a woman’s self-determination. (I am sure that many women will disagree with my assessment but I’m sure that no one can dispute that a lot has changed in 60 years; “you’ve come a long way, baby”, since Virginia Slims sold you a more feminine form of cancer!)The protagonist, Rosamund, a Cambridge graduate writing her thesis, has an accidental encounter with a BBC newsreader which results in her becoming pregnant. Before this, she never gave much attention to anything out of her academic field, 18th-century (or 19th, I can’t remember) English poetry; she had her chaste flirtations but protected herself by convincing each that she was involved with another man of their acquaintance, and never really thought about an after-thesis life. However, her pregnancy changes that and forces her to make some determinations. One thing that protects her is that she is from a privileged situation so money is not a consideration; obviously whether in that time or this time, empowerment requires financing. She has the economic freedom to visit the library to research and write her thesis but in spite of this liberty, she still has to live in a society where single motherhood was not looked on well, especially in her economic class; everyone expects that she’ll either visit a doctor to have a procedure to “eliminate the problem” or at the least give the baby up for adoption. A lot of strong hints and expectations are thrown her way but she is either oblivious or impervious to all the voices around her. The baby is hers and so is her life. This leads to a nail-biting final chapter. (I read this book with my wife, who loved it as much as I did, in spite of the nail situation.)This book is not all drama, although there are some things that affected me greatly; it’s more amusing as Rosamund wades further and further into taking charge of her life, and that of her baby. Everything is cast in a humorous light, from maternity to the National Health Service to the indifference and/or raised eyebrows of her acquaintances, one of whom, Lydia, sees a particular advantage for herself in all this while being a tremendous help. (According to Wikipedia, it was also adapted into a 1969 film, something I didn’t know: in the UK, “A Touch of Love”, in the USA, “Thank You Very Much.”) I really liked this book and look forward to reading more as I have a fondness for British women writers from this time, for reasons even I can’t explain. My wife has also read “A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman” which is a collection of short stories of middle-aged women with problems, mostly with their partners, and I hope to get to that soon.

Julian BarnOne of the reasons that I love Czech literature is that it poses very human problems and dilemmas but doesn’t necessarily offer solutions. Julian Barnes wrote, “Books are where things are explained to you. Life is where things aren’t.” In my case, I like happy endings but life isn’t usually like this; we often just get over and get on with it. It might be appropriate to start this  off by saying, “Physician, heal thyself,” (or in this case, “preacher”) but I’ve always thought that applied to hypocrites and the pastor here isn’t that; rather, he’s troubled by preaching the Gospel when it’s something he isn’t living by. Daniel Vedra is the pastor here who ministers to his flock, trying to guide them through the confusions of post-Communist Czechoslovakia while being a good husband to Hana and good father to his three children, two with Hana and one, Eva, from his previous ill-fated marriage, which still haunts him. The marriage haunts him because it only lasted four years, three good and one in which his wife, Jitka, is dying from cancer, and as is not uncommon, he’s raised his dead wife to something like sainthood, an ideal that neither Hana nor Eva nor any other woman could possibly match up to. Hana is a good woman but she’s not Jitka.There are four principal characters who narrate the story: Daniel, Hana, his lover, Bára, and his lover’s husband, Sam; Daniel carries Jitka over his heart like a medallion, Hana had only had bad experiences with men, Bára has a son, disdained by Sam, from her previous unhappy marriage and Sam has been married twice before, the last broken up for Bára. So, everyone is carrying more than enough baggage into this unholy mess and while Daniel and Bára have the common ground of the love they’d both been waiting for, Hana and Bára have the common ground of being less than their husbands desire; in short, all of more in common than they perhaps realize. And so it plays out with Daniel carrying out an adulterous affair while preaching from the Bible and displaying Jesus’s example of forgiveness by mentoring a released juvenile offender and welcoming him into his home, where he meets Daniel’s daughter, Bára trying to convince Sam of her love while carrying on an affair, Sam simultaneously demanding and rejecting Bára’s love… If it sounds like a Peyton Place, it’s not, it’s only humans trying to attain the impossibly complicated goals they set for themselves and all this with beautifully poetic prose – which was my problem here. Some chapters are Daniel’s diary while he wrestles with his inability to completely follow the teachings of Christ, and some are letters, particularly between Daniel and Bára trying to reconcile an impossible love without hurting anyone. (A common theme in adulterous relationships, trying to love a new love while not hurting the old love, having your cake and eating it, too.) I can recommend the book if you don’t necessarily need easy solutions to life’s complex problems and don’t find this all a lot of heart-wrenching trite ridiculousness. Life isn’t easy, love’s even harder, but it’s what we all try and work out....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 19, 2023","Jun 26, 2023","Jun 19, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20001758-the-ultimate-intimacy

Nonetheless, I was never pushed to read it until it became part of a book discussion group which I’m in with my wife. A rare but welcome opportunity for us to read something together, especially since we love to bounce impressions of films and books off each other.There are many books which are modeled off Biblical tales but this is a story mirrored off the Koran, something which turned off many readers unfamiliar with Islam’s Holy Book, but this wasn’t a problem for me since many of the stories are similar. The protagonist is Yusef and his story parallels that of the Yusef in the Koran, which is widely quoted in the novel. As a small boy, he lives a happy existence in his family in Tanzania before the first World War, particularly looking forward to visits from his Uncle Aziz, who always rewards him with a coin at the end of his visits; I think that most of us can identify with this, visits from relatives who gave us small gifts. However, Aziz is not really his uncle but a businessman who has lent money to Yusef’s father and when his father can’t pay, Yusef is taken in payment of the debt, to work it off in his “uncle’s” store; basically, he is sold off into slavery, something not uncommon in East Africa, particularly among the Arabs. All this develops slowly, as well as Yusef’s realization that he is not off on a family visit to learn the business and that the situation may be irreversible and final – and that he’s not the only one in this situation, where children are commonly used as security, functioning as slave workers or concubines. Children are routinely snatched off the street in broad daylight and public torture not only can take place at a moment’s notice but are public spectacles for bystanders to cheer on. Aziz’s god-like stature also takes a beating as he is proved not to be infallible and, out of his own environment, just as prey to the vagaries of other local leaders. Meanwhile, through this all, there are rumors of the Europeans arriving – in this case, the Germans – who will soon put an end to all this savagery and put order into this part of the world.One of the interesting things about this book is that it’s written by an African who puts the lie to the story that all was harmony and peace before the Europeans arrived. It was a world where cruelty and brutality ruled over compassion and kindness, and if your life was not predestined then it was at least up for sale; slavery is slavery and a slave’s life is not his or her own, and nothing has any value except force and power. In an interview, Gurnah also pointed out that Zanzibar’s and Tanzania’s independence in 1964, when he was a teenager, also brought brutal civil war, similar to what took place in Rwanda. It became open season on ethnic Arabs and Indians and he told the story of how a man ran into a mosque with a shotgun and shot everyone inside, including children. He said that nothing was ever done about it; it was as if nothing had happened. One point of this and of the book is maybe that while colonialism brought exploitation of resources, violence and human exploitation was already there. I liked this book – “enjoyed” isn’t the word I’d use with such an inhuman situation – because while it mirrors the story from the Koran, as I understand the story, it also deals with the hopelessness of Yusef and others in his situation and how each confronts it, knowing that their life has been decided by others. The sins of the father are passed on the children and it’s only their own desperation that can save them....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 08, 2023","Jun 13, 2023","Jun 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77815.Paradise

Patricia Wood’s premier novel, “Lottery”, was shortlisted for the 2008 Orange Prize and while it wasn’t my favorite of the runners-up, I like it a lot better than the winner, Rose Tremain’s “The Road Home.”The narrator, Perry Crandall, starts out by reminding us that he’s not retarded because you have to have an I.Q. below 75, or in some cases 70, for that and he has 76. He’s just slow – or as his Gram says, the rest of the world is just too fast, something I’m inclined to agree with at times! – but he’s as good-hearted a person as you can meet. (There’s a tendency here to compare Perry with Forrest Gump but the storylines are nowhere similar.) Perry was abandoned by his mother (boo, hiss!) and left with her in-laws. (The whereabouts of Perry’s father are unclear at first but his story gets filled in.) His grandparents are a model for raising a mentally-challenged child as they support him, never telling him he can’t do something, just telling him it takes more time, and Perry not only learns to be a crack sailor from his Gramps, but auto-sufficient thanks to his Gram who won’t stand for laziness or excuses. After the grandfather dies, Perry and his Gram live pinching pennies, without the support of his “cousin-brothers” (double boo, hiss!) who not only won’t give them a dime to help out but barely maintain any contact. The two live a life of weekly bingo nights and lottery tickets. Perry works in a boating supply store for Gary, along with his best friend, Keith, a flatulent Vietnam vet, visits Cherry, the slightly oversized clerk at the convenience store. These are our good guys. (Yea!)Then come two dramatic changes. First, Gram dies and his siblings and Mother argue about who’s going to be stuck with Perry, as well as how to get him to sign over his share of the house, which they promptly sell out from under him and give him his “share” - $500. Since none of them want him, he is forced to live in a small apartment over the shop. The second thing that happens is that Perry wins $12 million dollars in the lottery and as can be imagined, everyone who’s ignored him before suddenly takes a great interest in his welfare, particularly his heretofore mostly absent brothers and mother. As expected, there is the sweet talk but as this really goes against their natures, this is quickly followed by more forceful actions, as they are desperate for the money. The younger of the two brothers is a milquetoast with his lawyer wife barking up his ass, the mother may be more accustomed to earning a living lying on her back, and the oldest is on his fifth wife with legal and illegal financial problems; the acorn doesn’t fall far from the tree, as we find out. (No spoiler here as most of this is either on the book cover or easily predictable.)All of this plays out with tragedy and happiness with a good deal of humor packed in, especially as Perry may know right from wrong but is still a bit of an innocent and we’re with his friends, all screaming from the sidelines about what he should and shouldn’t do. The ending was not exactly as I expected but plausible, especially since in my reader’s heart, I knew it wouldn’t end badly; a few scraped knees but a happy ending nonetheless....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 28, 2023","May 31, 2023","May 28, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/759175.Lottery

Kenji is a Tokyo tourist guide who has an American client, Frank, who he suspects of Well, this is a strange and horrifying, but delightful thriller. Kenji is a Tokyo tourist guide who has an American client, Frank, who he suspects of being a brutal serial killer. (Think Black Dahlia.) This is not exactly a cat-and-mouse story but a story about how he reacts in those circumstances. And maybe how we’d react to having a possible vicious murderer at our side, and guiding him around. It develops into a sort of Stockholm Syndrome situation; Kenji can’t quit, especially when he receives a gruesome “message” at his doorstep that “someone” knows where he lives. He confesses his suspicions to his high-school girlfriend while fearing that she could be the next victim with one wrong move.The book can be divided into two parts in a sense: the first half when Kenji can’t believe it can be true (while the reader is thinking, oh yes, it can) leading up to a splatter-horror segment (shout-out to Judith Sonnet) and the aftermath, which forms the second part and the Stockholm Syndrome really kicks in; how do you escape your situation without becoming further involved and/or putting a loved one in danger as well. Not a book for the sensitive.The book brought back two memories for me. One is Ann Rule’s book, “The Stranger Beside Me” which is about her working on team to trace a serial killer in Washington and one of her colleagues is… Ted Bundy, who was the killer, of course! The other was when I lived in New York and my upstairs neighbor was a disturbed Vietnam vet. He came down on New Year’s Eve to share his misery: his wife had told him she was leaving him. He had a weapon with him to, shall we say, persuade me to commiserate with him. A long evening. At one point, he asked how they were as neighbors and I said, fine, except that you know how kids are, his daughter (four or five years old) liked to run in the house and these apartments, you can hear everything (no mention of the arguments) and I laughed because it was just a normal thing for me, growing up with kids and kids run. His eyes opened wide, and he said, “I’ll kill her!”, and started to get up; I assured him it didn’t really bother me, you know how kids are, and calmed him down. That was my New Year’s Eve. So, I could identify with Kenji, just trying to calm Frank down whenever Frank had a “look” in his eyes, not point out inconsistencies in his background stories, and just get out alive.This was a taste of Japanese thrillers I’d never had before, which can be aa lot stronger than the Western ones I’m used to, much grittier suspense. I’d had a brief encounter with this in a book by the other Murakami, who’s not related. (An episode in “The Wind-Up Bird” with a Russian.)

Burroughs, although some cited “Blade Runner”) as the plot takes second place to language and its use to create shifting moods and momentum. The writer is a renowned Congolese poet with a strong appreciation of jazz and African rap; this could have easily made the book unreadable and nonsensical but like all music, if you can melt into the beat, the rhythm, you can flow with it. To explain, there are various lines repeated, like refrains or passages, many times in the book which can make you crazy as a literary device but make perfect sense if you see it as music or poetry. It’s also very cynical about Africa and the American / European colonialization and exploitation of minerals and people.The story centers around the reuniting of two friends and their different perceptions of the unnamed country of their birth. (Neither of the two Congos is mentioned specifically although Zaire is.) Requiem is the one who stayed behind and has become a sort of wheeler-dealer who knows the terrain very well and how to exploit all parties, from the leader to the Europeans to the natives. Lucien is a writer who has returned from living in Europe and has high-minded ideas which in no way correspond to the reality of the country. There are the Europeans (or “tourists”), the university students with their Marxist pretensions and protests, the miners who have no patience with the students (and vice-versa) although they are all in the same boat together, and the women, aged from pre-pubescent to 41 (when they stop counting), who are all prostitutes advertising and selling their services because what else can they do to survive? All parties meet in Tram 83, the club where everything happens because it’s really the only place in the city to meet, even when there’s no room inside. All revolves around diamonds (“the stone”) because it’s why the Europeans are there and what everyone is connected to as the source of all money. The relationship between Requiem and Lucien changes as pragmatism clashes with idealism.This is not a book for a casual reader but rather a book for someone looking for something different. If the men are all mercenary and the women all prostitutes, it is from necessity because life with “the stone” has left them no alternative now that the West has stripped everything else away and left them with no other way to survive. However, the book has a lot of humor to it if you can see past the dismal setting and form of life. If Bukowski or Burroughs left a bad taste in your mouth or you just can’t get past that form of sexual bluntness and cynicism, this isn’t your book. This isn’t a book just to read, it’s a book to dance with or maybe just snap your fingers....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 27, 2023",May 2023,"Apr 27, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/26529055-tram-83

They are absolutely jReading some of the s on Good Reads, there were many who were either perplexed by this novel or plain just didn’t like it. They are absolutely justified in feeling this way because if a book is placed in the American West in the 1800’s, you have certain expectations. If you reading about an immigrant coming to the USA with nothing but a dream, you have expectations. Well, so did Håkan, Swedish immigrant and protagonist of the story but both they and he find out that things aren’t what they ought to be.The first problem here is that the author, Hernán Díaz, was born in Argentina but moved to Sweden as an exile as a child, where he grew up, so his influences are not only North American. He has admitted that the story was greatly influenced by the Argentinian stories of the Pampas – think of these as South American westerns - as much as anything else. (For a sample, you might look at the epic poem by José Hernández, “The Gaucho Martín Fierro.” I also ed another story, “The Clouds” by Juan José Saer, which I liked very much.) So, he doesn’t follow the stereotypical American western nor the stereotypical immigrant-comes-to-America-and-finds-happiness-and success story that we’re used to. Finally, there is something which bugged the shit out of many readers, including me, but has an explanation.The story is of Håkan, who grows up with his older brother on a farm in Sweden. His brother enchants Håkan with travel stories and when it’s clear that there is no real future for them on the farm, they take off for America, via England. However, the two brothers are somehow separated on the English dock and the only English word that Håkan knows is “America.” This lands him on a ship but instead of being headed for New York, his brother’s destination, his ship is headed is headed for San Francisco. Once he realizes his error, the mission in Håkan’s mind is to travel to New York and look for his brother, not having any ideas of how big the USA is nor, being a farm boy, how impossible it is to find someone in a big city when you haven’t a clue of what exactly IS a big city or where they might be. (San Francisco was just beginning to be affected by gold fever at the time.) There are more misadventures than anything else and while he meets some good people, he meets far more scoundrels, villains and just bizarre individuals than can be believed, all hampered by his poor English, to the point where humans are more a curse to him than anything else. This forms the circle of his life: wandering and avoiding people, then trusting them to his own misfortune, then avoiding them once again. This circular pattern turns out to be the part that bugged people because some passages of the book seem to repeat, to the extent that you wonder if it’s a printers’ error because you could SWEAR you’d just read the same thing 10-15 pages back – except that there are very slight changes. This reflects the circularity and routine of Håkan´s life, an almost pointless existence.I read this with my wife and while I liked it and recognized what Díaz was trying to do, my wife just found it depressing, and boring in parts. I can’t disagree but this alternate vision of historical fiction and the poetry – again, I’ll mention Martín Fierro – is probably why it was shortlisted for the Pulitzer. (His next book, “Trust”, was a co-winner.) It’s not a book for anyone, especially if you enter with a specific vision of what a Western, coming-to-America book should be – because it’s not that. It’s a book that challenges you – Díaz is a big Henry James fan – so you have to be in the mood and prepared for that.[ANECDOTE:] I attended his presentation of “Trust” in Santiago and had a chance to speak to him, as well as baffle the Chileans around me, including my wife. First, I told him that I was born in the section of Brooklyn that he mentions in the book, Fort Greene. He looked at me in amazement and said, “Get out!” (People wondered if I was being asked to leave!) Then I told him that his books aren´t available here in English so I’d read “In the Distance” as an illegal download. He looked at me, poker-faced, held out his hand and said, “You owe me 15 bucks,” paused for a beat, then laughed. However, he signed my wife’s book with a dedication to the Brooklyn homeboy! (And he let me keep my money.)

I knew that my wife had enjoyed it but we have a pact of not telling each other much about books one of us has read if the other is going to read it. It’s the same with reading s beforehand; we like to make up our own minds. I can also see from the s that this book has produced an interesting split between those who got into it and those who couldn’t wait to get out. (a.k.a. “The Gatsby Effect.”)First of all, I find alcoholics and drug addicts both sad and boring; those who think of look down on it as a weakness or character fault that can be just given up, or who think it just comes out of thin air, just don’t understand but those who think that the town drunk is hilarious don’t get it either because there is usually something behind it that fuels it. This is not to say that the occasional overindulgence isn’t funny but what is in this book is what happens when it becomes the only reason for living, the wait to go back under again where things don’t hurt quite so much. The narrator of this story has a lot of pain and like many of us, would just like to erase the past and start fresh. There are two things which enable her to try to do this, a seemingly endless supply of money and a psychiatrist who´s more than willing to write endless prescriptions in order to make a profit. I understand how some people find it difficult to sympathize with a tall attractive, blond rich girl who’s depressed – what does she have to be depressed about? – but problems she has while problem-solving abilities she doesn’t. She also had zero parenting and an alcoholic, depressive mother who soaked up pity like a sponge. I also understand why many people found her best (and only) friend, Reva, annoying because she’s a stereotypical whining type who only focuses on what she doesn’t have and the narrator does, but I’ve had best friends who constantly bugged the shit out of me but who I missed in equal measure when they weren’t there.So, the story about how she’d like to go to sleep for a year and wake up reborn in a new world isn’t so far from what other people sometimes wish. (Along perhaps with a time machine so they could go back and have a “do-over”.) Moreover, the possible reaction by a reader to all the events isn’t surprising, either, because depressed and/or addicted persons ARE maddeningly frustrating. There are just SO many people you’d like to slap, it’s hard to know where to start. No matter, I was still rooting for her to get out of her hole because it wasn’t of her own making; she’d had a lot of help getting there and without ever having learned how to cope added to a pill-pushing doctor (who epitomized the problem of mental health care in this world), she needed my good wishes.

On the other hand, I started my teaching career in a small town and I also know the problems of everyone knowing everyone else’s business, but being too polite to mention it to your face. No anonymity there.This was a story with heart to spare where all the problems and situations you can find in a bigger place are just as present in a smaller one. Violent acts, teenage pregnancy, love (or just a warm bed to share), loneliness and untapped (or overlooked sources) of kindness – all under a microscope of sorts. As a teacher, I could identify with one of the principal characters who felt that a student ought to do some work to graduate while he’s confronted with an administration who just wants to see the back end of a troublesome student, the idealism of teaching vs the pragmatic view of holding back a student not serving for much. I enjoyed this book tremendously and hope to read the next two in the series.

It’s also one of the few that I read simultaneously with my wife and she felt the same way. Coincidentally, we also saw a film or show which had a similar storyline (and whose title I can’t remember just now) but with a protagonist that was less endearing than Shuggie so that served as a good contrast. It’s hard to pick a particular theme to focus on but I’ll choose two. The first is the devastating effect that alcoholism can have on a family, destroying them from within and ostracizing them from without. (Even if those that ostracize have nothing to be proud of themselves.) Shuggie’s mother, Agnes, falls deeper and deeper and just when you think she’s touched bottom, she falls a bit further. One by one, the family drops away until it’s only Shuggie to take care of her, and even he knows in his heart that it’s hopeless. He knows that he can no longer save her, so doesn’t try. The book also shows the myth that alcoholics can just stop any time they want when Agnes manages to stop but is pushed off the wagon unwittingly by the man who helped save her. The book shows what anyone who’s lived with an addict knows: they are the ones who have to save themselves.The second theme is the difficulty of growing up gay in an overtly macho society; not only is Shuggie bullied but his father more-or-less abandons him, and his brother is embarrassed by him. (When his father suddenly takes an interest in him again, we see what Agnes is capable of as a fighter, definitely a force to be reckoned with!) In a sense, Agnes and Shuggie are co-dependents, fiercely defending each other on their island; they love each other, support each other, but ultimately can’t help each other.I was interested to read how the book went over with critics in Glasgow and the answer was, not very well. Some expressed they were tired of reading books about negative aspects of the city, poverty, drugs, crime and housing estates, but another that I read said, basically, it is what it is. Not all of these are in this book but the picture painted is bleak enough. The residents have been hit hard by Thatcherism and hope is scarce and this was also a theme, in my opinion, making the characters mean and mercenary. I really enjoyed the book; even if Agnes exhausted me through the last part, I think that this is what the author intended., that you feel as worn down as Shuggie, Agnes and the family. This is a book I may go back to one day....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 23, 2023","Aug 29, 2023","Feb 12, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57091322-shuggie-bain

(For example, an unexplained rape which seems to have no relation to the story or later consequences.) the book is poetic, I’ll give it that, and reads as a sort of cobbled-together fairy tale, like a Chaucer outtake, but to quote the little old lady in that old Wendy’s commercial, “Where’s the beef?” The sparsely-populated pilgrimage to Jerusalem was short but better than the rest of the book, which doesn’t say much, in my opinion.

However as is common in most This was the penultimate novel by Toni Morrison and even though it’s short, it leaves no doubt – this woman could WRITE! However as is common in most writers in their latter years, the novel is short and doesn’t quite compare to her earlier work - but that’s not saying much when you take into consideration what that earlier work consisted of. And what still comes through is the intensity and anger, as well as the vivid portrait of Afro-American life earlier in the 20th century.The story revolves around Frank Money, a veteran of the Korean War who’s returned with a PTSD that has left him wandering for a year, a vagabond with a drinking problem and flashbacks. The other main character is Cee, his four-years-younger sister, for whom he´s always been responsible due to their parents’ working all day in the cotton fields (before their deaths). They’re in the care of a grandmother who resents their presence and emotionally abuses Cee while disapproving of Frank and his friends. He and his friends only dream of escaping their tiny Georgia town and enlisting for Korea is their chance.The first four parts are a flashback accompanied by a character study, of Frank, Cee, the lover Frank leaves behind when he returns to Georgia to rescue Cee, and the grandmother; the lover is barely referred to afterwards and the grandmother only as an example of someone who felt she was better than everyone else because of her money but learns something about community, as do Frank and Cee. Mixed into all this are references to popular culture, the Red Scare of the 50’s and, of course, the evils done to blacks including a horrible episode involving eugenics. (Prepare to Google a bit; some of the references are a little obscure.)What I had problems with in the book is the lack of development of some parts, and the lack of Toni Morrison’s usual subtlety, although it’s present in that none of the characters are identified as black or white – you can figure that part out yourself. The book is definitely worth reading and its short length means that won’t take long.

She was waiting tables andAnyone who has read Ann Patchett’s memoir of how she became a writer, “The Getaway Car”, knows about this, her first novel. She was waiting tables and while she worked, she was writing her first novel in her head with the intention of putting it to paper when she got home at night. Of course, anyone who had ever done this kind of job knows you’re too exhausted to do much of anything when you get home so the novel didn’t quite arrive to its eventual publication so easily but that’s all in her memoir. (In fact, a lot of her novels are rewrites of her memoirs – “Commonwealth”, for example.)This novel didn’t quite work for me, for all its polishing, because most of the characters didn’t work for me. It has all the marks of a first novel, beautiful writing at times and partially-developed characters mixed with a lot of plot-stretching; that is to say, it’s hard to say what motivates the principal actors to do what they do or act in ways that seem to be inexplicable, and she doesn’t bother to justify it either. I felt the presence of a lot of plotlines which painted her in a corner with no way out so she ignored them.She described this as a choral novel, which it is in a sense, but one where one character picks up where another leaves off. We start with Rose, a young woman adrift in her San Diego-area beach town with a stunningly-beautiful mother (much like Ann’s). Rose doesn’t quite know what she wants so she marries the man who has been mooning after her for years at church, a teacher who teaches her to drive. This is the key to Rose’s freedom as she only wants to drive around all day, sometimes taking trips so far that she doesn’t arrive home to make dinner. When she becomes pregnant, she decides to leave him, take the car and drive cross-country to a Catholic home for unwed mothers in Kentucky to have her baby there. She also takes over the cooking, replacing an aging nun (much like Ann’s favorite nun.) A lot of Rose’s character is amorphous; she either cannot or chooses not to explain herself. She chooses not to give up her baby and marries again without divorcing her first husband and if her first husband is the weakest, most over-indulgent milquetoast ever, her second husband is not far behind. And so it goes, he picks up the story and part three is the daughter finishing it up.I had several problems with this novel but the biggest was a problem all-too-common in literature which is when a writer tries to get into the head of a character of the opposite gender; if Ann Patchett thought that this is how men think and act, I beg to differ because these men accepted EVERYTHING without the least intention to protest, just whine a little (but not too loud, lest Rose take it badly.) Rose isn’t a violent and morose woman, she’s just unknowable, even to herself apparently, cold and selfish, and they choose to worship her rather than question her. This is in a sense the second problem: Rose is never explained so after the first part, we have absolutely no idea what’s in her head and why she seems so furious and intolerant with the world. (Apparently Ann liked her though because she appears in a later novel, “Run”, as a cook.) In the third part, the daughter spends a lot of time and feels a lot of anguish trying to connect to her mother who seems totally unconnected to her, to the point of leaving her to others to raise. (The details of all this are what makes the novel so this isn’t really a plot-spoiler but a reflection.) Rose is the unknowable center of this novel but it was an unsatisfactory mystery for me. In a sense, she feels like the female embodiment of the man who’s always taking off because he can’t commit to anyone or anything so indulges his own urge to move on without regard for anyone else. No responsibility, just leave the others to work things out. In the end, I couldn’t identify or even sympathize with any of them, except possibly the daughter. I only felt cheated.(Added January 2024: the state of Florida has blacklisted this book in schools and what better recommendation can you ask for? As Ann Patchett said, you'd think that a book where teenage girls give their babies up for adoption would be just the message they'd embrace but no - maybe it's because they haven't even read it?)...more",Notes are private!,3,15,1,"Nov 17, 2022","Nov 23, 2022","Nov 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1057081.The_Patron_Saint_of_Liars

He was a career criminal from a troubled background who spent much of his youth and early adult years behind bars in California prisons, including San Quentin, and ended up trapped because even when he wanted to go straight, no one would give him a job. This was the theme of probably his best novel, “No Beast So Fierce”, the rights of which were bought by Dustin Hoffman and made into the film “Straight Time” – a critical success but not much at the box office. However, he was then able to make it as an author, screenwriter, consultant and actor in small parts.This is not his best book because although his strength in knowing the life as a small-time criminal shines, his awkwardness in sustained narratives, particularly pacing, shows. There are strong parts and weak parts in this book and it didn’t flow for me. The idea is nothing new, three long-time criminals are free and ready to give up their lives of crime forever – after one last big score. Thea character development is good and obviously he has no problem with the mind-set but a lot of this reads like a college or army reunion; they meet former fellow convicts and catch up on what others are doing. (“Do you remember…?”, “He passed away, cancer”, “What about…?”, “He’s doing okay, has a bar in…”, “Hey, remember the time when….?”) Interesting but there’s so much of this that it feels like filler. The action is a long time coming and the ending, and is well-developed, especially for each member of the group, but you have to wait. (Of course, there’s also a lot of famous name-dropping, just like Bunker did in real life; they mention Danny Trejo, for example, an ex-con who’s typecast as the typical Mexican thug in films and now has a Mexican cookbook; Google it and you’ll recognize him immediately!)I enjoyed the book; I particularly enjoyed the authenticity and atmosphere of ex-cons meeting and trying to make it in the world outside, but it’s not a must-read.

I saw Ian McEwan read this book before it was released, when he was in Chile for a symposium on climate change. We were all enthused. My balloon of enthusiasm has now been popped. The book's protagonist, Michael Beard, is in every part of the book; no other characters express their opinions or points-of-view, so you're stuck with Mike - but who is he? A short, fat, thoroughly egocentric serial philanderer, married five times, a glutton for food and alcohol and thief of intellectual property who will stop at literally nothing to advance himself or save himself the trouble of facing up to his messes and the messes he leaves for others, even if he has to frame them and send them to prison. ""Dislikeable"" doesn't even begin to describe him, nor does he fit into the category of ""loveable rogue"", he's just plain detestable.However, he serves a purpose as an allegory for all the talk about ""saving the world from climate change"" because while there are many who ""talk the talk"", there are few who are willing to make the necessary sacrifices. (Like taking public transport to climate change rallies and protests instead of driving, or recycling, or a dozen other things.) Michael Beard knows he has to change but finds it inconvenient, and he in fact admits that all the possibilities he has to make these changes will never happen because he doesn't want to give up anything. (McEwan says he was inspired on a trip to see the results of climate change when the ""boot room"" where gear was stored descended into utter chaos as people just grabbed whatever gear was convenient rather than look for their own.)There were some well-written comic scenes but most just dragged on and the ending was anti-climatic in the extreme, making an unsatisfactory reading experience even more so.

(Hold clarion call while the needle scratches.) He has fallen in love with his second baseman, D.J. Pickett – brings a whole new meaning to “double-play combination”, doesn’t it?The author, Peter Lefcourt, is an accomplished television writer, winning an award for “Cagney and Lacey”, and this can be seen not only in the tight writing but a plot that seems to follow a TV movie bullet-point outline. There’s little character development, just a bunch of stereotypes we can easily recognize, but that’s not unusual in farce; since the book is from 1992, though, some of these fall a little flat: all of the Southerners are rednecks and crackers with names like Billy Bob Bob, there’s an Hispanic player, nicknamed “Spic”, who has been in the majors for years but still can’t speak any English beyond a string of obscenities, and a bored Egyptian psychiatrist who doesn’t seem to understand the weight of what’s going on but basically tells Randy to go with his feelings because they are what they are.As can be expected, Randy tries to deny his feelings, and D.J. is gay and knows the grief that can come with this but falls for the big lug anyway. The truth is that this, and the feelings of Randy’s wife, are all handled sensitively - this is all done well – and the story follows predicable lines of clandestine meetings, misunderstandings, discovery and nationwide scandal - hence “The Dreyfus Affair” – and everyone divided along the lines of what’s technically legal but what’s not “in the best interests of baseball.” America just can’t have the reputation of the National Pastime sullied by this type of behavior, can it? (There is a Hollywood ending as homophobia strikes out, but this is hardly a spoiler.)I chose this book because we’re in baseball playoff season and this is a sport which is perfectly suited to novels since the game isn’t so much continuous action as a series of plays; this is why in days gone by, sportscasters could invent a play-by-play off a teletype machine. (Such as in the famous Ronald Reagan anecdote about how the teletype broke down and he had the batter fouling off pitches for 20 minutes until they could get it up and running again.) It’s also a sport prone to sex scandals, including my personal favorite from 1973 when Yankee left-handed pitchers, Fritz Peterson and Mike Kekich made a spring season trade – their wives and children. Baseball was not ready for this in 1973 and I don’t think they’re ready yet. (For the record, Mike Kekich and Marilyn Peterson didn’t last long but Fritz Peterson and Barbara Kekich are still going strong.) I love baseball and the book was pretty damn good as well.(When I was reading this, I remembered another sex scandal, with a literary connection. Bernard Malamud's 1952 novel ""The Natural"" - which was later made into a Robert Redford film with a completely different ""Hollywood"" ending, - was based on the shooting three years earlier of Phillies player Eddie Waitkus who was stalked and shot by an obsessed female fan. For what it's worth, I liked the book's ambiguity more than the film's cheesy finale, but that's just me.)...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 09, 2022","Oct 12, 2022","Oct 09, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/452940.The_Dreyfus_Affair

(I read those in grammar school, like most of you; it makes you wonder what critics are complaining about when they say kids today are exposed to needless violence.) There are also more comic versions usually based on being forced to hear some song or group on repeat through eternity. Tsutsui’s version is both more innocuous and far less so. Each of the characters finds himself in the next world, in Hell, and decides that all those horror stories are greatly overrated because they are enjoying some of the best moments of their lives, over and over, until it dawns on them that these moments had consequences that they’d rather forget; indeed, that’s just what they had done in life, ignoring the consequences of their rash or insensible actions. The torture isn’t physical or mental, like when someone reminds of some fun moment in your past but as the person repeats it, or the memory comes back, you realize your “fun” may have been less so for someone else and now your conscience won’t let you forget it. It all ended in tears and now it’s your turn to suffer. (An example that wasn’t in the book: the kid that you and your classmates laughed at; now that we’re older, we realize how hurtful that might have been but we’d rather not dwell on it. However since this is a website of bookworms, there’a fair chance that many of us weren’t with the “cool” kids.)This is my second Tsutsui book, after “The Girl Who Leapt Through Time”, which was more YA than a book with adult themes, and which explains why I didn’t like it all that much. “Hell” was much subtler, more engaging, as I identified with the characters wondering what the big deal about the place was. This version of Hell is strictly personal and based on the idea that we’d just as soon forget things we’re not particularly proud of, and Hell means you can’t. Ever. For eternity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Oct 2022,"Oct 02, 2022","Oct 02, 2022",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6319227-hell

The story here is of a man with an uncontrollable disorder which causes him to suddenly take off, with no apparent warning, on long walks which only end when he collapses from exhaustion. It’s left to his wife to retrieve him from wherever he’s ended up, at any hour day or night. There is no diagnosis, no explanation, let alone a cure, for whatever it is that causes him to do this. He’s a high-priced attorney in a powerful New York law firm and this will have its cost eventually but meanwhile, we have the image of this eminent attorney walking around the office with a backpack full of all the things he’ll need, such as warm clothing, water, and (if I remember) energy bars. Is it tragedy or comedy? Just like in the Niffenegger book, it’s the wife who suffers as much or more because she has to watch her husband deal with this disorder but is a prisoner to it as well. The couple here also has a teenage daughter, who’s caught in all the usual teenage traumas; she’s overweight and has a dad who’s weird in such an embarrassing way that it doesn’t even bear mentioning. She feels he could control this if he really wanted to; not like her with her weight, which is the real problem, but which she’d rather not discuss, either.The second half of the book is melancholic, poetic and sad; it deals really with the nature of love in a marriage and a family, in dealing with an illness that you can’t see or understand but tears at the fiber of these relationships and destroying lives, leaving this frustrating devastation. However, I couldn’t get a grip on the book, with its weird illness. However, after a month away, it began to occur to me; the book can be seen as an allegory. An illness that often the sufferer feels coming – in the book, he has a kit ready at home and they have a drill for when he “knows” it’s about to happen again – and which takes his family along as helpless bystanders, like watching a locomotive moving slowly towards them and no power to stop it. I began to think of mental illness or more specifically, clinical depression, where the sufferer passes through an episode, there’s no recurrence for months or years and they think it’s over and passed – but it’s not. In this sense, I think the book has clear parallels and combined with the elegant prose, it’s a sort of lament for the devastating effects of an illness that no one can really understand and that receives comments like, “You could control it if you really wanted to. You just need to snap out of it!” Like its victims are just attention-seekers.Ironically, I read this book while my wife was bed-ridden with COVID during my vacation from work – I followed a few days after – so I had a lot of time to think but the book’s impact didn’t really sink in. I was caught up by the style of a book I couldn’t get a handle on – and I may be completely wrong here – and worrying about my wife. I enjoyed a previous book by Jonathan Ferris, “And Then We Came to the End”, which could also be seen as devastation to a family unit, in that case an office and its co-workers. (Weird coincidence, maybe people found it pretentious and gimmicky because it was written in the first-person plural, a strange device – and I read “The Virgin Suicides” just after, which used the same device!) I’m not sure this book is for everybody and my own take may prejudice anyone else’s by giving them a preconception but it’s worth reading for the writing alone, and may be food for thought as well....more",Notes are private!,1,7,1,"Sep 18, 2022","Sep 21, 2022","Sep 18, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/7522659-the-unnamed

He’s the man who always gets away with things by being just a little more clever than those who oppose him and the man whose always there for the women in his life but can’t be counted on to be something more serious or permanent. In this sequel to “Nobody´s Fool”, which was made into a film with Paul Newman, we find a Sully who is feeling the effects of age in a way that many of us with this same problem can easily identify with. His doctor has warned him that his heart could give out at any moment but he chooses to be willfully oblivious; for once in his life, he has something to fear, something he can’t “wise-guy” his way around in a swift maneuver. At 70, his body isn’t what it was and even his long-standing affair with Ruth, the café owner who he still helps out every morning, has come to a halt, mostly because it’s run out of steam. (Or at least Sully has.) Ruth is also facing up to many of the problems that come with time and now has her daughter and granddaughter living with her, the daughter whose violent ex-con ex-husband is coming to look for her to seek revenge; he put her in the hospital once and that may have not been enough for him. There are also Rub, Sully’s sidekick, who idolizes Sully but fears that Sully no longer feels the same affection for him; Doug Raymer whose wife was about to leave him before she fell down the steps on her way out the door and broke her neck, leaving him with an obsession to find out who it was she was on her way to meet and the certainty that he is a failure as police chief as well; Gus Moynihan whose wife has sadly slipped; and Carl Roebuck, the constructor whose slipshod projects (and slipshod life) are about to collapse around him; and other new characters who weren’t in the first book. Except for the ex-con, there are no villains, only people whose lives are now coming to the point where they can’t escape consequences from what they might have done in the past – in short, what worked then ain’t working now. At one point, Doug muses that “it (is) a shame, indeed a crying shame, though probably not a crime, to be unequal to the most important tasks you’ve been given.” How true.The story has several threads as it follows each character through the trials and tribulations of the bad hands they’ve been dealt – or to be honest, that they’ve dealt themselves. This is probably the great attraction of the book for me, how we often bemoan bad luck or outside forces for the situations we find ourselves in when the fault can be placed on the person we see in the mirror, and we damn well know it. Again Doug: “(He) had naturally been attracted to women who were a step or two ahead of him, though naturally that was most of them.” He’s not the only one. And when women complain about the men they married or with whom they had a relationship, they also know who chose them.This is a book that I could keep on my shelf and open it at any time to lift my spirits. (Unfortunately, mine was a pirated copy, downloaded and printed out, so it’s been recycled; I can’t play the “open the book to a random page” game with it.) However, I’m sure I’ll find a copy during my remaining “used-bookshop-rat” days and treasure it for the lift it will give me....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,Sep 2022,"Sep 10, 2022","Sep 01, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/27208517-everybody-s-fool

I can't say this was a favorite book for me and I may have been better served starting somewhere else in his oeuvre but this is what I came across in my rounds of used bookstores. The story is told four times, from the point of view of three of the male characters, each with his own point-of-view, and takes place in an Alexandria hotel which has probably seen better days, revolving around a girl from the country who arrives to work there. There's a generational gap here as well as the owner, a widow, and two of the guests, two retired political figures, are somewhat trapped in the past and how they arrived at this point.

However, Isabel Allende has turned out a rather mundane prequel to the story of Zorro which is more Danielle Steel than anything else.

Not boring but the heart didn't soar, the triumphs seemed more amusing than heroic, and I just never got into it.

That pretty much sums up this book as two generations of families in China suffer the repercussions of revolution, one under Mao Tse-Tung’s land reforms, and the other with the Cultural Revolution culminating in Tiananmen Square. (The title actually refers to the Chinese version of “The Internationale”.) There are several eras referred to in the book as it zigs and zags back and forth, filling in the gaps in the story for Marie, the daughter of two who escaped and the exact story of whom she is trying to understand. In fact, the reader is hooked immediately when Marie starts by saying that her father left them twice, once when he ended his marriage and the second when he took his own life; obviously there are gaps to be filled. Marie mirrors the author, the first child born in Vancouver after immigration who, according to her mother, spoke “crooked” Chinese. Marie’s search for the story is sparked by the arrival (or better-said, escape) from China of Ai-Ming, someone with an unexplained connection to the family. The story unfolds with classical music as it’s background, particularly Bach and Shostakovich, and this is intertwined with traditional Chinese music and poetry. The story takes its time in unfolding but is a tragic and horrifying vision of the Chinese curse, “may you live in interesting times.” The family is constantly on the wrong side of history; even when they try to follow the tide, fanaticism finds them out and even when their love is music, it’s the shifting politics of the times which makes survival almost impossible. I really liked this book, in spite of some niggling details, and was worth the long wait before I finally had the chance to read it Some questions are answered, some perhaps can never be answered, but I think that anyone trying to understand their family’s past will find this; the answers, if any, are carried to the grave and you’re left with your own version that will just have to satisfy you....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 20, 2022","Jul 02, 2022","Jun 20, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/27876282-do-not-say-we-have-nothing

However, it’s told from the point-of-view of a man whose mind has started to go and not only is he trying to convince the nurse to run away with him, but he’s lost in time as he promises to take her to mansions that are now parking lots and land which has long since left the family’s hands, reporting conversations with people dead for decades as though they’d taken place just the day before, etc. Some readers objected to the vulgarity of some memories but he’s old and has long lost any sense of correct behavior. (You don’t have to wait long to get to the memories because on about the second page, he tells of being with his father in Paris at a young age and his father throwing coins on the floor which the French prostitutes picked up with using fingers or toes; if you know something about sleazy strip joints, you can imagine what part of their body they use.) A less puritanical reason for not liking the book is that his mind’s constant wandering through time, mixing present and past so freely, can make it difficult to follow. So, even if it’s a very short book, you have to frequently pay close attention to where he is in time, what’s real and what’s imaginary.My biggest problem is that I didn’t find a lot of humor particularly humorous, just sad, and the second problem was that I was constantly reminded of Gabriel García Marquez and “Memories of My Melancholy Whores” to which this book can’t even compare. In no way is this a bad book but it was unsatisfactory for me. It may be much better in Portuguese as people who read it in the original language seemed to like it a lot better, so maybe it was just me.

Started some years before the coup d’état that brought Pinochet to power while Donoso was in self-exile in Spain, it was finished afterwards and thus changed as he wrote it – not through rewrites but plot development, meaning the story changed as Chile changed. There are some characters fairly obviously modeled after personalities of the time as he took obvious shots at the upper classes; for instance, a doctor who “descends” to treat the “savages” (local farmers and workers) and is subsequently locked up and punished, but escapes to lead a revolt, an obvious allusion to Salvador Allende. His treatment of the upper class (of which he himself was a part) is brutal.The story revolves around a family, made up of seven or so siblings plus spouses and 30-odd cousins, who retreats to a summer house every year. They have no contact with the local population except for one brother who trades with the locals. The locals mine gold in abysmal conditions which they sell for a meagre amount of money and goods and it’s this profit which sustains the family. None of the rest of the family has the least idea of what work or business is, they only entertain themselves with social gatherings in other months and various games and entertainments in the house. The gold is sold to Europeans of a vague nationality and here is another poke at these upper-class Chileans because while the Chileans consider that their wealth makes them the equals, the Europeans are unimpressed by a group of South Americans, seeing them as little different than the local population.Early on, the story gives a hint of what’s to come, with the doctor declared by them as insane, transported in a cage every summer from the city and kept tied up in a room. From there, we have stories of homosexuality, rape, incest, murder, cannibalism, as well as other acts too horrible to describe, all with the idea of “drawing a thick veil” around them; that is, these are not things that are talked about. (Donoso’s adopted daughter used this idea of the “túpido velo” as the title of her biography of her tormented father and autobiography of her tormented self; she later committed suicide.) Dirty laundry is not washed in public and their social status keeps them immune from scandal in their own minds.Later in the first half, the adults prepare for an outing, a daytrip for a picnic at a waterfall near the house, a place almost completely unknown to them as they would never dare venture from the grounds which are protected from the “savages” by a high fence of cast-iron spears. They bring along a quantity of servants but leave the children in the care of other servants and this is where the next fantasy kicks in because in the second half we find they've been gone for one day in their minds but one year in reality. I thought this was a bit out of the spirit of the book but key to what follows because they return to a completely changed world where chaos has broken loose and what evolves is open warfare between some members of the family and servants on one side and other family members and servants on the other, with results just as horrible as those in the first half. The mix between black humor and horror makes the two hard to distinguish. Understanding Chile helps in identifying references but it’s not necessary for enjoyment.What is necessary? A good translation as this was the worst I’ve ever seen; it seemed not to have been translated by a person but by Google Translate and anyone who’s used an online translator for work knows what that means. It was at times incomprehensible because of the differences in pronouns between English and Spanish. A short example: in Spanish, “su” can mean “his / her / its / their / you”, depending on the context. Similarly, it’s common to skip “he / she / it” and all other personal pronouns as they are reflected in the verb-form and context. So, a human sees the context and immediately uses the correct forms; Google Translate sees a sentence in Spanish, says “WTF” and you get some sort of mixed-gender sentence, with personal and possessive pronouns chosen at random. Furthermore, slang is beyond Google’s understanding so I had a sentence where the speaker kept interjecting “eggs” into every sentence; it took me a few moments to understand that the translator was reading “huevón” which translates literally into “big egg” but is an interjection meaning in this context, “man” or “guy”. (“So, do you understand what I mean, man? “Man, I couldn’t believe what that guy said.”) It can also be pejorative and put into verb and noun forms – a very flexible word! But nothing to do with eggs.So, I can recommend the book but look for a later translation because mine was absolutely horrible.

She’s from old money, so old that although everyone knows, no one ever talks about it in polite company. (Can you say “slaves”? Does anyone ever ask the Kennedys about bootlegging? Probably not.) Nor do they work at jobs, they just pass the time. He’s the son of a family of industrialists, a steel company built and run by his father, ready to be passed on to the son. He has no interest in working, though, just enjoying a life of yachts, beaches and dedication to his semi-autobiographical novel where he rips into rich industrialists exploiting the working class. (When I was in university, all the communists were well-off because the rest of his couldn’t afford to “throw off our shackles”, and when I lived in Eastern Europe, I found that communism had inspired capitalism in its purest form, exchanges of goods and services instead of worthless currency.) She indulges his caprices because she has the money to do so – until she doesn’t because her parents are dead and have left her almost nothing while he has been spending as if the money were limitless. Does he get a job or take a position in his father’s company? No, he is a jerk – a wastrel - who immediately starts an affair and expects her to do the same. Meanwhile, while she hasn’t had a paying job, she has been running a household with three small children and one layabout husband – no small potatoes, although he wouldn’t know anything about it, his only advice to her being she should discover and develop her full potential. As if she has time.The story is told through various eyes: hers, his, her mother, his lover and the oldest child, the nine-year-old daughter who plays a key role in the book. I enjoyed the book but I can’t deny a certain anger at the idle rich in it and the comedy of errors which ensues is almost tragic. The 9-year-old was my heroine but there were too many characters who could have benefitted from a swift kick in the pants so in the end, I would have renamed it “Plenty of Unease.” Not a first-line recommendation but different....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 23, 2022","Apr 29, 2022","Apr 23, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/52651633-sons-and-daughters-of-ease-and-plenty

The most well-known of these (not counting Franz Kafka) is Milan Kundera, largely known through the film adaption of “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” but there was also the 1966 Oscar-winning adaption of Bohumil Hrabal’s “Closely Watched Trains”; both authors are highly recommendable and if you want a taste of typical dark Czech humor, Kundera’s “The Farewell Party” or Hrabal’s “Too Close a Solitude” (especially for avid readers), “The Little Town Where Time Stood Still” or “I Served the King of England” will do nicely. I am also a big fan of Josef Škvorecký whose “The Republic of Whores” had me on the floor, but whose “The Bride of Texas” was an interesting historical novel about the role of Czechs in the American Civil War. (I didn’t much like the worldwide favorite “The Good Soldier Švejk”, probably due to the translation.) However, all of these are either dead or, in the case of Kundera, getting close. (He’s now a curmudgeon living in France who’s famous for being extremely rude to anyone who asks him for an interview or guidance.)There are living authors, too, that I can recommend such as Ivan Klima or Iva Pekárková and all of these post-WW2 writers share a common topic, life under Communism, ranging from oppression to forced dirty deals to life-goes-on-in-a-village. This book by Tomás Zmeškal is no exception and has the interesting distinction of being by the only black Czech writer. (This doesn’t come up in this book but in another of his books.) Before the war, Josef meets Květa at a lecture on the deciphering of cuneiforms by the Czech scholar Hrozný; he falls for her and to his surprise, she chooses him over his friend and rival for her affections. Later, during communism, he is arrested for unknown reasons and she is forced to call on this ex-suitor, who now has power, to improve her husband’s conditions and he demands a certain “payment” in return. The story is told through various points-of-view, not necessarily chronological, by Květa, Josef, their daughter and a close family friend and psychiatrist. There are some amusing moments, too; typical Czech absurdity involving the doctor and a would-be burglar, and a visit from a British relative who arrives for the first time in Czechoslovakia and tries to describe the country to his sister. (Of particular note, the Czech tradition of carp-killing at Christmas; yes, I was also stunned when I first saw it and, yes, I know it’s a part of other Eastern-European cultures, too.) However, the focus of the book is on the rupture caused by her trying to help his ten-year prison stay by consorting with his “enemy.” There are many things here which are very Czech, such as the cottage in the country which undergoes unlimited alterations. (I once saw a BBC architecture special which featured the designed adaptability of these cottages.) There is also Josef’s Kafkian attempt to seek some sort of justice through the post-communist bureaus who promised this as part of the “new” regime. Unlike the East Germans, the Czechs mostly destroyed the files of who implicated who since so many good people had been forced to cooperate. (“Do you have any information on something your neighbor allegedly said in conversation at the market? We know your son is an intelligent young man and we’d like to see him keep his place at the university and not have to work in the coal mines…”) The book is about the tragedy caused by the regime, the human cost at such a personal level, driving a wedge between two people in love and the collateral damage to the family who have to step around this breech.I felt that some storylines were left dangling or abruptly ended, giving the novel a patchwork feel at times but I liked it very much and would recommend it to anyone who’s looking to break out of Russian literature but see another view of Eastern Europe.

He grew up not only a military brat but the son of a liaison officer between the USIA and the CIA, hence “Tree of Smoke”. He also spent his 20’s in a drug and alcohol haze, hence “Angels” and “Jesus’s Son”. Another brilliant and beautiful novel was “Train Dreams.” This was his attempt at a post-apocalyptic novel, something which obviously isn’t from experience, and it was a bit uneven for me (although any post-apocalyptic novel that begins with clarinet lessons already has something going for it!) Of course, the problem with this subject is that there have been a lot and although unfair, it’s hard to read one without comparing it to another.The story takes place on an island that resembles Cuba after an apparent nuclear event. On the island are several enclaves of different ethnicities and backgrounds who trade and share with another. There are various storylines mostly involving the music professor, his student and the student’s family members. An entire culture has evolved there, with new rituals and customs, messiahs, marijuana, plus terrible stories about the mainland around Miami. It is a very interesting mix and this is done well but aa lot of this is a mix between superstition, myth, legend and fact but it was hard for me to separate them at times. In other hands, this might be called “magical realism” but it can equally be called “reinventing the past” since there are few people who can recall what exactly happened and it becomes a matter for them of combining all of the above to form a narrative.For me, I may have had problems with the book because I’ve read too many post-apocalyptic stories and may not have been in the mood for something where it was hard to separate the parts and say what was really happening and what was just some poetic riff; I just couldn’t pin this book down. I’d certainly recommend it for the writing, less so for the storylines themselves, as well mixed and developed as they are.

This is, as others have appointed out, more of a “whydunnit”, as the events are recalled which led to Louise’s horrible act. As much as this is billed as an example of classism, it’s also a picture of someone marginalized all her life is unable to deal with life’s problems, always subservient to those around her and incapable of managing or solving any of the problems she’s forced to face, none of which are caused by her, and how quickly she’s discarded or abandoned by those around her when she is no longer of use. The plotlines had some holes as storylines were left undeveloped or unresolved and not everything about Louise’s predicament is fully explained. This seems more a story to demonstrate inequities in French society rather than a more complete character study and exploration; that is to say, these lines seem to lead nowhere because the author discarded them as beside the point – such as the fate of the daughter – or just too difficult to tie up without writing a whole new set of scenes.I can see how this won the Goncourt Prize because I can imagine how the French wouldn’t particularly care about tying up plotlines while making a point about society as a whole; the details are not the point that matters.

There are peripheral characters as well but this kind of mix needs superb juggling habits and the author is a little heavy-handed at times, particularly with the comedy; it alternates between poignancy and slapstick at times, with the “pedal to the metal” a little too often. It tries too hard.I read this book because I know Steve Earle as a singer-songwriter, and this through Shawn Colvin’s cover of “Someday”. Generally, in my opinion speaking the two genres don’t mix well, novelist and songwriter, as the use and quantity of words is so different unless we’re talking about a sparse prose which is more a series of images than a detailed novel. (One case that I'm looking forward to exploring are Leonard Cohen's novels.)

Is it any stranger to think of coexisting with spirits and curses with a physical presence in nature than to worship someone on a cross who you’ve never seen or met and light candles to saints? In any case, it’s a comfort to feel accompanied, even if it’s by something you can’t quite understand and feel there are ramifications for misdeeds, that the good will be rewarded and the evil punished if not in this life, then the next. But what happens when this “primitive” belief collides with the “modern” world? Can they coexist? In this book, they can.Kayo, a Ghanaian London-trained forensic pathologist, is ordered by the government against his will to investigate the mysterious remains of something unidentifiable in a village far from the city. Here, where his mother’s people originated, he’s almost at home but must reconcile the modern with the traditional. Unlike similar stories, this doesn’t result in a battle between the two but a merging of the two worlds as the leaders of this village are as interested in the possibilities of gaining knowledge through the modern methods as Kayo is in trying to understand the ancient. In short, the two worlds coalesce, unite and complement each other. After all, there are things which can be identified and classified with what we know and those maybe beyond understanding. Justice can come in many forms in this book.For me, this was the charm of the book, the idea of two worlds living in harmony without any sort of disparaging one or the other nor one winning out over the other in the end. The author is a poet and this shows in his language and ability in invoke this for the reader in the story while not being disrespectful of either; after all, who really knows?

(The + is becauI had the privilege of seeing Rod Stewart in-person 2+ times, once in August 1975 in the last days of the Faces and once in 1979 solo. (The + is because at a 1975 Led Zeppelin concert, Ronnie Wood came out for the encore – “the newest member of the Rolling Stone” – to jam and at the end, Rod Stewart was physically carried out to wave; I was in no condition to tell you what they played and he was in no condition to stand, let alone sing, so I guess it was a draw.) Whether these two performances can be considered concerts or just shows is debatable, just as whether this book is all that good is really a matter of opinion. Rod has been called “the laziest man in rock” because it feels like he does the bare minimum; there’s a lot of show and performance but it all feels a little sloppy, kind of frat house stuff, and while it’s entertaining, you can wonder where the passion and sweat are. His idols from soul and blues left it all on the stage because their audiences wouldn’t accept less but these shows felt more like Vegas or supper club stuff. Which brings me to the book.Rod also has the reputation of being one of the nicest and down-to-earth guys you could meet., which I can easily believe because there’s not a bad word about anyone here, not even the publicist he fired who then went on to invent one of the great rock legends – or rock myths – to revenge himself upon Rod. (For those not up on the story, which I heard MANY times with only slight variations in details, Rod allegedly went to a bikers’ bar and “serviced” every customer there, on his knees, after which he had to have his stomach pumped; the quantity of “material” which had to be pumped was usually about a gallon in most of the stories I heard and anyone with even the vaguest idea of how many bikers would be needed to produce a gallon would see through the story but critical thought is not always a strong point here.) The most Rod said was that the publicist was very good at his job.A huge middle part of the book is dedicated to the two protuberances on the front of his body, meaning his sexual and cocaine exploits, with names named, and how he could have maintained some of the relations with some of the world’s most beautiful women if he hadn’t been a slave to the lower one and how he almost lost his voice forever due to stuffing white powder in the upper one. As for the latter, he insists he wasn’t an addict, it was just part of the lifestyle, and as for the second… as he sings, “some guys have all the luck, some guys do nothing but complain.” There are a lot of crocodile tears here about he just COULDN’T stay faithful with all these beautiful women constantly forcing themselves on him. As a university professor, this has been less problematic for me and as a red-blooded hetero male, this could be my first case of ”penis envy” – but it isn’t. I hate whining from people who have it all but don’t appreciate it. He’s an excellent entertaainer but a better whiner than singer, and these parts really call for violins and hearts bleeding. He doesn’t blame the women for his broken marriages and relationships, he laments being and absent father (and when he is present, it seems to be all fun and games with the kids, nothing about the work involved in single motherhood.) If this had taken up a couple of chapters, fine, but it was at least 50-60% of the book and the fact that he feels bad about it doesn’t mitigate the number of pages he spends on it.So, that’s it for me. If you just want a good time, on the page or at the show, Rod’s your man. If you’re looking for something a little less fluffy, he ain’t. I still love the incredible run of albums he had from the early to late 70’s, but starting with “Do Ya Think I’m Sexy?”, almost everything just seemed like something to cash in on. This book felt to me like one more. (P.S. Rod: I got this book via an illegal download. Sorry.

So, I read s like, “Oh, I only read the chapters with the dog, the rest wasn’t interesting, I couldn’t understand it…” These are the people that Cliff Notes and Classics Illustrated were designed for because this book is about much more than that. Hopefully, she wasn’t reading for a homework assignment.A little unnecessary but interesting background gives you an idea of what may be behind all this: the author, Sigrid Nunez, was not only the amanuensis for Susan Sontag but nearly married the son, so much of what the unnamed narrator experiences may be tied up in that. Her mentor has died by his own hand, leaving no note, but one of his last instructions to his third and last wife was to leave the dog to his disciple. The dog is an arthritic middle-aged Great Dane who the mentor found running loose in Central Park and who no one ever claimed. (In real life, hard to believe, but this is a novel…) Although the narrator likes dogs, she lives in a Manhattan apartment and it’s never occurred to her to have one. There are trials and tribulations involved with having an enormous dog thrust on you and having to suddenly share an apartment with him but this is not the point of the book because the title refers not only to the dog but to her mentor, former lover and long-time friend. Her mentor’s departure was sudden and unexpected and she never had the chance to say goodbye; her new companion’s will be gradual but inevitable. As the vet warns her, big dogs don’t live as long and he’s already showing the signs of aging; the time will soon come to make “the decision.”However, this is only half the book because this is alternated with a description of the process of writing and being an author. Her mentor was on the verge of publishing a new book after a long drought and one of her colleagues had a spectacular debut as a writer, rave s, a prize-winning novel - and then nothing, with all the depression that comes with it. (She’s referred to behind her back as Ms. OP so I suppose it was the Orange Prize.) The narrator also teaches writing (of course) and reflects on her classes and students whose ideas on writing differ from hers. In both parts, I suspect her life with Susan Sontag enter into the story in some way.So, it’s a dog book and it isn’t; the dog draws her out of her shell and makes her more social as well as exposing her to the fact that we generally outlive man’s best friend and sometimes our human ones, too. However, it’s also about another form of suffering, the creative process.

So, I should start by saying that the book is humorous and universally melancholy because except for the fact that the story centers around a rabbi and her four children, it could be any family struggling with identity.It begins when this renowned rabbi attends the wedding of the oldest son but things go wrong almost immediately as he decides to run off with the presiding rabbi’s wife, leaving his fiancée at the altar and everyone in total confusion and chaos. However, instead of descending into a wacky comedy, what enfolds is the development of four storylines within the family: the rabbi’s, her husband’s and those of the oldest daughter and son. (There are two younger children who play minor roles; I found them to be badly written and a distraction.) The rabbi is a minor celebrity and a scandal like this can be lived through but not so easily lived down; she also has a problem which she’s trying to keep secret. The husband is a published author of mostly forgettable biographies of minor personalities, but on the verge of a breakthrough; this threatens to overshadow his wife and he fears it could upset the balance of the marriage. The oldest son struggles between doing what’s expected of him and finding the courage to do what he wants. Finally, the oldest daughter is the second wife of an overbearing widowed congregation member, mother of a son with him and stepmother to his two daughters who make her life miserable; she’s as trapped as her sibling but weighed down by the obligations of her unwanted responsibilities which no one seems to recognize. (I liked her and her father best.) The storylines unfold in a satisfactory way and although it wasn’t the greatest book for me, it was good enough.Reading the comments from other Good Readers, I noticed some complaints about language – as in a lot of Yiddish words without a glossary – which had strange tinge of anti-Semitism because I rarely see these complaints about other books with a lot of “foreign” words; however, I may be taking it wrong. In any case, my book had a glossary so if you are really bothered with specific meanings for words – I’m not sure that’s possible because words in any language can have “flavors” beyond meanings – you should look for a book which has one. I don’t think it’s necessary but if that kind of thing bothers you, you’ve been warned.

Or how subjective it can be, depending on personal knowledge. I hate sloppily-researched semi-historical novels and the had all the earmarks of lazy armchair research – but first, the writing itself.There are two threads running in this story, one in the 40’s as Paris fell to the Nazis and the other in the 90’s when two childhood friends from Baltimore reunite to go to Berlin for the film festival premiere of a documentary about the legendary jazz group they were a part of in Berlin and Paris, featuring a young trumpeter who disappeared after being arrested by the Nazis and now presumed dead – except that one of the friends has received a letter from Poland, allegedly from the missing musician. The other is about their time in Berlin and Europe as part of the ensemble. There are two “mysteries”, one in each thread, one about whether the letter is actually from the trumpeter – not a lot of mystery here – and the other about the part the narrator may have had in his arrest. The 90’s thread is slow and dull and the 40’s just dull and slow, as it wallows in self-pity while name-dropping other jazz musicians from the time such as Louis Armstrong and King Oliver. I waited for the plot to kick into gear but alas, ‘twas not to be, just a lot of waiting to get to the point. So, what else did I have to annoy me? At one point, the two friends are in a Paris train station in 1940 amid the chaos of people trying to escape Paris before the Nazis arrive. The narrator is overwhelmed by the mass hysteria and the other says, “What, you’ve never been to an Orioles game?” Hmm, probably not unless we have Doc talking to Marty McFly in “Back to the Future” since the Orioles were still the St. Louis Browns at the time and didn’t move to Baltimore until 1954; since the Bookers and Orange are both British and the writer is Canadian-Ghanaian, this wouldn’t be noticed but to an American baseball fan, it’s an unbelievable oversight. Secondly, the writer would have us believe that a black man could live in the Polish countryside for almost 50 years, unnoticed and unmolested by anyone there. For someone who lived in Eastern Europe, this is as unbelievable as it gets. Oh, but he’s really German? Well, who could be better loved in post-World War II Poland than the Germans? Maybe the Russians? A black German living in the Polish countryside should just put a bulls-eye on his back and be done with it. (Next, she’ll be trying to sell me a Gypsy family integrated into the community…) In the end, a lot depends on what you’re unaware of or are willing to ignore. I didn’t feel a sense of jazz and the mooning romance didn’t win me over either. The book wasn’t bad, just sort of blah, crossed off my list and eliminated from my pile of books to read.

The positive part is that it shows the devastating effect that mental illness can have on a family, particularly when there seems to be some tendency and it repeats, albeit in a different form. (I am no expert on mental illness and the book doesn’t identify what the characters are suffering but the first seems to be acute depressive episodes and the second an acute anxiety disorder, although I’m not sure if this qualifies as compulsive / obsessive; none of the other ers seemed able to pinpoint it either. The ingredients for the drug cocktail are also not mentioned, except for Klonopin and Zyprexa, maybe.) This was the important part.What was disappointing for me is that the characters were mostly unsympathetic but this is nothing new in mental disorders, where people would like to sufferers to “just get over it.” They are just impatient and primarily focused on how this is disrupting their own life and making their dysfunctional family even more so. The youngest seems resentful of how he was left out and ignored by his older siblings and later retreats into his homoerotic lifestyle while looking – hoping - for a partner so he can give up cruising and computer dating. (His job as a political reporter seemed far more interesting to me but it’s not my book.) The sister is in a job and relationship which seems dead-end but with causes for optimism; a caricature of many women everywhere who feel the pressure of time running against them. There’s no real depth to her character, in my opinion, but what’s more pertinent is that she’s a social worker but shows little knowledge or interest in the drug cocktail her brother is taking. The mother is the enabler, trying to make sure that everyone is happy and looks after each other but really, they are all just into wallowing in their own mental messes. I won’t get into the tendency of mental illness being misunderstood in the 60’s and possibly overmedicated in the 80’s and 90’s, but it was.In the end, it was hard to put up with the characters’ particular problems and find them remotely likeable. Some other ers abandoned the book, unable to put up with the endless rants of the ill character but I’ve had similar experiences in the past, listening to paranoiacs, obsessives and other people with problems – I lived in New York and San Francisco, two cities that accommodate them well – and so this didn’t bother me but I was annoyed with the family.

No exception here because a very common bone to pick – I couldn’t resist, sorry… - had to do with misrepresentation of dog societal behavior and, in this case, with the idea of pecking orders and with whom they choose to mate. In this case, the author chose a traditional model of alpha-male and descending to the lowest-level dog, as well as a total indifference as to who they mate with. The naysayers pointed to research which shows dog society to be much more complex, blablabla, and I say this because it’s a novel and I don’t care much about scientific investigation, no one asked the dogs to explain themselves and for all I know, they were faking it – “Those nosy scientific bastards are watching us again; quick, act out of character!” - and because if you wait long enough, there’ll probably be another study which shows the contrary to be the case. (Does coffee give you cancer? Does it prevent cancer? Does it make no difference at all? Wait, let me get my dartboard…) The other great complaint was that the book was sad and depressing; this it was, in a sense, but dogs don’t live forever, added wisdom or consciousness is not always a blessing and it would have been hard to manage fifteen separate plotlines and have all live happily ever after. It’s not that kind of book. Besides, as Sigrid Nunez wrote in “The Friend”, dogs in novels have a tendency either to suffer or have an unhappy final. I was traumatized by the ending of “Old Yeller” and I doubt that I was the only one.The premise here is that Hermès and Apollo are on Earth and lifting a few beers at a Toronto tavern when they decide to bet: if dogs were given human cognitive and speech abilities, would any be able to die happily? Fifteen dogs are let loose from a veterinary clinic (or given the ability to free themselves) and most don’t do well because they can’t adapt to this switch. In essence, they inherit human frailties and this includes innocence and unconditional trust which doesn’t allow them to survive a world in which there are plots and plans which work against them; these changes don’t necessarily bring happiness and some would prefer to go back to what they were, just dogs. The term “dog-eat-dog” takes on meaning (and I don’t mean cannibalism but as we know the struggle between weak and strong, those who take advantage and those who are taken advantage of.) In a sense, there is the best and worst of all of us humans. However, they don’t exactly understand the human world or behavior and are frequently confused by the “illogical” way in which we behave or lack of acceptance of their ways. I won’t go into details but I had a strange take on it as an expatriate who sometimes is confused in my travels by the customs or behavior in other places; you have to adapt but not all can.I liked the book very much as a way of looking at ourselves as humans as dogs might see us and for the frequently egoistical way of thinking of other people “if they were only like us, if they only understood, they’d be much better off”, but as applied to dogs. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, especially if you can’t process what you suddenly know or integrate it.

This book was nominated for the 1970 Booker in the early days of the prize; I had read two of the books for which he was also nominated, “Reading Turgenev” and “The Story of Lucy Gault”, as well as some others and was quite looking forward to this one. And…I was underwhelmed. Coincidentally in 1970, there was another nominee with a dysfunctional family falling apart in the last days of the dying patriarch, “Bruno’s Dream” by Iris Murdoch, which moves me still with its passion when I think about it. This book, revolving around a matriarch, doesn’t come close.Mrs. O’Neill is about to celebrate her 92nd birthday in the company of family and close acquaintances in the hotel which had been passed on to her by her father and which she hopes to pass on to her son, a wastrel only interested in drinking and gambling. There are other characters such as her daughter-in-law, daughter, son-in-law and grandson, an ancient priest, a bellboy still dreaming of restoring the hotel to its glory days, a pimp and his “employees”, and a customer; into all of this walks the somewhat demented Mrs. Ivy Eckdorf who’s set on photographing this family occasion against the will of all except Mrs. O’Neill, who’s the only really likeable character, and discovering the great secret which led to the hotel’s decline, which turned out to be fairly anticlimactic and cliché. Born deaf-mute, Mrs. O’Neill serves as a sounding board for all the hopes and dreams of the others, communicated in a series of notebooks which she keeps at her side. This has great potential but in my opinion, falls short. Various of the characters are orphans and this is the only home they know and Mrs. O’Neill the only person who seems to care about them, and while I felt bad for them, there wasn’t much to involve my sympathy. Most of them are looking for love and affection (except for the client whose search was more basic) but they only got my pity.

In the second year of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln’s young son died, a blow from which the President never recovered and which pushed the already unstable Mary Todd Lincoln into madness. Mixed into the narrative are excerpts of books and memories of the time, reporting not only the grand dinner the Lincolns had while Willie was upstairs suffering but many commentaries on Lincoln’s supposed attitude and behavior during this crisis, the ongoing war, his physical appearance and whatever else the sometimes sympathetic, sometimes malicious gossips of the time could come up with in his time of suffering. (There’s a saying in Spanish that when the tree falls, many people make firewood.) Lincoln’s decision to pursue the Civil War was not popular on all fronts since many couldn’t care less whether the South seceded or freeing slaves if it meant sacrificing their men so there may have been poetic justice for them in Lincoln’s own loss.The principal narrators are three, a printer, a closeted homosexual, and a minister, but Willie’s voice is also heard and through him, that of Lincoln. Amid this tragedy, there is a lot of humor because all the spirits who speak don’t quite accept that they are dead and ready for the great beyond; for this, they are in the bardo, the Tibetan / Buddhist stage between this life and the next, preparing for death. And in a comic turn, each is in the state that existed in their mind at the moment of death: the printer had lived with his frightened bride as brother and sister until she was ready and now that the moment was at last at hand, he was hit by a falling beam so he walks through this world in-between almost naked and proceeded by a tremendous engorged member; the repressed gay man had cut his wrists in despair but repented at the last moment, having decided he want to see, smell, feel, and sensually experience the world as it was and is thus a tentacle mass of ears, eyes, noses and hands whenever he becomes excited. Since all were interred in the same Georgetown cemetery, almost all the other members of this community are of a similar class, with the exception of those from “the other side of the fence”, a common grave which held lower-class whites as well as slaves. All of these constantly squabble, some in a vulgar manner, which adds comic relief to this otherwise sad tale. However, the biggest problem is that they haven’t accepted that they are dead and believe they are only in “sick-boxes”, not coffins, and that they can somehow return to terminate all unfinished business, while brooding over the fact that they’re mostly forgotten by those they’ve left behind, loved ones who’ve moved on with their lives.The form of the book is something I’ve never come across and might be off-putting to some because the story is told as a constant conversation between the community but mostly through that of the printer, the gay man and the minister, and varies between dialogue and commentary about what action there is. I found it almost impossible to constantly check who was speaking but it really didn’t matter since they were not all that different; however, the other characters were quite distinct and added a lot to the plot. The most touching parts for me were Lincoln’s reluctance to let go and his son’s frustration in trying to help; I think that almost everyone has had the same sensation with a recently-departed loved one that they are somehow there with you, that you could almost touch them just as they want to touch you, if only you both knew how until you realize that this separation is permanent. An incredible book.(One final note: I never use audiobooks and with so many voices, you’d think that the audiobook would be difficult to follow but I see from many people who did listen that this is not so.

The quality of his writing is different now, not as evocative as it was in the past, but his storytelling skills are as strong as ever. It’s a solid book even if it isn’t as good as some of his other works.In this book, Vargas Llosa returns to a story of Peruvian society and social class, a topic he always returns to in his current essays and journalism as well (and which his son, Álvaro, also writes about with great perception.) The novel concerns two apparently unconnected men (although a connection is revealed early on) who, unbeknownst to each other, are fighting heroically against two of the ills that plague contemporary Perú. The owner of a transport company in northern Perú is being shaken down for protection money, which he refuses to pay. He has risen from abject poverty to building a successful business and although many of his competitors and fellow businessmen pay as a cost of doing business, he refuses; his father counselled him many years ago to bow down to no one and in the story of how his father raised him, paying for his education through menial jobs, this mental rectitude and fortitude are formed.The parallel story revolves around a soon-to-be-retired insurance company executive in Lima who is involved in his boss´s scheme to avenge himself against his two wastrel twin sons who only wanted him dead when he suffered a near-fatal heart attack. Their father has spent a large amount of money in the past covering for their drug- and alcohol-fueled lifestyles, including paying off a rape victim, and now wants his revenge when he marries his maid. He knows that with his more than 80 years, they will try to have him declared incompetent but more than that, there’s the social disgrace of their father marrying a woman from a lower class with dark skin. (In South America, an indigenous, non-European complexion counts in many cases.) The father disappears on his honeymoon and the executive is left to face any number of violent threats and coercion from the twins but his loyalty doesn’t waver. (Not a spoiler since there’s never any doubt that it would.)Vargas Llosa has touched on themes of Peruvian (which can be amplified into South American) class society from the beginning – his first novel was “The Time of the Hero” which novelized his experience in military school, a rite of passage for many upper-class South American males - so the theme of the novel is no surprise. It’s the story of two discreet heroes who don’t look for attention but only want to do what’s right for everyone by staying true to their convictions. It’s certainly a solid, recommendable novel if you don’t enter looking for another “Feast of the Goats” or “War of the End of the World”. There is also a prominent role for Lituma, a police character from some of Vargas Llosa’s other novels, such as “The Green House”, “Who Killed Palomino Molero?” and the sequel, “Death in the Andes”.

However, if you’re a fan of the genre, this won’t disappoint; just like in police/detective novels or chick-lit rom-coms, you can forgive a lot if you just like that kind of reading. I expected a Nordic detective story so I just didn’t choose wisely. Let the nit-picking begin then.There are two storylines which obviously merge towards the end: three friends go to an island in northwestern Iceland which is now used as a summer retreat but is deserted in winter, with the purpose of renovating an old house in order to eventually convert it into a summer hotel. Supposedly, this is a hot prospect with a high demand which would lead any sensible person to ask why no one has bought and renovated this house before. (But we know, don’t we?) The other storyline involves a divorced doctor with a specialty in psychiatry who moves from Reykjavik in the south to the northwest because his son disappeared three years ago, accelerating the disintegration of his marriage. His ex-wife insists that their son comes to her in her dreams, which he dismisses as some psychosis due to their loss. (But we know better, of course.) This was actually the better storyline for me because it unfolded like a good mystery, lots of loose threads which eventually came together. The other storyline was almost laughably ridiculous though, sort of “Blair Witch Project” meets “Scooby-Doo” – it even had a cute dog. Of course, it’s the dog who continually senses the evil presence, growling at what appears to be an empty corner or thin air. (But we know better, don’t we?) This was just one of the many clichés. There’s the doubting man who dismisses it all as just everyone’s imagination (which of course usually means he’s signed his own death certificate), the frivolous woman who is basically useless as she panics at everything, and the sensible middle-ground woman (married to the man) whose attempts at logical explanations fall flat in her mind, the only mind we actually enter here. Their cell-phone batteries die simultaneously so no way to contact the mainland, they have forgotten to pack anything of use such as a first-aid kit or candles for an abandoned house with no electricity, not to mention not even wondering where the previous owner disappeared to or why no one else seems interested in fixing up a house in a prime location. It all oozes stupidity beyond belief as one mishap befalls them after another; you wonder what could happen next and then it happens and they’re even more helpless than ever.The book also suffered from mind-numbing predictability, and boring plot twists. Adultery, of all things, rears its ugly head towards the end, which in one storyline I caught on to about 20 pages and the other was the obvious explanation for some parts of one storyline since it was the only one. There was also an unbelievable quantity of coincidences as the doctor continually meets just the right person at just the right time to fill in a blank and keep the story advancing. (It was the cinematic equivalent of the investigation is seemingly at a dead end and just at that moment, the television is turned on and just at that moment there’s a special bulletin which leads the investigation onwards.) There’s a final coincidence which was totally unnecessary to the story as the author “jumped the shark” in an attempt to keep connecting things. And the ending… even worse.So, what was good here? Plotlines aside, the suspense still had me on the edge of my seat because the atmosphere was excellent if you don’t nitpick the rest. Finally, we learn (once again) that ghosts are restless souls who just want revenge and a decent Christian burial – which means, of course that there are no Jewish ghosts. (Dybbuks aside.) First of all, ghosts communicate their grievances monosyllabically and, growing up in a Jewish family, I can tell you that not only is no complaint is less than a Shakespearean monologue but a Jewish ghost would just be resigned to his or her fate. (“Listen, Mr. Big Shot Detective, if it’s not too much trouble, can you find the schlechte mensch that put me here? Oh, never mind, I know you’re busy, what am I, I’m only a corpse, I’ll just lie here and molder…”) And even solving the mystery won’t stop them haunting you. Trust me on this one.Anyway, if you like ghost stories, you’ll probably like this one and if not and are bothered by the details, there are other books than this one....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 29, 2022","Feb 03, 2022","Jan 31, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/17164961-i-remember-you

The good I read this when I was living in the Czech Republic and it gave me a glimpse into the country as it had been just before I arrived, in 1994. The good thing about living in a Socialist country is that you get what you need but the bad thing is that it's the government who decides what you need and when you'll need it and this is based on the old saying (which applies to any system of government), ""Everybody's equal but some are more equal than others."" Fialka is a young woman who enjoys sex with Czech long-haul drivers, hitchhiking from Prague to truck stops where they pass, and later frequents truck stops where Western long-distance drivers stop on their way from Germany and points north to Austria and points south. (A map will show you that Czechoslovakia was between the two and Prague is further west than Vienna.) She demands Western currency from these in order to help her friend, Patrick, who has MS and needs a wheelchair. (The government has offered him a top-of-the-line wheelchair, the most modern available, and it will be ready for him in 8 or 10 years - when, of course, he'll probably be dead. When I lived there, there was still a Tuzex store in my small city; these only accepted Western currency or vouchers, not Czech currency, and this was the only way to get some things Western, unless you ""knew"" someoine and could arrange one of the famous swaps which Czechs made for services or goods unavailable by government channels. For example, home or car repairs; when I lived there, the average age of a car on the road was 20 years.) Apart from the political aaspects of this book, there is also the erotic as Fialka is a woman who loves sex and there are lyrical and graphic passages which demonstrate that.

Jack was in fact named after John Ames but this is where the similarity ends in a sense because Jack’s youth was wild and reckless, ending in self-exile. After 20 years, he has returned but a small town never forgets and the book centers on his attempts to redeem himself in the eyes of others. It’s told through the eyes of his sister, Glory, who also returned to the family home after a disastrous excursion in the “outside world,” the precise details of which she has hidden from her dying father and only confesses to Jack. Through conversations with her, with Rev. Ames and his wife, Lila, and attempts at reconciliation with his father, Jack attempts to redeem himself in everyone’s eyes and overcome the assumptions people have of him due to his actions 20 or more years before. (Mostly sowing wild oats.) He has no problem quoting Scripture and referring to it in daily life but he has a difficult time in believing. Glory, due to her own secrets, and Lila, who didn’t live there in that time, have fewer problems than the two ministers and (by implication) the townspeople. He also has a secret regarding a woman who helped him on to the straight and narrow road which is too big to share but is implied in various conversations. Much of the book has this thread running through it as he waits to hear from her.This novel takes place in what would be the second half of the first book and so I already knew what the secret was as it’s revealed towards the end; this is mostly irrelevant to the plot of this book but it is important as it makes full forgiveness something which would be possibly impossible to receive. The stories of Lila and Jack’s “wandering in the desert” are in the next two books and I look forward to reading them. It’s not totally necessary to have read the first but it gives a side to the story, as well as information, which would serve you well in reading this part.Once again, as in the first, the book was inspiring as it uses the background of the two ministers and their families as a launching pad for greater and more important things. Most religions have more in common than different in how we should and can live together in spite of our human flaws.

The protagonist is an expert on one particular writer from this era, he wrote his thesis after seven years’ preparation and now realizes that this was probably the high point of his life. He grew up in a loveless home and this is reflected in his inability to love any of the women with whom he becomes involved; he’s not misogynist in the sense of having no respect for women as he has many female colleagues at the Sorbonne who he respects and with whom who he has social contact but he is incapable of any lasting feeling with any of his lovers, save one. These relations generally last a year but there is one former student who lingers in his mind and who he misses as a steady companion. They get together for his birthday and as a gift, she gives him a night of sex – one of two explicit and graphic scenes in the book, the other with a pair of call-girls – but they both know that there’s no going-back and she eventually leaves the country when a Muslim party wins the Presidential election. Much of the book is dedicated to how this comes about and the resulting changes in France, as well as how it affects (or benefits) the protagonist.Islam is portrayed in this novel not as religious but as geopolitical, in my opinion, which is to say that some tenets may be overlooked in order to make it more acceptable to a larger population. This is also reflected in how the Muslim party wins because they position themselves as the alternative to Marine LePen and co-opt the other parties through an offer of power-sharing; in the USA, we’re accustomed to a two-party system but in most of the rest of the world coalition governments are the norm and as always, politics makes for strange bedfellows. How this insinuates itself into all reaches of French society is a lesson in how this could happen in other countries. (In the USA, it could be seen when some Republicans jumped on the Trump bandwagon rather than be left out, but you can see it in other countries more clearly.) The protagonist is apathetic to everything: religion is irrelevant, his academic career is going nowhere and women are only a vessel for his libido but as the Muslim party’s triumph begins closing some doors but reopening them in their own fashion, he begins to re-evaluate things as cost-beneficial rather than ideological. (No problem since his ideology is mostly below the belt.)This book came out the same day as the Charlie Hebdo attack in France and attracted controversy, not least because Houellebecq thrives on controversy although he now claims he wants to be loved, or something like that. He has admitted to being something of an Islamophobic but has also said that Europe could benefit from being Islamist. (One of the goals of the party in the novel is to bring the Islamist countries into the European Union as well as convert the existing countries.) It was wildly successful but wildly controversial in expressing patriarchal ideas that can easily be seen as misogynist. (Lowering unemployment by keeping women at home and out of important positions by paying men much more, for example.) It is an entertaining book if you read it and follow the protagonist’s development, imaginable and thought-provoking as you see how easily a change like this could occur. However, you can also prepare yourself to possibly be offended by some parts.

I realize that she has followers in 300 countries in 500 languages – I’m sure you could find “Murder on the Orient Express” in Klingon, if you looked – but that doesn’t change my opinion. I’ve always associated Agatha Christie with those “Friday the 13th“ films. (You know: “Hey, let’s go to this abandoned summer campground where there’s a serial killer on the loose who butchers a group of teens every year and there’s never any sort of police investigation!” “Oh, that idea makes me SOOOOOO hot! And if I let you in my pants, I hope you won’t tell everyone and stab me in the back! Hahahaha” “Oh, you kid!”) In Agatha Christie, there is that harbinger of death, Miss Marple; every time you invite her to your house in the country, someone ends up dead; unless it’s some form of population control of the idle rich, I can’t understand why they keep doing it. “I hope you’re going to invite that horrid old bat. I do hate unexpected funerals! One never knows what to pack…” “Yes, quite right, it’s frightful. I know, we’ll invite Derek, who everyone hates, and that fat Frenchman!” “Oh, do, that would be delightful!” We all know the formula and who’ll be leaving horizontally.Which brings me to this book. A group of suburbanites near Nottingham Forest living in a community called Linchester and a neighborhood called The Circle. The first half of the book is about all the same intrigues as ever, money and infidelity, and we learn who has money problems and who’s boinking whom (or only wishes to do so.) This is 1965 so these affairs are not necessarily consummated in the flesh; it’s left vague but apparently some only lust in their hearts and make secret plans. Then we have the man who almost everyone hates. His wife has a birthday party, the bucket is kicked and on to the second half we go. (No plot spoiler here, it’s on the cover.) A doctor neighbor begins to unravel the mystery with gossip from all the others and we get to a ludicrous conclusion. The book, as well as the neighborhood, is inundated with wasps so we know they’re hard to ignore as part of the plot. (Like “don’t think of elephants” while you’re surrounded by them.) I like Ruth Rendell even if she’s not a favorite but this book was a miss for me. HOWEVER, if you like Agatha Christie, this could be for you because it follows the pattern quite closely; if you don’t, there’s always “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” to entertain you....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 19, 2021","Dec 29, 2021","Dec 19, 2021",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/83441.To_Fear_a_Painted_Devil

In my case, halfway through, I wasn’t exactly overwhelmed with this book but when I discussed it with her, I saw what I’d missed just by listening to myself and connecting the dots. (She’s big on empathy and insights, I’m big on parallel structures and layers.) I’d found what I was looking for.This is a story of a retired professor, a widower and East German now living in a reunified Berlin who finds himself captivated by the news story of a group of African immigrants camped out in a central plaza, demanding some clarification of their status so that they can work. He visits them in their hostel and even begins teaching German to some of the advanced students while slowly becoming more and more involved on their lives. What annoyed me at first was that he didn’t seem much interested in what they’d suffered so much as what their lives had been before civil wars crashed down on them; it seemed incredibly insensitive to ask about the “before” with its dead or missing family members and focus on a life they could never recover. However, my experiences with Czech and German friends and my life as an expatriate as well as telling my wife why I was underwhelmed suddenly put it all into focus for me. As an “Ossi” (former East German), he also had an immigrant experience as he adjusted to a new life in the West but where he was welcomed as a long-lost brother, many Germans rejected these new immigrants, with sarcasm, jokes and in some cases overt racism. As an end-of-WW2 child, he also had a gap since few parents wished to discuss what had just come before – this from German friends but also from what Gunter Grass suffered when he wrote “The Tin Drum” – so he just skipped over the unpleasant parts because that’s how he was raised. Some horrors are too big to absorb if you weren’t there. (My Czech friends didn’t want to discuss life under communism either nor the roles that many had played in their small town in the previous regime, even if their suffering was relatively minor and closer to inconvenient than anything.) This was the connection I’d been missing. There is a sort of parallel story of as parallel life as well as he had a long-term mistress while he was married. He managed the two by an extreme sense of order – I found this very German too – where his lover could only call on certain days at certain hours and meet him at a particular café wearing his favorite outfit and always approaching from a designated direction – until she’d had enough of this rigidity. As befits all of us who reach a certain age, he reflects on his structured past and seems to look at his new friends who have a completely unstructured and uncertain life in a new way; control only works if you have the power but if you lose it… His friends from the former East Germany also had their lives disrupted and reacted in different ways, just as not all are as welcoming to his African friends.In the end, I liked this book more as I began to penetrate a bit more into the mind of the protagonist and empathize with someone who’d lost control in his past but was trying to help others regain theirs. Very recommendable but it probably functions on different levels – or not at all – for others....more",Notes are private!,1,11,1,"Dec 02, 2021","Dec 11, 2021","Dec 02, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/34746211-go-went-gone

She believes firmly that this is impossible and is determined to expose the fraud but is unprepared for a mid-18th century impoverished post-famine Ireland where superstition and religious fanaticism abound. In a sense, it recalls the quote from Karl Marx about religion being the opium of the people; here it’s all they have to live on, their only refuge when there’s no food, either. She shares the duties of observation with a nun who’s also a nurse and in shifts they watch to see that no one is secretly passing food to the girl.I found the book interesting because it starts out as a detective story in which everyone in the village is a suspect, although we learn early on that not only Lib suspects some sort of fraud involved. However, she is a stranger and the only non-Catholic so she is equally suspect and gets the wrong end of the stick more often than not due to her arrogance and ignorance of what makes this other world tick and arrogance eventually turns to desperation.In the end though, it was less a detective story than something else. For me the story is about religious fanaticism playing on the mind of an innocent girl and exploiting her for personal reasons, while simultaneously blaming her for what led her to this point. Anna’s case is not the only one, either, of a woman taking the blame in a chauvinist society; Lib’s status as a woman also denigrates we find as we see reactions to her efforts to save Anna and in what brought her to this point in her life. This comes out in the vaguely-drawn characters which represent the different faces of authority; they probably don't need to be filled out because these figures are always the same and present everywhere. Some developments were easy to anticipate while others needed time to come out. In the end, I gave this a ""4"" because it did feel so locked in and repetitive at times. Most readers know Emma Donoghue through ""Room"", but that seems to be a “stand-alone” in the author's work because it didn't deal with Ireland and its treatment of women (as for example did ""Hood"") but I'd need to read more of her books to say for sure. It’s not a great book but there are more than enough underlying themes to make it a lively subject for discussion. (My wife and I are playing our perceptions off of each other now as we prepare to see the film. Chilean director so it’s a must-see for us in the cinema before it gets squeezed down on Netflix.) I may edit this  as more things occur to me – or my wife points them out – but it’s worth reading, not only to form your own opinion, but for an historical perspective on the Ireland that so many were forced to abandon for other shores.(Post-film addendum: If you see the film before you read the book, I doubt you'll enjoy the book so much. The film changed some things, and not for the better. The book unfolds its secrets slowly, giving you a sense of the frustration that Lib, the protagonist, feels. However, in the film, not only is one of the secrets revealed ten minutes in, but Lib is made out to be a drug addict. Finally, there is sex in the film that was DEFINITELY not in the book; during the sex scene, I could see my wife waving her finger, ""no, no, no..."" This was a film, paced for a cinematic experience with additional stuff tossed in and the mystery removed, making it all predictable. Beautiful cinematography but a totally different experience, a disppointment for me.)...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Nov 08, 2022","Nov 11, 2022","Nov 07, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32333487-the-wonder

Many people bought it or received it as a gift because they are suckers for dog books and with Rinty on the cover, how could they go wrong? Well, for starters by thinking this is a dog book, because it’s not. Susan Orleans is a writer, a journalist and an essayist; she is not necessarily a dog sycophant writing another version of “Marley and Me” or competing with C. Bruce Cameron with a book full of anecdotes. That would be confusing “Animal Farm” with Old McDonald. This is a book about a famous dog as an icon and this image of Rin Tin Tin came to dominate so many people’s lives for so many decades, some so obsessed that you’d want to move away from them on a park bench when they began to talk. It’s a fascinating story for people who are interested in the business and marketing side of Hollywood, in particular, how you take the image of a dog as a brand and keep it alive for decades, reinventing it as times change, and how it took over the life of so many people. There’s also the rivalry with those promoting other wonder dogs, such as Lassie – a bitter point as Rin Tin Tin was a real dog, rescued from the battlefields of France in World War I, not an invented one like Lassie – and keeping up with the changing tastes for cinema and television animals. So, if you like anecdotes about Hollywood, this is a good book, but if you want love stories about pets, look elsewhere....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 31, 2021","Nov 09, 2021","Oct 31, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11238914-rin-tin-tin

Margaret Atwood starts out with a good idea and an interesting first half but then resorts to a sort of amateurish, juvenile silliness that goes on too long, like a script for a brainless date movie; it’s adult but doesn’t strive to be something worthy of her talents.The book starts with a routine literary apocalypse: the US economy has collapsed causing massive unemployment and repossessions of homes, leaving many people to live in their cars and live in fear of roaming bands bent on robbery, violence, rape, etc.; this is played for comic effect because our female narrator, Charmaine, is a blonde goody-two-shoes determined to see the positive in everything while her husband, Stan, is a resentful schmuck who feels like a defeated failure, especially compared to his younger brother, Conor, who is a marginal sometime criminal who has always somehow come out on top, especially in dealings with Stan. What little money that comes in is from Charmaine’s waitressing job at what used to be an intellectual coffee shop but is now a bar with one part occupied by a pair of prostitutes. These two offer Charmaine the possibility to earn a little more by turning a few tricks, the idea of which repels her as something she could never do and Stan would never accept but which inwardly titillates her. (This hidden side of our Barbie doll later comes into play.)Their luck apparently turns when there’s an opportunity to join a closed community where accommodations are shared with another unseen couple with whom they alternate, each living in a model home for one month followed by one month in an on-site prison. They must sign a lifetime contract to live there and will never be permitted to visit or communicate with the outside world again. With the state the world is in, prey to criminals and poverty, and the comforts being offered, who could resist? This is the comic dystopia which has many possibilities, such as comparisons to totalitarian states where all is controlled by unseen authorities who control all information and monitor all activities, with strong parallels in “1984” but does the book go there? In a sense it does but mixes in so much broad comedy that the joke is lost, or rather, buried in silliness. Think about Stepford Wives. Think about Marilyn sex robots. Think about gay Elvis impersonators. Think about reading some other book, if possible.My impression is that Margaret Atwood started with a good idea but didn’t know where to go with it. The only time I can remember something like this being pulled off successfully was in Woody Allen’s “Sleeper” and this is not even close to that level. Dystopia turned into sex comedy is a tough challenge and Margaret Atwood isn’t up to the job here. It’s not a difficult book to read but frustratingly silly, less food for thought than “Charmaine and Ted’s Excellent Adventure.” Not her best effort....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 14, 2021","Oct 21, 2021","Oct 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24388326-the-heart-goes-last

A worldwide bestseller, it marks a distinct difference from the American thrillers right from the beginning. A man wakes up in covered in blood in his blood-splattered bedroom and can’t remember anything that happened from the night before. As the scene slowly unfolds, he finds his mother at the foot of the stairs with her throat slashed. In the American version, he’ll slowly piece the events together and find the real killer as well as the motive behind the murder and why he’s possibly being framed – but this is not America and things are not so simple as all that. You like unreliable narrators? There are two, one speaking from beyond the grave. You want someone who’s clearly innocent of the crime which he’s apparently committed? Not here because no one is innocent – or at least it’s not at all clear who is and who isn’t, nor of what – and you have to reboot your brain at various points as more details come to light. This book is darker than dark and constantly challenged me because just when I began to figure things out, and I had all the cards almost laid out although there was still a piece missing, and then came another part of the puzzle and I had to reshuffle the deck. That’s the problem with unreliable narrators, you can never be sure where you are and this casts doubt on what should be obvious because you begin to doubt yourself and your own judgement.

Vance has been elected senator from Ohio, I thought I ought to write my  of this book and get it over with. First of all, as has been seen in the campaign, Vance is a self-aggrandizing hypocrite, if everything he says in this book reflects what he feels. I think what's most interesting is the number of ""hillbillies"" in GoodReads who have mostly rejected this book as misrepresenting or exploiting them. Fair enough, he's an investment banker or something like that and knows how to make a buck, or at least seize on an opportunity so let's not run ol' J.D. down.First of all, if the ""hillbillies"" generally, disliked this book, who was it aimed at? Those who aren't or who don't share a similar background. I can imagine a bunch of privileged cocktail party attendees who seized on this as proof of something - or maybe were surprised that there were poor whites who could put a sentence together and escape the level of ""white trash"" - and use this proof for their own purposes, which is that more money either is or isn't the answer. It doesn't really matter which because it's not their money that is or isn't being spent but it's a useful plank in whatever sociopolitical campaign they're using their hot air on. But as J.D. Vance points out in the book, it's not so simple, any more than the solution to inner-city crime is more police and longer prison sentences; it's necessary to change the mindset before anything else. He makes his case well.However, his case is not exceptional; although I wouldn't define myself as a ""hillbilly,"" growing up in New York City under similar circumstances made all this feel familiar. In fact, I could easily go shot-for-shot with him on family history, and mine might actually be more colorful although I doubt it would sell as well. So, I have my doubts about his case being so unique because a lot of people escaped similar situations and his story does a disservice to those of us who made something of ourselves but feel some need to brag about it. He does make a good point though about family support and people you meet along the way being an important part of this; he didn't do it alone and few others did, either. It's very easy to sink down in the morass of dysfunctional families, alcoholics, drug addicts and other negatives but rather than paint himself as miraculous, he should point out that he's one of many. Still, if he did this, the book wouldn't sell and the cocktail party set wouldn't be interested. They would still treat as quaint rare birds but there would not be a lot of interest in the story anymore. There's another underlying theme that comes out here, and was better understood in the light of his senatorial campaign; we can't help who or what we are and make no apologies for it. He neatly detailed how the situation developed in these parts of the country. The failure of the various administrations of both political stripes to deal with it is no surprise because speeches are easier to deliver than solutions - or at least good solutions. In his campaign, his position was more-or-less ""they call us racists but we are Americans"", which ties into being a Trump protegé because who better to codify a message? (Trump also told West Virginia coal miners that they were going back to work so his hillbilly messaging is consistent at least.) Vance also made the claim that he was raised to fight back agao¿inst any insult but stood there grinning when Trump said, ""This man wants my endorsement so bad he's kissing my ass."" He had his eye on the prize.The book smacked of hypocrisy even before the campaign and the campaign only served to clarify it; it's not best-selling out-and-out lie like James Frey's ""A Million Pieces"" but it comes close in many ways. It's more like those books by ex-officials and politicians who want to ""set the record straight"" by putting themselves in the best possible light. Based on the book's success and his own personal climb to the top, I ask: is it because the cream rises to the top or because shit floats?...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 04, 2022","Oct 08, 2022","Aug 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy

Ian McEwan haSince “Atonement”, Ian McEwan has become a less-interesting, less-thought-provoking writer, and now… Who would have thought it possible? Ian McEwan having a run at writing a chick-lit romantic comedy! Not exactly my favorite genre but while a good chick-lit rom-com is intelligent, this is more intellectual, as well as being fairly predictable. I think this was loosely based on the 2003 case of Valerie Plame, the outed ex-CIA spy; here, the heroine is named Serena Frome (no relation to Ethan), pronounced to rhyme with “plume.” Through a series of incidents and love affairs, she’s recruited by MI5 and put on a mission which can best be described as promoting anti-Communist literature. What follows is something reminiscent of the London bombing in WW II; each plot twist may as well be preceded by a screaming whistle because you can easily see them coming and no red herring can deflect your sense of what’s to follow. The novel is set in late 60’s / early 70´s Wilson/Heath/Wilson England but this historical context is mostly wasted because Serena is only vaguely interested; the same with the internal turmoil of the miners’ strike and Northern Ireland, both of which serve as background but which are not gotten into. (Intellectualism stops at cultural footnotes and references; current events play only a small part, mostly to give some reason why the mission was planned in the first place.) Even the attempt at a final twist mostly fell flat for me because I’d already given up hope of something more by that time. Frankly, Serena Frome is no Bridget Jones, she just a voracious but non-discriminating reader. (At one point, she puts Jane Austen and Jacqueline Susann on equal footing, though she later recants.) This wasn’t an unpleasant reading experience, just an uneventful one. (By the way: Unlike “Atonement”, I see this as a TV movie; maybe a breakout opportunity for Jessica Simpson as Serena…?)...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 16, 2021","Jun 25, 2021","Jun 17, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19033863-sweet-tooth

I also seem to remember there was an interview where Ralph Kiner, who did post-game interviews, asked him, What's your wife's name what's she like?"", and he answered, indignantly ""Her name is Mrs. Coleman and she likes me just fine, bub!""

Picture yourself vision about to start a vacation which you’ve fantasized about all your life and you encounter with one problem after another as you prepare to leave but you finally arrive at the airport, only to find your flight is delayed. Nevertheless, you finally board, strapped in only to have the captain announce that there will be another delay because there are 87 planes in line for the only runway as the others have been damaged due to excessive seagull guano or something but be patient, the flight attendants will be passing out extra bags of peanuts to compensate for this unanticipated problem. After 90 minutes or so, there is another announcement that the airport of your destination is fogged in so to keep you amused, they will now show a bonus in-flight movie, “The Brady Bunch Meet Dracula”, or some such – but the projector breaks. Luckily for you, your neighbor has brought along snapshots of EVERY vacation he or she has been on before and proceeds to show them to you, accompanied by family anecdotes such as when Uncle Lester fell out of the tree or Mom burned the cookies and the fire department arrived. Soon darkness falls, passengers are snoring and you finally come to the conclusion that this flight will NEVER EVER take off – much like this book. You’re in…The Twilight Zone!!!! Why do I say this? This book has a very thin plot – wafer thin – interspersed with Martin’s dreams – but then the plot mostly runs out and you’re left with all of his remaining phantasmagorical fantasies, like one of those books of unfeasible architectural projects. The setting of an emerging New York at the end of the 19th century is interesting but this is finally “The Winchester Mystery House Meets the Tower of Babel”, an endless and pointless exercise in writing. The biggest wonder here was how this ever won the Pulitzer. The runners-up were a book of short stories by Ursula K. Le Guin, “Unlocking the Air”, that weren’t fantasy and also included unfinished drafts, and “The Mannikin”, by Joanna Scott, a mix of a creepy house, taxidermy and the arrival of a housekeeper who keeps the young mistress “intrigued”, which may have been too much thrown in for some judges. I smell compromise between warring factions. The non-fiction winner, “Angela’s Ashes”, may have been the real quality that year but that’s my personal opinion; obviously, there were those who were captivated by this book but to quote AbeBooks list on 10 most-forgotten Pulitzer fiction winners, this book deserves a mention because no one’s buying it.

As for the book itself, it mixes the richness of Russian literature with the expatriate’s love for his mother country. It seems to be his main topic, the failures of Russian history and how this carries over to today.

Race is a dominant theme here but this book isn’t some clarion call for justice; there is an underlying theme here of how impossible that would be in the working-class Boston where this mainly takes place but frames not only racial but economic inequalities and hypocrisies that exist. No apologies, no excuses, no solutions offered, just a setting. Although this is the first in the Kenzie-Gennaro series, it wasn’t the first I read – that would be “Gone, Baby, Gone” – and this follows in the Lehane tradition of just when you think you know what’s happening, it turns out you may not. There is also a thread that’s common to these two as well as a third book, “Mystic River”, which is abused children. As this was the first in the series, there are some tired clichés that pop up: sleazy politicians, and marksmanship. (You know, killers who can’t seem to kill our heroes, even at point-blank range with an Uzi, while our heroes could probably do a double back-flip, fire between their legs mid-air and score a direct hit between the eyes. (Our detectives DO get beaten up quite a lot but like Timex watches, they take a lickin’ and keep on tickin’…) However, their hard-boiled, wiseass dialogue will take you back a bit to Chandler and Spillane and their chemistry makes them lovable, if I may say so; you may not want to mess with them but you might want to give them a hug. I now have to dig up the rest of the series in my remote corner of the world but in the meantime, there are the three films (that I know of) of Lehane novels to watch again.

Looking at ratings in Good Reads can be deceptive but I find that when a book has less than a 3, there's usually a reason, and this was no exception. This was a train wreck disguised as a book, but not precisely for the reasons that some ers gave. The most obvious reason to dislike the book was for the quantity of incest, particularly father-daughter, but other forms of older man/underage girl attractions. Martin Amis is greatly influenced by Nabokov and follows the advice that actions must match the character in order to be true to the character; however, ""Lolita"" is a classic of a man led to his own downfall by this attraction while this takes a slightly different angle which I found to be less serious and in a way, more dangerous. I don't want to get into it but I didn't like it at all. If the books admirers want to justify it in a ""you just don't get it"" sort of way, I'm fine with not ""getting it."" This wasn't even the worst of it for me. There are four basic storylines here, all with their share of black humor but only one even remotely interesting. There's the ex-gangster, from a long line of gangsters, whose behavior changes after being hit on the head; there's the underendowed writer for a scandal rag; there's the mostly asexual King of England whose 15-year-old daughter is secretly photographed in the nude, plus the King's attendant, Brendan Urquhart-Gordon, called Bugger for his initials, who's infatuated with the Princess; and there's a doomed flight with a coffin bouncing around in the baggage hold and causing all sorts of damage. Of these, the first is mildly interesting and the rest I could have done without. Much of the dialogue was like overheard conversations where you're not in on the shorthand references in the conversation. Finally, there are the attempts at humor that sound like extremely bad Monty Python: a Chinese masseuse named He - she is named He, so we have lines like ""He touched He, He touched him, He was hard, He was soft"" - and another character, Andrew New, who's referred to as And, just so you can have lines like, ""...and And and...""
