I have a lot more to write about the specifics of this volume's treasures, but seriously, I have another Nibley volume that I have to finish reading first. My friens Zina, Nibley's youngest daughter, recounted how her father was a prolific reader known for sitting in the library with a stack of books guarded by one arm while he plowed through volume after volume, taking notes on whatever interested him along the way. He was a true Christian apologist who engaged the world through his beloved gospel lens. A personal aside, Nibley's curmudgeonly humor, brilliance, and associative mind are reason enough to love spending time with him, but I feel compelled to explain why I have set a goal to read all of his collected works in honor of my Finnish father, Valto Antero Tolvanen. I grew up during the 1960s through the 1980s with my scholarly father reading Nibley, discussing what he discovered, and then clacking away with his lightning fast peculiar two-finger typing method on his huge Finnish-keyed olive green WWII-era typewriter, as he translated, eventually with Hugh's blessing, all of his available works at the time into Finnish. He began this task with Lehi in the Deseet to improve his own knowledge of English. Well, the Finns are known as the most literate nation in the world and Dad didn't want them to miss out on Nibley. A peculiar ability of Dad's was his uncanny way of translating what Vladimir Nobokov called the author's signature (voice), including his sense of humor and irony. They were kindred spirits. Dad and Hugh had met in the early 1970s and when Dad died in 1991, his translations of Nibley were housed at Brigham Young University with FARMS, the Fundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies. The binders housing these translations sat awaiting publication for several decades, until my sister and I retrieved them, after realizing that the small Finnish audience Dad was aiming to reach was't exactly high on FARMS' priority list. But, hopefully someday the manuscripts will see the light of day with technology advances to scan his typewritten pages, take them through AI copyediting and into a digital form....more",Notes are private!,1,1,1,not set,"Dec 19, 2022","Dec 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/399213.Old_Testament_and_Related_Studies

The first time in 2006, much of what Dr. Lipton wrote about was considered pseudoscience by the scientific community. Now many of the ideas that he brought forth, including the intelligence of cells, which was also the subject of Dr. Candace Pert in ""Molecules of Emotion"" (she was nominated for a Nobel prize) are more mainstream. Dr. Lipton's most fascinating ideas include the importance of community throughout systems including cellular life. Recently, I read an article in the New York Times, about the discovery that plants talk to one another and actually use little clicking sounds to express danger or thirst. How little we really understand about the world we live in. Science is still in its infancy. Descarte's idea of the body as mechanical clock, for instance, still prevails. Mind, body, and spirit are still divided. Until we learn to become true scientists, and examine interconnected systems in the forest and not just a solitary spot on a tree, we are merely dabbling at the edges of the billions of galaxies that surround us. I ackowledge the strides we have made in science. Yet, I also llove intrepid explorers who continue to ask questions.

He began on this When I was a teen my father began (with Hugh Nibley’s permission) to translate Nibley’s works into Finnish on his manual typewriter. He began on this labor of love with Lehi in the Desert until his death in 1992. He had by then completed a majority of the volumes and given them to BYU F.A.RM.S. Sadly, Finnish is not a priority language and nothing has been published and F.A.RM.S. is now dissolved. It took several decades for me to begin seriously reading Nibley’s books and after finishing some of the collected works, I am hooked and hope to read the majority of them. One of my favorites this far has been Temple and Cosmos. This is Volume 5 of his series. If you want to read this 3 book volume, Lehi in the Desert is my recommendation as it is very accessible and contains so many details that enrich one’s understanding of the Jewish and Egyptian cultures at the time of Lehi (600 BCE). I have read this one several times and continue to return to it with questions. The relationship between Egypt and Jerusalem is discussed as are naming conventions, habits of the “desert dwellers”, the significance of the honeybee, and much, much more. The second and third books are about the Jaredite civilization. Nibley presents unusual, yet convincing evidence as to the origins of this mysterious group that is fascinating. He hypothesizes that despite a lack of archeological artifacts, he can present his points from a bigger picture of how they fit into a pattern of many civilizations that have acted in identical ways, beginning with large scale migrations and ending with an almost overnight destruction of a people. If you are interested in a thread of thought that extends from the Central Asian steppes to warrior kings, chivalry, intrigues, assassins, final battles, and more, the World of the Jaredites may be fascinating. The final book, And There were Jaredites was not as compelling for me, but basically expanded and then summarized points from the second book within a creative conversation between imaginary scholars. Nibley is somewhat of a legend. What I love about Hugh Nibley is his wide-ranging mind. In w wry book the list of sources that he has consulted (or should I say, digested), to come up with his conclusions is staggering. And best of all, he adds in footnotes that are always worth reading.

It’s just scripture, which I want, rather than commentary (which has been done so many times). The book is meticulously organized. We see the birth and events leading up to the 3 year ministry of the Savior ordered chronologically as 244 events. With an abundance of white space for annotations, the volume includes the JST and Greek translation texts and offers excellent reader pointers by way of marginal footnotes indicating who is speaking, what passages are quotations and their source, scriptural references, place names, dates, and duplicate account scripture references.

This novel was one that drew me inside the imagined worlds of Doerr much like a MC Escher drawing. I refused to read anything about the novel before beginning and allowed myself to slip into the multiple story lines that weave their threads throughout this hauntingly compelling bricolage. This is a paean to bibliofiles and libraries, an echo of Jorge Luis Borges' the Library of Babel. It is an uplifting novel to enjoy but also one that merits discussion because of the interconnected web of ideas that it touches upon.

This is a work that took 40 years of gathering to write. Neal A. Maxwell encouraged the author to develop the manuscript to recount the Christology underpinning the story of the early Latter-day Saint experience in Kirtland, Ohio and the marvelous spiritual manifestations experienced by members of the faith. It was a heady time described at its apex as a “Day of Pentecost”, a time in the fledgling Church where the heavens opened and angels walked among saints. Filled with details and quotations that are not readily available, I was fascinated with the construction of the book, as Anderson described the Christ-centered evidences of the Savior in Kirtland.

The Sierra Club wilderness experience hike brings a group of members together each summer to explore the vast, pristine wilderness of the Western United States. Each walker brings only camping essentials including a pair of hobnail boots to walk along winding trails, on long days that conclude with a fiddler playing hymns to weary travelers after a plain, yet nourishing dinner served by the camp cook and his assistants. It is a genteel time. Whispers of poetry dot the writing as do references to the legendary John Muir, who “never hurried. . . [and] would hail people passing by and make them get down on hands and knees if necessary to examine some tiny seedling or to see the beauty of some little bed of almost microscopic flowers.” 28Albert Wentworth Palmer records his experience during or summer in a brief, but beautiful tribute to the physical and spiritual fulfillment found in this annual event.

When my father was a boy Finland’s struggles toward nationhood included strife between whites and the reds that often tore apart families. This novel begins where some of my own family stories begin. My recently widowed grandfather was marched away at sunset as a prisoner of war in 1917 leaving behind his three young sons. My stories meld with Karl Marlantes’ family memories. Deep River is a gutsy story. A story of survival. Through two world wars, famine, loss, and sorrow, my father also survived, gained an education, and married. Then he emigrated in 1956 from Finland to Vancouver, Canada, leaving behind a comfortable career for a new life. Like the family in Deep River, my father’s first job in Canada was with a crew of immigrant Finns, working as loggers on the wild northwest coast of Vancouver Island. Father, at nearly age 50 became a topper, a most dangerous occupation, scaling to the heights of the immense coastal Douglas Fir trees to cut and release their swaying crowns to the crew below. We arrived a few months later to join him and began again. The story of Deep River is the story of immigrants. It is the story that the elders tell. It is a story that reminds us of things that should not be forgotten. It is a story of hardship, sacrifice, love, and family. It is in its emotional landscape, my story, even when the details do not match. How could I not be drawn in by this bigger than life, stark, amazing novel?...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 14, 2021","Feb 22, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36395451-deep-river

He is a master of finding principles to live by in the scriptures. In this slender volume, he searches the scriptures to find mention of incidents where Christ notices and reaches out to the “one” while making the case that we all are individually known and loved by a kind, merciful Father and his Son. Our lives are filled with encounters and incidents, but there are no coincidences, he writes. Instead, there is divine and loving orchestration happening that we often cannot see. Elder Bednar includes stories of tender mercies that occur when people are prompted to reach out to others, to help and comfort the ”one” as we are asked to do in the second great commandment. These acts of ministering to others in turn bring us closer to emulating the character of Christlike service. My favorite part of this book was where he elaborated on the times that the phrase “one by one” is mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Somehow, I had not really noticed the repetition of this phrase before, nor it’s significance. Beautiful truths are to be found in this chapter. Sometimes a slim, simple volume contains the most powerful truths. As Elder Bednar writes: “As we consistently seek for eyes to see and ears to hear, we can discern and detect the tender mercies of the Lord in our lives—as we are blessed both to receive them and to act as instruments in the hands of the Savior to deliver them to other people.” 160...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 16, 2020","Apr 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35672023-one-by-one

Kingsolver always does her homework and her fascination portrait of Mary Street as well as her insights into the close-minded society she inhabited was fascinating. Her work in botany and how easily we have brushed over her research reminds me of other brilliant women of her time including artist Mary Hallock Foote (in Wallace Steiner’s Angle of Repose) and Mary Anning, the British fossil hunter (in Tracy Chevalier’s Remarkable Creatures). Mary Street is only one facet of this novel, however, and it’s dual storyline is an interesting study in contrasts between two eras and two families as their daily dramas play out in the small town of Vineland, New Jersey, where Mary Treat lived at one time.

An enlisted man, my father was a lieutenant in the white-clad Finnish army who knew their harsh winters and fought, often guerilla warfare on skis. Mother waited for him for nearly 5 years, faithfully writing letters from Helsinki to the front as the battles Finland fought with neighboring Russia, raged on in the Winter War and the Continuation War during World War II. My father finally came home, a decorated veteran, but seldom spoke about his experiences. After his death we have read his journals and pondered at the photos in his album dedicated to this time. Annette Lyon's novel, The Girl in Grey, has brought these times to life for me.The story of Sini Toivola (whose surname is derived from the Finnish word for hope) tells of the brave Finnish women who needed two references to request membership in a group of intrepid grey-clad women, the Lotta Svärd, a paramilitary organization originally formed in 1918, who during the Second World War kept their tiny country running while all available men were ""freed"" to be conscripted into the army. The Svärd by 1944 numbered nearly 250,000 women, the largest volunteer auxiliary organization in the world. This was in a country that at the time numbered less than 4 million. As in London, children including my eldest sister in Helsinki and its environs were sent to Sweden for safety, many for the entirety of the war. Finnish men and women fought for their freedom, families, and way of life. While my mother served as a telegraph operator for the war department in Helsinki, the Lotta Svärd served at the air raid warning stations and hospitals as well as at the front. The author captures the unique feeling of life in Finland during this time, and although romance figures into this book, Lyons never glosses over the bitterness of war or the sacrifices that are required. The story deserves to be remembered and I am personally grateful to Annette Lyon for her well-written and engaging story.

Dreams are often discounted as merely a part of our psyche I have a family heritage of people who have dreams, which I have always found interesting. Dreams are often discounted as merely a part of our psyche trying to mull through events of the day, but through experience I believe there is more to them. My mother, for instance, had a gift for knowing things. She told of a time during the Finnish Winter War when she was was suddenly awoken during the night to hear my father cry out her name. She recorded the time and day and anxiously awaited news from the battlefield. She was relieved but not surprised when a letter came from father. He had narrowly escaped death when a bomb exploded by him, creating a crater right where he stood as it sprayed shrapnel and killed his fellow soldier, but miraculously spared him. He wrote that he had called out her name at that moment. Coincidence? I think not.I have mixed feelings about this anthology. I really looked forward to reading it as there are so many interesting dreams that I have read about the early days of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The book is a collection by three authors, organized into chapter headings to categorize types of dreams such as dreams of warning, or prophecy, of comfort, and so forth. The book has an introduction by Robert L Millet, and two interesting introductory chapters, the first about how revelation is given in the form of dreams, the second discussing how to ascertain if your dreams are revelation. The book seems a bit hastily edited from this point on; dreams have sometimes been included only to bulk up a chapter while others are very interesting and even faith-promoting. The reader will find incidents which are famous in Latter-day Saint history, such as the dream of Joseph F. Smith, ""I am Clean,"" and other treasures in the 284-page volume. In fact, if you want to find out whose dreams are included, there is a handy list of individuals to consult at the end of the book. As a reader, I wished there had been a more historical background and commentary for some of the more interesting dreams, whereas the authors only gave a brief introduction of each topic at the beginning of each chapter. I read it from cover to cover but it might be better as a reference work, especially if it had included an index.

I was thrilled to visit and tour the author’s home and library in Lenox, Massachusetts this past summer l. There at the delightful gift shop I purchased a lovely Macmillan Collector’s pocket-sized gilt-edged edition with an introduction by Rachel Cusk. It’s a perfect size to carry on a journey.Some of my acquaintances read this in high school and hated it. I understand as it is not a book for any starry-eyed romantic. It more about the choices we make in life and how we see them as we look back. I happen to love the ending and find it very satisfying. But perhaps that is my age and my life experience speaking. The novel certainly deserved the Pulitzer Prize (1920) and is still bright and wry in its observations of human foibles and social commentary. Wharton’s eye for interesting dialogue and historical detail is impeccable. And as I just discovered, Edith Wharton writes so weep about the homes inhabited by her characters. She did understand beautiful homes. Her time and experience spent building her own home called The Mount, was one of the inspirations that also spurred her writing of of one of the finest books on design that is still studied today in interior design classes! The Age of Innocence is a novel that one can return to read every few years. Each decade it would be a new story, I believe. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 30, 2019","Dec 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53835.The_Age_of_Innocence

However, It’s rather odd that today’s society needs to be taught how to behave and/or to solve problems through the voice of a dog. Have we really strayed that far from a personal or societal moral compass? Three quotes stood out for me:1. “Such a simple concept, it’s so true: that which we manifest is before us; we are the creators of our own destiny. Be it through intention or ignorance, our successes and our failures have been brought on by none other than ourselves.” 43-442. On pain: “. . . only dogs and women understand because we connect to pain directly from its source, and so it is at once brilliant and brutal and clear, like white-hot metal spraying out of a firehose, we can appreciate the aesthetic while taking the rest of it straight in the face. Men, on the other hand, are all filters and deflectors and timed release. For men, it’s like athletes foot: spray the special spray on it they say, and it goes away. They have no idea that the manifestation of their affliction-–the fungus between their hairy toes—is merely a symptom, an indication of a systemic problem.” 67-683. Enzo: “ I cannot speak, so I listen very well. I never interrupt, I never deflect the course of the conversation with a comment of my own. People, if you pay attention to them, change the direction of one another’s conversations constantly.” 109...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 07, 2019","Aug 08, 2019","Aug 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3153910-the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain

At times I would put it down for a week or two, overwhelmed at the plight of both the narrator, Lyman Ward, and his grandparents. It would catch my eye and draw me in again, and while I plowed through parts, at other times, the text sang out her truth and I didn't want the moment to end. I love Stegner's writing. It is powerful and poignant, truthful, and often lyrically beautiful. At times I felt as if I was reading a work by Flannery O'Conner, as horrific as Southern Grotesque, at other times, Stegner's voice smooths out into romance or drama, painted with the bold brushstrokes of Frida Kahlo, and at others, post-war baby boomers tossed around their revolutionary ideas .Deftly blended, this pioneer tale of the American West was so complex in its construction and satisfying in its outcome as Stegner unearthed the life of Lyman and his Grandparents and unravel the mysteries of the human heart. It is a masterpiece of American literature and keenly cognizant of the legacy of the dreamers who populated the West and how history ever repeats itself in one grand story....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Jul 30, 2019not set","Jan 04, 2020not set","Jul 30, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/292408.Angle_of_Repose

I very much enjoyed The Woman in White by Collins and thought this would be an excellent way to read more of Collins’ work. My edition had almost 500 pages printed in a very tiny font and was daunting to read but by the end I was enjoying the design and workmanship in the writing so much and now feel that it really is a “must read” for any serious student of mystery or detective novels. First published in as a 32-episode serial, The Moonstone debuted to great public anticipation and Charles Dickens, a lifelong friend of Collins, commented that it was “ A very curious story, wild and yet domestic with excellent character in it and great mystery.” Contemporaneous authors including Henry James praised it; T. S. Elliot called it “The first, the longest and the best of the modern English detective novel.”The introduction was fascinating as were the end notes which at times describe some of the research and background that Collins drew from in his writing. For the modern reader, I know that an abridged version might make this more palatable, but the meticulous way in which details are described in the novel are incredibly informative for any student of the Victorian era. Plus, the characters are delightfully drawn, and show us some of the humor, sentiment, and social commentary of the British Empire at its height. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,Jul 2017not set,"Jul 09, 2019not set","Jul 10, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/867638.The_Moonstone

That was the year when the wonders of the bookmobile first appeared as it parked on the empty lot kitty corner from where we lived on Sunnyside Road. One trip to the mobile library every two weeks didn’t suffice and I faithfully read everything I could tote home in two visits. Horses became a bit of an obsession after Henry’s delightful books. My imagination ran wild as I saved money to buy Dr. Barry’s series of horse training manuals and unsuccessfully begged my parents for permission to buy a pony to keep in the little garden shed in the back of our yard. Visiting my daughter in Maryland brought me full circle as we visited the island of the wild ponies a few weeks ago. Chincoteague is a National Park, whose sand dunes, marsh, and forest protect the northern Maryland coast from the buffeting storms of the Atlantic Ocean. Filled with birds and wildlife and edged with beaches, the island is a natural haven and a highly favored summer tourist destination. History suggests that in 1750 a Spanish galleon, La Galla, was shipwrecked off the island in a storm and the first island ponies were survivors of that tragedy. Henry has deftly integrated the history of the ponies into her story, including the yearly tradition of the pony roundup. As we stood on a wooden pier hoping for a glimpse, we were rewarded by a herd watched over by a chestnut stallion. One lovely brown and white pinto mare and her foal waded with the herd across the marshy bay to where we stood. The mare grazed peacefully as tourists snapped photos. Her foal rolled around in marsh grass, scratched herself on the bushes and explored the little island off the pier. Magical. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,"May 31, 2019not set","Jun 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17461.Misty_of_Chincoteague

There are so many excellent books on the Holocaust, but I couldn’t really classify this as one of them. This novel is based upon the true survival story of Lale Sokolov, who innocently accepts an Nazi demand for each family to send one 18-year old to work for the German government. His world is turned upside down as he is transports on a cattle car, stripped of all that he has with him, and then is tattooed with his identifier number, 32407. Th story unfolds with Lale deciding to watch and learn how to survive, eventually gaining the post of the camp tattooist, a privileged, but also horrible assignment. The story unfolds in 268 pages and while it is gripping at times, as a reader, I felt that the horror of the holocaust and Lale’s motivations are not always given enough space to integrate into one another. I felt that the author wrote from a woman’s perspective and Lale’s character and motivations to survive were not always adequately addressed. It almost felt like a romance was written first and then the events of the holocaust was laid upon the bones of that story. I still recommend the book as a 3.5 but as stated, have my reservations about the writing of the story itself. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2019","Jan 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38359036-the-tattooist-of-auschwitz

I have many favorite Asian authors but this is my first experience with the story of a Korean family after Japanese occupation. Told in an omniscient voice, the story slips back and forth, as the author deftly weaves the lives of the characters into a rich tapestry of emotions and situations. Beginning with young and innocent Sunja who lives in a fishing village South Korea with her parents, the stories adds in several generations until we meet a grandson educated in America. They all deal with their Korean identity in unique ways. Many quotes stood out including, “Living every day in the presence of those who refuse to acknowledge your humanity takes great courage.” Lee is a gifted storyteller and pulls the reader into her narration. While this is a powerful and often beautifully written story, for me, some modern fiction writing pushes past my comfort level.

I’m a literacy advocate as was Barbara (on a much bigger scale) which is why I originally picked it up, but reading this warm, often laugh-out-loud humorous, down to earth account of her life was so refreshing. Honestly, I have recommended it to everyone. At this time in our history it was a breath of fresh air. My biggest question was, how on earth did she have the energy to do all that was on her schedule. Inspirational. Favorite quotes: “We are encouraging volunteerism and want people to try to take back their own communities by being responsible, supportive, and interested. In short, we are trying to live up to George’s Thousand Points of Light credo: “From now on any definition of a successful life must include service to others.” 529“George Bush and I have been the two luckiest people in the world, and when all the dust is settled and all the crowds are gone, the things that matter are faith, family, and friends.

Theirs is a long tradition of noticing, treasuring, and articulating beauty. I grew up with this series and as an adult am so impressed with the authors of this time, like Boston, who never thought to talk down to children in their writing. This volume, number three in the series, does not bring in the characters from the previous books. Instead it is comprised of adventures, sometimes magical, for three children who stay with a preoccupied archeologist and her cook at Green Knowe manor for a summer, with total freedom to explore the world around them. They canoe along the River Ouse, that runs past the banks of the property, and create a map of their discoveries on paper in the attic bedroom which they share. Filled with wonder and innocence, this was a delight to read again.

It sometimes reminds me of the gothic writing of Flannery O’Connor with its quirky characters and details of the bizarre and often unexpectedly cruel nature of the natural world. An astute observer, Dillard has created a massive (397 page) historically accurate novel of the early settlers that migrated West, dropped off by watercraft on the narrow beaches that backed onto the inhospitable forested wilderness of Whatcom County, Washington. Beginning with the fictional Fishburns in 1855, we follow the varied fortunes of four families who labor against overwhelming odds, to survive in a fog-shrouded, verdant and untamed land with timber twelve feet across and no road access across the forbidding Coastal Range mountains. It was fascinating to ponder the lives that these hardy individuals painstakingly carve out over the next decades. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,"May 26, 2018not set","Jun 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/158742.The_Living

I can't say that I loved this book, but I love the talent of Geraldine Brooks, who has won a Pulitzer for her novels but is equally talented in nonfiction, having been a war and foreign correspondent; she is so, so good as a writer. She does her research and writes with a strong, deft touch and with, what is said to be a ""harrowing"" brilliance. If you are looking for a sweet view of the patriarch of the March family, this fictionalized version of the Little Women's father modeled somewhat on Bronson Alcott, may not the book for you. Instead this is often a haunting and disturbing book about the idealistic Mr. March leaving his ""little"" women to heroically participate in war. Reading March is almost a visceral experience, a flaying open of the wounds caused by the experiences of war--an illumination of war's toll on the flawed men and women who are drawn into conflict for myriad reasons. As a history buff, I found the truths in this book to be both insightful and terrible.

Born out of a time that includes a loving but also vengeful God who could destroy villages and slay those who were not children of the covenant, this retelling may seem barbaric to the eyes of a modern reader who is looking for the kind God of the New Testament, but possibly more “true” in its feel than many of the stories I had grown up with. As a child I was smitten with the beautiful young shepherd boy who slew a giant Philistine, rose to prominence in King Saul’s court and then became king and the uniting force behind the Israelite people. Over the years I’ve learned to see David as much more complex and often flawed as a character than I ever imagined as a child. Some of my favorite passages include the fact that Bathsheba was not a “wanton” woman, rather that she was doing a common ritual cleansing in a mikveh on her rooftop when first seen by the King. I also loved the passages with David composing music for his God and weeping because of his own imperfections including the slaughter of Uriah and his indulgence to so many sons who competed for his crown. I was also taken with the beauty of the passages about the young heir, Solomon that were fictionalized but insightful as to possibly how this child of Bathsheba’s and protégé of the prophet Nathan grew into a wise and thoughtful ruler. Filled with beautiful passages that are a trademark of Brooks’ writing, this book also contains graphic images of war, rape and death. It’s there in the Old Testament and as we study the history of the time, the treatment of women, the subterfuge, the fratricide, etc, that are recorded are not pleasant but quite possibly historically accurate. So, as a reader I used my agency to skip over passages that were too much for me and by the end found that David’s story is ultimately redemptive. If you want a whitewashed story with noble characters, this is not recommended but as a reminder of the turbulent times that Israel grew out of, and how the God of Israel uses flawed individuals to further His purposes, it is well done....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,"Feb 08, 2018not set","Feb 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24611425-the-secret-chord

The author's portrayal of working class conditions of the time translate in my mind to similar work that we now outsource to many countries. There companies have similar working conditions for the women and children whom they employ. The era of sweatshop labor that is portrayed in this novel and in in movies such as North and South is unbelievably still alive and well. My favorite quote in this novel was ""Perhaps you're too young yet to see how the tides go in and out. For all the wealth and luxury in this house, there's nothing magical about it. One generation toils away so they can eat off silver dishes. The next drifts along, barely bothering to paddle the boat. And then it is up or down . . .

I remember contemplating what this idea entailed. But no one ever really explained what faith was, and I wondered how to apply this idea in my own life until I read parts of these lectures years years later. Originally a part of the Doctrine and Covenants, these doctrinal ideas were taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith to the School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio in about 1834-35, and later were later recorded by Sidney Rigdon with Joseph's input and corrections. These theological lectures cover questions such as, Why is Christ called ""the author and finisher of our faith?"" Why is faith essential and what is faith and how do we obtain it? Every decade that I live, my understanding of this principle grows. Life experience and desire definitely help me to comprehend this book better.

At times I felt that the author repeated herself and that the writing was not as sophisticated as I had hoped. Yet, the subject of the story, Phoebe Snetsinger, is a complex, driven, and fascinating woman. Although perhaps not in “touch” with her deeper feelings, according to the author, her ability to focus on her love of birds drove her many years past a cancer diagnosis and many mishaps and traumatic events to become the first person to break the 8,000 bird species ceiling.My favorite parts of this book include the descriptions of Phoebe’s travels around the world as well as the birds that Amy sought out on he trips. I found her relationship with her family to be difficult to understand as it always seemed to be in second place behind her birding goals, but perhaps in order to achieve something of this magnitude, a ferocious single mindedness is necessary.

The books cover a period of time from 1776 and the American revolution through 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars. I enjoyed the historical aspects of the novels, although in a few of the stories the political sections got a little over-long for a leisure read so I skimmed them, only to come back to reread as I wanted to know what happened. I found the characters, especially the Polark family, to be well-drawn, compelling, and complex. They have human foibles and at times I was frustrated with the decisions that they would make to the point of not wanting to read what I anticipated would occur next, which is for me, a sign of an engaging text. Graham wrote the first four books in the series and then years later wanted to find out what happened to his characters and wrote another eight, so it was quite a time commitment to read the complete series. Definitely worth it if you are a quick reader. The books are lengthy so each book took several days to read. Overall, the Poldarks are one of my new favorite literary families. The books are full of pithy quotes and lovely writing:""They spoke little, all preferring to keep their own thoughts tight and tidy and untouched.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2016,"Oct 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25365667-ross-poldark

Written in the passionate, often poetic style of the mid-1800s by Elder Parley Parker Pratt, who joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints just five months after it had been organized on April 6, 1830, the book touches on a broad array of ideas ranging from the purpose of government, through the creation of the universe, the purpose of science and the arts, and of course, the mysteries of the Godhead. An indefatigable missionary and writer, Elder Pratt wanted members throughout the fledgling Church to know about the concepts that the Prophet taught. So Pratt wrote countless missionary tracts, books including the History of the Missouri Persecutions, and founded the Millennial Star, the oldest publication issued by the Church. He served numerous missions, was imprisoned for his views, as well called as an apostle on the first Council of Twelve for the Church along with his brother Orson Pratt. To know more about his remarkable life, I would recommend the Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt (Deseret Book, 1874). This book is fascinating as it shows how the time Elder Pratt spent with the Prophet Joseph Smith broadened his vision of what life holds for the follower of Christ. For Elder Pratt, truth was all encompassed within the Gospel--all part of what he called the science of theology. Some of the most interesting chapters span the second half of the book, including ruminations on the powers and calling of angels, the divine nature of dreams, qualifications for understanding the ""science"" of theology, the differentiation of spirits, and the power of miracles. Some members of the Church may not feel that there is anything new here, but a careful contextualization reminds us that these ideas were for the time, almost unimaginable and often breathtaking in their scope. The book has many often quoted passages including a personal favorite on the refining influence of the Holy Ghost: ""It quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections, and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom to their lawful use. It inspires, develops, cultivates and matures all the fine toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings and affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social feeling. It develops and invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, invigorates and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 08, 2016","May 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3004287-key-to-the-science-of-theology

Over 17 hours of narration long, the Greater Journey, literally dragged on for almost a year. There is so much of interest from politics and medicine, through architecture, fashion, and fine art in this expansive retelling of a time period (approx. 1830-1900) when everything worthwhile appeared to be found on the Continent, especially in Paris, the City of Lights. As I generally can read so quickly, I found myself bogged down as I listened and then discovered that speeding up the reading ruined the storytelling for me.

Parts of this novel reminded me of childhood magic--apple trees that seemed to be alive and an abundance of flowers that we could use to change emotions and perhaps fate. This was Allen's first novel and if you enjoy gardens and romance, this just might be your summer read. Reader's warning: this is an adult novel with some sexual references.

I used his celery cleanse, for instance, and felt fabulous. He feels that the new so-called mystery illnesses like fibromyalgia, Epstein-Barr, rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme Disease, and chronic fatigue can be healed by a cleansing diet of lots of (you guessed it), fruits and vegetables. He also posits a case for super mutating viruses like CMV as the root of many of these unexplained illnesses. Healthy people may have these viruses in them (over 60% of American grownups, for instance has CMV) but when stress and illness strike, they predispose people to exhibit these ailments which are then hard to diagnose and cure. Another issue that causes the body to get out of balance according to Anthony is the overuse of ""super-antibiotics"" that play havoc with the human biome.Practical and easy to follow suggestions.

It concerns the rise of the Ephrussi house, a wealthy Jewish family who come as grain merchants from Odessa, Russia to cities including Paris and Vienna in the mid 1800s. They experience incredible success in business and begin collecting art as they build grand homes. During this time, one of the early family members buys several hundred netsuke figurines from Japan as part of his penchant for collecting. As the decades pass the family is at times honored and adored and then castigated and hated because of their race. The threads of the story are woven together into a tapestry by a contemporary family member, a successful potter, who has inherited the netsuke. The author has a wonderful voice and an incredible eye for detail as he travels around Europe and beyond to follow the history of the netsuke as it passes through the scions of the family into contemporary times. “Stories are a kind of thing, too. Stories and objects share something, a patina. I thought I had this clear, two years ago before I started, but I am no longer sure how this works. Perhaps a patina is a process of rubbing back so that the essential is revealed, the way that a striated stone tumbled in a river feels irreducible, the way that this netsuke of a fox has become little more than a memory of a nose and a tail. But it also seems additive, in the way that a piece of oak furniture gains over years and years of polishing, and the way the leaves of my medlar shine.” “Yangi, a philosopher, art historian and poet, had evolved a theory of why some objects - pots, baskets, cloth made by unknown craftsmen - were so beautiful. In his view, they expressed unconscious beauty because they had been made in such numbers that the craftsman had been liberated from his ego.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 29, 2015","Dec 04, 2015","Oct 29, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7821828-the-hare-with-amber-eyes

Although I felt that the Epilogue was not the strongest part of the novel, the rest of this story is lovely. Wound around themes such Luminous novel. Although I felt that the Epilogue was not the strongest part of the novel, the rest of this story is lovely. Wound around themes such as the passage of time, religious faith, what it means to be literate, and especially the power of art, beauty, and music to change our lives, Bel Canto (which translates to ""beautiful singing"") is an enchanting view of what it means to be human under trying circumstances. Opera and classical music have been in my home once childhood and the thrill of sitting in an opera house as the orchestra warms up and the light dim is palpable delight at its best. Consequently I was surprised at how the author, who admits to only recently beginning her admiration for this art form, is able to make it sound so authentic and integral to this story. Without a retelling of the plot, I will state that the book actually reads like an opera on many levels. Katsumi Hosokawa recalls how his life forever changed after his father took him to see Verdi's Rigoletto as a child. From that point on, ""There was nothing more to want than the privilege to sit and listen."" His favorite recording star is Roxane Coss, modeled on lyric soprano Renée Fleming. Pachett's descriptions are at times, exquisite: ""Her voice was so pure, so light, that it opened up the ceiling and carried their petitions directly to God. It swept over them like the feathery dusting of wings, so that even the Catholics who no longer practiced their faith, and the non-Catholics who came along because there was nothing else to do, and all those who had no idea what he was saying, and the stone-cold atheists who wouldn't have cared anyway, because of her singing they all went away feeling moved, feeling comforted, feeling, perhaps, the slightest tremors of faith."" 200. As Roxane exults, ""who did not feel the joy in such music?""This book contains so much to examine (references to music abound), to savor and contemplate that it has earned a spot on my bookshelf. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 29, 2015","Jul 30, 2015","Jul 31, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

Even as a young girl, I remember looking at these books which always appealed to me because of their titles. This 1946 bestseller about Walter a Gurney, a young bastard son of a noble is a fascinating look back into English history in the 1200s. Costain draws on a legend of an English crusader who becomes the father of Thomas a Beckett, and an Eastern girl who only knows two words of English. Costain began the book wanting to write about three individuals: Edward I, King of England; the scientist and visionary thinker, Roger Bacon; and a Mongolian general named Bayon of the Hundred Eyes, who conquered China for Kublai Khan. While the book only deals with these three individuals in a peripheral way, and although dated due to 1940s stereotypes and writing style, this was still a fascinating, though romanticized look into the Dark Ages including changes in the feudal system of England, the advent of the longbow and discovery of gunpowder, as well as the beginning of enlightenment due to the intrepid explorers who returned from fabled Cathay....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 05, 2015","Jan 07, 2015","Jan 07, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/401921.The_Black_Rose

Our medical schools are increasingly offering courses in these modalities to round out a physician's training. I am an integrationist (find all helpful truths and use them) and feel that one method or school of thought seldom has all of the answers. Halpern's book offers a window to a different, wholistic way of looking at the body and especially illness as ""dis-ease"". When we are not in balance illness often will manifest itself. And sadly, what we do in Western medicine often addresses only symptoms and not causes, thereby creating further complications. Medicine is often an ""art,"" not an exact science.

If this 1996 novel had been introduced to me only with its basic plot, I would have probably not been very interested (proud and rebellious heroine meets dark, brooding archangel) but it is often delightful and resonates with me due to the characters as well as references to biblical texts that Shinn incorporates. A sci-fi-fantasy, the world that Shinn creates within the pages of her novel is both a unique and provocative look at religion, faith, and opposition in all things. It is romantic, philosophical, and spiritual in the larger than life way of an epic, but also warm and intimate. In a country called Samaria, a race of angels lives among humans. Appointed as guardians to the human race by their god, Jovah, the angels are beset by the same personality flaws and frailties as humans. The associative way that Shinn writes, bringing in geographic details and names such as Lucifer, Tamar, Bethel, and the ideas that drive the plot--how gods, angels, and mortals live and interact--are thought-provoking.

Every day, more fragments of the past roll around heavily in the chambers of an empty brain, shedding bits of color, a sentence or a fragrance, something that changes and then disappears. It drops like a stone to the bottom of the cave.”This novel was a serendipitous read as we work currently for an NGO in Eastern Europe that promotes international development in post-communist countries. Having just returned from Europe, I found myself at the airport bookstore searching for a book as we headed for the Yucatán peninsula for a vacation. I picked up Lacuna, by a favorite author, Barbara Kingsolver, and I was not disappointed, especially once I explored the cenotes and snorkeled in the underground rivers that are found throughout the Yucatán. An ambitious work, while sadly eschewed by some critics, Lacuna offers a unique and brilliant lens for looking at a tumultuous time in 20th Century history. I thoroughly enjoyed Kingsolver’s use of multiple narrational viewpoints to understand the worker’s movement and it’s appeal to human rights activists such as Leon Trotsky and the artist Diego Rivera and appreciated her research on this topic that was so assumed to be black and white for US citizens raised in the post WWII era. History repeats itself when we do not understand the past.

While I feel the author was a very good man and stalwart member of the LDS church who points the way to Zion I do have some small criticisms and reservations. My biggest reservation is with his focus on the doctrine of translation. I think it is definitely possible but not something that, just like the 12 Nephite apostles at the visit of Christ exhibited, need necessarily be the wish of each of our hearts. When we align our will with that of God, we will each be given specific tasks to complete prior to the Savior's return, only one of which might be serving in a translated capacity.

This novel is conflicted, beautiful, irritating, and really quite brilliant. If you read it as a gothic romance, that works. The beginning paragraph is flawless. The description of Manderley when the narrator first arrives is gorgeous. Personally I read it as a psychological exploration of women, with Rebecca and the unnamed narrator acting as foils/mirrors of one another. They are the red queen-white queen locked in a strange Alice in Wonderland world. Suspenseful, haunting, sometimes a little over the top, yet once the plot starts to unfold it veritably gallops along to an unexpected conclusion. Lots to discuss with this one and many good s discuss literary aspects worth exploring. No wonder Alfred Hitchcock chose to make a film from the novel.I’ve read this at 20, 40, and now in my 60s. It’s still just brilliant but it’s incredible what happens to my reactions as the narration unfolds. The relationship that I have with the narrator is changed radically with every two decades. In my 20s it was a historical romance, my 40s found me viewing the narrator from a psychological lens, and now, I find it a very different read indeed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 17, 2018","Jul 21, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12873.Rebecca

It is on one hand brash and slightly crude (think of a stereotypical adolescent male brain) and on the other, inventive, creative and quite brilliant. It reminds me a lot of Catcher in the Rye for some strange reason. A bildungsroman perhaps? Anyway, I loved Holly's , which is spot on including how one may unexpectedly experience high school giggles at times while reading. I am old school and grew up thinking that swearing was an attempt at machismo from either young adults or uneducated individuals--in fact I almost find expressions such as ""fudge"" or ""fug"" worse than the real expletive as they are an attempt to get around the stigma of swearing in an irritatingly cloying way. But that is also Green's genius as he perfectly captures a form of adolescent boy talk typified in the relationship between protagonist, Colin, and his slightly chubby ""male boobs"" friend and sidekick, Hassan--sexual innuendos and potty humor, brashness, put downs, and more. Yet Colin is also brilliant and socially awkward and Hassan is bright, lovable, but lazy. Their banter is often intelligent. The use of ""fug"" for instance, is a literary reference, which makes it amusing as do the French and German expressions including sitzpinklery. At time I wanted to give up reading in disgust at the immaturity of the boys, and at the next, was drawn back in to see if they would grow up. That is Green's talent.

There are so many references that possibly escape the casual reader, including Sir Francis Bacon's quote: ""Some books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be chewed and digested thoroughly.""

It is just remarkable and shows the inspiration that stood behind Joseph Smith's teachings. The doctrines are set out in a way that we can both comprehend the character of God and learn what it takes to progress in our lives to become more Christ-like in our character.“If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves.” ( History of the Church, 6:303. ) “When you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.) those things that were presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in Christ Jesus.” ( Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 151.) “We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man. . . . All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not.” ( Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 181.) Although the Joseph Smith Papers have filled in a lot more than this ever could have addressed, it still stands by the ""standard works"" of religion on my bookshelf. It contains mind-expanding restored doctrine of who we are and why we are experiencing mortality with all of its highs and lows. It gives the reader so much Hope. I agree with Joe Hunt that it just gets better, the further you read in this volume. The doctrines are mind-blowing. It's why I became a member of this church as a 10-year old and have never looked back or regretted my decision.“Surely I have contemplated the things of God.” ( History of the Church 5:554 )...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Nov 23, 2012not set","Dec 21, 2014not set","Nov 23, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/574361.Teachings_of_the_Prophet_Joseph_Smith

Well, Victoria Holt, is another pen name for the same author. I love history and do enjoy this genre, as long as it is well written. Holt has done fastidious homework and while much of the intimate detail is fictionalized, Marie Antoinette and the circumstances of the French Revolution are drawn in great detail, from the historical events down to fantastic three-foot high hairstyles and her love of beautiful gowns to the little country home, the Trianon, that she had built on the grounds of Versailles to live her conception of pastoral idyllic life. As one who hated the super-conflated etiquette of the French court, Marie was so ill-suited to the manipulations and contrivances of the age and escaped reality and restriction to Trianon whenever she could. Understanding that she was so young and high-spirited allows the reader to see the tragic train of events unfolding. She and Louis XVI, her husband are tragic characters in a hate-filled, hysterical time that is often romanticized by modern shows such as Les Miserables. Excess, greed, avarice--all the classic seven sins are apparent in this era, but also the sweetness of human bonds. As a character and actual historical personage, Marie is most interesting. She had a happy childhood as the last of fifteen children, born to the Empress of Austria. Growing up in a life of privilege and wealth as an archduchess in Schonbruun Palace, Marie was completely unaware of the world around her and once transported to France as part of an ""alliance"" pact as a very young teen, she was supposed to immediately consummate her marriage with an equally young Louis to bear an heir, a dauphin, for France. As a foreigner to the court, she was high-spirited, headstrong, and had no idea of the money that she spent or of her detractors which put her in a dangerous position from the very beginning. Although she matures with motherhood, the French people saw her as the scapegoat for the excesses of the nobility that had magnified after the death of Louise IV. Mostly she refused to heed the advice of Mercy, the councilor that was appointed to advice her by her mother. Each chapter begins with quotations for documents of the time, including Marie's copious journals, letters, and memoirs, which center the events. I would recommend this highly but with the caution to read other accounts of her life to get a more complete picture. History is very subjective and as a historian friend reminds me, corroboration of sources is essential. ...more",Notes are private!,-2,7,1,not set,not set,"Nov 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/817139.The_Queen_s_Confession

Emily Carr was one of my favorite painters as an art major in the early 1970s. I even completed a project on her at that time for my amazing professor, the Canadian painter, Gordon A. Smith. Carr was introduced to me by Professor Smoth as a part of the Canadian Group of Seven. She was an acquaintance of Georgia O'Keefe's, and equal to her in vision as well as to Frida Kahlo. Currently Emily Carr's work is on exhibit at Germany's prestigious Documenta art show. While I love her artwork, much of which documents the coastal landscapes and First Nations life in turn of the century British Columbia, Canada, my heart is most attracted to her stories. The Book of Small, Klee Wyck, and many others are gems of storytelling from a very original voice. Ms. Carr won the Governor General's award for Klee Wyck in about 1941.

At first I wasn't sure that I ""liked"" the writing style and setup but as I went through the chapters and pondered the ideas, I began to see the purpose behind the apparent simplicity of the book. I also wasn't particularly a fan of the stories that he chose to illustrate his points, but the doctrinal insights and scriptures that are cited are thoroughly researched and organized into a cohesive argument. At some points, I feel Ferrell stretches his analogy too far in order to prove his case (he is a lawyer, after all), but this book is a good reminder for our self-absorbed and goal-obsessed Western culture. In the end, until we stop our ceaseless striving to become better than others and realize our nothingness before the perfection of the Savior, we are entirely missing the point of mortality. For only when we begin to see our own imperfections honestly along with our inability to become ""light"" without the Atonement, do we begin to understand why prophets like Alma, Ammon, Nephi, and Paul, all commented in frustration on their own weakness. We truly must fall down in humility at His feet at our inability to become perfect alone; only then can we be lifted up. It is a hard lesson in our feel-good culture.A favorite quote from G.K. Chesterton:How much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller in it; if you could look at other men with common curiosity and pleasure . . . You would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your own little plot is always being played, and you would find yourself under a freer sky, and in a street full of splendid strangers....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 04, 2012","Jul 04, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13503234-falling-to-heaven

Wicked King Leck is dead and his daughter, Bitterblue, is now the young queen. She is faced with unhelpful councilors and ridicoulous mounds of paperwork, but no answers to her questions. At the beginning of the story she is very inexperienced as a ruler. She realizes that she has been kept from the truth concerning the lives of her subjects and the situation in her kingdom since the death of her monster-of-a-father, King Leck. Now,bas she awakens to her responsibilities, she searches for further answers to her past. Her task is to then discover how to awaken her subjects and slowly purge her kingdom of the hidden trauma they have endured. Nice to have Cashore pull in characters from prior novels into this, but I wish we had seen a little more of their personality--especially Katsa and Po--instead of having them appear almost comical in their constant amorous tussling with one another. A more grown up conversation or some depth would have been appreciated in their characterization.

Stephen Batchelor also tries in this book to answer some of the big questions of existence, but through a Buddhist lens. At times, this book is profound, at others I felt it was a bit less finished, but on the whole, this is a very insightful look at what it means to truly be present with yourself as well as with others. The idea of becoming enlightened is really fascinating as it includes self-acceptance and ultimately a turning outward of oneself to truly care for the needs of others. For me, as a Christian, this book reminds me of what we can strive for as humans.Some favorite quotations:Through yoga and meditation I have learned a little about the principle of one-pointed concentration (Samadhi) but Batchelor reminds us with a quote from Tzong Khapa that ""one should mount the wisdom which clearly discerns the way things are upon the immovable horse of concentration.""On an optimum way of being: "". . . such a person is characterized by three principle qualities. He appears to be possessed of great intuition and wisdom, he radiates deep concern and compassion for others, and he seems to be endowed with an unusual inner strength and will power.""""It is only when the optimum mode of being is realized that one achieves the capacity to spontaneously act in such a way that one's every word and deed serves to intimate to others the possibility of experiencing a much fuller and richer existence.""""Buddha is nothing but the optimum mode of being possible for man in his present condition.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 29, 2012","Jun 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/596076.Alone_with_Others

It is a harder read for many who don't love history as it has little narrative flow and introduces so many stories of women that overlap in odd places. I enjoyed parts but felt that although I have lived through these times, I have always been tremendously thrilled to be a woman, rather that feeling oppressed. I do agree with Collins' definition of a feminist--one who is for equal rights under the law and equal wages. Feminism has become a suspect term today, but even in the time of Eliza R. Snow and the early Utah Saints, the LDS women were very involved with the topic of suffrage and equal rights under the law. I am appreciative of women who have paved the way for us today to have opportunities for education, for voting rights, and much more. Today, woman are still treated as chattel in many countries in the world. Even when I grew up, a woman was still paid less than 60% of what a man made for doing the same job. Every woman should at least skim through this book, if only to consider how lucky she is to live in a country that now guarantees so many freedoms. http://nyti.ms/8gCNjE...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 31, 2012","Mar 31, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6192234-when-everything-changed

Donalyn Miller is practical and honest in her recounting of the struggles she had in getting her class to read a book. Then with a little ""tweak"" her students now read dozens of books each year. Her method reminds me of my 6th and 7th grade teacher, Mr. Gibson, a once-in-a-lifetime model of great teaching who somehow came from Glasgow, Scotland to our little provincial Elementary school in White Rock, British Columbia, Canada. Like the author, he allowed us to spend hours reading and discussing literature. We started off reading Nancy Drew and other series books, but slowly were absorbed into more difficult texts that still astonish me. During my years with him, our entire class became readers--Thomas Hardy, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters, were all among the classics which became our friends in a very real way--as we each devoured books under his watchful eye. Frank Smith said that we need to introduce children into the ""reading club"" by a simple recipe, ""the more you read, the better you read; the better you read, the more you read."" Worksheets, drills, and boring assessments will never do what reading widely voraciously, and through one's own volition, will. When will grownups wake up to the fact that reading must be caught, not taught? I have always contended that if reading were made a subversive activity, every child in America would be reading at night with a flashlight under their covers. :)I have several friends I have recommended this book to and have heard that their students are reading like never before. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 05, 2011","Aug 21, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4732276-the-book-whisperer

The story is wonderful and would make a romantic and action-packed film. At his best, Sir Walter Scott is eloquent and the story flows through it's poetic cantos so quickly that one can't put it down. Some parts however, drag a bit for a modern audience. Based loosely on the reign of James V, King of Scotland, and the beautiful Ellen, this is an almost forgotten yet richly rewarding account of the battles between the Scottish highlanders and lowlanders. With Robin Hood; burning crosses, later sadly adopted by the Klu Klux Klan (the first two words came from the Greek word for circle); the song Hail to the Chief; Schubert's Ave Maria, and much more, the story has a rich cultural footprint.My interest in it was aroused when going through family genealogy and realizing that Duncan as well as Rob Roy are family ancestors. My husband's highland roots come out with every Scottish festival and he reminds me of Sir Douglas in the story--a man of uncommon strength and valor. :) Recommended for those who want to work at reading a little harder as one should at least read the wiki intro first to get a grasp of the three story lines and the major characters. Also, I didn't purchase the book, instead I read the free 1903 Google scan of the Nightingale edition with and introduction by Chalmers. :) It has pages of excellent explanatory notes in the back.

The characters are all tied to the Holocaust in one way or another. They are complex and as we see their oft-heated family exchanges, they are ""drawn"" with a fabulous sense of reality to them. I even recognized something of my own now deceased father in Art's father, also a WWII survivor. Dad would spend hours straightening nails and storing them, and other quaint objects that we who live in such affluence cannot imagine saving. I even remember him being angry about throwing out a crust of bread and saying that one can never know which meal will be your last. He fought on the Russian front for five years. We have no idea what these individuals went through, especially these Jewish people who were caught up in the Holocaust.The graphic novel is intriguing as you examine the subtle shifts of tone in the pictures and the hidden symbols like the naked trees and the road as a swastika when Vladek and Anja Spiegelman, Art's parents, try to find a place of safety in Poland. The story is compelling and the artistry merits study. I have enjoyed considering how the act of reading changes when we ""read"" the combined text of a comic and a written text.

As a Canadian at the time, I heard of peace protests and encountered draft dogers in Vancouver while I went to university.

Who wouldn't be interested in building themselves a better brain? This books explains many aspects of modern neuroscience, arguing for plasticity, while much of our scientific community is still stuck in Decartean thinking where the brain is ""hardwired"" with fixed regions that limit human intelligence, growth, healing, and change. In a culture where everyone is bent on a ""quick fix"" through surgery or drugs and trusts a medical establishment that is too often immersed in neurological nihilism, it is an exceptionally brave endeavor to go against the status quo and write a book such as this. I am not convinced that all of his quoted scientific research is exceptional, but he makes a very compelling case.Malleability or plasticity as Doidge calls it, is found in four areas:1. Brain map expansion2. Sensory reassignment3. Compensatory masquerade4. Mirror region takeoverAll of these kinds of plasticity are discussed in detail in the book and have been identified by Jordan Grafman, the chief of the Congnitive Neursciences section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NIH). My favorite sections include Merzenich's research on dyslexia and other forms of language impairment among children (pp 69-83); the extended mental lifespan section (pp.84-91) that even talks about why we need to walk barefoot as often as possible when we age; a section on imagination and its effects on mental practice including the inhibition of pain (pp. 199-204; a chapter on neurogenesis (Ch 10); and how children caught between two cultures can modify their brains (298-304). Yes, we can become sharper, faster, and more brilliant with age!Favorite quote: ""When Pablo Casals, the cellist, was ninety-one years old, he was approached by a student who asked, ""Master, why do you continue to practice?""

This is one of the major themes of this book. If the wind had shifted direction at the wrong time during the Battle of Long Island, or if the fog hadn't settled in during Washington's retreat across the East River, then the Revolution might have ended then and there. But it wasn't just Providence that made the difference, it also was the courage and character of individual soldiers that turned the tide, Washington himself being a key figure. McCullough quotes George Otto Trevelyan, who wrote, ""It may be doubted whether so small a number of men ever employed so short a space of time with greater and more lasting effects upon the history of the world."" That the Continental Army survived the year 1776 at all is miraculous. McCullough writes with clarity and energy and has done a remarkable job synthesizing a vast amount of scholarship.""Miss your insights, Gary. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 19, 2015","May 03, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1067.1776

While I agree with many of the very positive s and felt as if Kingsolver's reading of historical events in the Congo was enlightening, I felt that my chief disappointment was the underdevelopment of the father as a character. He was so flat; a caricature . Kingsolver painted him with broad brushstrokes into an abusive, tyrannical fanatic, who in short lacked any redeeming qualities. I understand that some individuals are wounded or broken, but people are generally more complex than the father. Why would Leah be so dogged on her early determination to follow him? Perhaps this was a character with progressive mental illness? I'd love to hear a psychologist's read of this book.

Incredible stories that are so painful to read about. Am trying to decide what to do to help--have an educational project with Africa I am involved with that might be the answer. Read Chapter 6, for instance, and you will weep at the incredible state of a world who pays for wars but ignores human dignity.Finally finished. The challenge of this book is to face up to the humanitarian concerns of women locked up in brothels, sold into slavery, left dying in huts because of no access to fistula surgery, women who are beaten, raped and demeaned because of cultural ignorance and tradition. Because of who we are, and the tremendous opportunities we have been given in this ""promised land,"" we cannot read about these injustices, sigh, and go on with our comfortable lives. We have to find ways to be involved in ending suffering and ignorance in our communities and throughout the world. The authors offer many concrete options at the end of the book--ways in which each reader can make a small difference. While I do not necessarily agree with all of the author's conclusions from the data that they present, I feel that this is one of the most important books of the past decade. As Brigham Young, the LDS prophet and visionary leader stated over 150 years ago, ""If I had a choice of educating my daughters or my sons because of opportunity constraints, I would choose to educate my daughters."" This is not a sexist statement, but a necessity in most parts of the world; especially when one takes a more broad look at what the term education can imply. Women in a society must realize their worth and dignity and be valued by men, in order for a society to evolve. As Greg Mortenson writes in ""Three Cups of Tea,"" the ""enemy is ignorance."" He has concluded after years of working with villagers in remote reaches of Afghanistan and Pakistan that ""Once you educate the boys, they tend to leave the villages and go search for work in the cities . . . but girls stay home, become leaders in the community, and pass on what they've learned. If you really want to change a culture . . . the answer is to educate girls.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 21, 2010","Mar 19, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6260997-half-the-sky

Based on historical circumstances, Schmidt, an English professor, sets this award-winning story of friendship and coming-of-age on the Maine coastline in Phippsburg, a town near Malaga Island. The time period is about 1905, when the publication of Charles Darwin's ""Origin of the Species"" shocked a nation from their slumber. Rich with descriptions of the coastline and the Atlantic shore, the book is evocative without overly long passages. I emerged, having climbed with Turner on the granite outcroppings, smelling the pines and rainstorms. Turner is the son of a very conservative preacher, the third Buckminster (III), and cannot seem to do anything right in the eyes of other boys his age, his parents, and of course, the townsfolk. The appearance of Lizzy, a resident of Malaga, sets the historical events of the story in motion. A favorite reading quote:Reverend Buckminster on deciding whether to allow Turner to read Darwin: ""Turner,"" he said, ""books can be fire you know.""""Fire?""""Fire. Books can ignite fires in your mind, because they carry ideas for kindling, and art for matches."" He handed the book to Turner.

Campbell was then director of International Affairs for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Campbell, also a director of the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation and a founder of the Special Olympics program here, in a more watered down version, shares some insights on the story of Eden. Who was Eve? As a young Lutheran girl, I was always a little embarrassed to have been descended from Eve as Adam seemed so wise and righteous. The world portrays Eve as somehow a failure: weak, easily deceived, and mentally incapable of making a good decision. As a member of the LDS church I have come to realize that Eve was truly glorious and beautiful, a perfect woman as a match for Adam. In an early vision that opens to Zebedee Coltrin, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, they see ""two most beautiful and perfect specimens of mankind [they had:] ever [seen:]."" Zebedee writes that ""Joseph said, They are our first parents,' Adam and Eve."" He continues that ""Adam was a large broad-shouldered man, and Eve, as a woman, was as large in proportion."" B. H. Roberts, ""New Witnesses for God, 2:7.If one believes that the purpose of mortality is to progress to become more Christlike in all of our attributes, we are able to do this through a conscious decision-making process called agency. We come to earth from a pre-existent state in order to learn to choose wisely and grow to become more like our Father--Eloheim, the Eternal God. The Fall was a necessary part of an eternal plan. Eve's choice was to transgress one law in order to fulfill another law, the commandment to ""multiply and replenish the earth."" Our placement on earth stems from the agency that Eve exercises on behalf of all mankind, a transgression from the garden state to mortality, without which the entire plan of God would have no meaning and Adam and Eve would still be wandering around in Eden alone. So how was Eve able to make this choice? Was it because she was simple and confused or was it a carefully thought out decision? I concur with Campbell that it was the latter.As brain research is beginning to indicate, perhaps men and women think differently. Men seem to think in terms of absolute justice (black and white, right and wrong), whereas women's thinking is generally more intuitive and multidimensional. Women's brains are hardwired to think in terms of ""highest best good"" and interrelationships (the qualities of mercy) or what Beverly Campbell calls a ""morality of responsibility. "" In fact, research on how morality develops within societies indicates that morality scales are based on studies which do not include women as subjects! See Alma 42:24 for an interesting insight on the terms his and hers.In the Genesis (and Moses) account, Adam is given a commandment to not partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil in a time before Eve is created (Genesis 2:16-17). He, as a black and white thinker will not break the commandment of God by his own volition. Eve, on the other hand, uses the type of thinking that allows for a morality of responsibility and realizes that without transgressing one law, she breaks another (multiple and replenish the earth) and cannot ever bear children to fulfill God's other commandment. How long she ponders this choice is not told to us, but over time, she comes to the decision that if Adam will not do it, she must. And what a gift she gives us. Through her brave and well-reasoned choice, we learn that mortality is a probationary period in which we are allowed to choose and to know by our own experience ""the good from the evil."" Adam and Eve, for me, epitomize the best of a marriage relationship and partnership as they complement each others ways of being and even each others' thought processes. 1 Corinthians 11:11 talks of this. Who'd have guessed? It looks as if God knew all along why man and women were intended to become of one heart and one mind. :) Also read: Alonzo Gaskill's book on the subject, The Savior and the Serpent: Unlocking The Doctrine of the Fall....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 24, 2010","Jan 06, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/449545.Eve_and_the_Choice_Made_in_Eden

Cashore presents an often funny, innovative view of human gifts and talents and what we may choose to do with them as well as a great psychological analysis of a character's growth. Kudos.

If YA is an opportunity for young adults to vicariously experience rich relationships, I was disappointed that Cashore takes the easy way out to allow Katsa freedom without the obligations and discipline required in a marriage. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 17, 2010","Jan 05, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3236307-graceling

I loved the flawed characters in this well-crafted tale. Maugham is a wonderful writer with an eye for detail and nuance. He leaves the reader with so many unanswered questions in this book, which make it a joy to read. Kitty Fane (rhymes with vane -- like The Vane Sisters--Nabokov's tale is delightful, by the way), is vacuous and undisciplined at the book's beginning. By the end, will she have learned anything? There are no neat endings and ""the way"" through this book is as complex as the veil that has been drawn over life itself. Certainly at the end one can reread and find foreshadowing and writerly glimpses and gestures, but this is a sophisticated read about a developing personality, not a romance. This book offers insights into so many windows including the sometimes absurdities of love, the nature of spirituality, the disasters of upbringing, the foibles of self-importance and left me wanting to return to Maugham and discover more of his craft.

In 1564 Galileo Galilei is born in Pisa on February 15. Michelangelo Buonarroti dies in Florence, February 18. (William Shakespeare is born in England, April 23). Filled with novel detail including the fact that Viviani, the beloved student of Galileo’s old age “promulgated the belief that Michelangelo’s spirit had leaped like an inspiration from his aged, failing body to the infant Galileo in the brief span of hours separating the former’s death from the latter’s birth” is sometimes simply stunning to contemplate. The biography, which took me about two years to finish (I tend to be a slow and careful reader of this type of writing) is generally fascinating, but will not be everyone’s choice as it strays into so many areas in its subject matter: from the day-to-day minutiae of a Poor Clare nun’s life (the letters of Seur Celeste, Galileo’s daughter) and her thoughts on how many scudis a bottle of wine will bring or what natural medicines might repel the bubonic plague, through European and Italian City State politics, circling around intriguing religious squabbles and Galileo’s trial at the Vatican, and naturally ing, often in great and often illustrated detail, the theoretical and scientific thinking of this genius. If you have ever laid on the grass on a summer’s evening gazing up at the stars or wondered at the changing tides or pondered why the face in the moon never changes even as the moon revolves around the earth, this book will both educate and delight you.Some interesting quotations:“Galileo would engage this same cosmic conflict with the Church, treading a dangerous path between the Heaven he revered as a good Catholic and the heavens he revealed through his telescope.”A ... “duration of forty days—quaranta giorni in Italian, from which the word quarantine” is derived.“Fully 50 percent of the daughters of Florentine patrician families spent at least part of their lives within convent walls.”Lastly, rhe delightful and creative writing of Sister Celeste: “In this last post your letters arrived like the Franciscan friars wearing their wooden clogs, not only yoked together, but with a resounding clatter, creating in me a much greater than usual commotion of pleasure and happiness . . .”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 28, 2019","Aug 29, 2009",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8347052-galileo-s-daughter

Kind of a ""read a chapter a day and think about it"" layout. It appears very basic, but is a great sumary of truths. I did enjoy many quotes by Thoreau.I recommend this book to anyone trying to learn to be more mindful and accepting of their lives. So many individuals live in their fantasies --how wonderful/terrible the past was or how they will be happy if only this happens in the future. But really, all you have is this immediate moment to live in fully, followed by the next moment, and the next. Kabat-Zinn, who has spent his life in the medical field, teaching meditation at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, says that the whole point of mindfulness based stress reduction is ""to challenge and encourage people to become their own best authorities, to take more responsibility for their own lives their bodies, their health.""

That said, this is a brave book for an established systems theory genious to write. It takes empirical research to an uncomfortable place for most A-B ""rational"" Descartian thinkers. Gasp--it even verges on reaching for answers to those terrible questions that tippy-toe about the sublime. ""Who are we? Where did we come from? Is there something after this pale existence?"" The author (whose writing could have been more effective in the latter chapters with a little less ""fluff"") employs systems theory to integrate the specialized knowledge found in diverse disciplines such as astrophysics, quantum physics, molecular biology, and even consciousness studies into a holistic interdisciplinary model that frankly is so elegant that it takes one's breath away. His basic premise is a philosophic one, built upon the life works of brilliant scholars in each of these fields. Called the quantum/vacuum interaction hypothesis or A-field (the hypothesized fifth field after gravity, electromagnetic, strong and weak force), his theory (for I call it such) takes what Carl Jung calls the collective unconscious or what eastern philosophers have postulated for millenia: we live in a universe built upon coherence, continuity, and consciousness. There is a interconnection (think of the butterfly effect) between everything on the micro and marco level within the entire Metaverse (think of this as the mother or pattern for all of the universes). In fact, he postulates, the metaverse contains an encoding or patterning that creates new universes that come into being with the same possibility of evolutionary life and agency that we experience here on our own planet. There is much more to digest here. Very worthwhile reading.Favorite quotes: ""the memory of the universe may be eternal."" ""In the final count, the evolutionist/creationist controversy has no point. The question ""Design or evolution?"" poses a false alternative. Design and evolution do not exclude each other; indeed they require one another. The Metaverse is unlikely to have come into existence out of nothing, as a result of pure chance. And if it was designed, it was evidently so designed that it could evolve. The truth of the matter is not ""design or evolution."" It is design for evolution."" 128...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 29, 2008","Aug 19, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/181821.Science_and_the_Akashic_Field

We really care most about ourselves and how we feel about everything, whether we want to admit it or not. I have met very few self-actualized individuals in my life and definitely fewer enlightened ones. Eat, Pray, Love was certainly not great literature, and written unevenly in places, but it was also at times funny, poignant, heart-rending, earthy, and informative. Sadly, people felt betrayed by the final section--accusing the narrator of giving up her search for God in the process of rediscovering love. Hey. . . that's life. We are either happy and fulfilled or we are not. If finding love gets us closer to God, or towards the feeling of happiness, what is wrong with that? Not everyone needs to spend the rest of their days in an ashram. After all, it is easy to be mindful and peaceful when away from ""real life"" but the ability to live among others, especially those who we automatically don't love is the thing that really tests our compassion and ability to be mindful.Anyway, this was not a book about finding God as much as about first finding oneself and then having an ability to look at that individual in the mirror with forgiveness, humor, and compassion. As Gilbert wisely writes:This is what we are like. Collectively, as a species, this is our emotional landscape. I met an old lady once, almost one hundred years old, and she told me, ""There are only two questions that human beings have ever fought over all though history. How much do you love me? And Who's in charge?"" . . .

After reading Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea, I wonder again at the international community and the blind eye most of us turn towards those who are in need. Are we not our brother's and sister's keepers? Although I was at Sundance a few years ago queued up to see the film premiere, ""The Giant Buddha's"" mentioned in this novel, I am startled that they made such headlines in the US news compared to the untold misery that individuals in these warring countries have endured. And why should we care? Because we have been given so much and so few of us are actively engaged in giving back. I suppose I am asking that you do something more than read to be entertained--although we cannot do everything, we can take the time to find a cause or charity that makes a difference for others. My personal cause is literacy and I advocate for the International Reading Associate which works with agencies internationally to make a difference in the lives of children by teaching them to read. I also am very interested in literacy for women, particularly in third world countries, agreeing with Mortenson who state that if you educate a woman, you educate a village. Ken Mortensen speaks for many of us who want to make a difference: ""Fighting terror is may be seventh or eighth on my list of priorities. But working over there, I’ve learned a few things. I’ve learned that terror doesn’t happen beacause some group of people somewhere like Pakistan or Afghanistan simply decide to hate us. It happens because children aren’t being offered a bright enough future that they have a reason to choose life over death.""I am naive enough to believe that schools and universal literacy are the cure for terrorism. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 07, 2008","Jul 28, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns

I know better than to expect a main character to be likable, and I want to like him, but Okonkwo is flawed--how can you love a man who is determined to be so blind to human kindness that he beats his wives and children and superstitiously refuses to take a stand against the murder of innocents because he has such a hatred towards his own father's soft nature? But I protest with little effect on history. For I am reading from a viewpoint so distanced from the African culture that Chinua Achebe describes, and from a personal ""moral"" compass and upbringing that is so different. My mind wanders to my horror at waterboarding. His is a culture that honors warriors. It reminds me of reading Sophocles' Oedipus, which I taught several years ago in a senior class along with books such as Anne Michael's ""Fugitive Pieces,"" and, of course, Max Frish's ""Homo Faber."" The theme of the course was on human blindness. This would have fit perfectly. Okonkwo is a tragic protagonist, but I cannot say hero, for even in his tribe, he was often corrected by his elders for his lack of restraint. In the background of his story, we see the equally blind white incursion upon his culture and the destruction of much of what has held his culture together. This is powerful reading that infuriates you and at the same time, sweeps you inexorably along to its tragic conclusion. An excellent book to discuss in a high school classroom....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 06, 2009","Jul 28, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37781.Things_Fall_Apart

Its goal is quite different; its goal is salvation from suffering."" 27The Four Noble Truths are universal teachings that I suppose it will take more than a lifetime to integrate into my beling. I love how the focus of this book changes as I mature. The purpose of a symbol, according to Hugh Nibley, is to ""direct, concentrate, discipline, and inform the thought."" (Temple and Cosmos, 1992, 14) As Siddhaartha states, ""I just love the stone and the river and all these things that we see and from which we can learn."" 117 Om Mani Padme Hung!The True Sound of TruthA devoted meditator, after years concentrating on a particular mantra, had attained enough insight to begin teaching. The student's humility was far from perfect, but the teachers at the monastery were not worried. A few years of successful teaching left the meditator with no thoughts about learning from anyone; but upon hearing about a famous hermit living nearby, the opportunity was too exciting to be passed up. The hermit lived alone on an island at the middle of a lake, so the meditator hired a man with a boat to row across to the island. The meditator was very respectful of the old hermit. As they shared some tea made with herbs the meditator asked him about his spiritual practice. The old man said he had no spiritual practice, except for a mantra which he repeated all the time to himself. The meditator was pleased: the hermit was using the same mantra he used himself -- but when the hermit spoke the mantra aloud, the meditator was horrified! ""What's wrong?"" asked the hermit. ""I don't know what to say. I'm afraid you've wasted your whole life! You are pronouncing the mantra incorrectly!"" ""Oh, Dear! That is terrible. How should I say it?"" The meditator gave the correct pronunciation, and the old hermit was very grateful, asking to be left alone so he could get started right away. On the way back across the lake the meditator, now confirmed as an accomplished teacher, was pondering the sad fate of the hermit. ""It's so fortunate that I came along. At least he will have a little time to practice correctly before he dies."" Just then, the meditator noticed that the boatman was looking quite shocked, and turned to see the hermit standing respectfully on the water, next to the boat. ""Excuse me, please. I hate to bother you, but I've forgotten the correct pronunciation again. Would you please repeat it for me?"" ""You obviously don't need it,"" stammered the meditator; but the old man persisted in his polite request until the meditator relented and told him again the way he thought the mantra should be pronounced. The old hermit was saying the mantra very carefully, slowly, over and over, as he walked across the surface of the water back to the island. http://www.dharma-haven.org/tibetan/m... ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Apr 1998,"Mar 23, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/357806.Siddhartha

Of Jung (whom I so admire), he wrote: ""Many brilliant people display their knowledge by talking in big words and might concepts that serve the dual purpose of inflating the speaker and confusing the listener. They sit like Olympian gods and expect other people to learn their language. But Jung could adjust his discourse in as was that would best serve the needs of the other person. He was a great intuitive thinker, but he did not speak to me in abstract intellectual language; he addressed me in the feeling language that I could relate to.""The academy could take note of this!This book was referred to me by peaceful Brother John at The Hermitage in Big Sur, California. Why do we struggle so to understand that ""Enlightenment is simply being, the act or fact of being a human with consciousness that you are following the will of God""My favorite lesson: ""But if you can stand to live in paradox long enough, then a transformation takes place and a new consciousness is born--a child called Samadhi. This occurs when one has stopped trying to maneuver external reality so that it will work out as the ego desires. One turns authority to something greater than oneself; the ego is sacrificed to the Self, the earthly world serves the heavenly world, and one learns, at last, to trust the slender threads....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Feb 2006,"Mar 23, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/424896.Balancing_Heaven_and_Earth

But what I did find to be of interest was following up on Brown's research in my English 305 class. The book originally piqued my interest because of the scholarly interest shown for its multiple premises. University courses were being offered, to my surprise, centered around the novel and even symposia were held. Brown has never expressed any pretensions of being one of the great American novelists, but he certainly was brilliant this time in his choice of topics. As Jeremy Paugh wrote, this is an ""intriguing exploration of some of Western culture's greatest mysteries--from the nature of the Mona Lisa's smile to the secret of the Holy Grail."" While I do not agree with all of his conclusions, I applaud him for the fact that he took a formulaic murder mystery and wove in multiple ideas that should make any thoughtful reader a little curious about history and instill a desire in them to follow up on the wealth of source material. By the way, after reading some of the s on this website, I have to comment that too often we readers pretend to be far more erudite and sophisticated than we really are. All of us have at times been guilty of thinking we have ""read"" great works which we might have cursorily glanced through in college or worse, heard of at some point in our education. The, sagcious ""oh yes"" nod when some writer is mentioned in a conversation, whom you really have not ever spent time with as a bedfellow. Don't be a book snob, for goodness sake. What is literature if you only wade through it as the Finns say, ""with long teeth"" in order to say that you have read one of the ""classics."" Novels after all, are meant, as Francis Bacon said, ""to be chewed, digested,"" and throughly enjoyed. :) Hooray for the Dan Browns of the world who keep us happily entertained....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Aug 2004,"Mar 20, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/968.The_Da_Vinci_Code

Although overly long (almost 600 pages), this is a classic text on spiritual growth and self-realization, especially focused upon kriya yoga meditation. As Paramahansa Yogananda details his personal journey to master the self he (unlike Ekhart Tolle, who mysteriously was given the gift of enlightenment without seeking), becomes an enlightened individual committed to peacefully serving mankind through teaching meditation. The book gives glimpses into the Indian culture and touches on some fascinating stories of saints and holy people including Ghandi. It is interesting how some cultures accept miracles as a natural part of life in contrast to how we in the West, with our supposed sophistication, have largely discounted these manifestations. One of the great contributions of the yogic tradition is the concept, based upon Patanjali's yoga sutras, of a union of body, mind and spirit. For India, this is a well-accepted part of science that we are only beginning to tap into with the work of scientists including Candace Peart, and our recent acceptance of the benefits of yoga, alternative medicine, etc. Read Lynne McTaggart's ""The Intention Experiment"" and ""The Field"" or Ervin Laslow's ""Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything"" for more on quantum physics and the universe.

Does not only write about peace, but has spent 20 years in Pakistan building schools in isolated, illiterate communities and educating women. Believes that in order to change a culture, one begins by educating the girls. Excellent--it motivated me to do something!2012: After reading the negative press, having talked to Greg personally, and considered the sources, I thought I'd add this link http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/opi... to a NYTimes article as well as an excerpt from a  of ""Three Cups of Deceit"" --the most scathing criticism of Greg's book to date from Wikipedia:Krakauer has received both criticism and praise for Three Cups of Deceit. The e-book was described as both ""Krakauer's fact-based gut-punch to Three Cups of Tea"" and to ""have a bit of a 'jilted lover' feel to it"" by Chamber Four online book er Marcos Velasquez who congratulated Krakauer on the book's release[2]. A starred  in Publishers Weekly proclaimed, ""Packed with interviews and anecdotes that undercut Mortenson's image as a cheerful do-gooder, Krakauer's account of good intentions gone horribly wrong is a stunning example of investigative journalism""[3]. Critics of Krakauer's work, however, have said Krakauer's focus is in the wrong direction. Marjorie Kehe, books editor for The Christian Science Monitor stated in her article on Krakauer's book, ""...having read and fully digested Three Cups of Deceit, I can still identify...fundamental truths in both of Mortenson's books, Three Cups of Tea and Stones Into Schools. Kehe went on to state, ""Most of us, if we had established one such school – or even played a part in doing so – might feel that we had justified our very existences by that act. Mortenson has done this many, many times over. I'm not saying that this makes any wrongs he has committed right. It doesn't. But it certainly ought to be weighed in the balance.""[4] Scott Darsney, a mountaineer and friend of Greg Mortenson, wrote an email subsequently turned into an exclusive article for Outside magazine's online version as a response to Krakauer's book. Darnsey questioned the accuracy and fairness of both the Krakauer piece and the 60 Minutes report. Darnsey had been interviewed by Krakauer for Three Cups of Deceit, and maintains that Krakauer either misquoted or misunderstood what he said.[5]As a response to Krakauer's allegations, CAI produced a comprehensive list of projects completed over a period of years and projects CAI is currently working on. The list was released in December, 2011....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Mar 2008,"Mar 18, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49436.Three_Cups_of_Tea
