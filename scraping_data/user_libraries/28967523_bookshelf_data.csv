She and her brother see a different kind of family life - loving and fun - when they go to stay with their aunt and cousins. This is all set to the backdrop of the Nigerian coup which affects her father's life most of all.There were lots of things I enjoyed: how complicated her father is, the stirrings of love that Kambili feels for a priest, and the aunt and cousins, but still I was left rather unmoved. The brother and mother both seemed unknowable, and even Kambili is so introverted that she lack enough energy and agency to care too much about. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,Apr 2024,"Apr 08, 2024","Apr 09, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/126381.Purple_Hibiscus

Sometimes the shaming is because they have been caught out telling lies, other times it's because they posted a poorly thought through 'joke'.

It is repulsive, disturbing, grotesque, and mordantly funny - I laughed out loud many times and then felt bad about laughing. It's a clever writer who can make a reader feel both delighted and appalled in the same moment. Dinah Brooke's writing is clear and crisp, and the images she creates in the reader's head are vivid and nightmarish. Lord Jim at Home is a story in three parts about the life of Giles Trenchard, born between the wars into an upper middle class family where he is cruelly treated by his father and his first nursemaid. He learns to keep his head down, and by doing this he survives school and escapes to the Navy. The second part is about long stretches of time doing nothing, and an hour or two of intense and terrible fighting. When Giles returns to England he finds he doesn't fit in anywhere, can't understand what he's supposed to be doing, and the third part is completely unexpected and yet makes complete sense in a weird and very dark way.

This is definitely goiI absolutely loved this novel about (as the title suggests) three surgical interns in a Dublin hospital working the nightshift. This is definitely going on my top ten reads of 2024. And the more I think about, the cleverer I realise it is: a novel with a structure that matches the content. It's told from the point of view of an unnamed, ungendered narrator who's working several shifts, mostly at night with two other interns, Lynda and Stuart. They are continually beeped on their pagers and have to go to different wards around the hospital to carry out various tasks - mostly mundane but some highly pressured. Sleep deprivation, and terror at doing something wrong or being accused of doing something wrong by the toxic hospital consultants is pervasive, which means there's alternately a dream-like quality to what's happening or everything is lit up with a hideous brightness.Some s have criticised The Night Interns for a lack of a plot and that many (all?) of the crises fizzle out, but that's the point. Instead of the usual Western structure of everything leading to a single climax, here we have scene after scene that might go badly or might go well (just as the narrator feels). And these brightly lit scenes and are linked both physically and metaphorically by the long dark corridors that the interns have to traipse up and down to get to the wards and back to the res where they can (perhaps) rest.We see the narrator's intern colleagues talking to each other and sometimes laughing and just like the narrator we don't always understand why. This kind of confusion just made me feel more like the narrator must be feeling - too tired, too discombobulated to work things out.At first I wasn't sure about not knowing the narrator's gender or name, but perhaps that is to show that their condition is universal.I love novels set in places of work, and I love reading about hospitals, so The Night Interns was always going to appeal to me, but I think it's a brilliant novel which seems to be a little misunderstood. ...more",Notes are private!,1,22,1,"Feb 04, 2024","Feb 07, 2024","Feb 08, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/141396537-the-night-interns

I read it compulsively to find out what would happen but I was often repulsed by it, not only by the story but by the choices Christopher made in writing his characters. Really this is a male power trip, full of misogyny, sexism, and casual racism. It was of course written in the 1950s, but that doesn't excuse all of it.A virus has wiped out grass in China. The virus spreads to Europe and the UK. The government knows that famine will be coming and apparently decides that bombing all the large cities will be a way of decreasing the population so that at least some people survive. John has a brother who lives in a secluded valley in Westmorland and after a tip-off from a friend, he gathers his family, as well as various other people and they set off out of London heading towards the valley. This novel is the story of that journey, first in cars and then on foot and what happens along the way. And let me tell you a lot of bad things happen along the way. Lots of killing, and not only in self defence, and rape. Civilisation falls apart very quickly, and the men with the guns take control.Christopher doesn't let any of the characters spend much time questioning the terrible events and their choices, including letting a man in his fifties taking a 'middle-teens' girl as his 'wife', after he shoots his own wife because he's bored of her being adulterous. And yet a boy with a blister on his heel is carried for miles by his parents.I know I'm seeing this with 21st century eyes, but it's a troubling book. Is it a dystopian classic, or a misogynous horror?

In the middle of the pandemic, Lara and Joe's three daughters, all in their twenties, return to the family cherry farm to help out.

I knew somethings about Comyns' history (having read the most autobiographical of her novels, Out of the Red and Into the Blue), but I didn't know the extent of how hard she found it to hold onto money, the long gap in her life when her writing was out of favour, and just how many times she moved house to try to escape her debts.

I'm not sure I've read anything like it, and it took me a while but I came to really enjoy it. The majority of the novel is from a kind of omniscient narrator's point of view, but one which doesn't go inside characters' heads, so all we get is action which moves around the characters and their environment, rather like detailed stage directions. It was a fascinating way to (write) read, and discover that it worked - I still felt I knew the emotion (if not the thoughts) of each character, and that says masses for Rooney's skill as a writer. The other sections are emails between two friends, Alice and Eileen who live a couple of hours away from each other in Ireland. They discuss beauty and other existential ideas as well as their ever-changing relationships with their boyfriends Felix and Simon.Alice is a very successful writer who has had two novels published and isn't enjoying all the things she's expected to do by her publishers. Clearly inspired by Rooney herself (hard to say exactly how autobiographical Alice is), this was also interesting - especially having read Yellow Face recently, where those writers only want to become successful and give no thought to the negative side. Alice's views made me rather dislike her which only made the novel more interesting, reinforcing the notion that too much success when you're young is not a good thing....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Dec 12, 2023","Dec 16, 2023","Dec 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56646958-beautiful-world-where-are-you
