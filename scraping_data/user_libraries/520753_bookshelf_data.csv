Here I go. The Library Book was, I will admit, a book club book. I’m not a book club peIt’s been awhile since I’ve wrote a  so I’m a bit rusty. Here I go. The Library Book was, I will admit, a book club book. I’m not a book club person, I tend to rant and throw around references and gesticulate to hell so most book club patrons are kind of horrified by me. Thankfully I DID NOT attend the discussion and decided to keep this to myself. Background (not really to do with the book, so you purist  readers may not like this): My elementary school was built in 1891. When I was there in the 1970s there was no gym (we used a classroom) the big hall on the first floor was transformed into the cold lunch station (big table/chair combos set up) and the big hall on the second floor was our library. It was made up of about 8 stacks of books on a couple of area rugs and a few round tables. On each side were classrooms in full session. I would plant myself on one of said area rugs and just forget about everything. Often I would be ushered back to class and would return with my head full of wonders. Would Nancy find the Spider Sapphire on her trip to Africa? Will the Ingalls children have to quit school because of the grasshopper invasion? Will Pa survive the blizzard? Will Mary and Dickon be able to help Colin?So, you can see my dilemma… not enough time to fit all this in. But then we would have the McGruff read-a-thons. This was my all out excuse to immerse myself in as many books as I could find since my parents and all their friends were donating 10 cents per book I read to stopping neighborhood crime! Who would contest that?The public library in Manchester, NH was built in 1850s. Now, I’m not a fan of Manchester AT ALL but they did have an impressive library. I remember when I could get my first library card… we had to be able to write our names… I remember walking those looming stacks, finding the most comfortable chair, reading by the big window in the hallway. It was a haul for my parents to bring me down there (not being readers they couldn’t understand my fascination) so I didn’t get to make many memories there until I visited it again with my daughter when she was about 2. I would read to her in that same hallway, We would marvel at the punch card machine and giggle over the posters in the children’s room. Alas, she is not a reader now and when I try to share these memories she rolls her eyes. Shame.Okay.. now the book.“Sometimes it’s harder to notice a place you think you know well; your eyes glide over it, seeing it but not seeing it at all. It’s almost as if familiarity gives you a kind of temporary blindness. I had to force myself to look harder and try to see beyond the concept of library that was so latent in my brain.”This books starts with the LA Central Library Fire of 1986. Remember that? Nope.. neither did I.. it might be because it was the same week as Chernobyl so it didn’t make national news right off. This fire burned for 7 hours and destroyed or damaged over one million books. It lost manuscripts, music, maps, microfiche (oh my). Hundreds of volunteers worked around the clock for the next 3 days.“They formed a human chain, passing the books hand over hand from one person to the next, through the smoky building and out the door. It was as if, in this urgent moment, the people of Los Angeles formed a living library. The created, for that short time, a system to protect and pass along shared knowledge, to save what we know for each other, which is what libraries do every day.” Holy crud. Imagine that site. It makes my eyes water. Book lovers are my peeps. This would send me over the edge.So, the book centers on the investigation of the fire but also delves into the burning of libraries over the course of history (did you know that Library of Alexandria actually burned 3 times? So it was built up again and then lost and again… Christ) the history of the Central Library itself and also what is happening to modern libraries today. I was fascinated by the discussions with the librarians, security guards, help line workers (people actually call the library to find out google-able stuff) library packers, the trends of a library.. “The people in shipping know all the trends. They can tell when a book has been recommended by Oprah, because they will pack dozens of copies that have been requested all over the city. The know that the day after any holiday, the load will be heavy: Apparently, everyone in Los Angeles gets on the computer right after Thanksgiving dinner and makes requests for diet books.”It makes me want to go to library school. I have found a renewed love for my librarian friends. I dreamed about the smell of books, the smell of libraries, the smell of burning paper. “In Senegal, the polite expression for saying someone died is to say his or her library has burned… Our minds and should contain volumes inscribed by our experience and emotions; each individuals consciousness is a collection of memories we’ve cataloged and store inside us, a private library of a life lived.”Isn’t that beautiful? This book is a must read for bibliophile. For anyone on this site. FOR THE LOVE OF HUMANITY. (okay, I’m reaching.. I know..)“A library is a good place to soften solitude; a place where you feel part of a conversation that has gone on for hundreds and hundreds of years even when you’re all alone. The library is a whispering post. You don’t need to take a book off ta shelf to now there is a voice inside that is waiting to speak to you, and behind that was someone who truly believed that if he or she spoke, someone would listen.”Word. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 18, 2019","Nov 08, 2019","Oct 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39507318-the-library-book

The Holocaust.” As I approach the inconceivable age of fifty.. (god, written out it looks frightening, but numerically, 50, it looks damn impossible).. I find myself once again becoming that self-absorbed teenager. I guess I never really grew out of it. The neuroses are still there.. the fears and failures are still there.. damn, it’s downright depressing. For a while, I distracted myself with marriage and children and become too exhausted to think about myself but somewhere around 40 this whole ‘mindfulness’ catch –all happened and we were told to experience the present.. like that would be better..  Studies have shown that rumination and worry contribute to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, and that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in the reduction of both rumination and worry.Really? I don’t want to knock it, but yeah.. not my thing. I had my own brand of self preservation which has now been clichéd to hell and back and maybe I unconsciously saw it somewhere but I thought.. make memories…. That’s what matters. And, it works.. It helps stave off the feeling of failing at being an adult or the fact that what you said and did at 15, 18, 22… those were rantings of the inspired, oblivious, hopeful version of you and that has been beaten down and now resides just behind your epiglottis and you tamper it down with prescribed GERD medications. How many pills do you take a day to function? Tell me to shut the fuck up already. First world issues. This book is most definitely a first world issue book. A group of kids who bond in summer camp and how their lives play out…. Lots of self-absorption, talking and talking and then more talking. The person who had this book prior to me wrote on the  slip that’s taped to the first page ‘After 75 pages I gave up.. too boring!’ I can see that.. it’s like those television shows that get canceled because they are ‘too real’.. meaning that they just portray life….ups, downs, futility, nostalgia, death.“Then it wouldn't be long before they all found themselves shocked and sad to be fully grown into their thicker, finalized adult selves with almost no chance for reinvention.” I’m scared to say I related to the main character because she was a full on self-absorbed, rooted in the mind of her 15 year old self. I don’t want to be like that anymore. I want to grow up. You can slap me anytime. There are too many real world horrors going on right now to care.. I’m not sure if this is escapism or self-pity… I’ll settle on both. “...You want to know whether the problems that you teenagers feel—will they follow you over the rest of your lives? Will your hearts always be aching? Is that what you are asking me?”Goodman shifted in discomfort. “Something like that,” he said.“Yes,” said the counselor in a suddenly plangent voice. “Always they will be aching. I wish I could tell you something else, but I wouldn’t be telling the truth. My wise and gentle friends, this is the way it will be from now on.”No one could say anything. “We are so, so fucked,” ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,Jul 2018,"Jul 11, 2018","Mar 22, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15815333-the-interestings

Amazing that the poop emoticon is so... what it is. (I haven't had an occasion to use this one... I guess it could be construed as good and bad). Anyway, emotions... I tend to squash them deep down and play happy, squinty eye smile and then when I'm watching something like say...murder porn… I start to sweat and my eyes well up (but no smile) and I begin to tremble because I know that single mom walking home is gonna die and her kid is going to be messed up big time and then I breakdown and cry for like 3 days.“Throughout my life I have been criticized for a perceived lack of emotion, as if this were some absolute fault…. I am perfectly happy to detect, recognize, and analyze emotions. This is a useful skill and I would like to be better at it. Occasionally an emotion can be enjoyed—the gratitude I felt for my sister, who visited me even during the bad times, the primitive feeling of well-being after a glass of wine—but we need to be vigilant that emotions do not cripple us.”Meet Don. I’m pretty sure that Don would drive me absolutely batshit crazy because of my repressed emotions and I would turn every analytical thing he does into some sort of injustice against me. He doesn’t care, he is bored, he doesn’t get it, he thinks I’m dumb. He doesn’t love me. Frowny red face.Emotions are tricky. We’ve never had a great relationship. I think that by reading this book, I am able to understand a bit more about logic and pragmatism. Occum’s Razor. This was a quick read… I’ll use the word ‘quirky’ because it’s fun to say. Like ‘qwerty’ but with more kick. I don’t believe that Don would like me.

I've been told to read Meg Abbot for awhile and maybe I shouldn't have chosen this one as my first. I'm all like what is this? So.. I'm thinking 'Fever'... okay, like biochemical apocalyptic.... I mean there is that lake.. with it's slime... No. They're just normal 16 yr old girls who really really really like to wear tights (as we are told many many many times) and their normal lust driven thoughts. Ok, I can deal.. I've read Sarah Dessen.. this steps it up a notch.

VACCINES... jesus christ on a crumb. I'm so weary of the vaccine debate. So, eye roll. Then, no HPV lurking parasite. Check. Now we've got a group of girls twitching and snapping and screaming and vomiting and tweaking and more and more each day... I'm thinking 'Where's Winona? Where's Goody Glover?' At this time, I am so confused... sighOkay, so no trials of the blaming sort, but wait... what's this? Jealousy! Carnality! Fury! Retribution! And... spells. The Craft? Hot girls in short black skirts and no acne and perfect hair seeking out the beautiful innocents? ehhhhh......... I'm lost. I'm tired. I've only read 4 books this year. I feel like I wasted my precious netflix bingeing time on this. I want to cry because I miss reading. I miss the excitement of losing myself in a saga of epic proportions...

Not like pregnant someone-ate-my-christmas-cookie or that-stupid-hallmark-commercial cry..no, not exactly like that.  More like watching a bunch of teenagers get all excited singing a hymn mash up at the high school fall choir concert, or watching an episode of Black Mirror where a wife mail orders a textured semi-synthetic-organic compound that is malleable on command husband, or when your boyfriend decides that a puzzle solving section of Fall Out is better than messaging you. That sort of cry.. the heaving, (not in the case of the BF, that was put there to make him feel bad.. and he will), pulsing, visine seeking, leave you aching kind of cry. Maybe it’s the cry of growing old. I feel old. “And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person's life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. memories, perhaps.”Ove, the man called Ove, is old. Well, he’s only like 59 but he feels a lot older. He tries to live in black and white in a world that is gray and ends up becoming a ‘veritable explosion of color. A riot of yellow and red and blue and green and orange and purple.'  I think he hates it. I get why.When I started the book I was told to ‘hang in there’, that I would ‘come to love it’.. but I loved it right from the beginning because Ove, bless his gray soul, kicks ass. Pragmatic. I used to think that word meant stodgy, lacking emotion, detached. Sound it out praaagmaaatic. Praaaag sounds like something a bridge troll would belch while waiting for you to answer it’s riddle. Ugh. Onomatopoeia gets me every time. Ove taught me to see pragmatism differently.. it truly is practical. No fuss, no frills… git ‘er done. There’s something to be said about those type of men.. “Men like Ove and Rune were from a generation in which one was what one did, not what one talked about.” It sounds---- nice. Sourpuss, sweetheart, tomato, tomahto. I probably would get irritated down the road. Because I suck… I can’t handle simple. I like broken, and although Ove seems broken… and okay, I will admit it, feels broken… he’s not. He’s just not built for this world. “Now you listen to me,"" says Ove calmly while he carefully closes the door. ""You've given birth to two children and quite soon will be squeezing out a third. You've come here from a land far away and most likely you fled war and persecution and all sorts of other nonsense. You've learned a new language and got yourself an education and you're holding together a family of obvious incompetents. And I'll be damned if I've seen you afraid of a single bloody thing in this world before now....I'm not asking for brain surgery. I'm asking you to drive a car. It's got an accelerator, a brake and a clutch. Some of the greatest twits in world history have sorted out how it works. And you will as well."" And then he utters seven words, which Parvaneh will always remember as the loveliest compliment he'll ever give her. ""Because you are not a complete twit.”Oh, that’s so Ove.So, yes.. I cried. A lot. And I thought it would be a The Elegance of the Hedgehogcry but no.. it was worse. I know… right?The words are so gracefully arrranged that it hurts. It really does… “Loving someone is like moving into a house,"" Sonja used to say. ""At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren't actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it's cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.”Or…“She laughed and laughed and laughed until the vowels were rolling across the walls and floors, as if they meant to do away with the laws of time and space.”Breaks. My. Heart.So, if you want to read about a foul speaking, Saab loving, white shirt fighting, heart too big, grumpus. Ove is your man. He is highly recommended by his Cat Annoyance. And Me. “The very sort of smile that makes decent folk want to slap Buddhist monks in the face,”So Ove...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jul 29, 2016","Nov 05, 2016","Jul 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove

I’ve heard about the stigma surrounding it, the ‘found’ diary, the banning, and the horror of a girl getting caught up in drugs. I also heard how profound an effect it had on society at the time of its release. It was 25 cents at the library so what the hell. First of all, I really thought that people thought it was written by some random teen, found and published to warn us all of the danger of drugs and a Godless existence. Maybe if I had read this when I was ten, when I picked up VC Andrews for the first time it would have scared the shit out of me but as a 45 year old mom, I find it cheesy, irresponsible, horribly written, and god is she annoying. Yes, I am a cynic. Sarcasm is like a third limb. I’m biased. I’ve read YA books that are superior in so many ways. I know I need to consider the era that it was written, I can totally see my mom handing this off to me as a woebegone tale (along with the anatomy book that was silently left on my bed). It doesn’t help. I still think this is trash. Reefer Madness, some after school special starring Scott Baio and Melissa Sue Anderson, Courtney Love… We’ve seen it all before… I just feel that this is a poor example. The journal entry format is annoying… she doesn’t write like she’s a 15 year old…she is so wholesome in the beginning, ‘oh, I need to lose weight’, ‘oh, no one will ever like me’, boys are perfectly respectable, on and on and on… The drug parts were a little interesting… they didn’t SAY NO TO DRUGS you, they let you see that you can enjoy it and it can be addicting and it always stays with you. And people will ‘intercourse’ with just about anyone. Anyone who has done drugs, or knows drug addicts knows this. The writing here is so generic, textbook, PLAIN. I can see a Mormon therapist sitting down in her cat eye glasses saying ‘this will show them.. they will all go to HELL’. Yeah, not my cup of tea. If anything, I thought Alice’s time in San Francisco and Berkley were pretty damn cool. Oregon, not so much, but you can’t deny the street kid/drug issues of Oregon.

I DID IT. I AIN’T NO QUITTER!!! Sorry, I had to get that out. This is the 2nd book that I’ve read this year. TWO, DOS, NUMÉRO DEUX. 1/3 YASSSSSSS!!!! I DID IT. I AIN’T NO QUITTER!!! Sorry, I had to get that out. This is the 2nd book that I’ve read this year. TWO, DOS, NUMÉRO DEUX. 1/3 of the year down and TWEE. This is reprehensible. I am a sea anemone but not as cute. I am shamed.BUT I DID IT! I finished what amounts to ¾ of a George RR Martin book with a lot less characters! Yay on me! This was one book that I was indecisive on. Should I read it? I mean it won a Nobel prize, but then again, hype. My friends are talking it up, but I hated The Secret History. I don’t know… nail biting really (a testament to my awesome social life). Then, there it was, on the $1 table at the local library sale. This whopping hardcover in the age of kindles. Ok. Fate has spoken. Then it sat in my bag for months. I wouldn’t take it out, I would carry it but never start it. Almost my albatross… not that I was reading anything else, but basically, not that I was reading. (frowny face)I was skeptical, I still felt the agony of TSH… the trauma and dashed hopes but I plundered on… and it took a good 40 pages for me to say.. ‘oh, this is kinda neat’. Neat meaning that someone would actually choose to (view spoiler)[bomb the Metropolitan Museum of Art (hide spoiler)]. Who does that? Why didn’t they go into that? My god! Now I had to read on. Ok, I liked Theo. I know he was a whiny asshat (with reason)Anthony . I get that. I can see the privilege being a sore spot. I can see someone slapping the back of his head with a ‘get over it, kid’ but I can see the other side. The trauma, the agoraphobia, the tinnitus, the flashbacks that you don’t really hear about but can obviously witness. This is what I liked about Tartt’s writing this time. She made you look for it. Each character is so perfectly molded and so layered that you can re-read passages and psycho-analyze it and it turns out different each time. At least for me. I love Boris. I really do. I found myself reading his dialogue in choppy Russian accents (which I would NEVER do aloud) and loving him even more. He is so.. I guess Theo called him fearless… he will throw himself into any situation and not care of the outcome. It is what it is. That, my friends, is a talent. I can personally say that I map out everything that I do in fear of retribution, perception, judgment, blah blah blah. What it must be like to be fearless. I imagine your life is not very long.“Well—I have to say I personally have never drawn such a sharp line between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ as you. For me: that line is often false. The two are never disconnected. One can’t exist without the other. As long as I am acting out of love, I feel I am doing best I know how. But you—wrapped up in judgment, always regretting the past, cursing yourself, blaming yourself, asking ‘what if,’ ‘what if.’ ‘Life is cruel.’ ‘I wish I had died instead of.’ Well—think about this. What if all your actions and choices, good or bad, make no difference to God? What if the pattern is pre-set? No no—hang on—this is a question worth struggling with. What if our badness and mistakes are the very thing that set our fate and bring us round to good? What if, for some of us, we can’t get there any other way?”Here is where we get into what Theo is saying in the last 20 pages ( Sarah!! Peeking!!!). That old knowledge that we don’t want to acknowledge. Life sucks. It really does. It’s not fair, we learn this fairly early and then we swallow it and we find shiny things to occupy ourselves so we don’t have to think about the shit we’re going through. Ooh, I’m an orphan, can I please get an American Girl doll? It’s about surviving and if we have to survive something, then it mostly like sucks. Pippa is beautiful. I think that the relationship between Theo and Pippa is so tragic. Screw Catherine and Heathcliff. They have NO IDEA. Imagine surviving such a trauma.. imagine being linked by that and all that it represents. I see how Theo feels Pippa is his salvation, his one true. I see how Pippa can’t let herself do that because of the instability that all that entails. I love that Theo can’t see that until much later, at least he had that light to hold on to. I love that she’s not like Kitsey… although I think I get where Kitsey is coming from. I’m not saying there isn’t hardships with privilege. (minor eye rolling)Hobie. Oh, Hobie. Everyone should have a Hobie. He is such an amazing character, his charm, his bluster, his naiveté, his grounding. I’m Team Hobie. “His reassuring hand on my shoulder, a strong, comforting pressure, like an anchor letting me know that everything was okay. I hadn’t felt a touch like that since my mother died—friendly, steadying in the midst of confusing events—and, like a stray dog hungry for affection, I felt some profound shift in allegiance, blood-deep, a sudden, humiliating, eyewatering conviction of this place is good, this person is safe, I can trust him, nobody will hurt me here.”So, I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m NOT going to use the ‘Winners never Quit… ‘ line but if you gave up on this, you might want to try again. The writing is elegant, the characters are stunning and the tale will stick with you. My daughter is in NYC this weekend and one of the plan events was a tour called ‘Strange and beautiful things’ and I thought how awesome is that? They were going to tour Chelsea and a folk museum, and go to the Strand… it sounded so lovely. Only 3 people signed up for it so it was canceled. Life sucks. “That life - whatever else it is - is short. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn’t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open. And in the midst of our dying, as we rise from the organic and sink back ignominiously into the organic, it is a glory and a privilege to love what Death doesn’t touch.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Nov 29, 2015","Apr 08, 2016","Nov 29, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

He spoke it out loud and used it in a sentence.” Oh, and yes... I have been there. I remember the loins calling out and the secret stalking and the wow. Especially the wow.

No, worse than harsh, that was brutal. I am wretched, shattered, ausgespielt even. Have to give credit to the Germans for such an onomatopoeic word for how this feels. Yay, Germans.It’s 4:30 am, I’m on my 5th cup of coffee and trying to counteract the caffeine shakes with graham crackers, my eyes are bleary, words blurring, my jaw is clenched, throat sore and there’s a hollow space above my rib cage, I think that’s my soul. Wow. I did not think that this was going to be like this. I thought what a sort of lovely fairy tale; my fellow goodreaders have recommended it, why not. But this, this was like a story your mom might tell you as you curl into her lap, feeling all safe and sound wrapped in a Grimm Brother’s morality lesson, then drenched in a Thomas Hardy tragedy. Now that I’ve set the mood, let’s talk. “The earth’s lungs, coated in green ooze and thaw, breathed out blossom-scent and sour rot and fungus-must, wet and warm and aware, where before the air had been cold and blind, remote as the moon.”Exactly. Life can be cold and blind. We all have our grievances, our wrongs, some are trivial, some truly heinous, but the emotion is there nonetheless (is that too many commas in one sentence? Whatever. Carry on.) I am not going to tell you the plot, but I’m going to relate my feelings about the events and do with it what you will, this is MY space. I totally get the feeling of wanting to escape. The pain is too much, the work is too hard, the results are too little. I cannot blame Liga for wanting to create her own heart’s desire, her version of heaven and wanting to stay in that zone and raise her daughters free from all the harm that befell her. Yes, I say, BRING ON THE SHEEP FARM FROM BABE (without all the heavy like farm work, of course). Liga was totally screwed. Good for her. Let the boring safe life prevail. Score one for Team Liga. And yet…. It can’t last. Right? The pumpkin returns, the apple is eaten, Heathcliff is actually an asshole. ‘There are no happy endings. Endings are the saddest part, So just give me a happy middle And a very happy start.’ –Sorry Shel, we aren’t even worthy of that. Yes, we have happy times but they are almost always dwarfed by misfortune. This book will give you so many great starts that will just devastate you. And this is why I love it. It’s real. It’s got magical worlds, and sorcery and true love and then it just tears you a new one.“Now you are in the true world, and a great deal more is required of you. Here you must befriend real wolves, and lure real birds down from the sky. Here you must endure real people around you, and we are not uniformly kind; we are damaged and impulsive, each in our own way. It is harder. It is not safe. But it is what you were born to.”Suck that. You know what really gets me? The give and take. It’s never equal is it? I might be speaking from not such a great place and who knows, next week I might be bitch slapping myself for writing this, but yeah, I feel like I’ve been dealt a crappy hand. I have wonderful children, I have daily laughs, not always the belly type, but still good moments, but it’s a constant struggle and why is that? Why can’t we sometimes just get a break, you know? Liga, I get it. I wish to be your conduit. I wish to take all the injustices dealt to you and let you be truly happy. Don’t be happy for someone else, there’s a time and a place for that, I know.. but just for you. The last line of the book kills me because it just seems so unfair:  “They all looked to Liga, seated by the window with her face to the light, to the faint midsummer air, which moved the tendrils of hair at her temples. She turned and slightly smiled at them all, and titled her head most graciously, accepting the witch’s, and the woolman’s compliments, and her daughters’ pleasure in them, as no more than she deserved.”Ugh.

She had to commit her oldest daughter to the Hospital for the Negro Insane and at the age of 31 died of ‘uremic poisoning’  “The official cause of Henrietta’s death was terminal uremia: blood poisoning from the buildup of toxins normally flushed out of the body in urine. The tumors had completely blocked her urethra, leaving her doctors unable to pass a catheter into her bladder to empty it. Tumors the size of baseballs had nearly replaced her kidneys, bladder, ovaries, and uterus. And her other organs were so covered in small white tumors it looked as if someone had filled her with pearls.” You know… ordinary. Her story was one of millions of stories that still continue today, overworked, under appreciated, dedicated beings who got the wrong lot in life. We don’t really hear about these stories unless we seek them out. And it was no different for Henrietta, except that her cells, the HeLa cells, became famous for helping cure polio, or test the effects of radiation during cancer research, or AIDS, or gene mapping. Henrietta is buried in an unmarked grave alongside the tobacco farm that she worked on in Clover Virginia.What I found most interesting about this account of Henrietta and her family’s life is how arcane some of the treatments were, granted this is 1951, but:“The morning of Henrietta’s first treatment, a taxi driver picked up a doctor’s bag filled with thin glass tubes of radium from the clinic across town. The tubes were tucked into individual slots inside small canvas pouches (plaques) hand-sewn by a local Baltimore woman. .. With Henrietta unconscious on the operating table in the center of the room, her feet in stirrups, the surgeon on duty, Dr. Lawrence Wharton Jr., sat on a stool between her legs. He peered inside Henrietta, dilated her cervix and prepared to treat her tumor. But first—though no one had told Henrietta that TeLinde was collecting samples or asked if she wanted to be a donor---Wharton picked up a sharp knife and shaved two dime0sized pieces of tissue from Henrietta’s cervix: one from her tumor and one from the healthy cervical tissue nearby. The he placed the samples in a glass dish. Wharton slipped a tube filled with radium inside Henrietta’s cervix, and sewed it in place. He sewed a plaque filled with radium to the outer surface of her cervix and packed another plaque against it. He slid several rolls of gauze inside her vagina to help keep the radium in place, then threaded a catheter into her bladder so she could urinate without disturbing the treatment. “Holy hell. I won’t complain at my next pap smear. Then learning of some of the experiments done on patients without their consent/knowledge. “The Tuskegee syphilis experiment being one of them “was an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service to study the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama. They were told that they were receiving free health care from the U.S. government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 during the Great Depression, in collaboration with the Tuskegee Institute, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 399 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 201 did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. None of the men infected was ever told he had the disease, nor was any treated for it with penicillin after this antibiotic became proven for treatment. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a local term for various illnesses that include syphilis, anemia, and fatigue.”I don’t even want to get into Nuremberg or studies done on patients in asylums… my god. Give me those rose colored glasses, pronto. Yes, it is wrong of me to want to be oblivious, I, unfortunately, am AWARE of that. But this book throws a lot at you: Poverty, consent, experiments, trials, clinical reasoning, greed, exploitation, mass media hysteria, mad scientists, inequality, and how downright unfair life can be. I am glad that Rebecca Skloot wrote this book and I am glad that she got to know the Lacks’ family, treating them like real people, not petri dishes. The consent issue is one that I can’t reason with. I’m torn. I get it and I don’t. But, what I didn’t like was the cockiness of some of the doctors, granted this might be taken out of context, well… if it can be:“The dean of Stanford University School of Medicine told a reporter that as long as researchers disclosed their financial interests, patients shouldn’t object to the use of their tissues. “If you did, “ he said, “I guess you could sit there with your ruptured appendix and negotiate.”I know it is meant to be horrifying, another media hysteria thing, but Christ.

I do not need to read any other book this year. I am satiated. You know how I have that groupie mentality? Yeah, well… Ilovejohnsteinbecksomuchit’skillingme. “It happened to so many of my friends. The lecture ends, “Slow down. You’re not as young as you once were.” And I had seen so many begin to pack their lives in cotton wool, smother their impulses, hood their passions, and gradually retire from their manhood into a kind of spiritual and physical semi invalidism…. And I have searched myself for this possibility with a kind of horror. For I have always lived violently, drunk hugely, eaten too much or not at all, slept around the clock or missed two nights of sleeping, worked too hard and too long in glory, or slobbed for a time in utter laziness. I’ve lifted pulled, chopped, climbed, made love with joy and taken my hangovers as a consequence, not as a punishment. I did not want to surrender fierceness for a small gain in yardage.”They should put that on a t-shirt. Girls would flock. Seriously, this guy is hot. What’s the opposite of cougar because that’s what I am. Or maybe I should just move to necrophilia since we’re going on 40 years since he met the daisies. Still, all through this book I was OMG THIS IS THE MAN OF MY DREAMS. He names his truck Rocinante! And Charley? My god… don’t even. I’ve never really had the itch to travel across America. I’m a northeaster, I can’t handle people who don’t talk as fast as me, don’t walk as fast as me, eat clam chowder that’s red, use the word ‘pop’, don’t have basements, have tornado warnings, you know… those people. I’ve tiptoed out of my comfort zone a few times but usually rush back to the elitist, bitter, hmphing bosom of my kind. John has given me a bit of a rash. The first few parts of the book center on country that I am familiar with… he drives from Long Island to the tip of Maine and back down across New Hampshire and Vermont. He stops at roadside diners, encounters sad souls and men of few words. This is 1960, when plastic covered everything was in and politics was best left to the city folk. He absorbs so much.  “ And the Aurora Borealis was out. I’ve seen it only a few times in my life. It hung and moved with majesty in folds like an infinite traveler upstage in an infinite theater. In color sof rose and lavender and purple it moved and pulsed against the night, and the frost sharpened stars shone through it. What a thing to see at a time when I need it so badly!"" And to the sad soul who served him his plastic meal that night he says “ I wondered for a moment whether I should grab that waitress and kick her behind out to look at it, but I didn’t dare. She could make eternity and infinity melt and run out through your fingers.” Yes, I realize that’s an insult, but how freakin’ beautiful.  I want to breathe that air, to feel that rising, so glorious that words are not enough (except with him, they can be and that’s amazing). I want to sit by a fire with canucks passing as seasonal potato pickers; I want to sit in the Vermont church with him listening to the hellfire promising preacher damn us. “Having proved that we, or perhaps only I, were no damn good, he painted with cool certainty what was likely to happen to us if we didn’t make some basic reorganizations for which he didn’t hold out much hope…. I began to feel good all over. For some years now God has been a pal to us, practicing togetherness, and that causes the same emptiness a father does playing softball with his son. But this Vermont God cared enough about me to go to a lot of trouble kicking the hell out of me.”My OTP. My BFF, the fly to my soup, the lox to my bagel, my everything. See, John is.. JOHN in this book, he says he’s not.. he says he doesn’t want anyone to recognize him, that he wants to know America, to understand but he comes across so vividly, full Technicolor, that I found myself responding to him. I felt the manic depressive moments like the hills and valley of a rollercoaster. He bares himself to strangers, tries to pry the life out of them. He studies voraciously—and this isn’t a newbie rambler---he’s been EVERYWHERE and you still feel lost with him on the shores of lakes in the back woods of Indiana.  “My wants are simple. I have no desire to latch onto a monster symbol of fate and prove my manhood in titanic piscine war. But sometimes I do like a couple of cooperative fish of frying size.” I would fish with you my friend. Even in Indiana. If I were to step out of my comfort zone and travel this America, I know that I wouldn’t see the same way that John sees. I know that this is a different America from 1960 Steinbeck as much as it is to 1930 Steinbeck. Perhaps even more so… we are consumed with posthaste and irritated with impermanent. I would want to take the unknown but know that I would fall prey to the interstates and their humdrum. I am not a patient woman (I am a northeaster). I wonder how many have taken the travels with Charley route and what they discovered. There are so many more scenes that I want to share with you. I want to follow you around and read this out loud with boisterous glee. I cannot however, dinner is due and laundry is waiting. Please, PLEASE read this book. Scratch the itch.

I got goosebumps when I read it. To be forgotten… erased from memory. But, I don’t think that is what this book is about. (I just liked that quote). I think this book is about love and choices and damned be all who judges. This is not a book I would have read on my own. I will start with that. But, I am glad that I did. I’m not sure I was changed by it, but the quick time that I spent in Janus with Tom and Isabel and Lucy.. well, it was precious. I’ve always wanted to live in a lighthouse. Who doesn’t? I pity the landlocked. The sound of the ocean, the breaks in the water, the tidal pools… I miss it. You see, I have become one of the landlocked. Yes, I have a large lake, but it’s not the same. Not by far. This is the lighthouse I want to live in.[image] I have since I was eight years old on vacation with my family. I love the pulley system, I love the little house, it’s close to land, but it’s not. I spent a lot of my teens here, I still visit at least yearly and I still want to live there.In 1874 President Rutherford B. Hayes appropriated the sum of $15,000 to build a lighthouse on this “Nub” of land. On July 1, 1879 construction was completed on what, at the time, was known as the Knubble Lighthouse with a 4th order light began to protect our men and women on the sea. The men and women serving in the Lighthouse Service were the first guardians who provided great care for the light and its surrounding buildings… Eventually this service became short of resources and funding to care for our majestic beacons.Because of this in part, as well as the growing development of technology, the Lighthouses became automated. Nubble Light was automated in July, 1987The lighthouse in this book is nothing like Nubble Light. [image] It’s its own little world and just as beautiful and just as important a character as anyone else. This is where Tom Sherbourne feels the safest. He’s been through WWI and likes the rules, the continuity, the sameness. He is a thoughtful man, one that holds the horrors of what he’s seen close to him. He meets Isabel who is light, quick to laugh, fierce in her love. I truly enjoyed these characters. The life on the lighthouse seems to suit them and soon they become pregnant. Good people, who have much to offer, much love to share… and what happens? Life is a bitch. It is cruel and cold and unfair. Dammit. But, what do they do? They persevere. They suffer through 3 miscarriages until the ocean brings them a gift. A baby in a dinghy (oh and her dead dad). What would you do? 100 miles from land with little contact with the outside world, just having buried your third child? I don’t blame them… they are good people. “When it comes to their kids, parents are all just instinct and hope. And fear. Rules and laws fly straight out the window.”Yep. This is the one thing in this book that is familiar to me. This and that life is a bitch. I don’t fault them their happiness and if it wasn’t for that damn onus. That stupid (view spoiler)[rattle. (hide spoiler)] I knew it was their downfall… they would have been FINE.Well, except for the whole guilt feeling. That can get to some people and I truly wonder if I were in their place, would it bother me. Sad to say, I think not. Not after the life they were dealt.“Perhaps when it comes to it, no one is just the worst thing they ever did.”Word.  I don’t believe that these actions cause these people to be bad. I understand that it left a hole in someone else’s life and yeah, that makes me sad, but really… the aftermath seems much worse. Maybe I am going to hell. Maybe I am a rotten person.  “You only have to forgive once. To resent, you have to do it all day, every day.”If only it were that easy for me.This book is a tug of war of contradictions for me. I would do that and I would do that, but not that. I would feel guilt but I wouldn’t change. Lately, a lot of what I’ve read has led me to these self doubts. Judging my own character against these fictional ones. Is this a book nerd’s midlife crisis?  I did cry. I cried for Tom, for Isabel, for Lucy, for Hannah. I can’t say what is right and what is wrong, only what would make the most joy or cause the most grief. It’s a heavy scale. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Sep 20, 2014","Oct 04, 2014","Aug 15, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13158800-the-light-between-oceans

For the better part of my life I feel that I’ve leaned towards the glass half full-look at the bright side-I’d like to teach the world to sing-make lemonade-happy happy joy joy side of things.Reading this book made me feel doomed. I snorted and harrumphed and tsk’d a lot at her observations and her truths and it made me Unhappy. I don’t much care for books that do that. Okay, let’s back up. I wasn’t expecting a life changer here. I thought it would be anecdotal, humorous, like maybe Amy Sedaris-ish or at least kitschy Erma Bombeck-y… I thought I might find a like-minded soul.I did not. I will take the blame for this. High expectations and crap. I should know better. Plus, I really don’t do well with the self-helpy kind of books. They tend to read like ‘all or nothing’ and ‘I am the expert’. This book didn’t do that but it did feel a little preachy.However… and here is where I am not liking myself and feeling sort of hypocritical and Debbie downerish….I’m not sure that she quite… she doesn’t… It’s not… Ugh. Okay.1.	 She is kind of privileged. She lives in Manhattan with a sane, functioning, providing, husband and two gifted little girls and getting to ‘work’ from home (I use quotes because she gets to write and stuff all day and she loves that and I’m not downplaying people who achieve their work nirvana or anything, but I don’t think she thinks it’s work either)2.	She has this awesome support system and lots and lots of friends. She goes to parties. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a party. Certainly not as a grown up.3.	I kind of feel like she’s throwing it in my face.I know, I own this. She is just trying to get a little appreciation and warm fuzzies out of her day to day life (which is already pretty toasty). I am a major proponent in finding your happy place. Your gleemonex (if you are a Kids in the Hall fan). I just don’t like the way she tells it because she makes it feel like so much work. Become clutter free, don’t expect retribution, exercise more, sleep more, meet new friends, write a novel in a month, indulge yourself (modestly), lighten up, be serious about play, aim higher, stop nagging, don’t gossip, find a spiritual master. Wow. I have 18 marked pages of issues that I wanted to counteract. That’s not good. I shouldn’t be judging like that. But, scoring your virtues? And taking this cue from Benjamin Franklin? I don’t know. That seems sketchy to me. Pg. 18. “Was it supremely self-centered to spend so much effort on my own happiness?”Hell yes. I mean, I’m sure others benefited, but if you started talking about having a play date to clutter free my closet, I’m going to want to punch you in the face. Pg. 153 “I tried to remember not to judge people harshly, especially on the first or second encounter. Their actions might not reveal their enduring character but instead reflect some situation they find themselves in. Forbearance is a form of generosity.”Doesn’t that sound snotty? I’m not saying she’s wrong.. I guess I’m just pointing out that her little realizations made me annoyed. I don’t want to be THAT person. Pg. 215: ""It took me a long time to accept this perverse fact—many people don’t want to be happy or at least don’t want to seem happy (and if they act as if they’re not happy, they’re not going to feel happy).”Ugh. She makes me feel like one of those people and I started this book thinking I’d find kin! Now I’m a frowning, furrowed, huffy, lip biter who sees the bad instead of the good.Yes, it’s my bad. I said that already. Why does she have to make happiness sound so exhausting? I get it, we need to be more aware of our blessings or what have you. Gratitude journals are big right now, daily truths, calm blue oceans, yoga and colored skies and Meyers Briggs, and parachutes and all that. I came across a site that offered Positive Affirmations! (for a price) ‘Reminder: You can still grab The Positive Affirmations for Life program (The Positive Affirmation for Life program is a 4-hour audio program, spanning 7 important life series (see below). Each series contains three 12-minute tracks in MP3 format to play virtually anywhere. Plus you get an instructional guide and the complete audio transcripts in PDF format. You get immediate access to the entire product upon purchase.) With more than 4 hours of audio affirmations for 7 life situations that impact your happiness and success the most. You can buy your very own positive affirmation with a 30 day money back guarantee. See, I’m a cynic. I’m grumpy and I want to argue with all her observations. I want to keep butting in saying ‘but, what about’, ‘and if you aren’t able to…’, ‘really?’. Crud. I hate myself.Things I did learn from this book: 3 second hugs release oxytocin or dopamine or something that induces calmness (I wish I were a better hugger). Studies DO show that instant gratification is just that. Can you imagine a study where people went and put like coins in a pay phone for other people to find to make their day? Weird.

These are the gifts that Zoe gives Hannah and the belief in the intangible is what she gets in return. Ultimate Trust, even when you have to trust the impossible. That is the great theme in this book, the intangible. Zoe’s brother, Noah (“Comfort”): “Zoe’s eight-year old little brother, Noah, has some kind of Aspergery thing. He could read when he was two. He understands Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. He’s read all of Stephen Hawking’s books. He is obsessed with the cosmos and talks about it constantly without ever noticing if you’re listening to him. And yet he cannot process anything at all irrational or intangible. Emotions are elusive to him. Dreaming and imagination, foreign.To help him, and since he loves museums, Zoe created the Museum of Intangible things, for which she creates a new installation in her basement every month.September’s project was “Pride.” In the corner, Zoe created a puffed-out human chest with papier-mache and peach tempers paint. A marionette peacock walked back and forth over a gay pride rainbow, while a video montage streamed footage of a mother watching her son graduate from college, a swimmer winning a gold medal, and an actress receiving an Academy Award. She covered the walls with white paper and asked me to write about when I feel proud.""""Zoe explains that ‘Sloth-Laziness-Depression” will consist of Barbie and Ken in gray felt outfits installed in a shoebox also covered in gray felt. She found an old flowered couch with the foam bulging from the rips of the cushions and on top of it, she flopped her mannequin dressed in a Snuggie. An old TV/VCR will stream infomercials and Zoe will scatter potato chips and empty soda cans around the couch, which will also be sprinkled with cat hair.. For the interactive part of the exhibit, she filled the pockets of an old fishing vest with rocks and will ask Noah to try it on. Behind a screen in the corner of the basement, to distinguish between sloth and sadness-slash-despair, Zoe created a beating heart impaled by a kitchen knife.""""Won’t that scare him? I ask.""“Um. Duh. He doesn’t understand fear.”.This weed… it needs to be yanked. I need to fill this space with that sort of devotion, give and take. This book reminds me of that. Acceptance...that is intangible as well. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 15, 2014","Jun 25, 2014","Jun 15, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18079542-the-museum-of-intangible-things

I want to swim in their words and dance between their snarky sparring. Oh, how I wish.  This is so my kind of book. This is so my kind of thing. I have totally done this. I am this. I use my words (always use your words) because my social skills are so lacking. The written word is my vehicle. I may babble, I may be self-absorbed, I may tangent (I’m using that as a verb, just so you know) but this is the most real me that you will ever see. My confidence is like the Vegas Strip. It’s all ‘Look here!’ ‘No, look here!’ ‘Hey, buddy! Yo!’ when I write. Here is where I thrive. But… put me in a room with people and I shrivel. I stumble and I make really bad choices. I wish I could just email people or have my own reverse Speak and Spell, custom-made for my brand of communication. We’d have to let it loose to make up words and there would have to be a ‘no grammar bullying’ allowed. Example: I tried online dating. Yes. I admit that. And my description is rambling and filled with quotes and pop culture references and the book section is like a mile long and any of the takers that could actually get through that and not ‘hey baby’ me and mention something that relates to my essay then I will respond. This is rare. I did, however, get one taker and we had amazing spar sessions, like blow your mind kind of repertoire. Then we met, and I must have somehow related my dufus self because ‘the end’. There, that was a mighty big confession. I can do this in writing!! I can show you my scars and scrapes and I am okay because I have Lily:  “I don’t really know how to talk to boys. In person. Which is probably why I’ve become dependent on a notebook for creative expression of a potentially romantic nature.”So, what I’m trying to say is, I get Dash and I get Lily. I love the idea of a treasure hunt in The Strand. I love the Strand. I love the curmudgeony hipster works, I love that I sneeze a lot because of the dusty shelves, I love walking down the stairs into the basement and seeing all the colored spines of the children books.(That's where it was when I lived there... can't say for sure now..) I am so jealous.  “I was spending time in the Strand, that bastion of titillating erudition, not so much a bookstore as the collision of a hundred different bookstores with literary wreckage strewn over eighteen miles of shelves. All the clerks there saunter-slouch around distractedly in their skinny jeans and their thrift-store button downs, like older siblings who will never, ever be bothered to talk to you or care about you or even acknowledge your existence if their friends are around…which they always are.”Yes. Absolutely yes.This whole story is filled with quotables. I am super jealous. I wanted to be the one to write these words. I wanted to be the one to say:“I’ve always resented Hermione, because I wanted to be her so badly and she never seemed to appreciate as much as I thought she should that she got to be her. She got to live at Hogwarts and be friends with Harry and kiss Ron, which was supposed to happen to me.”I want to cry. These are my people. This is my world. So, why am I here? I’m pathetic. I can’t grow up. I mean, look: “At the end of the book, when Zooey calls Franny pretending to be their brother Buddy, trying to cheer her up, there’s a line where he talks about Franny going to the phone and becoming ‘younger with each step’ as she walked, because she’s making it to the other side. She’s going to be okay. At least that’s’ what I took it to mean. I want that. The getting younger with each step, because of anticipation, in hope and belief.”So, here’s where I want to rant and rave. I come from a generation so disillusioned, so snarly, so underwhelmed. So, why do we have such high expectations? That’s what gets us in the end, the being let down. The anti-anticipation. I hate that. Maybe it’s because we crave hope. We have to think that something better has to be out there just to get through the day. We’ve even made happiness science a thing. So sad really. “The world was too full of wastrels and waifs, sycophants and spies—all of whom put words to the wrong use, who made everything that was said or written suspect.”I feel like I’m a third wheel. The super super jealous third wheel. I felt it in Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist and I will go out and read Naomi and Ely's No Kiss List because I am one of those ingratiating Peter Pan types who can’t leave Neverland. “It’s that leap, that understanding, that leads to meaning. And a lot of the time in life, we’re still just sounding things out. We know the sentences and how to say them. We know the ideas and how to present them. We know the prayers and which words to say in what order. But that’s only spelling.”Seriously… Rachel, David… please let me in. Do I suggest that you read this? I think that I have a few requests.1. You can’t have lost all hope2. Put the cynicism aside, don’t worry, it will be right where you left it.3. Accept the words. How they are presented to you how they extract, paint, bleed, sound, whatever…because this is a gift. One last quote:“We are reading the story of our lives. As though we were in it. As though we had written it.”...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 14, 2014","Jun 15, 2014","Jun 14, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7741325-dash-lily-s-book-of-dares

Granted, in space terms that’s not so far, but it is a mere speck to me. Here is your chance to judge: I don’t read books that deal with or written in areas between Europe and Australia I know, it’s a vast area and there are AMAZING stories out there and I HAVE tried (Cutting for Stone, The Kite Runner, Dance Dance Dance) but on the whole.. I avoid the middle east/Africa/Japan area. Go ahead and judge because when I finally admitted that to myself and to my book clubbers, I totally judged me. Am I some sort of racist? What about this whole scene is it that keeps me away? I have run through it a hundred times. I could give you a hundred reasons, excuses and I’m still not redeemed. It’s my fault, my loss, my burden to carry. It just doesn’t interest me. And that shows me how truly self-centered I am. So, with that, I will tell you what I thought of this book. Continue to judge. I thought Amanda Lindhout was a bratty, self centered, braggy little girl. Granted, she wasn’t born privileged and didn’t do the whole early 20s backpacking the way that hipsters do, but she was still annoying to me. I don’t know how much of the responsibility lies with her co-writer, but reading this story did not give me a sense of whatever it is I should have had a sense of. So, I’m a bitch. I know this because really? Amanda Lindhout went through HELL. Like 9th circle type hell. So, why was I thinking that this was sort of her own fault? (Again, I am an ignorant bitch, I am not arguing with you so please refrain from posting some horrible comment)1.	 She is white.2.	She is female.3.	She went to Somalia.WTF? She mentions how many times she was warned not to go there. So many people told her that she was pretty much a beacon for kidnappers, that her head ALONE would be worth a million. She even talked about kidnappings that she had heard about, beheadings that made it on the news. Situations that we over here in privilege land only hear snippets about between Kardashian feuds. Why did she go? Was it really because she wanted to experience the suffering for herself or was it so that she could brag that she went to Somalia and took photos and saw the plight of the country? Because that is what was going through my cynical bitchy head. Did she not see Black Hawk Down? They don’t fuck around down there. I saw her journey there as a reason for profit and it was hard to snap out of that mindset. Then again… There are passages where she herself condemns her self indulgence so that made me warm up a bit to it. God, I seriously sound like the biggest bitch. I am sorry. I just can’t relate to this. A 25 year old white woman freely goes into Somalia? Then, I get even more cynical with the book. She wrote a book about it. She got famous because of this. If you google her name her very pretty face is EVERYWHERE. Again, argue with me that she is just trying to make the story public of how terrifying life in Somalia is and to bring the humane part out. I appreciate that. I do, and starting a foundation that helps educate Somalians is awesome. Until those schoolgirls are kidnapped and sold to prove some fundamentalist idea that women should not be educated. Maybe… maybe we shouldn’t interfere if we can’t make the promises that we can protect them?I really hate myself for writing this. I sound like a horrible person. I AM a horrible person. Of course the humane thing to do is help. We, privileged folk, we try to help all the time and yes, by buying Toms and applauding these courageous people who spend their lives doing this humanitarian work we feel that we are helping… and I don’t know of a solution and would never feign to but I think that sometimes by helping we are hurting these people even more. We are cocky and we are forcing our ways onto them and they are resentful and who wouldn’t blame them? It’s like what we did to Hawaii… what we try to do in Iran, Iraq. Our way is better… but is it?Ok, that rant was off topic. I cannot imagine the hell that Amanda Lindhout went through. Even after reading 400 pages of it. It still doesn’t feel real. I can’t imagine how she sleeps at night. Richard Phillips lives like 2 towns over and I can’t fathom how he can even function. This is some serious serious shit. And Amanda is right to feel for her torturers because what if, what if life had given them a different path. What if they didn’t have to watch their families be murdered or always fear mortar attacks. Would they not have had to resort to extortion? I am glad that she acknowledged this. I hope that she is well and I hope the same for Nigel and for their captors (some of them) and for Somalia, I wish it peace and I feel guilty for everything that I have. I truly do. But words don’t make a difference. Not in this case. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 12, 2014","May 31, 2014","Apr 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18039963-a-house-in-the-sky

Truly a shame… This has been out for 15 years… 15 years that I could have carried Kit and his story with me.  It almost eluded me once again, when I noticed the author, David Almond, I knew that name. A sudden surge, like a warm fuzzie or a premenopausal hot flash overcame me. Skellig. Yes. Now, I remember.David Almond has this incredible talent. His voice. He rambles, he doesn’t use paragraphs, his dialogues runs into each other, he’s got that British slang thing and he must say “Eh? Eh?” a hundred times which just reminds me of Eh? Eh!. Then I lose my train of thought and some random facebook picture of one of Eh’s dinners pop up and then I’m hungry and I have to focus focus focus.His voice. It’s gentle, it lulls you. “This is our world, he used to say. “Aye, there’s more than enough of darkness in it. But over everthing there’s all this joy, Kit. There’s all this lovely lovely light.” The story is of two boys, Kit and John, aged thirteen. Living in Stoneygate, built over an old mine that holds a power of the boys, the ghosts of children who perished down there, the fascination with death, the escape of grandfathers suffering from dementia or drunk abusive fathers… something draws them together, a story that they need to tell in order to heal. Or something like that. What I know is that Mr. Almond was able to lure me into a story of two pubescent boys living in a bleak town in England and hold me there, tightly, until he decided he was done with me. Cast me off into the tunnels below Stoneygate. And now I feel hollow and I’m meandering, trying to catch Silky’s eye.

They must be hotel rooms.Levithan is revisiting A, the character he introduced us to in Every Day. I suppose this is a prequel that needs to be read as a sequel so you understand A, you can see, be, the six different people that A has chosen you to glimpse.Again, such beauty. One day does not ever seem enough and to stay detached, to try to not disrupt, to always have to be thinking of the person you are squatting in and not yourself... I don't envy A. ""It's the secret smile you get from knowing that, somewhere, there is someone who is yours. Not in the sense that you own her, or control her. She is yours because you can say anything to her.""Too often we realize this too late.""The desire to be heard is as deepply seeded as the desire to be loved. So much of the technology we spend our time on is geared toward this. For some people, it doesn't matter who's on the other end.""I want to hug David Levithan. I have since I met A, Nick, Nora... and now I want to meet all of his creations. I may even go back and find which Baby Sitter's Club books he wrote. I'm a geek.. I'm nerd... I have no life.. but if not living means I can throw myself in a Levithan world, then I'm okay with that. I feel lighter after one of his reads. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 28, 2014","Mar 31, 2014","Mar 28, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16071620-six-earlier-days

Need. Loss. Despair.This is a love story. It’s a story of two young people falling in love. “Romeo and Juliet are just two rich kids who’ve always gotten every little thing they want. And now, they think they want each other.”“They’re in love..” Mr. Stessman said, clutching his heart.“They don’t even know each other,” she said.“It was love at first sight.”“It was ‘Oh my God, he’s so cute’ at first sight. If Shakespeare wanted you to believe they were in love, he wouldn’t tell you in almost the very first scene that Romeo was hung up on Rosaline… It’s Shakespeare making fun of love.” She said.“They why has it survived?”….”Tell us, why has Romeo and Julie survived four hundred years?”Park hated talking in class. Eleanor frowned at him, then looked away. He felt himself blush.“Because…” he said quietly, looking at his desk, “Because people want to remember what it’s like to be young? And in love?”See? Rainbow Rowell is making fun of us. We should all be storming her door with torches and yard rakes. It’s not like books haven’t done this to me before, but maybe just maybe I’m wiser now.. maybe I’ve gained some distance from that ‘When he touched Eleanor’s hand, he recognized her. He knew. Eleanor: Disintegrated. ….. If you’ve ever wondered what that feels like, it’s a lot like melting—but more violent.”Or maybe not.Because this isn’t  REAL. It doesn’t LAST. You can’t NEED a person like that forever. It FADES, it withers and dies and if it doesn’t outwardly die, it limps along begrudgingly muttering bits of snarkyness under its halitosis laden breath. And that is why I hate it so much, it stirred up all that stale oxytocin that is mixing with my gastric juices and flung it around right back into circulation... visceral and made me feel weak, made me cry. Made me wish for that.  But, it only happens in books. I have to keep reminding myself of that. The good never lasts. And it’s never the big dramatic orchestra laden climax that does it. It’s just life. And the memories are there and they sting and a glimmer of hope of having that again rises up until you put down the book and know that there really isn’t an Eleanor or a Park and it’s the end of Say Anything all over again when Lloyd and Diane are on the plane and they look at each and you know… you just  know  that they’re not going to last. Maybe you cry for that old self. Or maybe you let the bitterness eat at you.

I kind of feel bad giving it 3 stars but I kind of can't justify 4. I'm not a fan of first person narrative. I suppose it's because I'm really not sure who the character is talking to. Is it us? Are they just reminiscing and we are the intruders? I spent the first part of this book thinking ""Is Annie just hanging around her Soho apartment telling all these things to herself? What is the point? Then I started to doubt myself as a reader. How many books have I read that are like this and why hadn't I questioned this before? Is this how books are written? Why am I so focused on this? Whenever they come back to the present after some long retelling, it seems like it's only been like five minutes their time. Is this just zoning out? Do I do this?Yeah. Lots of confusion.Then I started to actually care about the characters, and boy, can Wally do character development. whoa. How long is this book anyway? So, yeah... I started to like them, Orion mostly, because he's the kind of guy that you want but when you get you sort of resent because he wants to be the protector and the teacher and who is he to think that you need to be taught? It's one of those stupid girl burdens... it looks good on paper but once we have it we treat it like shit. I also liked the back story, the 1950s/60s flashbacks. I wish we had more of Josephus Jones... because he does feel like the thread through all of this and his paintings seem to show a story that really needs telling. It's a shame that he wasn't more developed. So, I really don't have much more to say about this. It was good. I've got a Wally Lamb under my belt. I enjoyed the story even though I didn't know where it was going for the first three parts. Yep.Oh wait.. I thought of something else. Another reason for the detachment. I never had adult relationships with parents so this really is fiction for me. I always tend to remove myself from that because it is so foreign.

I’m sure that there was some Barbie accessory that I wanted, the Dream House most definiI’m trying to remember the first time my parents let me down. I’m sure that there was some Barbie accessory that I wanted, the Dream House most definitely. But, damn, I was spoiled!!! What a freaking brat… how could anyone stand me? Now, what about the times I let them down? The time I swallowed a penny and sat at the end of their bed staring at them until one of them woke up? The time I ‘lost’ my little sister? (She only walked to the store, like 4 blocks away, when she was 3) The time our dog Dusty had to go away because his ‘real’ parents missed him. Noope. None of those. I didn’t question their actions at all. They were my parents after all.Now you might get the impression that I’ve got the 1970s Cleaver edition of parents. Far freakin’ from it. We were blue collar, alcoholic dad working 3 jobs, chain smoking mom working 2, deep in debt like I wouldn’t be surprised if that nice man with the briefcase was actually someone wanting to take our house away. I, of course, being so self-consumed, did not see it. Ask me when I first realized when my parents were human and I’m there, in the moment, vivid Technicolor. It was like a tellanovella, complete with infidelity and the big ‘C’ and the absolute WORST trip to the county fair when my father told me he was moving out. Yep, bubble sufficiently burst. Yes, Kim, TMI. T.M.I. Get on with it. Tell us why we should read this damn book. Okay, but first, I have to kind of argue that this is a ‘novel’. I mean really, it’s like under 200 pages… So, I asked Siri ‘What is a novel?’ and after giving me pictures of some anorexic, stiletto wearing, pre pubescents, (NOVEL, Siri, not MODEL) this is what dicitionary.com gave me: a fictitious prose narrative of considerable length and complexity, portraying characters and usually presenting a sequential organization of action and scenes. Um… Okay, what is considerable length (you don’t want to know what Siri replied to that). Then I got the philosophical “After all, would we really care if Michelangelo's statue of David was a foot shorter or if Rodin's Thinker was a foot taller? They would still be great works of art, no?” crap. Whatever. For the record, I see this as a novella, a fable, let’s get all fancyshmancy and use the word ‘allegory’ So, if you got this far, then now you’ll hear what I actually think of this book. I have to set the scene, I have to let you know my baseline. This book was beautiful. Someone in book club said ‘tenderly written’; the word ‘fantastical’ was also tossed around. Some said it was scary and my reply was ‘have you read gaiman?’ Because this is what I see when I hear his name. I think of monsters, and book nerdy children, and all that complexity crap written above. I remember Door, I remember Death, I even remember Tristran (even though I wasn’t too fond of that book and thought he was Tristan throughout).  In the interview at the end of the book, one of the book clubbers mentioned that when asked about how much of this book was invention and how much was autobiographical his response was: “Imagine a mosaic picture of a house in the country: lots of red and blue and yellow and black and brown and white and a dozen different shades of green tiles which make a beautiful picture if you stand back far enough.All the little red squares are true--true things, true places, true feelings. But the red squares aren't the picture. All the rest of it is lies and stories, often within the same sentence.”This made me fall in love. I wouldn’t have understood this when I was little, but now, as a mother who had most definitely let down their kids and shown just how human she can be, this is the best I can do at trying to explain what it’s like. What is ‘what’, I don’t know. But, this is it.  He says “It's a book about family, it's a book about being 7 in a world of people who are bigger than you, and more dangerous, and stepping into territory that you don't entirely understand.""How many fears did we have as children (and adults)? Irrational, cockamamie, unreasonable fears? I know I had a lot, I was a timid child, timid teen, I’m sure there were many monsters that I feared that I have swallowed and hidden in the blackest corner of my soul and I bet they will emerge with dementia and/or death. I’ve always felt that I am just pretending at this adult thing. I’ve learned, semi-recently, that I am not the only one and that floored me. I thought everyone else had it together. Well, everyone who didn’t OD or end up on a slew of SSRIs and benzos. “Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. Truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.”Again, thank you, Neil. You rock. I don’t think that this book would really appeal to people who don’t understand that touch of magic that Gaiman can bring out in us. He takes our vulnerability and cradles it gingerly, shows us the scary and then gives us the ocean at the end of the lane and all is well, as long as you can remember the red tiles....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jul 23, 2016","Jul 29, 2016","Dec 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15783514-the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane

It happens often and the internal struggle is staggering. This happens out in the open, usually on a crowded sidewalk or bus or subway or stoplight. I find that I will mouth the argument much to the annoyance of people who need to walk around me or stand next to me or wait behind me. Sometimes I think I'm deep...this Denny's bottomless cup of coffee of enlightenment, sometimes I think I'm just fucking nuts. Why do I not like David Sedaris more than I do? I think we would be friends if he weren't 14 years older than me and living in completely different circles. I believe our combined neuroses could make even Woody Allen say 'Hey now...' I read his essays and nod my head with equally matched comraderie and empathy. Yet, I finish one of his books and I'm like 'eh'. What the hell is wrong with me? I read When You are Engulfed in Flames concurrently with Arguably: Selected Essays and I marveled at the feelings each book brought forth. I would smile and sometimes chuckle with David but be in awe of Christopher. David is much more kin to me than Christopher ever would be, is that why I expect more out of him? I know, it's not fair to compare, but that's just my nature. But, I can say the same of Sarah Vowell. I adore Sarah. I worship Sarah, yet I'm lukewarm to David? Is that really fair? Do I spend too much time thinking about my injustices with David? Most likely. Again, flummoxed. Maybe I need to hear David read. I've listened to Sarah, and her voice grates on me and speaks to me in ways that have me desperatley reaching for my anti depressants. Just the opening reading of Assassination Vacation had me picking out our china pattern, naming our firstborn. Why doesn't David do that for me?

Some article some where said that this was one of those 'must read' young adult books. I didn't really read into it to see why. The title sort of piqued my interest. Who didn't have a hate list? Right? My 25th high school reunion was 2 days ago. I found this out because a couple of friends from middle school had facebooked me and I saw a few posts about partying it up with the class of 1988. I admit, I was interested. I looked at their photos. I looked at some of the profiles of people that made my life hell. (I have that stalker thing going on.) I have that need to see if these people are miserable. I still ( still) want them to be miserable. I guess I haven't grown, much. I recently finished Margaret Atwood's beautifully written book dealing with bullying, Cat's Eye, and found myself too wound up to actually write a . Too emotional, too full. I then read  karen's and thought that she summed it up pretty well. There is a hollow that comes from those scars.. it changes you even when you are not sure how or why. Now I find that I can't escape this topic. I have a daughter in middle school. I see her suffer from those hateful little beasts day in and day out. I want to shield her, I want to pummel them. I want to tell her it will be okay, but I know that it will not, because here I am, living proof, that it is not. Do you really ever get over bullying? Does the Hate List ever get dismissed?It's been 25 years since I left the hell of high school social life and I still have the scar tissue.. tender even.... I finished this book within 24 hours and while I read the words, the images that formed were not of Val and Nick and Jessica and Christy, but of my own demons. Of the Twissas, and Dereks, and Sues that I see posing in photo booth pictures at the reunion acting like this was such a great time in their lives. Sure, maybe it was. Maybe they've blocked out the horrible things that they did, the horrible people that they were and chocked it up to youth. Fuck them, I say. I'm not ready to get over it. This book wasn't outstanding, but it did have some interesting messages.... How the media represents the 'healing process' of the schools after such a massacre. How very Columbine it was (although we've experienced too many such massacres since, Columbine is the one that always comes to my mind) How schools come together after a tragedy. Right. Sure it does.  ""People hate. That's our reality. People hate and are hated and carry grudges and want punishments.The news tells us that hate is no longer our reality.I don't know if it's possible to take hate away from people. Not even people like us, who've seen firsthand what hate can do. We're all hurting. We're all going to be hurting for a long time. And we, probably more than anyone else out there, will be searching for a new reality every day. A better one."" The cynical part of me says 'Good luck with that.' I can't see a better reality for people who carry that grudge. I can tell you that I am not a good enough person to say that after 25 years I didn't see all the same faces as I read through this book, that I didn't sympathize with the killer. Maybe it was the reunion that brought that out in me... but I didn't feel anything but the old resentments surface. I'm afraid to face my 12 year old today. I'm afraid that I'm going to have to lie and tell her that it goes away. My words will sound hollow and will drift (much like this  has).

And the other has no idea what the first has written until that moment? I’m sure I could look this up, but I don’t want to. I need to stay in this Rachel/me/David bubble.

I blend in easily as should a girl from Schenectady….I don’t bother with dating. There is the problem of no one actually asking me on a date, but I choose not to think of that problem as a problem. It’s a solution. The Velmas of the world do not intern at CNN, hope to be accepted at Columbia J-School after graduating NYU with honors and go on to with Pulitzer Prized by getting bogged down in a relationship drama. That's a problem for the Daphnes of the world. Daphne, you bitch, you can't even drive the damn van.""I don’t even think I have that much going for me. Though I certainly know a lot of Daphnes. But, it makes me smile. What doesn’t make me smile is that I sort of feel like a fool. These books are not written for 40-something moms who need an escape, like Twilight or Outlander. These books are meant for the ones that are young and just beginning and to inspire them to be more than just boring. So, yeah… pie on my face me living in my fool’s paradise.This is a sad story in the way that most people actually can understand. It's learning that what you thought could happen, just won’t. That things change, people change, that you can’t make plans and live comfortably in them until you are old and gray. Life gets in the way. And when this happens, it breaks you. I know it did me. Like innocence lost, like no santa at christmas, like Charlie before the glass elevator. It fucking sucks. “The complexity embedded in the different levels of meaning that go along with the words ""I love you"" ought to be a whole mindfuck of a video game”Exactly Dachel. Naomi and Ely. Naomi thinks that they are meant for eachother. Ely thinks that too. But he knows better. And that realization of ‘knowing’… that’s the ball buster. It breaks everything. Your whole conception of ‘being’ is shifted and now you have to think of life without the other person and you’ve never done that before and that’s scary as fuck.  “Maybe your history just repeats and repeats until it batters you enough to snap the seams that hold you together”It’s not pretty when the seams rip. It’s goddamn awful. A hurt so deep that the thought of just feeling despair is a mood lifter. “We always see the worst in our selves. Our most vulnerable selves. We need someone to get close enough to tell us that we're wrong. Someone we trust.”I want to be worthy of these writers. I know that they aren’t like the Hemingways or the Austins, or the Franzens of the world. Which is awesome actually having just finished reading Zadie Smith and not at ALL having this warm fuzzy that Naomi and Ely provided. It shows me that even if my tastes are thought to be par with Hungry Mans, my feelings are still like gelato in Florence.  “Therefore. Ergo. Erg. Argh. Ugh.”...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 24, 2014","Oct 25, 2014","Jul 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23230.Naomi_and_Ely_s_No_Kiss_List
