Usually he sticks to economists, foreign policy wonks, authors of big histories. And I really like his thoughtful way of engaging with his guests, even as he tends at times to veer into high school stoner conversation territory. Sometimes he has other folks on, seemingly just to offer their interesting perspectives: a childcare philosopher, or authors like Margaret Atwood. Recently he had on Emily St. John Mandel, author of, among other books, Station Eleven and The Glass Hotel. I famously didn't really like Station Eleven, but enjoyed The Glass Hotel a lot and absolutely adored the TV show based on Station Eleven, so I was eager to hear the two talk. They talked about quarantine, parenthood, time travel, etc. It's worth a listen. But as is the convention on the show, Ezra's last question is ""What are three books you'd recommend?"" This was one of them.I had never heard of Dan Chaon (pronounced ""Shane"") or this book before, and horror isn't really my thing. But this was such a fascinating and engrossing book--part TV shows ""The Sinner"" and (the first season of) ""True Detective,"" part Cormac McCarthy book infused with so much lurking menace that it felt like it hummed in the background when I wasn't reading it. Told in non-linear fashion, the book involves a series of adolescent cousins whose lives are upended when their parents are brutally killed. The book is split pretty evenly between the childhood (both before and after the killings) and their adulthood, as they grapple with the nature of blame and culpability, and their lives fall apart for mostly unrelated reasons. A recurring theme in ""Ill Will"" is the pliability of memory--can we selectively remember something? Can we selectively forget? How can we be sure that we haven't fabricated something, particularly something important and vivid, either in part or out of whole cloth? It's a fascinating and creepy book, and I'm excited to read more of Chaon and more of St. John Mandel's recommendations....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 25, 2022","May 03, 2022","Apr 25, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30687788-ill-will

They looked a bit haggard, which is to be expected for parents of a newborn, but more than anything else, Colin Jost is surprisingly yoked. The guy had real dad presence. Perhaps this was because he was pushing around a 10-lb. infant and standing next to his surprisingly short wife. But I always thought he was maybe my height or a bit taller. How big is Michael Che, it made me wonder.Anyway, this book is fine; not as hilarious as Amy Poehler's or Tina Fey's books, but you can tell that Colin Jost is a tremendously hard worker and works very hard at his craft.

That book is one I evangelize for, and I was excited to read a more granular, primary-source-anchored account of ACTUP, not only because of my interest in HIV/AIDS, queer history, etc., but because I've always been impressed by the creative and evocative ways that ACTUP made it impossible for an apathetic/hostile public to turn its attention from the scourge of HIV/AIDS. Reading this during a pandemic was often poignant and felt very germane. Not only are some of the same names relevant--for example: Anthony Fauci is very prominent, and often demonized in this book for his perceived slow-rolling of AIDS treatments--but it's impossible not to draw parallels, or, more often: distinctions. Because HIV/AIDS is never and has never been a pandemic, even though those it affects are considerably less siloed than was and is still believed. If there is a thrust to this book, it's that HIV/AIDS was allowed to decimate certain populations because in the best of circumstances the straight/white world didn't care, and in the worst of cases saw HIV/AIDS as condign punishment for a life of vice, or an expedient end to lives better disposed of than preserved.Vito Russo, an HIV/AIDS activist who died of the disease gave a speech titled ""Why We Fight,"" and the speech in its entirety is included in this book. I have never been able to read through it without tearing up, and the few times I've tried to read it aloud to friends I have been unable to finish. But I think it's worth reading in full, because it speaks to the exigency of empathy.A friend of mine in New York City has a half-fare transit card, which means that you get on buses and subways for half price. And the other day, when he showed his card to the token attendant, the attendant asked what his disability was and he said, I have AIDS. And the attendant said, no you don't, if you had AIDS, you'd be home dying. And so, I wanted to speak out today as a person with AIDS who is not dying.You know, for the last three years, since I was diagnosed, my family thinks two things about my situation. One, they think I'm going to die, and two, they think that my government is doing absolutely everything in their power to stop that. And they're wrong, on both counts.So, if I'm dying from anything, I'm dying from homophobia. If I'm dying from anything, I'm dying from racism. If I'm dying from anything, it's from indifference and red tape, because these are the things that are preventing an end to this crisis. If I'm dying from anything, I'm dying from Jesse Helms. If I'm dying from anything, I'm dying from the President of the United States. And, especially, if I'm dying from anything, I'm dying from the sensationalism of newspapers and magazines and television shows, which are interested in me, as a human interest story -- only as long as I'm willing to be a helpless victim, but not if I'm fighting for my life.If I'm dying from anything -- I'm dying from the fact that not enough rich, white, heterosexual men have gotten AIDS for anybody to give a shit. You know, living with AIDS in this country is like living in the twilight zone. Living with AIDS is like living through a war which is happening only for those people who happen to be in the trenches. Every time a shell explodes, you look around and you discover that you've lost more of your friends, but nobody else notices. It isn't happening to them. They're walking the streets as though we weren't living through some sort of nightmare. And only you can hear the screams of the people who are dying and their cries for help. No one else seems to be noticing.And it's worse than a war, because during a war people are united in a shared experience. This war has not united us, it's divided us. It's separated those of us with AIDS and those of us who fight for people with AIDS from the rest of the population.Two and a half years ago, I picked up Life Magazine, and I read an editorial which said, ""it's time to pay attention, because this disease is now beginning to strike the rest of us."" It was as if I wasn't the one holding the magazine in my hand. And since then, nothing has changed to alter the perception that AIDS is not happening to the real people in this country.It's not happening to us in the United States, it's happening to them -- to the disposable populations of fags and junkies who deserve what they get. The media tells them that they don't have to care, because the people who really matter are not in danger. Twice, three times, four times -- The New York Times has published editorials saying, don't panic yet, over AIDS -- it still hasn't entered the general population, and until it does, we don't have to give a shit.And the days, and the months, and the years pass by, and they don't spend those days and nights and months and years trying to figure out how to get hold of the latest experimental drug, and which dose to take it at, and in what combination with other drugs, and from what source? And, how are you going to pay for it? And where are you going to get it? Because it isn't happening to them, so they don't give a shit.And they don't sit in television studios, surrounded by technicians who are wearing rubber gloves, who won't put a microphone on you, because it isn't happening to them, so they don't give a shit. And they don't have their houses burned down by bigots and morons. They watch it on the news and they have dinner and they go to bed, because it isn't happening to them, and they don't give a shit.And they don't spend their waking hours going from hospital room to hospital room, and watching the people that they love die slowly -- of neglect and bigotry, because it isn't happening to them and they don't have to give a shit. They haven't been to two funerals a week for the last three or four or five years -- so they don't give a shit, because it's not happening to them.And we read on the front page of The New York Times last Saturday that Anthony Fauci now says that all sorts of promising drugs for treatment haven't even been tested in the last two years because he can't afford to hire the people to test them. We're supposed to be grateful that this story has appeared in the newspaper after two years. Nobody wonders why some reporter didn't dig up that story and print it 18 months ago, before Fauci got dragged before a Congressional hearing .How many people are dead in the last two years, who might be alive today, if those drugs had been tested more quickly? Reporters all over the country are busy printing government press releases. They don't give a shit, it isn't happening to them -- meaning that it isn't happening to people like them -- the real people, the world-famous general public we all keep hearing about.Legionnaire's Disease was happening to them because it hit people who looked like them, who sounded like them, who were the same color as them. And that fucking story about a couple of dozen people hit the front page of every newspaper and magazine in this country, and it stayed there until that mystery got solved.All I read in the newspapers tells me that the mainstream, white heterosexual population is not at risk for this disease. All the newspapers I read tell me that IV drug users and homosexuals still account for the overwhelming majority of cases, and a majority of those people at risk.And can somebody please tell me why every single penny allocated for education and prevention gets spent on ad campaigns that are directed almost exclusively to white, heterosexual teenagers -- who they keep telling us are not at risk!Can somebody tell me why the only television movie ever produced by a major network in this country, about the impact of this disease, is not about the impact of this disease on the man who has AIDS, but of the impact of AIDS on his white, straight, nuclear family? Why, for eight years, every newspaper and magazine in this country has done cover stories on AIDS only when the threat of heterosexual transmission is raised?Why, for eight years, every single educational film designed for use in high schools has eliminated any gay positive material, before being approved by the Board of Education? Why, for eight years, every single public information pamphlet and videotape distributed by establishment sources has ignored specific homosexual content?Why is every bus and subway ad I read and every advertisement and every billboard I see in this country specifically not directed at gay men? Don't believe the lie that the gay community has done its job and done it well and educated its people. The gay community and IV drug users are not all politicized people living in New York and San Francisco. Members of minority populations, including so called sophisticated gay men are abysmally ignorant about AIDS.If it is true that gay men and IV drug users are the populations at risk for this disease, then we have a right to demand that education and prevention be targeted specifically to these people. And it is not happening. We are being allowed to die, while low risk populations are being panicked -- not educated, panicked -- into believing that we deserve to die.Why are we here together today? We're here because it is happening to us, and we do give a shit. And if there were more of us AIDS wouldn't be what it is at this moment in history. It's more than just a disease, which ignorant people have turned into an excuse to exercise the bigotry they have always felt.It is more than a horror story, exploited by the tabloids. AIDS is really a test of us, as a people. When future generations ask what we did in this crisis, we're going to have to tell them that we were out here today. And we have to leave the legacy to those generations of people who will come after us.Someday, the AIDS crisis will be over. Remember that. And when that day comes -- when that day has come and gone, there'll be people alive on this earth -- gay people and straight people, men and women, black and white, who will hear the story that once there was a terrible disease in this country and all over the world, and that a brave group of people stood up and fought and, in some cases, gave their lives, so that other people might live and be free.So, I'm proud to be with my friends today and the people I love, because I think you're all heroes, and I'm glad to be part of this fight. But, to borrow a phrase from Michael Callen's song: all we have is love right now, what we don't have is time.In a lot of ways, AIDS activists are like those doctors out there -- they're so busy putting out fires and taking care of people on respirators, that they don't have the time to take care of all the sick people. We're so busy putting out fires right now, that we don't have the time to talk to each other and strategize and plan for the next wave, and the next day, and next month and the next week and the next year.And, we're going to have to find the time to do that in the next few months. And, we have to commit ourselves to doing that. And then, after we kick the shit out of this disease, we're all going to be alive to kick the shit out of this system, so that this never happens again.COVID is undeniably a scourge, but the mortality rates are so much lower than HIV/AIDS that the two cannot be plausibly compared. In the United States, COVID mortality rates hover around 0.3%. At its peak in 1995 before the development of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), HIV/AIDS mortality exceeded 16%, and was above 30% for self-identified gay men; what's more, it had been above 10% for the prior three years.We moved heaven and earth in response to COVID, shut down our entire society, altered our way of life for years, took honest and cautious account of who might be harmed the most by its spread, and managed to create several astoundingly effective vaccines within a single year. For HIV/AIDS, developing HAART took well over a decade, and things like PrEP took more than three times as long. The contrast is as repellent as it is revelatory. There is no world in which we would have tolerated HIV/AIDS if even 10% of straight, white, non-drug-using people in rich countries had been falling victim to it. Because that wasn't the case, as Vito Russo says: they didn't give a shit. Queer people mourned the families it's so hard for us to build as they died off in droves; gay men died horrifically undignified deaths, emaciated and covered in thrush and sores and excrement while straight people blamed these victims for their behavior and sinfulness. This, too, contrasts painfully with COVID, where doing things like living your life--including doing things like having a sex life and pursuing romance--are expected, and even the most reckless behaviors are largely free of moral condemnation less than two years in.In 1985, Bob Hope told a joke about AIDS to an audience that included then-President Reagan and his wife, Nancy Reagan. ""The Statue of Liberty has AIDS. They don't know if she got it from the mouth of the Hudson or the Staten Island 'ferry'."" ""Ferry"" was a pun on ""fairy"" and ""Hudson"" was a double entendre referencing the Hudson River and also Rock Hudson, who was fairly well known to be a closeted gay man and the first high-profile celebrity to be acknowledged as having HIV/AIDS. President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan purportedly laughed uproariously at the joke. Hudson, who was friendly with the Reagans from their time in Hollywood, begged the White House to intercede on his behalf to admit him to a hospital in France that he believed could provide the only treatment that might save his life, or at least mitigate the disease ravishing his body; Nancy demurred, and Hudson succumbed three months later. President Reagan didn't say the word ""AIDS"" until late in 1985, though his staff had been joking about it during pressers for years. Earlier this year, First Lady Jill Biden participated in a flashy ceremony honoring Nancy Reagan's depiction on a postage stamp.I mention Nancy Reagan's rehabilitation because part of me thinks that the time has passed for white/heterosexual society to contend with and make amends for its passive toleration of HIV/AIDS. America is a supremely flawed country, and it's understandable that its people need to deploy a lot of cognitive dissonance just to get on. But as queer people our rage should be enduring and incandescent, and it's all the more incumbent that we work in solidarity with other groups facing less analogous forms of oppression and disregard to pull them from the teeth of a brutal and self-interested society....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"May 28, 2021","Jun 13, 2021","May 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54785548-let-the-record-show

The author""Gay Bar: Why We Went Out"" has a weird format: it's a bit of a memoir threaded through the author's monograph on gay bars through the ages. The author grew up in the Bay Area, went to college in LA, and seems to have spent the majority of his adulthood in London, three of the best known gay metropoles; New York makes a few cameos as well, but absent are other notable gay cities--Sydney, Tel Aviv, Berlin, dare I include DC? As others have noted, this is a limited sampling, but for many gay folks the only cities to live in are these, anyway. Lin is a talented writer, as I think most of the s I've read and heard readily admit. He can turn a sentence, and drop esoteric quotes and references seemingly effortlessly. He also ably describes his own experiences at gay bars, sharing specific songs and feelings and moments in a way that the reader feels situated there with him. With that all said, I didn't really feel like I took too much away from this book. It felt like it didn't commit enough to either an interesting personal narrative or a comprehensive history to leave me with any lasting impression. As to the first, the author probably cannot help this; it's probably a rare thing to have a personal history worth putting to paper for others to consume, but I think that's all the more reason one would want to stick to telling others' stories--I think of The Deviant's War: The Homosexual vs. the United States of America by Eric Cervini and others that manage to convey important and underattended histories in engaging ways. This book had not enough of either to keep me very interested, and our book club managed about 10 minutes of discussion before moving on to other topics.Last night my friend Patrick, who invited me to this book club, sent around this article, by Bryan Washington, which talks about his own experiences in gay bars, but in more of an episodic, anecdotal way. Obviously, such topics are more appropriate for an NYT article and might not be able to frame a whole book, but I still felt like I got more out of this one article than Lin's whole book. Not only because Washington describes the experience of building gay community in less metropolitan settings (Lin spends a bit of time talking about Blackpool in the United Kingdom, but the balance of the book deals with the gay meccas), but because he talks about gay community in a way that Lin either purposefully or accidentally glosses over. Lin's telling is about sexual encounters, shocking sights and smells, and dynamics; Washington talks about the miracle of queer spaces, the way that queer people together are greater than the sum of their parts, the way we find each other through sex or substance abuse or niche cultural interest and from these unlikely origins create family; for all of Lin's baleful warning about apps, there's no replacing this lifegiving aspect of being a queer person, or the gay bar's role in facilitating these queer communities....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Apr 05, 2021","Apr 10, 2021","Apr 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53915332-gay-bar

It explores not only the foibles con artists exploit to get us to trust them (as well as to take from us what they want, once that trust is earned), but also the powerful impulse we have to disbelieve that we could have been duped. Psychological research (if not intuition) shows that it's far easier to reaffirm the probity of the person who wronged us than to admit we were chumps.Ego is a powerful thing, and most of us fancy ourselves above average in most capacities, something that in the aggregate is mathematically impossible--the Lake Wobegon effect, it's called. The mind cannot really cope with evidence that tends to undermine the powerful, baseline assumptions we have about the skill with which we are navigating the world (and that others so sorely lack), and so we negate it, even absent all glaring evidence suggesting we're the dummies. Konnikova explores ur-Ponzi schemes, demonstrating that even after the con artists had left the country with people's life savings for no conceivable reason other than to escape accountability for a clear scam, having paid out ludicrous dividends up until that point, those who had clearly been taken threatened violence to anyone who dared question the con artists' legitimacy and even hoped to double down on their poor choices, as soon as the con artist returns once this is all sorted out, of course. It also talks about how people who are down on their luck and desperate are the easiest and most effective marks for the talented con artist. Sadly, it was published in 2015, right before the ascent of Donald Trump (though of course he was a famous con artist before his successful foray into presidential politics), and so it does not mention this greatest con artist of our times (but I have plans to find her twitter account in search of her analysis). But it does explain why people like coal miners in West Virginia, having found the person they thought was their savior, who promised them impossible things and an exit from their desperate situations, having seen no dissipation of their misery, double down and support this man who has used them and played them as fools even more so in 2020 than in 2016. It's not too different from the ways that holy rollers have been cheating the poor and exploiting their misery since time immemorial. These subjects are expected, given the book's subject matter, but some of the others--such as the guy who conned his way into the top position on a Korean warship without any expertise, and then performed miraculous feats that any talented doctor would have been proud of--are interesting and notable for the insights into the motivations and methods of not only the imposters themselves, but their pliant marks.I've been extolling this book because it's a condensed and fascinating look into our intricate and quirky minds, why we do the nonsensical things we do and how none of us is immune, no matter how wise or shrewd we fancy ourselves to be.

Washington is a great writer, and it was a smashing debut.

They've been together for years, and things seem a bit lopsided, inspired by real affection but on borrowed time after a number of blowout fights, emotional distance, and entropy. The novel starts with Mike picking up his acerbic Japanese mother at the airport, driving her to the Houston apartment he shares with Ben, and promptly leaving for Japan to spend time with his moribund father in Osaka. The characters grow apart in two senses--they both grow away from each other and grow as individuals in the absence of the other--as Mike reconnects with his brusque father and Ben his own family, and each of them find romantic partners they connect with better individually. On many levels I related to the goings on in this book: as someone who has lost a parent, as someone who was in the process of wrapping up a relationship that was sustained by a lot of good but ultimately didn't have the legs to continue, as someone who feels alienated by the isolation of the pandemic (which the book does not cover).

It explores the etiology of the disease, which somewhat breaks from our usual models of diseases being inherited/genetic or acquired through contagion. Theories for the cause of schizophrenia swung between blaming environmental factors (often: overbearing or withholding mothers) to entirely genetic (anyone who had a history of depression, for instance, was suspect), and to evaluate the latter, families were often studied to determine what role genes played in the development of this disease. So when scientists became aware of the Galvin family, who had twelves children, six of whom were diagnosed schizophrenics, they sought to learn all that they could. Kolker walks us through the family history--the denial that anything was wrong in an outwardly congenial, large American family, the gradual development of recurring tendencies, the refusal to acknowledge deeply troubling tendencies and the tragedies this would portend--in painstaking detail; that's the real story here, with ""schizophrenia"" the idea/concept as backdrop.

In most cases, the shine of nostalgia does not hold up upon the secondI haven't had the best luck re-reading favorite books from my early adult life. In most cases, the shine of nostalgia does not hold up upon the second attempt. But ""Confederacy"" is a notable exception.Back in college when I read for pleasure much more sparingly, I have to imagine I had an elaborate selection process, but for the life of me I have no idea why I would have picked up this book. But pick it up I did, and my life was never the same. I graduated a semester early from college but hung around a less notorious Charlottesville, whiling away the down hours at a pizza place reading this book and laughing like a maniac, the first book and to-date one of the only capable of eliciting such a reaction.I think a large part of it stems from my friendship throughout college with my friend Richard, who in many ways was like Ignatius: Richard had American parents but was raised in the toniest of British environs, attending a 500-year-old public school and (at the time at least) affecting a plummy upper crust accent. Richard was/is also huge, about 6'3"", 250-300 lbs, and often with a giant frizzy 'fro. He was Ignatian in that he had strong senses of orthodoxy about the world, who was good and who should ""be punished,"" and combined the slovenliness and erudition of Ignatius to a scary degree. Richard would often hold forth in the most officious of ways about recondite rituals like which hand to use when passing a bottle of port at the dinner table and when it was appropriate to wear white tails, yet he could almost invariably be found issuing these pronouncements recumbent on a ratty couch, dressed in torn jeans and a tall tee, usually covered in mustard or BBQ-sauce stains. He was as apt to quote Chaucer as an obscure character from a Ninja Turtles movie, and his life in college was as picaresque as they come. But the comparisons stop there (for the most part--in a twist of fate, Richard ended up moving to and running a restaurant in New Orleans--for which he recently wrote this amusing NYT op-ed), because unlike Ignatius, Richard is moored in reality, friendly, loyal, kind, generally normal, industrious, good to his friends and family, and (as far as I know) not unnaturally animated by the memories of his dead pets. But the first time I read this I was living with Richard, as I had in some form or fashion for three years of college, and we had created a sort of dialectic worldview with one another whereby every action and every college character was exasperatedly judged to be good or bad. There is strong appeal to a coherent (however unreasonable) worldview through which everything can be sorted, and one's heels can pleasingly dig in to the extent it is challenged or opposed as unreasonable by the wishy-washy or idiotic people--the dunces!--confederated against it. Ignatius is an educated troglodyte, a bloated caricature of sloth, bombast, and bigotry, someone animated more by petty animosities and delusions of grandeur than any principled crusade against the tyranny of modern times. But so much of comedy is being unreasonable, and Ignatius does it better than anyone else. A final note on the somewhat well-known tragedy of the author, who tried manfully to shop around his book, only to have it rejected because it didn't ""have a point""; that idea seems positively quaint in retrospect, even denuded of the context of the author's tragic suicide at 31 and the posthumous Pulitzer the book so deservedly won. The sad thing is that the editors who read this work knew it was funny, knew it showcased incredible talent, and yet they held it back anyway. The author succumbed to vice and mental illness, and the rest is tragic history. But I keep coming back to thinking about writing something this funny, this thoughtful, this original, this good, only to be told that it won't be read, too bad, try again next time--the confederacy of dunces arrayed against the genius in a bitterly ironic, real-life twist.

The book stemmed from the author's historical research, plus the unlikely opportunity to become close with and learn from one of Malcolm's siblings. The result is a pretty fleshed out story, though one that seems heavily tilted toward the younger, formative years of Malcolm X's life.The look we get into Malcolm X's early life is interesting if not surprising. Malcolm's family, who were acolytes of Marcus Garvey's Back to Africa movement, refused to abide by the white supremacist codes of early 20th Century America, which dictated where Black people could and could not live, what rights they were entitled to, and the threats they could expect for things as commonplace as not stepping off the sidewalk if a white person walked by. Inevitably, this resulted in squabbles and death threats, including the KKK menacing Malcolm's mother while she was pregnant with him. The family were also devout Christians--his father was a minister--and this seemed to lay the framework for Malcolm's later embrace of and proselytization through the Muslim faith--at first esoteric, then conventional--of his adult years.Malcolm X is so often portrayed as MLK's more acceptable civil rights counterpart, perhaps because his advocacy of an-eye-for-an-eye was less palatable (and continues to be less palatable) to white America than King's turn-the-other-cheek approach. It was interesting to read this during MLK Day, and to think about King's approach removed from this period by half a century in a period where historical figures, even admirable ones, get reevaluated under more critical contemporaneous standards. Should a political leader preaching respectability and incrementalism be criticized for doing so if their legacy is one of success, even if qualified success? Is MLK's legacy intact because his approach was and continues to be countenanced by white Americans, or is it because in addition to his incrementalist and institutionalist approaches, he also preached (conveniently less remembered) ideas that were quite radical? Is Malcolm X's relatively diminished reputation owing to the legacy of his actions, the piquancy of his claims, or our awareness of his own flaws (his longtime adherence to a movement run by a hypocritical lunatic, Elijah Mohammed, his misogyny, his homophobia, etc.)? It's tough to say, but this book often felt like it was trying a bit hard to excuse Malcolm's flaws while extolling his virtues, with the former perhaps justified by the undeservedly negative reputation X still somewhat enjoys in mainstream (read: white) American culture. It glosses over allegations of antisemitism blithely (i.e., ""It's not that he hated Jews, it's that he hated all white people!"") and misogyny (i.e., ""Sure, he was brutal and abusive to white women... but never to Black women!""), and doesn't even attempt to hide his homophobia (""Malcolm hated queers.""), and veers into hagiography in other explorations of the man's rhetorical skills, piety, and judgment. It also makes some absurd claims (e.g., saying that a Nation of Islam henchman was know to be ""extraordinarily skilled""... with a pickaxe? Claiming that Elijah Mohammad's claims, in the Twentieth Century, of a ""mothership"" were no crazier than Judeo-Christian beliefs in a talking Burning Bush, as if the latter were not created by pre-literate people to describe the workings of a world they poorly understood, the former by a low rent grifter in the modern era). But more fairly it portrays Malcolm X as a man reacting reasonably to a world that brutalizes and disregards Black lives. As with MLK, who shifted from messages of racial equality to economic equality around the time (and perhaps because of this) he was killed, Malcolm X--having publicly eschewed Elijah Muhammad shortly before (and perhaps causing) his own death--shifted from a message that mostly boiled down to ""white people are the devil"" to ""white people are not inherently evil, but society incentivizes them to exploit, denigrate, and maim Black people,"" and one wonders what might have happened had he lived to preach this modified message....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jan 18, 2021","Jan 22, 2021","Jan 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50489321-the-dead-are-arising

In discussing the backslapping Anglo-American past 150-year period, Mishra points out the inconsistencies of the West's approach to the rest of the world, for instance Wilson deigning to grant sovereignty to the lesser Poles and Slovaks, but not daring to do so to the Egyptians or Vietnamese, specifically rejecting an audience with Ho Chi Minh in France with shall we say famous consequences. Having sent up the incoherent, inconsistent, and myopic framework used to justify not only the interventions and authority but also the prestige of the Anglo-American century, Mishra takes aim at those who insist on its primacy yet bemoan any cracks in its hegemony, from Churchill to Powell to Niall Ferguson to Jordan Peterson. Picking over the carcass of the now discredited idea that Anglo-American liberal democracy as deployed on the unwilling and unconsulted browner peoples of the Earth is the Only Way, or a good way, or a way designed to promote anything more than crass consumerism or neocolonial dynamics, Mishra lambastes the confidence and incompetence of Americans and Britons who conflate a legacy of power with contemporary wisdom, intelligence, and legitimacy. Showing more than telling, Mishra's exclamation point to this takedown is the leadership, at present, of the free world consigned to the wild-haired and buffoonish Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, both grotesque products of generations of privilege that has insulated them as much from responsibility as it has from scruple or the ability to attempt introspection. Although the book starts out as an exploration of the West's benighted attempts at ""civilizing"" (and really dominating) the non-white peoples of the Earth, especially where they sit atop resources requiring cleverer workarounds to achieve colonial exploitation, it also takes aim at the rudiments of British prestige and culture, especially where they have anchored firmer roots in its more rowdy and interventionist offspring such as America, Canada, and Australia. The Economist--which has as many subscribers in Britain as in its Commonwealth, and three times that many in America--earns special attention for the duration and particularly pointed nature of its contribution to Anglo-American economic nostrums and interventionist urgings (an editor skipping down the hallway singing ""My enemy is dead!"" after Pinochet's CIA-backed coup killed the democratically elected socialist president of Chile was a particularly revealing and grisly anecdote), as does Rupert Murdoch, for perhaps more obvious reasons. The BBC, and the ""unteachably stupid"" and ossified aristocratic class that dominates and bungles British foreign policy (as exemplified by the Eton-Oxford ""chumocracy"" of Cameron and Johnson, modern analogues of Lord Mountbatten, stick out as leaders whose pedigree suffices where quality is wanting) also merit merciless and entertaining scrutiny.This collection of essays is that much more notable for being so gripping despite being about something that obviously shapes my world, but is not very front-of-mind.

The author wryly recounts this tale, focusing distinctly on two issues libertarians grapple with, one famously (""Everyone's a libertarian until their house catches fire"") and another less so (bears: libertarians believe that one should be able to do what one wants on one's property, including as concerns wildlife; when one woman began undertaking superhuman efforts to feed a colony of lay-about bears, gun enthusiasts clashed with state authorities in their attempts to mitigate the problem while everyone else remained helpless).This book is not a charitable take on libertarianism, and perhaps that is acceptable. I'm no fan of the doctrine, and for reasons the book chronicles: the idea that one can take all of the advantages of modern life and exempt oneself from them is not only childish, but inevitably courts disaster. Ultimately, we all live in a society and human tolls must be accounted for; ideally, we prevent them, even if it costs us. In Grafton, the poor are unable to prevent bear attacks, what little government presides is incapable of or unwilling to provide bear protection services that render bear-human interactions a rarity in surrounding locales, and fires run rampant while principled citizens dicker over peanuts and ponder whether all-volunteer fire companies can solve a problem that the rest of the developed world has already figured is a worthwhile expense that can be borne by everyone collectively.Anyway, it's an amusing yarn, but not particularly revelatory.

It's branded as a kind of poor, gay, Anglophone bildungsroman, but struck me much more as a tale of poverty and alcoholism. At one point the titular character and one of his female confidants talk about their alcoholic mothers, saying that alcoholism is just a slow suicide for people who cannot face reality, and that sounded true enough. Even as Shuggie's mother's alcoholism abates at times, there is such a sense of foreboding and irretrievable doom that the few breaks of sunlight seem menacing rather than a reprieve. If you are close with anyone who struggles (or struggled) with alcoholism, I would imagine it could be difficult as well.Told amidst the surprising squalor and dismalness of working class Thatcherite Scotland, Shuggie is the effeminate only child of Agnes, a fading beauty and unregenerate alcoholic, and Big Shug, a ladies-man cabbie. Poverty immiserates as a rule, and that's certainly the case here. Infidelity, lack of economic opportunity, alcoholism, and Catholic/Protestant antagonisms spoil the relationship, and the children bear the brunt of the fallout.

Instead of (view spoiler)[an over-the-hill gay man swanning all over the globe, doubting his appeal only to reunite with his much younger lover, a story that I never found believable or very interesting (hide spoiler)], McCauley's David inhabits a much less glamorous station in life, having been dumped by his most recent lover (who is engaged to a rich surgeon), inhabiting a career he doesn't love, and not having much in terms of financial security to show for his travails. In desperate need of a change, he leaves San Francisco and goes to stay with his ex-wife in maritime Massachusetts, encountering a colorful cast of characters and forming meaningful if not predictable relationships throughout. Heartwarming and funny, I have been browbeating everyone I can buttonhole who loved ""Less"" to read this and let me know their thoughts on how the two compare.

They were well written, and they cover a lot of topics, touching on familiar touchstones of American racism and racial strife without feeling hoary or warmed over. But I think the last story, with its almost gothic air of mystery and foreboding, its explorations of wealth, privilege, race, politics, friendship, and the safety, ease, and ghastly appurtenances of whiteness, stands out among them all and will stick with me for a while.

The premise is that a 30-something gay, having left NYC for LA and not in possession of wealth or the perfect body, seeks out an otherworldly solution for his brokenness. He is in recovery from addiction and coming off a few very painful breakups, so when he hears about a shaman who can cure everything, he leaps at the opportunity.As I said, Lansky is such a skilled writer and an observant narrator, but sometimes--especially when cataloguing the materialistic things, e.g., the Creed cologne bottles or the fur trim of a designer coat--it felt hard to take seriously, especially when these details vied for space on the same page with (or stood in as metaphors for) breakthroughs and more transcendent realizations. There's a certain type of gay whose currency seems to consist entirely in being fluent in identifying, ranking, and hoarding such details, and while I get the impression that the author wanted us to associate those with his former self--the pre-enlightenment iteration--it didn't really come off that way in the end.

Within twenty minutes, I was hooked.The book follows a charming cast of characters, all old New York mainstays, as they navigate the drama that touches off the action: a doddering old widower drunk--Sportcoat, or Deacon King Kong--shoots the projects' chief drug dealer in cold blood, right in the face. The insights into the characters' backgrounds, their connections, and their colorful pasts and how they came to Brooklyn unfolds in a charmingly Dickensian manner, and a lot of ground gets covered and issues reconciled by the time the book ends.I had read this author's The Good Lord Bird before, and it has similar elements.

Beautiful writing, but that's seldom enough for me.Flash forward several months later and my friend Jeff and my mom had really exhorted this one to me, so I thought I would give it a shot. It's really well crafted, consistently lyrical, and a really affecting tale of love and loss in the times of a different and far more virulent, unknown pandemic: the bubonic plague. Much of this is pure conjecture, which the author readily notes--we don't even know what Hamnet died of, for instance, much less have any certainty that it was the plague--but that gave the author the license to speculate (for instance: never once does Shakespeare mention a plague in his plays; it could be that he wanted to divert and remove people from their miserable and uncertain lives; but it could also be that the topic was simply too painful for him, and so he refused to address it) and weave an engrossing tale.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Oct 13, 2020","Apr 21, 2021","Jul 31, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43890641-hamnet

It starts out ordinarily enough: a woman of little consequence is called by her neighbor to attend to the body of a neighbor who violently choked on the bone of a deer he had recently slaughtered, and the woman is affected by it deeply. The narrator, a student of Blake and a self-described ""crone"" interacts with her neighbors in various frustrating and alienating ways, and begins to propound a theory about why various men begin meeting their violent deaths: the animals are fighting back against their slaughter. She is by no means coy about sharing this theory with friends and strangers alike, and as a third audience the reader has to decide whether she is descending into madness, or casting a series of events in a light that reflects her own theory of justice and happenstance, or both.(view spoiler)[It became quite obvious to me early on that the narrator herself was doing the killing, given her disgust with meat-eating generally and her pointed vitriol toward hunters in particular. Of course this wasn't fully revealed until the penultimate chapter, but the proliferation of murders of men who had scoffed at and rebuffed her attempts to prevent or mitigate the slaughter of wild and abuse of domestic animals could not have been a coincidence. This book is a fascinating exploration of vigilantism--whether it makes sense to abide by the rules of a society whose rules and principles you find so arbitrary, hypocritical, and backward; whether you lose yourself in the process or can trust yourself to mete out justice, or that your sense of justice will endure. It also underscores the link between wisdom, motivation, and anger, clarifying more than once that the latter can be the source of cogency and righteous action, something I often feel as someone whose reaction to injustice is seldom sadness and often indignation, and who rarely feels more articulate or unflagging than when he is angered by a sense of injustice.And there's also the way the author addresses being ignored or of no consequence. For better or for worse, I've always felt this feeling more severely than I see it borne in others, and I enjoyed how the protagonist weaponizes being looked over, after years of accepting it. Try as she did to effect important changes and to get people to listen to her the conventional ways, they would pay her heed in the end. None of this is to say that any of her actions are sane or warranted. But it's interesting and invigorating to witness. Especially as concerns her disassociation from a violent, male, hypocritical and testosterone-guided society, it is not so difficult to imagine that rejecting and subverting the power structures in a violently antisocial way might not be such a hard break for someone; the self-recrimination to act 'sanely' might become a pesky voice to ignore, rather than an admonition guiding all of life's choices. (hide spoiler)]I loved Tokarczuk's voice in Flights, but it lacks a cohesive plot.

The author, a very thoughtful and toothsome (someone called him a ""snackademic,"" lol) young scholar--Eric Cervini--lays out the respectability politics that guided this stubborn and tenacious young man to become the first advocate for lesbian and gay equality in the workplace.As a gay civil rights lawyer, and given the momentous 7-2 Supreme Court decision in Bostock that extended Title VII protections to LGBT people, I read this eagerly and with great relish.

We chose this for our book club and this past week, we were lucky enough to host the L.A.-based author via Zoom. He graciously sat with us for a full hour, talking about gay DC, the failings of the LGBT rights movement to support the civil rights of other groups, the failure of queer men to adequately support queer women and trans people, and had thoughtful, intriguing answers for all of our questions. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about the early stages of the LGBT rights movement in the United States, or who is interested in the tensions between conventional and radical elements within a movement ostensibly agitating for the same goal, or who is interested in understanding (some of the) tensions that still divide those who fight for LGBTQ+ civil rights and those who fight for civil rights based on sex or race....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 26, 2020","Jul 08, 2020","Jun 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51542229-the-deviant-s-war

I used a clumsy analogy in my bookclub that I don't think landed, but it stuck with me as I read these very short vignettes detailing the development and degeneration of a queer relationship into emotional abuse. I remember in high school my trigonometry teacher telling us that a circle could be described as an infinite number of lines tangent to a single function, with the circle being ""rounder,"" the better described by the greater number of lines contributing to its rounded shape. These insights were so brief--not more than a few sentences in some cases--but they described such a vivid dynamic. It's probably impossible to recreate the experience or the relationship in any reliably complete or objective way--just as a finite number of tangents articulates an imperfect circle--but by giving us so many looks through many different lenses, Machado gives us the next best thing. Machado endured abuse that I won't call unbelievable, (because I do believe her) but rather unfathomable. I truly found it hard to relate, not least because I have adverted to far less problematic and psychopathic behaviors to justify ending a relationship. But I have to believe that lots of emotionally abusive relationships unfold this way, and though she does her best to educate her readers on the ways in which queer relationships are no less susceptible to such abuse than straight ones, it still felt like there was something fundamentally awry, something beyond just the badness of the abusive dynamic to begin with: it felt unnatural to see this dynamic unfolding absent a gendered power imbalance.Anyway, maybe that's my naivete or just my extrapolation of my own experiences, or the fact that I've never read about any queer abuse dynamics before, whether between men or women (or any other combination of genders). But I still found it unsettling. Ultimately I'm happy for Machado (the acknowledgements were tender and beautiful), and I'm glad I gave her a second chance after a disappointing introduction.

This might be read as the non-fiction accompaniment, as they both came out recently to significant acclaim, and both deal with N. Ireland's Troubles period.The impetus for this book is pretty wild: Boston College somehow convinced a number of people who were deeply involved in IRA activity to speak candidly bout their experiences and even to confess to many of the violent crimes they took part in over the years, in the interests of preserving the stories of the guerrilla side (presumably the British narratives will all be declassified at some point and in any event are better documented than the non-governmental group's). Improbably, many of the most deeply implicated folks readily spoke to the coordinators of this project, thinking that a private American university's clout and remove from Northern Ireland would be sufficient to preserve the secrecy of the participants until they died, which was their incentive to become involved and speak candidly. Obviously there are international treaties and court systems that can override whatever ""clout"" is meant to be and that can supersede any such promises, and the stories began to leak before many of the most implicated folks had passed away. That's the genesis, likely, of so much of the material that made up this book. But the drama about the consequences and reckoning these folks faced is secondary. Instead, the real pull of this book is the insider's look into IRA dynamics, the secrecy and deceit that characterized everything they did, and the powerful zeal animating nationalist activism. It's also interesting to view, in retrospect, how quickly a place like Belfast can change from a veritable war zone to a mini-London, with all of its Georgian decorum and prosperity. Ireland, too, in this book is portrayed in the way it had always been portrayed to me as the offspring of Irish grandparents: beautiful, but squalid, cold, backward, stubborn, and poor poor poor. Now, by some measures Ireland is the most prosperous non-microstate in Europe, and one of the richest countries in the world. Obviously this is owing to many factors, but it's hard to imagine that could have happened if bombs were still regularly going off in Belfast and Dublin. Luckily we're past those times, and with Brexit and demographic trends being what they are, a united Ireland may not be too far in the offing. One is not necessarily left with the impression that this would be a good thing, or that the zeal is even still there for it to take on the epic dimensions it did in the latter half of the 20th Century, but it will be interesting to see whether seven centuries of bitter division can be forgotten in the face of overwhelming prosperity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 08, 2020","May 10, 2020","Apr 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40163119-say-nothing

I've read that the author sought to center himself as a Black, gay man in a campus novel, because he had seldom if ever read anything reflecting his experience. For Wallace, the Black, gay protagonist: hell is white people, and he cannot get away from them. Grad school does tend to be quite privileged, and in a country like the United States where privilege correlates most closely with race, it is not surprising that almost all of Wallace's cohort and academic program are white people from privileged backgrounds. Having been spurned, underestimated, and unwanted by these people before--despite his hopes for escaping the benighted South and finding sanctuary in the enlightened (?) North/Midwest--he often tries to avoid them, but when you live in Madison, WI there do not seem to be many alternatives. with some exceptions, these white people are all pretty insufferable, wanting to live out a pastoral, liberal ideal but too cowardly to call out the cartoonish racism that Wallace is subjected to on a regular basis.

It talks not only about why we sleep, why it's important, and why we dream, but about the deleterious effects of not getting enough of it. This part was the hard part--they basically make it seem like if you're not getting 7-8 hours per night (spoiler: I do not), then you're walking around lobotomized, setting yourself up for a lifetime of Parkinson's and cancer, in addition to every other type of decline you can imagine.If you're like me, you bristle at such claims. On the one hand, they seem of the sort peddled by writers of some ""wonder food,"" who claim that everything bad comes of not getting enough of it, and so much--an implausible amount of--good can be wrought from availing yourself of its wonders. This, of course, is an inapt analogy, because we can all get by fine with or without most diets, but none of us can live without sleep. And even those of us who can ""get by"" on less sleep are probably deluding ourselves, as those who truly show no cognitive decline when they get 5-6 hours of sleep per night are vanishingly rare, something like one in 50,000 to 100,000 people. I think where I've settled is that I buy the claims generally but understand that they operate in the aggregate. It's not that I think that I am not impairing myself in the short-term (hopefully not the long-term, but *gulp*), it's just that I don't think that I am as negatively affected as most people by getting less sleep than recommended. I came to this realization after the chapter on obesity, which is not something I have had to contend with, whether in times of bountiful sleep or times of lesser, despite the baleful warnings this book issued. I believe that I would be in worse shape if I slept more, as I use a lot of the time that people spend snoozing working out, and any fatigue I get from losing out on sleep feels primarily mental rather than ""corporeal.""

After many months, I have come across a truly exceptional book. ""Apeirogon"" follows shortly on another (extremely good) book told in a similar fashion, Carmen Maria Machado's ""In the Dream House: A Memoir,"" which uses a somewhat similar storytelling device. As it turns out, I wrote a not particularly articulate  of that book, in which I tried to describe the act of storytelling by describing an apeirogon, or an infinitely sided shape, though I didn't have the vocabulary for describing it at the time. Like Machado, McCann's book has many chapters, often using topics as varied and orthogonal to the plot of the story as the migratory habits of birds, or the death of the first socialist president of France, or the Troubles in Northern Ireland to tell a rounded if imperfectly detailed story, in this case about the ceaseless and senseless bloodshed and human trauma that stem from the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The two protagonists of this story are actual people, fathers of slain daughters, one Jewish Israeli and one Palestinian Muslim, who each lost a child through senseless violence stemming from the occupation. This book is just suffused with humanity, and it's a mix of shocking, amazing, and witnessing grace to understand these men, to inhabit the worlds they occupied and the forces that should have contrived to make them anything but what they turned out to be--deeply compassionate, empathetic people dedicated to ending one of the gravest human rights and democratic failures of modern times. I have seen so many people on this website decry this book and admit that they abandoned it part way through, because they were so upset by the allegedly anti-Israel bias it exhibits. Shame, shame, shame on these people, who are so dug into their strident beliefs that they cannot even devote the patience to witness the full unfurling of the stories of people who have lost far more to this conflict than they ever will, yet have had the nuance of opinion and grace of understanding to avoid the pitfall of lizard-brained, reactionary hate and have chosen to use the position their grief has given them to advocate for peace and understanding. One does not have to come away from this book thinking that Palestinians do no wrong and that the State of Israel is an unjustifiable evil. But to abandon it is an act as much of cowardice as it is of ignorance.I got my name from a book written by Leon Uris, a Jewish American who had never stepped foot in Ireland when he wrote Trinity. The book appealed to many of the Irish diaspora, including my parents, who named me after its protagonist, Conor Larkin. I always marveled at how someone from a culture so different from the one he portrayed could tell a story so evocatively, and marveled at his ability to do so.

One comes away with the notion that Steve Jobs was an absolute sociopath--being a tyrant to adults in the workplace is one thing, but a man who makes seven-year-olds cry at dinner because he doesn't like their voice or what dish they ordered, or who has billions of dollars but won't pay for his daughter's college tuition, or who says ""too bad"" when his daughter--whom he has pressured to live with him in order to be ""part of [the] family""--asks him if he wouldn't mind coming to say goodnight to her every once in a while because she is lonely is truly an ogre.Seriously, the guy is a monster, and his moments of goofiness or occasional largess or charm really make up for so little of the bad behavior that I don't really understand why the daughter stuck with him. I suppose power does that to you, and when you're used to thinking you're an infallible genius, it's no longer enough to have everyone do whatever you ask them to do; they have to anticipate every possible bad reaction you might have and walk around on eggshells to avert their mere possibility. Somehow, despite having a mother who also seemed to have her own issues, Lisa turned out--at least in the subjective light of self-portrayal--a pretty grounded person with good values and a compassionate heart. I think the ending leaves it a bit ambiguous and up to the reader to decide whether Lisa forgives Jobs, or whether he deserves it.

By way of a little bit of history, a few decades before the Civil War (and many years after the British Empire outlawed the practice), the Congress outlawed the trade in slaves brought from abroad. While this occurred long before the subject of this book was even born, given how valuable slaves were, many profiteers took it upon themselves to engage in the skin trade and bring people over from Africa. One of them was Cudjoe Lewis, and he was the last of these to survive when Franz Boas, father of modern anthropology at Columbia University (and subject of another book I am reading right now, coincidentally: Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century), sent his acolyte Zora Neale Hurston to Florida to interview him.It's interesting, because his life spans Africa and then slavery and then attempts at Reconstruction, such as they even existed in deep Florida. Cudjoe had a really tough life, probably even by free Black standards of the day, and the tale is a mournful one. There are the expected tales of whites leaving their former slaves with nothing, black bodies as grist fed into the rough machinery of an industrializing behemoth, and the wanton violence that was visited on his family until he was the only one left.

From inauspicious beginnings and against headwinds of Nazism in his home country (to say nothing of the taxonomic and ""meritocratic"" tendencies of his adopted home, the fin-de-siècle United States), Boas established anthropology as an academic discipline at Columbia University, and immediately began recruiting some of the most luminous minds to develop under his tutelage, Mead and Hurston included. Mostly their task was to establish cultural relativism, and I think the following summarizes the ethos well:There can be no real analysis of human societies without the prior assumption that one’s own way of seeing the world isn’t universal, [Ruth] Benedict said. Every society, including our own, suffers from the tyranny of the capital letter: we tend to equate our own behavior with a thing we label Behavior and the ways that seem natural to us with a thing we call Human Nature. But all societies are in fact just snippets of a “great arc” of possible ways of behaving. Which particular snippets a society develops depends on a whole host of accidental factors, from “hints” provided by geography, environment, or basic human needs to more or less random borrowings from neighboring societies. These choices might be reasonably durable, which allows anthropologists to study them in context—to write down, in a given society, how babies are born, how boys are ushered into adulthood, or how girls are married off well and expeditiously. But they are never glued in place. All societies change.Implicit in that summary but not stated outright is the idea that because all societies change and any given society may (at any given time) value or disdain certain behaviors or attributes, no group of humans is naturally better or worse than any other, just different and possibly better or worse along certain dimensions. We tend to give those dimensions value (e.g., tendency to produce philosophers we know, or buildings we regard as beautiful, or authors we revere), but those values reflect our own biases more than any transcendental truth about human capability or purpose. In the end, the book dealt with a lot of only minorly interesting personal dynamics between the in-group and their taggers along, and so turned into something of a slog. This was particularly so given that the main thesis, though important, is graspable pretty easily and early on.

I had never heard of it or the author, but I found it extremely entertaining, even as a gay who was never really in the circuit in NYC and who has never stepped foot on Fire Island. This was all about Malone for me. He was endlessly entertaining, truly either the perfect commemoration of a voice that has endured for generations or the instantiation of a gay archetype that continues to this day. As we discussed in book club, this book was also interesting for having been released right before AIDS mushroomed into full-blown epidemic. Gay culture seemed to have developed in many baroque, intriguing, alluring, and disturbing ways. There was so much hedonism and promiscuity, and it's easy to see how those were both good and bad things, simultaneously. It's also easy to see how a contemptuous cishet society would link gay holocaust to the types of behaviors portrayed in this book, characterizing the scourge as condign punishment for the most scandalous sybaritism this side of Gomorrah. And as a factual matter I don't think you could say those statements were wrong, though assignment of blame and culpability are an entirely different matter. But it's interesting to see in so much of the puritanism within and without the gay community how internalized that feeling is, that any sufficiently uninhibited behavior is ""asking"" for punishment. It wasn't until much later that people began to acknowledge that this was a particularly virulent disease and one that was uniquely linked with a particular subgroup's maligned form of sexual activity, and that these things were much more likely to be purely and tragically coincidental than at all connected in some more cosmic sense. If it had been a bunch of straight people dying because they move to the suburbs and catch diseases related to lawn care regimens, I doubt we would be blaming them or warning that a renewed wave of lawn-care enthusiasm is a harbinger of a second pandemic, but humans are simple creatures prone to cognitive biases, and so I imagine the condemnatory mindset will persist.Having lived through the recoil following the worst of the AIDS crisis and living in the drug-positive, PReP-enabled 2010s, it feels in some ways as though we're back at that moment depicted in this book. Maybe a bit ""before"" it, but it's hard to make exact comparisons. There were parts of this book that seemed alluring, and there was some nostalgia for a time I never experienced, and probably never will. But would my life have been better if I had lived back then? I probably would have been some miserable suburban closet case, and if I had broke free to live the lives of the men in this book, I probably would have had a ton of anonymous sex and done a lot more drugs, but I certainly have those avenues available to me still and don't find them particularly alluring.Maybe it's just that that time will never return, that culture will never again be as vital and vibrant, robbed as it is of its frisson of danger and intrigue and the complexity of semiunderground social strata.

Specifically, it's weird that the Pandemic of 1918 isn't up there with the Holocaust and WWII in terms of notable massacres of the 20th century. Sure, we talk about it some--I think a few of my grandfather's sisters died in it, and that's to be expected, given that about 1 in 40 who got the disease died, and children and people living in poor, urban areas were more likely to get infected. But I feel like it's not given its due. Aside from being extremely deadly--far deadlier than all the wars of the 20th century combined, according to this book--it's wild how truly global the pandemic was, and how unprepared for it the world was. Accelerated by the squalor of urbanization, WWI, and increasing globalization, this pandemic was unlike anything before or since; indeed, much of our current flu preparedness methodology is a reaction to pandemics such as the one from 1918. Perhaps the scariest section was the last one, which talked about the future of the flu. Ever wonder why you only have to get the polio vaccine once, but you get a flu vaccination every year? Well it's because the latter is extremely volatile and changes all the time. Volatility means that it is constantly evolving, and so far we have been able to check it pretty well. But a contagious flu--which (and this is so wild to me) can only ever come about if bird droppings find their way into a pig's digestive tract, which pig then spreads it to human--is capable of some really scary mutations, including the Bird Flu of the early 2000s, which could only pass directly from birds to humans but had a SIXTY PERCENT kill rate (compare that with 2.5% for the deadliest flu ever). The ""problem"" with the bird flu was that it could not be passed from one human to another. And yet under lab conditions (thank god), certain scientists have created versions of the bird flu with the mutations that would, if given to a human, be contagious from human to human, potentially setting off a global holocaust the likes of which we've never before seen, and that would make the Black Death look benign by comparison. These scientists were ostensibly conducting research, in the event that someone tried to use such a contagion for malign purposes; after all, it's hard to sneak a nuclear bomb into a country, but you can carry a deadly flu without any detection whatsoever. And then there's always the chance that something like this could evolve on its own. I don't think we have any means for dealing with such a scourge.

The clerical patriarch insists that the physical residue of their assaults betokens visits from demons, the wages of immoral behavior and thought. Only by catching one of the perpetrators in the act are the women able to force confessions and seek respite from the scourge. We find them discussing how to move forward after the men have been reported to local Bolivian authorities and incarcerated before standing trial. The women are essentially given an ultimatum: forgive their attackers and continue to live in this community or refuse them forgiveness and be kicked out of the community for the withholding. This all happened in real life, and the women--who are not allowed to read--debated how to move forward and had one trusted male record their deliberations. Toews has a pretty airy, light way of dealing with heavy subjects--the other book of hers that I read, All My Puny Sorrows, is about suicide--but it felt more jarring here than in the other. Some of the women almost see themselves as livestock, and think they would do well to stop making such a ""big deal"" out of it. Some women fault the ones who got pregnant through these rapes, claiming it stains their purity and their future offspring alike. Some women resign themselves to their fates, acknowledging the wrong but unable to imagine a life outside of the insular community they have always known, and the necessities that men have always provided them. The subject matter is difficult, but I began to appreciate it as an allegory of how sexual assault is treated in our society. Toews exposes the horrors of this particular insular society, and the sheer depravity of it all makes us think, ""How backward!"" But I'm not sure that this society handles sexual assault too differently than we do. Women are always called on to let these things go, to reimagine them as either complicit in the act or having asked for it in some way. There is always outsized solicitude for the life of the attacker, and less for the well-being of the victim. Women who have been denied education or have been forced out of gainful employment feel trapped, and other women understandably lack the energy to bring their attackers to justice, given the headwinds and recriminations they face. And, as here, women's stories are more often than not told by men.This book was thought-provoking. Difficult at times, but I find myself recommending it often.

Obviously they've had different routes to power, and that power manifests itself in different ways. And as an attorney, a SCOTUS justice is naturally going to manifest hers in ways that is more germane to my career than a First Lady would. Sotomayor I think lives in RBG's shadow a bit but her jurisprudence is no less progressive (and indeed, in some cases she will be the lone holdout), and she brings a type of compassion to her legal analysis that is decidedly absent from the terse and cerebral writings of RBG.

I guess I have conflictI put myself on the list for this one forever ago, and had kind of forgotten that I had done so when it finally rolled around. I guess I have conflicted feelings about the Obamas. I was an Obama champion from before he announced his candidacy for the presidency, and was really pretty overjoyed when he won not only the nomination but the presidency in 2008. Oh the promise he held. But he fell back down to earth, and there are things I resent about his presidency in hindsight. I think he had the financial industry by the throat and decided to dust them off and give them more than a helping hand, and that this has been bad for our present, and will be extremely bad in the not-remote future; I think he ended up wielding a hawkish foreign policy that was too cavalier about civilian deaths; I think his immigration policy was too aggressive and unremitting; and perhaps worst of all I think he is kind of a naif--about human nature, about how politics works, about America. And what are we to make of a Barack Obama presidency if it leads to Donald Trump's?But I guess I had never really thought too much about Michelle. I knew she was a Princeton and Harvard Law grad, and so I always thought she came from a tony background. But that is certainly not the case. She is a true American success story. And this book really shows her in a wonderful light. She is not a braggart, she is not maudlin. She just comes across as a truly humble but principled and hard-working person; she cares about her family and her causes, but disdains politics; and she adores Barack. She is injured by the racist and misogynistic things that people have said about her, but she is not shy about calling it like it is and saying she would not have been subject to such indignities if she were not a black woman. She does not devote her book to railing against Trump, but she does call him out as a bully, a racist, a misogynist, and someone whom she will never forgive for putting her family's safety at risk. That takes guts, and it is a notable deviation from what Barack can (or probably even would) do. And so I appreciated her candor and really grew to respect her--she embodies all of the hope we had about Barack's presidency, unblemished by the messy reality of it all.And this book is also amazing for providing insight into how lovely Barack seems as a person, the dignity and self-possession with which the First Family was required to carry itself, and the amazing journey they had throughout their eight years in the White House.

I followed Jia as she developed through stints at the Awl, the Hairpin, Jezebel, and finally the New Yorker, where she seems to have finally encountered an audience commensurate to her talents and the importance of the issues she grapples with.

It's odd enough to have someone describe the honeyed and cosseted life of your college experience to you, but it's even weirder to think ""I was at that Girl Talk show where you talk about doing MDMA for the first time"" and ""I know this person whose peacock wedding you're describing!""

But I have no desire to overstate (or state) a relationship for Goodreads cool points. Ultimately I didn't have any strong impression of her upon graduation other than that a lot of people I was (and am still) friends with thought she was next-level cool. It wasn't until a few years later that traces of the numinous mind we're more familiar with in 2019 began to surface. She had this amazing blog (which she has regrettably made private) where she would say brilliant, pithy, poignant, piercing things about books, people, the Peace Corps, etc. I read it assiduously, and kicked myself for not getting to know her in college; it turned me onto (among others) Winesburg, Ohio. At a certain point the blog dried up and I continue to mourn its loss, but Jia's writing continued to sharpen as it became better known on the aforementioned sites. I remember in particular one post about her sitting in a cafe in Central Asia, going to the bathroom, and coming back to realize that she had left her laptop out to be stolen, and with it the novel she had been working on (and had not saved to the cloud, or email, or whatever people were doing in the early aughts to save their work). I remember thinking what a shame it was that some person stole and probably destroyed this laptop for a few hundred bucks, considering the work of intelligence and insight and perspective it no doubt contained. But I also remember mourning as a reader who would never get a chance to read her thoughts in book form. So it was with nostalgic excitement that I picked up ""Trick Mirror,"" likely unimaginable at the time of the theft, and read Jia's first book. And it was just as entertaining, insightful, glancing, and tender as are the articles on which she built her reputation, and just as indicative of the thoughtfulness I've admired from afar, hopefully not too creepily, for the past decade....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Aug 11, 2019","Aug 16, 2019","Aug 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror

But I do resent that a generation that was given more than any other developed the most indulgent victim complex possible, ruining it for the rest of us in the process. The author suggests that younger generations' attitudes toward one's relationship to society betoken a less sociopathic mien, and that we might remake society in reaction to the atrocious histrionics, myopia, and selfishness of the Boomers.

I read ""Little Fires Everywhere"" with a great deal of anticipation, and although a lot of my friends loved it, I thought it was pretty uninteresting. I guess the writing and character development were OK, but the story did nothing for me. But I told a friend about this and he recommended her debut, which he said was shorter and better in many of the ways I described mattering to me. Cut to my new life in DC, and my adorable neighborhood is honeycombed with neighborhood ""lending libraries."" In my experience, these are either full of extremely esoteric (e.g., a T.C. Boyle book written in German) or specific (e.g., folk songs of the Arapaho tribe) books, neither of which I tend to liberate from their halfway homes. But you never know, and it makes an adventure of a stroll to be treasure-hunting, so I have been doing more peeking than usual. One that is close to my house is a particular trove: I've found Vonnegut, Amy Bloom, and a well loved copy of this book, so I pounced.Interestingly, I read most of it on a flight to Seattle, to attend the wedding of two dear friends. One of them is the middle daughter of a white-American/Chinese couple, raised in Ohio among high-achieving people, not unlike Lydia, the character whose death sets this story in motion. My friend Sarah couldn't possibly be described in most of the ways Lydia is described, but this book does tell a compelling narrative about teenage anxiety in high-achieving homes, and the degree to which society's retrograde feelings about race and gender operate to foil people's dreams.But this book is not--or not just--a particular slice of mixed-race Ohioan life. The universal theme that this book explores so well is the difficulty families have with honesty and openness, the misunderstanding that inevitably flows therefrom. Poorly written TV dramas (anything Sorkin, but others too) often employ this weird conceit: characters could easily clear up a lot of confusion and set things right by revealing their true motives and clarifying their thought processes, but instead they play the noble hero and the other person hates them only out of ignorance of their true nobility. It's very tired, but this book admirably avoids the trope, offering plausible and sympathetic reasons why we might occlude the truth....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 14, 2019","Jun 16, 2019","Jun 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18693763-everything-i-never-told-you

I can't give it five stars because c'mon: it's a book about usage, and fully 1/3 of it is devoted to humorous instructions that are nevertheless admonitions about how not to misspell and mix up words. Dreyer is as clever as he is imperious, officious and cocksure. To be certain, I was listening to this on audiobook, which can often feel like a one-way conversation, but one gets the impression that it would be no different--no less rapid-fire, no less officious, no less unidirectional--if he were to hold forth in person: lots of ""but you would never do that,"" and ""we needn't resolve that here; just say X."" To my great horror, I had been practicing any number of the faux pas he dispatches. But, for the most part, these rules appeared fit the contours of my orthodoxy, if not always my practice. Impressively, Dreyer avoids coming across as pretentious (for the most part), and dresses down many of the ""rules"" promulgated by pluralities of school teachers, mothers, and British.

It would be easy to say that this was Sunny--the diminutive and nasty Svengali-like boyfriend twice her age who co-ran Theranos for most of the period in question--but that's too simple an explanation, one that smacks of both sexism and racism, and couldn't explain everything. The interesting thing about this book is that we only hear from the people around Holmes, and not all of them have come forward. It's like piecing together the motivations of a mass shooter from the accounts of the survivors--we can have our suspicions and our theories of motivation, but we will never know the answer unless and until we hear from the perpetrator herself.Perhaps it's mostly/only because I am an attorney, but the end of the book struck me as a particularly unflattering portrayal of my profession. We are left to infer about Holmes' conduct and motivations, but there can be no question about the behavior of David Boies and his firm, and they behaved appallingly.

This book chronicles the administrative apparatus of the Holocaust, and spotlights Adolf Eichmann, the man responsible for ensuring that the Final Solution was a finely-tuned German machine. By exploring the ideas of guilt and agency in the Holocaust, that most horrific of circumstances, Arendt prefigured the experiments of Milgram, et al., who showed the disturbing propensity humans have for contributing toward the most ghastly of ends, so long as they are not the ones pulling the trigger. Arendt doesn't convincingly establish whether Eichmann felt real guilt about his role in the Holocaust--he admits it was a crime against humanity yet claimed that he had no agency to refuse to give the orders he gave, sending untold Jews to the gas chambers--but she does reveal him to be a slightly stupid, vain man, always in search of a soap box.Arendt also examines the role that Jews played in acquiescing to and even abetting their own destruction. Understandably, this is a controversial point, and one that she was savaged for making. But while it's important not to blame the Jews or any victims for the suffering to which they are subjected, the points Arendt raises are important for understanding how these massively bureaucratic atrocities are committed. Collective action problems are as old as humanity itself, and I would imagine the problems get worse in situations of mortal danger, but as Arendt points out, the survival rate of Jews who fled or went into hiding was remarkably higher than of those who went with the flow, hoping that obedience would save them, and the Jews who helped Nazis by turning over Jews and/or their property to the Nazis did not fare much better. Collective uprisings are always going to be hard, especially against knowledgable and cruel foes, but Arendt's chronicle shows that oppressed people might do better to establish resistance as the default, instead of an outlier option....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 28, 2019","Jun 02, 2019","May 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52090.Eichmann_in_Jerusalem

It's whimsical and Dickensian, in my mind--though I struggle to recall a character with this particular tic--with a whiff of Ignatius Reilly to it.Here, Ms. Jean Brodie, a petty schoolteacher with a yen for continental fascists shepherds a brood of young Scottish lassies through their school years. She emphasizes from the outset that she is in her prime years, and any doubt about her quality or fitness for the job is gainsaid by another, who reminds the doubter that Brodie is in her prime. It should be noted that Ms. Brodie's prime takes place in her late 50s, and her life is divided fairly plainly into two camps: during her prime and after her prime, when she has fallen into ruin. Her downfall is pretty satisfying, as the character--whether during or following her prime years--seems ignoble, clueless, and drawn to brownshirt tendencies.

Only by remembering Lucille and Buster Bluth's Oedipal hyjinks was this one made bearable.It starts out serviceable enough--a young woman from a comparatively higher station falls in love with a charismatic, working-class collier, the latter of whom turns out to be a sot with occasional violent tendencies. Some children are born and they factor into and influence these dynamics. As the kids age, it's not really clear who will be the main characters--the oldest child and consummate charmer ""William,"" the younger son ""Paul,"" the mother or the father. Paul, who apparently stands in for the author in this bildungsroman, starts out as a seemingly marginal character(view spoiler)[, only coming to prominence after William dies (hide spoiler)]. Eventually he becomes more prominent, and the father dries out a bit and fades into the background. So then it's just Paul, his on-again-off-again (and-on-again-and-off-again) girlfriends, and his mother for about 400 pages. The mother is clearly an imposing character with considerable sway over her son, but they're probably a bit too close for a healthy relationship. I think what made this book so excruciating was that they never really go into why they are so preternaturally close to begin with. There's just a lot of holding each other tenderly and saying things in triplicate (e.g. ""My son, my son, my son!""; ""My love, my love, my love"" “Muther, muther, muther”). Also, Paul goes from detesting to being absolutely in love with each of two women approximately 100 times throughout the book, and he never really tells us why he has such an extreme ambivalence nor meditates on his true feelings, he just goes from lustfully yearning for possession of these women to hating them, usually over a small slight or inoffensive comment. Totally unflattering, obnoxious, and infuriating to read over and over ad nauseam.

The fifth most powerful earthquake ever recorded killed a handful of people in seismically prepared Japan, but the water it dislodged wreaked unprecedented catastrophe, killing tens of thousands more. While many communities on the east coast of Japan were devastated, a particular rural community had an entire generation of its children wiped out in a tragedy this book attempts to encircle.

Most of the participants have young children, so I have to imagine this was a really difficult book for them, given how rough it was for me.

She's clearly wildly smart and has interesting things to say about society and capitalism and relationships and the environment, but I feel like the stories usually unravel, or fail to conclude in a satisfying manner.Doxology focuses on punk-adjacent New Yorker parents and their development from scrappy scene kids to unprepared parents to accidental millionaires, true Gen X success stories. Their daughter Flora is also portrayed in a way that brings the novel into the present, to the era of Trump and a DC that is turning into an unaffordable gentrified Disneyland. Heady to read while you're inhabiting it, to be sure. The first fifty pages of this made me smile despite myself, but the last 200-or-so pages of this felt like some tedious Ann Patchett, shot through every once in a while with morsels of razor sharp commentary.

In the book, we are privy to the goings on of wealthy Fifth Avenue types, centered on our protagonist Newland Archer, a jeunesse doree with more wealth than pedigree, though certainly not lacking in either. Wharton early on establishes the hierarchy, with the descendants of the patroons (in real life: Van Rennselaers) and planters (in real life: Randolphs) comprising the only real aristocracy in America, while the rest of them happily thicken society's broth as genteel parvenus, basking in the glow of their tenuous connections to Old Europe, with its more developed art scenes and social niceties. This framing is why I maintain that the book is less New York--which is really all about wealth, as the Vanderbilts would show the Astors, and as the Trumps would show us all--and more Boston, which has always been big on downplaying obscene wealth and esteeming lineage above all else.This book is charming for cataloguing the quirks and tendencies of what would come to evolve into a very rarefied set, but as it shifts to cataloguing a love affair lacking in much credibility, it grew less compelling.

There's a heady sense of entitlement to everything the American Dream promises: comfortable living earned through pluck and occasional effort, a pervasive expectation of safety (except for the occasional drunken scrape or tipsy car crash), a boorish and careless demeanor toward women and children, and an irresistible urge to smash up the pleasant life that centuries of capitalism and prosperity and patriarchy have conspired to render them. This last characteristic is particularly notable in books of this type, and is alluded to by the title of this book: an ancient Middle Eastern yarn about the ineluctable nature of death.Books like this prefigured Richard Yates and John Updike, John Cheever and ""Mad Men."" The ennui of the suburbs, the maddeningly destructive temporary reprieves of dark liquor and extramarital sex: it's all there, superficially familiar and genteel but rotting faithfully beneath the surface. Hemingway was already plumbing the last of the grand, noble battles of the century while these protagonists instead fought purposelessness and a sense of existential dread. It's depressing stuff, but I just can't get enough. While lustily reading the first few pages of this book I described its appeal to someone as ""exposing the American Dream as a fraud."" He called the idea passé, saying that only Republicans (or less malignant naifs) would believe in the sham. I can't dispute the assessment, really--this book was published more than fifty years before I was born, and I can't imagine it was breaking new ground even at the time.

As recently as this year, we saw people arguing in good (if benighted) faith that an algorithm cannot be racist or sexist because it is based on math. But Noble's experience and research showed that this is very demonstrably untrue: while searches for ""white girls"" bring up a sampling of mostly unoffensive images, the search for ""black girls"" brought up mostly porn until Google corrected the difference; typing in ""This English major taught herself calculus"" would draw Google's suggestion ""Did you mean 'This English major taught himself calculus'?"" and suggested autotext for black women is much more racist and sexist than the equivalents for white men or women. So much of the internet, functioning as it does as an aggregate, is assumed to be benign. But it doesn't take much critical thinking to understand that bigotry--being a thing that all societies share in varying degrees--will be instantiated by group behaviors, particularly when they are done anonymously, as is the case with most of our internet activity. Noble spends this book unpacking the ways in which we give the internet too much credit for neutrality, showing that inaction by sites like Google and Yelp has serious ramifications, and pointing out the ludicrousness of their claims that they are powerless to anticipate, prevent, or mitigate the harm that is caused by the reification of the bigotry that gets pumped out by their algorithms.This book is short and has the tone of a doctoral thesis.

It explores a lot of ideas that we reflexively reject, likely because they go against common sense. Ideas like ""just give poor people cash"" seem not only politically infeasible, but unwise. And sadly, our politics is dictated by soundbites and conventional wisdom, and we wonder why we only dig ourselves deeper into wealth inequality and dissatisfaction with government at all levels.This book explores concepts like universal basic income, open borders, and cash substitutes for our current forms of welfare/charity, in a way that makes me hopeful they might one day be implemented on a large scale, or at least experimented with. Not that ideas that make all the sense in the world for our peer countries have ever really prodded the United States into action--see, e.g., universal healthcare and noninterventionist military policy--but I might be able to dust off that Irish passport and decamp for one of the more enlightened countries once this one starts to really tear itself apart.Lest I leave it on that unsavory note, I wonder whether the silver lining from this Trump administration might just be that we are so screwed up or have such a political mandate that trying these things out becomes palatable, if not necessary. I just wonder why--when one political party is trying to drag us backward and the other one, overly proud of its respectability, insists on keeping us in stasis--there isn't more of a yen for something radical and outside the box. Here's hoping more of the 2020 candidates trade on the yen for something different and begin exploring these things through their platforms.

Dopesick explores the opioid epidemic where it has taken hold most relentlessly: the backwater towns of Appalachia that progress long ago abandoned. A lax regulatory structure, the opportunistic Sackler family, and a lack of economic opportunity set the stage for this exploration of a truly scary journey, one that seems essentially inescapable for those unlucky enough to have fallen into its clutches.The most galling thing about this book is that we seem to have a partial solution--MAT, or medication-assisted treatment, which makes use of less abusable opioids to wean you off of heroin or oxy without the dreaded ""dopesickness""--but that governmental regulators/funders are either too squeamish/sanctimonious about the idea of using drugs to conquer addiction or too cheap to understand the benefits of doing so. We have such an allergy to helping people in need in this country, particularly when their needs are ""untoward"" like drug addiction. A cynical part of me thought that maybe this might be different, given that white people are associated with the ravages of this drug, but even that doesn't seem the case.I am heartened that 2020 hopefuls such as Elizabeth Warren are making tackling the opioid epidemic a key part of their platforms. I hope that whoever wins in 2020 gives some relief to those suffering under the yoke of this addiction, whether that is in the form of MAT (and subsidizing things like transportation to clinics, childcare, etc. that otherwise prevent people, especially low-income people, from seeking treatment), job training, ""ban the box"" laws, or otherwise, unlike Trump, who paid lip service to the scourge only to engage in characteristic sloth and defund agencies that were marginally helping in the past.

Reading this, I started thinking about the Internet as the opposite of what we consider to be Society. I'm venturing beyond my pay grade here, but Society seems good for, perhaps above all else, suppressing your amygdala a bit and clamping down on those animal urges. It's a functional trade--we swap immediate gratification for safety and predictability, in an equilibrium that is always changing based on who is contributing and what they bring to the equation. Essential to the bargain is the idea that you will likely be punished for any transgression; even if it turns out that your darkest tendencies aren't very uncommon, it's just too risky to ventilate them. But not on the anonymous Internet. And Nagle paints the picture of the ghastliest, most macabre passel of ghoul-virgins you can imagine, marshaled by the likes of Milo Yiannopolous and his successors, inspired by Steve Bannon, and peopled by the faceless iconoclasts of 4chan. Nothing about their behavior is especially interesting or inspired—it's just transgression for transgression's sake, a mob of inattentive children having their fun with the god-mode of human interaction before it grows tedious, probably becoming libertarians if sufficient outside interaction and genetic luck speeds them to escape velocity, and becoming whiney incels (""involuntary celibates"") if not. I have nothing but contempt for these people, clinging to their white pride and cartoonish misogyny, and it's hard to miss how the validation of crassness and spleen have pitched into the dynamic that gave us the modern Republican Party, headed by the biggest ass to ever bray.Shortly after she chained herself to Twitter headquarters, I realized that I had, by pure chance, interacted with a pre-famous (and bottle blonde) Laura Loomer, heroine of sorts to this “movement,” when I went to the Women's March in early 2017. I told her (ignorantly but erroneously) that it was illegal for her to film me, and also that her MAGA hat sucked (accurately). She responded that once Trump was inaugurated, all of us ""beta males"" were going to find out what a real alpha can do. Well, Laura is back on her bullshit today and having some sort of lawn party on Nancy Pelosi's Napa estate, proving, ironically, that walls don't keep unwanted visitors out.

It started off pretty electric--the dialogue is taut and the foreshadowing is masterful. This book is very much in the sweet spot of influence, where its pungency and style are clearly echoed in the many other great and influential books that followed in its wake and emulated its affects. The writing is both belletristic and masterful--RPW is the only person to have won the Pulitzer in writing and in poetry, and the latter skill comes across in the narrative very clearly. He is an adept writer and has a way with a phrase.For all of its initial momentum, though, ""All the King's Men"" unraveled a bit across its deceptively short 440 pages. The quality of writing remained high, but RPW started interpolating stories and anecdotes of questionable use, and the careful unfolding of plot lines began to give way to a more relaxed, less engaging style. Also, for all of RPW's careful attention to detail, many of the plot twists began to feel contrived. This is perhaps apparent from the beginning, where the main character, a governor, and an influential judge all live on the same street, which furnishes about 80% of the main characters in this book. I'm not the most active reader, and so I rarely predict the direction of a plot, but I think I saw every twist and turn in this one long before it was explicitly broached in the text. I also would have loved more of the Boss and less of his henchman, our main character. The Boss is such a fascinating person, and the build-up to his governorship would have been a fascinating thing to gander at.But I'm glad I read it.

Far and away, aside from perhaps assassination, the easiest way to pretermit a presidency seems to be by ensuring that the guy doesn't get reelected. Aside from that, there's impeachment, which historians/constitutional scholars seem to agree is a political action and doesn't need to be grounded on any specific action, or the easier but less official practice of denying the agenda of any president and overriding his veto--in other words, using a supermajority of the legislature to replace the executive for most practical purposes, as was done when the impeachment of anti-Reconstruction Andrew Johnson failed to oust him from office.One point this book really emphasizes is that impeachment is not an absolute last measure, to be avoided except in the absolute worst circumstances. It was not intended to be ""the worst thing ever,"" or some sort of nuclear option. But I do think that's what we've come to regard it as. When Constitutional mechanisms are never exercised, they tend to acquire a totally unfounded patina of extremeness. For example, there are two ways to amend the Constitution--one is by amendment and one is by calling a constitutional convention; because we have literally never used the latter and only used the former, the latter seems more ""extreme,"" even if there's no evidence that the Founders thought of or intended for it to be that way. I found myself thinking a lot about the much-exalted ""wisdom"" of the Founders while reading this. There is ample evidence that the Founders thought the Constitution would and should be rewritten very often, and the fact that there were twelve amendments to it within its first fifteen years is testament to the intended mutability of the document. But the document itself and all of its internal mechanisms were promulgated with a lot of (flawed) assumptions in mind. The Founders, to their credit, really thought highly of the educated citizen. They were probably living in the apex of civic, democratic virtue over the past two millennia, so we can't really blame them, but they really thought that people were not very susceptible to manipulation or dishonest/corrupt politicians, and really approached the whole project of government with some pretty rosy opinions about how human nature operates and what people could be trusted to do. They also didn't anticipate the rise of political parties or the varieties of ""truth"" available to the modern citizen, and made few provisions for either in the workings of the Constitution. This oversight is particularly evident in the impeachment mechanism.Centuries later we have an executive whose power has mushroomed beyond the Founders' comprehension (the result of both Democratic and Republican administrations, it must be said). We have political partisanship that seems a far more powerful and consistent motivator than truth or the commonweal. And we have at least one party that understands that, in the short run at least, from a partisan point of view it's far better to have a flawed, corrupt, disgrace of a president of your own party than to admit fault and take responsibility for wrongdoing to ensure the preservation of non-partisan institutions/norms. This is why (I predict) Trump will never be impeached, and probably why no president ever will be impeached. Even in the very depths of Trump's popularity, I can't imagine him getting more than 2-5 GOP Senators to convict him, and that will never be enough to satisfy the Constitution's 2/3 requirement. I was speaking with a friend recently about Nixon. Analysis of Nixon is a surprisingly small portion of this book, but one thing is certain: Nixon could have destroyed the White House tapes, and he could have been more obstructive. He could have taken the Senate to the brink and seen what they might have done to him, even if they ultimately followed through with impeaching him (which I think they would have). He didn't, and this is because, for all of his flaws, Nixon had some small interest in institutional legitimacy and the preservation of the system above his own nearly limitless self-interest. My friend mused that if Nixon were more Trumpian, he never would have been impeached, and I think that also might be true. Certainly at the onset of the Watergate revelations Republicans treated all initial evidence with skepticism, using terms we are now supersaturated with, such as ""witch hunt"" and accusations of a partisan hack job. I guess it's possible--entertaining a different counterfactual--that if Nixon had had Mitch McConnell as his Senate Majority Leader, he would have doubled down and avoided impeachment, but we will never know. While we know that executive power has been growing exponentially and the Legislature is increasingly unwilling to use its powers to check a president, particularly when a majority has a president of its own party, what we haven't really been exposed to until recently are the ideas that a president is basically above the law. While impeachment is undeniably the method by which a president can be removed from power, if we all agree that a president is extremely unlikely to be impeached, whether they have a Democrat or a Republican Senate, then essentially the president is above the law. Even in the unlikely event that there is enough political will to prosecute the crime after the four- or eight-year term of a president, there really isn't anything that we can rely on to interrupt the presidency of someone whom we know or strongly suspect has committed serious crimes, even if those crimes were in service of installing him in the office in the first place. And this is the case even though the Vice President--in every conceivable scenario a person of the same party as the president--would be installed in his stead. This really points to a cult-of-personality model of democracy, a type of divine king whose powers are finite but whose impunity is anything but.

I think it was just on a bunch of ""Best of"" lists, and, frankly, I ignored it for some time because the title made me think that it was just another entry in the past year's canon of fish-fuck fiction. Not sure what the title is about--perhaps to his last days spent at Sea Ranch, CA?--but this book consisted of five disconnected, medium-length stories, seemingly set in inland locales. I liked some more than others--the Cass/rehab/epistolary story comes to mind, as does the story whose protagonist, oddly, shares my last name. Others were less compelling, but that's the nature of these collections, I suppose; in most cases, at least. Johnson is dead now, with this being his last work.

The Marshall Plan isn't of intrinsic interest for me, even as a former history major who focused on the post-WWII period in college. I think it was because I was interested in a pre-Nixon America that was more interested in magnanimity than gloating or retribution. Interestingly enough, the Marshall Plan was anything but magnanimous. I don't mean to imply that generosity is diminished for having elements of self-interest, but this book lays out just how aggressive the Marshall Plan was. The author presents America's two main objectives as: 1) making Europe into a self-sustaining marketplace for American goods, and turning war-ravaged Central Europe into an ideological and physical breakwater for the lumbering Soviet menace to the East. Whether America would have been stirred to its largess in the absence of these interests is left unanswered, but one gets the impression that America would not have given so readily to its Western European allies or the belligerents it helped vanquish without them. The Soviets knew what America was planning, and they were put in a tough situation: if they called out dollar diplomacy for what it was, they would risk looking unreasonable, cheap, and envious. Despite the objections that they couched in the contemporary vernacular of post-colonialism, the Marshall Plan is in many ways the precursor to the EU and NATO, the import and influence of which are in more doubt now than ever. Having finished this, my takeaway is not that the Marshall Plan is something we should pan or be ashamed of. But like so many of the complex phenomena that are glossed over in our civics texts, it should be viewed in its proper context. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 24, 2019","Mar 31, 2019","Dec 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35297577-the-marshall-plan

I think I leapt headlong into tWell, I finally finished this beast last night, and with it my sudden interest in anything and everything Vietnam War. I think I leapt headlong into the subject because I was convinced that this was where America started to get it really wrong--fighting colonialist wars, whose outcomes were manipulated by unscrupulous actors like Nixon and Kissinger; having the knowledge of the atrocities we were capable of but not holding ourselves accountable, because patriotism/tribalism wins out over the humanity of the brutalized other; the dawning feeling of vulnerability and decay that is still being exploited by demagogues to speed, rather than reverse, our decline.But I never really found that borne out. Not because Vietnam wasn't awful, but because I don't think it's really fair to the victims of a longer history to say we had some claim on moral probity before that. It's probably only white dudes like me who have the naiveté required to believe something as silly and demonstrably false as ""America got it right, mostly, until the 1960s!""But I do think that the fear of decline has a potentiating effect. Particularly because we now know that conservatism is so/primarily motivated by fear, this defeat by a militaristically primitive, poorer people really seems to have quickened the fear in the minds of a previously mostly inert group of middle Americans, fused with their contempt for hippy culture and women's lib, drug experimentation, etc. to prefigure the throbbing amygdala governing modern conservative hate/fear culture.

She breaks off the relationship perhaps a bit more hastily than she was ready for, and then decamps for Venice Beach, where the book does a decent job of sending up the Tinder dating lifestyle while making cheap sallies at SoCal culture, where everyone is a vapid, gluten-free, ultra-triggered navel-gazer. The book gets somewhat more serious when the big reveal occurs, which I won't spoil or mention here (I thought it was obvious from the cover alone, but YMMV). I liked the romance, and I thought some of the sex scenes were pretty steamy and well written. I also didn't really see the final twist coming, but it was a dark one. But I think what I'll remember this book most for was its absolutely absurd lines. On more than one occasion on an otherwise silent bus they caused me to exclaim, ""Are you kidding me?"" Upon reading one particularly piquant line, I had to look up the author, because it was so eye-roll-worthy that I was certain it was a man, probably some knockoff John Updike troglodyte. But no, the author appears female. I guess ladies be writin' cringeworthy lines, too! I didn't manage to record many of them, but this one might take the cake:""Like Claire, I too wanted a thousand cocks. Didn't we all just want a thousand hard cocks attached to the bodies of boys who have died for us, still warm, to plug our infinite holes?""Yep.

I actually remember three distinct moments: as a devotee of The Awl, I remember reading her I can't remember when I first heard of Patricia Lockwood. I actually remember three distinct moments: as a devotee of The Awl, I remember reading her ""Rape Joke"" several years back. I don't remember my thoughts on it but I do remember thinking it was good and it generating a lot of buzz and conversation. Years later I read about the concept for this book, which sounded gimmicky (this is a memoir of Lockwood and her family, headed by her father, who is a practicing Roman Catholic priest, owing to some weird loophole in church practice), but interesting. Then I came across her psychoanalysis and exegesis of the oeuvre of John Updike, titled ""Malfunctioning Sex Robot"" and was hooked. This paragraph in particular I think highlights Lockwood's incisive mind and brand of humor:When he is in flight you are glad to be alive. When he comes down wrong – which is often – you feel the sickening turn of an ankle, a real nausea. All the flaws that will become fatal later are present at the beginning. He has a three-panel cartoonist’s sense of plot. The dialogue is a weakness: in terms of pitch, it’s half a step sharp, too nervily and jumpily tuned to the tics and italics and slang of the era. And yes, there are his women. Janice is a grotesquerie with a watery drink in one hand and a face full of television static; her emotional needs are presented as a gaping, hungry and above all unseemly hole, surrounded by well-described hair. He paints and paints them, but the proportions are wrong. He is like a God who spends four hours on the shading on Eve’s upper lip, forgets to give her a clitoris, and then decides to rest on a Tuesday. In the scene where Janice drunkenly drowns the baby, it wasn’t the character I felt pity for but Updike, fumbling so clumsily to get inside her that in the end it’s his hands that get slippery, drop the baby.But it wasn't until I read the London Review of Books' John Updike sendup that I looked into what she had written and discovered she was responsible for all three works. Seeing that her only book--Priestdaddy--was already in print, I checked it out from the library and then promptly let the title expire, collecting but never cracking the book once. Fast forward a few months later and several friends on my book-oriented group-chat independently identified it as a laugh riot, so I put myself back in the library queue and waited it out. Friends, I have gone a long time without truly loving a book, with 2018 probably being the last time I really emphatically gave a book five stars. ""Priestdaddy"" looked to be a great candidate for breaking that streak: it's hilarious from the first few pages, particularly if you have parents who are both conventional and idiosyncratic, grew up Catholic, and have an appreciation for people's tics and quirks. This book starts out so very strong I didn't want to read it all at once, preferring to extend my enjoyment. But by the second half of the book, the pace and originality of the prose does slow a bit. Not enough to be unenjoyable, but it can feel like filler at times. Lockwood gets big points for the poetry of her prose, which is beautiful and wryly funny, often in the same paragraph (not an easy feat). But, sadly, the streak is not broken because the second half could not keep up the excellence of the first.Still--a book a heartily recommend.

What I wanted out of this book was an understanding of American chicanery and manipulation of public sentiment to prosecute this war that we never should have been involved with in the first place, and I'm not sure I got that. Not because it doesn't mention it--it does--but because it is weighed down by the myriad anecdotes of skirmishes, interpersonal dynamics, and day-by-day clashes that are of historical note but not something I am particularly interested in.One thing that struck me was that after My Lai, 69% of Americans excused the massacre, saying something like ""We can expect these things to happen in war."" The author, a Brit and certainly no American apologist, notes that the character of a civilization cannot be judged based on whether its soldiers commit atrocities, but by whether the populace countenances them in retrospect. Regardless of whether you credit that metric, the United States fails abjectly by either assessment. I'll be reading ""The Brightest Lie"" with my law school roommate next.

Perhaps it's because there's so much overlap between authors and professors, or because professors are kind of professional dilettantes, allowed if not expected to be learned on a narrow, esoteric subject, making the author's verisimilitude lift much more manageable when describing their days, thoughts, machinations. It often felt like ""Disgrace"" by Coetzee--our protagonist is also an academic lightweight afflicted by ennui who views women as masturbation devices. But the subject matter is very of the moment. France in the near future has split along ideological lines between an increasingly rockribbed hard right led by none other than Marine Le Pen, and a divided socialist left, increasingly split with a ""Muslim Party."" It's not always clear what positions this Muslim Party takes, other than ""distributivism"" (a kind of family-oriented ethos which sacrifices the bureaucracy and dispensable organs of government for what seems like a universal basic income and lots of private, religious subsidies aimed at accomplishing similar ends), but the leftists need these folks to hold off a menacing right, and make a seemingly shrewd devil's bargain with the eminently reasonable and respectable head of the Muslim Party: head of the Department of Education in exchange for a parliamentary majority.Well, education is apparently a big driver of culture in France, because soon everyone is wearing the hijjab and taking multiple wives. Saudi money lubricates the transition, and by 2022 the fashions of Paris are not too different from those of Tehran. Throughout the book we are confronted with this idea that Europe post rejection of Christianity is in suicidal decline, and rather than sundering it further as many on the right warn, the influx of immigrants from Muslim countries is the only thing that can rejuvenate France. The patriarchal, pro-masculine, pro-polygamy nature of Saudi Islam is the only thing that can rouse the West from its decadence, personified in the alcoholic, wayward Lothario narrator. It's hard to tell whether this is satire or admonition--perhaps that's what makes it good?--but I think I'm going to have to consult Lilla once again to determine my thoughts on this one......more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 04, 2018","Nov 07, 2018","Nov 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25322084-submission

Never straying too far from the data, the authors show that people were not really motivated by their concerns about their jobs or the state of their retirement accounts, but by their racist and xenophobic tendencies, as demonstrated by the high correlation between support for Trump and exhibitions of sexism, or beliefs such as ""black people could get ahead if they just put in the effort"" and ""immigrants are a drain on our society.""

But it is interesting to consider what it means for politics in a world where media is so important and race anxieties are fair game for major politicians to cultivate.

It ably conveys the horribly lonely and hopeless feeling of the young and beautiful and free dying too soon, the endlessly tragic fact that real people who had love and acceptance and happiness denied to them finally secured these things only for them to be sources of their untimely demises.It was hard to read at times, but I really liked this book a lot and definitely recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Dec 02, 2018","Dec 08, 2018","Oct 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36739329-the-great-believers

AdamIf you're interested in understanding how we got to the point where corporations have more say in our democracy than The People, look no further. Adam Winkler, a professor of law at UCLA, has written a corker. I might be biased as a history nerd/major and a lawyer, but I found this history--essentially of the idea of corporate personhood--to be fascinating and methodical. Winkler starts by explaining an alien if not absurd concept to the modern, unenlightened reader: corporations--which were designed to pool the resources and liabilities of many different people to accomplish very specific ends--were very rare at Common Law, required government permission to exist, and needed to have a function that was salutary to the commonweal to justify their exceptional rarity and special rights. Examples included funds to build canals, aqueducts, bridges, and universities. These corporations--including still extant institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth--existed at the pleasure of the state, and could have their charters revoked at any time for a number of reasons, at least under the British system. But, when in the early Nineteenth Century the state of New Hampshire tried to take control of a university within its borders to which its predecessor colony had granted a charter (through the British Crown), the Supreme Court issued a fateful decision. SCOTUS did not extend the British Crown's ability to disestablish a corporate charter to the successor state of New Hampshire, with the [i]ultra vires[/i] reasoning being that the state owed some deference to the people and property comprising the corporation, in this case Dartmouth College. Fatefully, corporate personhood gained a toehold in America, and through it--the world.Although corporations are not mentioned in the Constitution and there is reason to believe that the Founding Fathers were suspicious of their influence upon democracy, the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, sadly and ironically, was used to buoy the case for corporate personhood. Arguably the most important of all the amendments, the Fourteenth Amendment provides for many things--incorporation of many of the Bill of Rights amendments, citizenship for emancipated slaves, and equal protection under the laws of the country. It was a Reconstruction Amendment, and it's impossible to argue in good faith that its main object was not the extension of citizenship to all men (though, of course: the usual disclaimers about women and other groups not being ushered in as citizens after the Civil War). Intentions be damned, Winkler walks us through the shameful failure of the courts to actually protect Freedmen, juxtaposed by their zeal for using the Amendment to fashion newfound rights for corporations. This was aided by the outright lies of folks like Roscoe Conkling, who traded on his reputation and his role in drafting the Fourteenth Amendment (shrewdly, after all his fellow drafters were dead) to falsely state that among its main purposes was the protection of corporations. Well, the rest is history, and it's interesting history at that. There's no doubt that with a conservative lock on the Supreme Court and lower judiciaries over the next few decades, corporations will be empowered even more. Their speech rights are ascendant, and those of non-corporate individuals (also known as ""people"") are in decline. It's a sad state of affairs, but it's your duty as a citizen to know it and to rail against it if you find it unjust.

We all thThis was our recent book club pick, and a funny thing happened, somewhat without precedent: everyone agreed in their assessment of the book. We all thought it started out strong, had a cool concept, that it sputtered a bit toward the end but overall we enjoyed it. But then we spent most of the rest of the book club ragging on it for its weird inconsistencies and random plot elements. The power is a book about women developing electroconductive abilities and giving men some long overdue what-for. I could sit here and carp about the flatness of the characters or the laziness of certain details, but I think the most interesting thing to consider about this book is what underlies the actual power imbalance between men and women in our world. The conceit of this book is just one big thought experiment: what if the almost universal physical advantage that men have over women were reversed, instantaneously? Would the gynocracy that some (yours truly included) pine for at times be a more just, compassionate world, or just as depraved and cruel as the patriarchy we actually inhabit, just with different overladies? There was disagreement about whether the real dynamic was due entirely to differences in physical strength (as opposed to strength plus women's ability to gestate and birth children, or some innate differences between men and women, or some combination of these three factors), but I thought this book was most interesting for its exploration of what it might look like to ""reset"" a reality like that, and to explore what human beings--who seem to naturally fall into hierarchies of power--would do. The world we currently inhabit, to varying degrees, must be conceived of as a more genteel one than the ur-state, the proverbial caveman with his club, dragging his concubine to the cave for cave sex whenever he pleases by dint of his superior strength. Nowadays most men in even the most repressive societies don't go around raping every physically weaker woman they see, even if the percentage who do is disturbingly, unsettlingly high. And yet even in the safest and most modern of societies, the physical menace of men that many women feel--whether constantly or in certain situations--is very real and extremely disquieting. We often talk of the persistence of rape culture in acts of sexual violence and coercion, but it's a more difficult undertaking to untangle the ways in which a species has developed its norms and comportment around the predicate assumption of male recourse to violence. And The Power explores that first generation after such a ""reset."" I think it's a bit disappointing that the book almost entirely dispenses with the cultural apparatus of repression, which I assume would still weigh heavily on the actions of women, even if the physical dynamics were reversed. The book sticks mostly to the physical dynamic, but it was somewhat interesting to see that first generation flexing its muscles, or skeins, as it were. And in the end, the author's winking indications that power corrupts all humans in the same ways are clumsy and impossible to miss, a bit boring by the end, even. But this book sure is good for prompting discussion of these issues!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 16, 2018","Sep 20, 2018","Sep 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29751398-the-power

When life is annoying, or stressful, or seems pointless, the luxury of a drunken night of oblivion in bed alone can seem too decadent to resist; Moshfegh just experiments with that to the extreme, untethering her heroine from the constraints of societal norms and expectations to show what it would be like to just completely check out, to fully disconnect, to time warp, in effect.It's pretty dark territory at times, but the book ends on a somewhat uplifting note.

At first he just made a snide remark about my comment being Spiro Agnew-esque, and I rolled my eyes and snarked back. We got into a pretty heated back-and-forth, and I don't think it was either of our best sides on display. But, although I still don't love his Facebook comments, I have always admired how prolific and articulate and challenging his articles are. I recommend him to you!So I decided to look into his two books. I had read some negative s of this one, but I wanted to pick it up anyway. It's true that the first part is prettttty dry. There's a lot of very esoteric discussion of Hobbes and Montesquieu that I'm not sure I really absorbed or was what I came to this book for. But toward the end there is some provocative discussion of the workings of American government and pluralism and the negative aspects of things like separation of powers and civic society that I found interesting after a lifetime of having de Tocqueville crammed down my throat. I'll be reading his more recent book, ""The Reactionary Mind,"" but more for what I've read in his shorter-form writing than this work....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 21, 2018","Nov 21, 2018","Aug 21, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/364629.Fear

I'm very into old-timey, neo-Biblical writing styles, and Melville is about as baroque as it gets. So the writing was a thrill for me at the beginning. At times it was downright difficult to understand what was meant to be conveyed, but for the most part it was just a matter of acknowledging the idiosyncrasy. The story started out pretty great, too. I wanted the whole thing to be a bromantic romp between Ishmael and Queequeg. But the novel itself is oddly constructed. There are lengthy discursions on the nature of cetaceans, the color white, the various meats to be prized from cetacean corpses, etc. These discursions interrupt the plot of the novel in a way that is at times difficult to follow, and beggars the latter.

I'm not finished with ""July's People"" just yet but I have to imagine I will end up liking it better. This book felt too disconnected, too unresolved. It reminds me of the kind of book I hated to explicate in high school English class--there's so much ambiguity that almost any interpretation is credited, not unlike a horoscope. I just didn't enjoy it as a work of literature, not to say anything of the disturbing subject matter. The technical mastery is something to behold, but this was not a pleasant or compelling book, for me at least....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 03, 2018","Jul 05, 2018","Jun 15, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6192.Disgrace

I'm glad to have read this book because it was the only title I hadn't read, and also because lesbian literature is something I am realizing I'm woefully underexposed to.This roman à clef stars a bright young woman in provincial Florida with designs on greatness. Common as a feature in queer youth lit (e.g., ""The End of Eddy""), the protagonist nurtures her intelligence as an escape hatch from the conformity and stolidity of the repressive South. To the extent that she actually flaunted her homosexuality in the 1960s South, I give this woman massive props. The New York stuff was all pretty conventional, decrepit, 1970s NYC stuff. We all agreed that the book oversold people's sexual suggestiveness and made sex the focal (end?) point of most entanglements with people. But we also agreed that the author had a fun voice, a charming story, and spun and interesting tale.But seriously we polled the group on their knowledge of good lesbian fiction and most of us couldn't come up with more than one or two. My friend Alice recommended a lesbian steampunk novel called (exquisitely) ""Fingersmith,"" but that's about the extent of my knowledge.

Well, the truth is that we had him, and his name is Richard M. Nixon. Oozing with hatred, grievance, and tapped into the amygdalae of the discomfited white majorities in this country, Nixon inaugurated our present dynamic, where two sides of the aisle regard each other as a mortal threat to the Republic and all that is good, where truth and decency matter less than political tribalism, and where grievance and insecurity are weaponized to their fullest extent to scupper and roll back progress--Nixonland, as the author would have it.Not that we weren't riven by cultural fissures before this point, but we have had little hope of our better angels governing us in the time since due to his influence. It's remarkable that it could come out that a party's president rose to power and aimed to retain it by extending the war in Vietnam, killing scores of innocent Vietnamese and sacrificing thousands of American citizens for no lasting purpose. And it's amazing that fifty scant years since, the GOP has remained one of the two main political options in this country, not at all reconstructed but, if anything, more rock-ribbed and truculent than Nixon could ever have hoped for. Before Trump, the GOP had perhaps as strong a claim to being the party of Eisenhower, Bush I, and Teddy Roosevelt as it did to Goldwater and Nixon. Reagan and Bush II merged the two warring impulses in their administrations. But Trump is the latter camp's apotheosis. Doctrinaire know-nothing-ism, celebration of ignorance, validation and operationalization of all unearned grievance, greedy fingers ever picking at the scabs we so rarely form over our fissures and recriminations. Whether that has staying power in the long run is something I doubt less and less as the country continues to disappoint. But, taken in a moderately optimistic light, the lesson of Nixon is that eventually the charlatans and the liars get their comeuppance. As we head into midterms, as Mueller's investigation wraps, and as the Supreme Court is irretrievably politicized, this revealing quote from after Nixon's resignation will give me hope:""It’s a piece of cake until you get to the top,” [Nixon] mused with Ken Clawson. “Then you find you can’t stop playing the game the way you’ve always played it because it is part of you and you need it as much as you need an arm or a leg.” And here is the nub. “So you are lean and mean and resourceful and you continue to walk on the edge of the precipice because over the years you have become fascinated by how close you can walk without losing your balance.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 02, 2018","Jun 23, 2018","Jun 02, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2393575.Nixonland

Russia, purveyors of a negative-sum politics in which everyone is worse off for the untruths peddled and instability sown (but with Russia losing relatively less on both measures), is openly working to subvert the stability of regimes that have outmaneuvered it economically and politically.

I loI visited Stanford University for the first time in years this past summer, and saw that the author was giving a talk on this book at some point. I looked it up and it sounded interesting--why not find out more about this neoliberal impulse that benights those who have had power in Western and especially U.S. politics over the past 70 years? Overall this book was way above my pay grade, but I'll take a stab at summarizing it.This dense but expertly researched work traces the development of world economic orders from the Hapsburg Empire to the development of the World Trade Organization. Summed up succinctly, it discusses the emergence of neoliberal thought as the process of keeping capitalism safe from democracy. Following the twilight of colonial power, Western metropoles fought to preserve the economic inequities that characterized those relationships, using paternalistic language and coercive development aid and trade as a way of suggesting that the long subjugated and plundered peoples of the world were ""radical"" and ""disruptive"" for demanding fairly equitable redistributive equitable measures. Whether through severe sanctions imposed for the nationalization of rapacious extraction industries or their subtle but strong support for the apartheid regime in South Africa, these folks did not want anything to get in the way of free trade at the lowest prices possible, justice be damned. In addition to this backdrop of reaction to decolonization, Slobodian addresses the other supranational entities that have emerged in the last century, including the EU, that place markets beyond the power of national governments, while granting property rights to individuals outside of the citizenry. He argues that this has largely been a capitalist push, and has marginalized democracy in general and labor in particular as a consequence. Finally, he discusses the role of law in propitiating global capitalism, where ""laissez faire"" ironically required quite a robust set of rules and regulations as base assumptions. We tend to view the post-WWII period as one of great prosperity and cooperation, but this book has made me wonder who really benefits, and who loses out because of that cooperation. If our international systems provide more ballast for private interests than mechanisms for rights and equity redress, then how much pride should we be taking in them? I'm not hopeful that a truly equitable system of international economic redress would ever gain traction, but I hope it's at least possible for international legal systems to evolve in a way that they can resist the antidemocratic impulses that have characterized their development over the past century....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jun 17, 2018","Nov 07, 2018","May 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36738613-globalists

Dahl charts the relationship between confidence and groundedness and the potential for discomfort--which is of course at the heart of our need to call out every awkward, cringeworthy thing--and exhorts us to forgive ourselves more, embrace new things, and generally lean into the cringeworthiest parts of our lives for the positive good that can be wrung from the process.

Understanding that ""hate"" is too blunt and charged a term, this might describe a (mostly) passive, inhumane disinterest for one's fellow humans and citizens. In order to do this, you have to disregard their humanity: mostly this takes the form of ignoring their plight, but at times it calls on its sufferers to doubt the pain they express or the innocence they claim, to assume the best of their tormentors even against the weight of evidence.That is the context in which MLH wants us to examine the horrifying string of modern day lynchings of black folks in the United States. He inveighs against our wormy bromides--self-defense is only a concept for white people; freedom means freedom from consequence for acting out on racist impulses; ""broken windows,"" ""prosecutorial discretion,"" and ""stop and frisk"" are nominally neutral and rational policies that in practice allow cops, judges, and prosecutors to enforce a modern Jim Crow, etc.--and challenges us to care about the lives people like Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Sandra Bland led before they had their fatal run-ins with law enforcement. Chillingly, he asks us to ponder what their lives would have been like had they not lost their lives--would they have ended up caged and undignified in the penal system, anyway? Quarry for police and a begrudged burden for the government in their own country?This book focuses on the list of names that have become all too familiar, and traces it from the Stepfordy 1950s, when people were perhaps too insulated from the poor and people of other races to really understand how bad it was for people of color, to the 1990s and 2000s, where whites across the political spectrum disbelieved or downplayed the suffering of black people, claiming they were exaggerating, or presuming (as cognitive bias studies show is common) that the darker person was the aggressor, to the present day, when we have videorecordings of everything from unarmed black people being gunned down in broad daylight to cops planting weapons on the body or not bothering to call for medical intervention when the life of a person of color is in mortal danger. One would think that this would be enough for the doubting Thomases of the world, but it almost seems to have normalized these occurrences and exhausted their potential. If you care about the people victimized in this way, you're exasperated that the hecatomb of black bodies is not enough, and if you don't really care about the people being victimized, then no amount of frothy racial animus or unnecessary violence will convince you that this is something our country not only tolerates but actively promotes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 09, 2018","May 11, 2018","May 02, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27274349-nobody

It concludes by regretting the move away from local, civic organizations and toward elites, spokespersons, and fundraising organizations. The decline of the Elks and the rise of the ACLU and the NRA. It makes sense that this top-down type of advocacy style and looser affiliation makes people feel more suspicious of their lesser-known fellow Americans and more eager to consume their spleen about the other side. Far from offering a pollyannaish solution like ""let's go back to how it was"" (which it explicitly rejects on multiple occasions because, after all, ""how it was"" was only really great for middle- and upper-class white people, mostly straight, Christian, and male at that), Skocpol suggests we acknowledge the reality of the primacy of money to political and social organizing but incorporate more mobilization elements into such organizations. It got me thinking about the alienation people feel from politics, and how they are willing to give money to ""outsiders"" like Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump as their only meaningful form of participation in politics or protest against the established orders.

But that's better than the alternative, I suppose.Right before I started reading this, I resurrected this band that I like. As is my wont, I played only the songs that I like, and played the hell out of them. The band is The Antlers, and the songs were ""Putting the Dog to Sleep"", ""Shiva"", ""Two"", and ""Epilogue"".

Pretty emo, I admit, but it made for appropriate listening as I read this book about sisterly affection and suicide.""All My Puny Sorrows"" is the rare book about suicide that takes on the topic with a sense of lighthearted tenderness. The main dyad of the book is a pair of sisters who care for each other deeply. Despite their mutual affections the elder, more established sister is intent on killing herself, and the book centers on the younger sister's helplessness in the face of this massive and unimaginable burden.This book raises so many interesting, difficult, and important questions: Is suicide ever rational? Can success ever inoculate us from despair? Is ""life"" always better than the alternative, and who gets to make that decision? Can self-harm be rational? Are we obligated to live for others? When is it justified to curtail the autonomy of people for (what we perceive to be) their own benefit?But mostly I liked it for its tone. Despite the foregoing, it was lighthearted and effervescent, quirky and idiosyncratic and breezy.

It discusses the rhetorics of the era of FDR, when we worked together to build this country, and the era of Ronald Reagan, when the individual was the hero. Lilla seems to think we are at the cusp, perhaps in a palate-cleansing period, and won't say what he thinks is coming next. He certainly loathes Trump and understands him to be dangerous. But he warns us away from identity politics. It is not a winning strategy, we are told. We can be as woke as we like, but a predicate assumption to supporting any political position is the power to implement it, and on this front the Left in this country has been woefully, if not irretrievably outflanked.I'm not sure I join Lilla in his mocking denunciation of ""social justice warriors,"" and I wonder how he proposes that black people bring light to their brutalization by the state without saying something akin to ""Black Lives Matter,"" which Lilla derides as hopelessly counterproductive. But I do think the American Left needs to seriously rethink its rhetoric and strategy if it ever wants to regain power in this country. Sadly, Lilla doesn't really provide us with any answers--even the class-based call for unity he derides. Still, I think he's onto something that I've been seeing in the sharpest commentaries on the rise of the alt-right, white nationalism, and American anomie. Things are getting desperate and this could be progressivism's last best shot. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,"Apr 26, 2018Apr 26, 2018","Apr 26, 2018Apr 26, 2018","Apr 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34323539-the-once-and-future-liberal

It starts out talking about reactionaries in modern America and France, noting that they are the true radicals in society with their stated intentions to revert to eras we’ve decidedly moved on from. So far, so good.But then he veers off on a severe and lengthy tangent, talking about the foundational mythologies of Judaism and Christianity, Hegel, Heidegger, Nietzsche and St. Augustine. It’s really quite dense and esoteric stuff, at least for me. And it veered very far from the topic that drew me to the book in the first place, which was political reactionaryism. It returns to this topic, tantalizingly, after a discourse on popular literature’s role in stoking Islamophobia in France, but ends pretty abruptly after a brief rumination on the revanchist Catholic fantasies harbored by European hardline reactionaries. Disappointing!But I generally found Lilla so reasonable and compelling that it reminded me of my initial hesitancy to read his work, which was my only prior exposure to the author: this article, which was released only ten days following the 2016 Election and which I remember denouncing biliously in those miserable days of uncertainty and disbelief. So I went back and reread it, and in a different lens I found it, surprisingly, totally unobjectionable! I think I misread Lilla’s exhortations as normative, rather than strategic. He’s not saying that we need to actually cater to those “forgotten” working class whites with their racial anxieties, and to forget the more acute needs of disenfranchised peoples; rather, he is saying that any successful rhetoric will need to speak to an entire culture, an identity shared by all or most, and can do its bidding—however much it may diverge in reality from the message—once it has proven itself worthier at the polls.

He has contributed to the quixotic call for Democrats to pack the Supreme Court, a proposal that pretty much occupies the confluence of what's left of my propriety anxieties about orthodoxy and being a lawyer. And I think that would probably be the thing that is used to discredit Faris and his ilk--this talk of norms, as if they still exist or are things we should cherish while the party with marginal power and decades of popular vote losses runs roughshod over the political process. No, I don't think we should give norms any undue power when they are collapsing left and right, but nor do I think we should baldly manipulate things like the size of the Supreme Court--something that is technically legal and constitutional--or split California into six states (which would almost certainly never happen) just to shore up our systemic advantage, even if the authoritarian Right has been overcoming its toxicity through exploitation of intrinsic advantages rooted in the concerns of chattel slaveholders, or pulling bullshit like McConnell's theft of Merrick Garland's SCOTUS seat. But there's plenty in this book that we should absolutely adopt. And the absolute most important ones are statehood for Puerto Rico and Washington, DC. I'm sure that Republicans would throw a fit about these things, but the important thing to remember is that they are opportunistic liars who don't abide any prior norms or display any shame, so we should encourage their passage by whatever bare majority means we can to ensure that Democrats have power at the national level; this is, of course, what voters have indicated by their voting preferences every time since 1988 save for once (2004). There are interesting ideas about how to allocate popular votes, but they seem too complex and esoteric for the American people to sufficiently get behind. And there are valid, even nonpartisan ideas about Supreme Court placement and tenure that deserve to be talked about but that won't be, because of political entropy and the endless amount of bureaucracy that characterizes our federal system. Aside from the foregoing and the other impracticable ideas, this book lays out the systemic disadvantages plaguing Democrats and the inconsistency between the Founders' intentions and how things are playing out presently. Republicans have deftly exploited the system to shore up power despite demographics shifting away from their core constituency, namely people who want or would tolerate a white, Christian, ethnocentrist state. We should be just as ruthless, though practical and mindful of institutional legitimacy, and make sure that Puerto Rican and DC statehood get passed at the very next opportunity....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"May 09, 2018","May 20, 2018","Apr 12, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35757549-it-s-time-to-fight-dirty

I had no idea what I was getting into when I downloaded it other than that it was a book I'd seen people reading on the subway lately, a common barometer of mine that has introduced me to lighthearted authors like Maria Semple and Meg Wolitzer.

""The Rules"" to which the title refers are the norms and expectations that structure many of our lives, particularly those of us who know how lucky we have been. Go about a life sufficiently charmed and at a certain point, you will feel entitled to stability and happiness. Any setback or downturn is remediable with enough gumption and resources. The big inevitables--death, frailty, old age, of oneself, one's partner, one's family and friends--are all in the remote offing, and we assume that they will approach at a manageable and predictable clip. But of course it's not like that. Life is not an equation whereby enough effort, charm, and good intentions will produce satisfaction, security, and peace. If we're lucky, it may mostly resemble this function, but even the most propitious life is apt to be beset by unexpected calamities, catastrophes that sunder plans and spoil the collected efforts of our lives. This, more than anything else, was the terrible and important lesson of the book--that we may get lucky, but no chain of sensical events or good fortune is a reliable talisman against the cruel caprices of fate....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 10, 2018","Apr 11, 2018","Apr 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32572166-the-rules-do-not-apply

The train I take to work in the morning--a local--is often so crowded that even breaking out a book can be regarded as a solecism, and this morning was no exception. As the guy got off of the train, I stepped to the side to let off the departing passengers/avoid the stampede; he pointed to me and said ""That's a great book!"" and in my antisocial subway mode, channeling my most awkward teenaged version of me, I mustered an awkward ""Thanks!"" as if he had congratulated me for having written the book myself.That story isn't really too important or relevant (but #Brooklyn!), and I think the reason I tell it is because I have nothing more to say about the content of the book--it was pretty dry. The thesis seems to be that there is a qualitative difference that we often lose sight of between organizing (good!) and mobilizing (eh, fine). This seems right. The penultimate chapter, based on Make the Road--which is an awesome organization where many friends work--seems to emphasize that community is a much stronger driver of participation and turnout than political principle. But it's also so much harder to cultivate. Tough tradeoffs.

Perhaps it was a bit too dim by the point it was written--this was one of the many collections of facts, in addition to the lived experience of reality, that was as clarion as the calls come that Trump should never be given any sort of political power, bequeathed any dignity, or really kept out of jail for so long--but I think by that point everyone was so exhausted by the run up to the election and the constant spectacle of it all that I don't even remember this book being something of note.The first half was satisfying--it's a highlight reel of Trump's many, many failings, from the familial and personal up to the present, where they incorporate dealings with the mob, Russian gangsters, fabricated identities and sexual insecurities. The man is a pathetic slob, and he personifies the arrogant decline of the United States, and I even found it nice to be reminded in a succinct manner that my visceral odium for this man is justified. Unfortunately the foregoing does not fill a whole book, so there are some lengthy discourses on particular deals and moral failings that are frankly not that interesting or relevant.

Immerse yourself in it--invest your time, because it will try you at times--and you will come to know one of the numinous new lights of literature.Like 2666 (which I didn't love) and Underworld (which has some genuinely jawdropping passages and which I liked but ultimately left me feeling cold), ""A Brief History of Seven Killings"" is a masterwork of different voices, divergent perspectives, imbricated lives, and intertwined cultures; and unlike the two aforementioned tomes, this was a relentless joy. As a reader (listener), it can be difficult to follow, so one can only marvel at the beautiful galaxy brain its author must possess to be able to come up with a story so textured, involute, and entertaining. Spanning several decades, two countries, and told from the points of view of 15 wildly different people, ""A Brief History"" is loosely plotted around the attempted murder of Bob Marley, ""The Singer"" who rose to fame in internecine Kingston, Jamaica, at the end of the CIA's Cold War interest in the country and the beginning of the international crack cocaine and heroin corridor that ran through the island from Medellín, Colombia to America's bombed-out Northeast. As with the best of these sprawling epics, each character brings a unique perspective and charts an interesting path, perspectives that challenge the reader and paths that overlap cleverly. Laced throughout with a patois that starts annoying/inscrutable but ends up (view spoiler)[BUMBA RAS'CLOT (hide spoiler)] endearing, and more history than I thought I could be ignorant of: this is madcap, nonstop entertainment for 700 pages.

I think I would really like Tim Kreider.I really only stumbled upon him because of this NYT op-ed about the inevitability of Millennials replacing the current determined stagnancy with indignant energy. I liked the style of argument and the measures it took to qualify its approach and bias, the subtle humor peppered throughout. This book is a collection of essays, and it benefits from the same qualities. Kreider starts off with a lot of stories whose gist is basically: I'm a difficult person, I have issues in interpersonal relationships; witness my quirks and sympathize with my unreasonable interpretations of things! They were funny in a pretty unique way, but not laugh-out-loud funny. Just ""smirk"" funny. But I think what really sets this collection--and Kreider's writing--apart is how genuine and perceptive he is. He has really eloquent and tender thoughts on friendship, family, and deportment that I really enjoyed reading, and certainly related to. And far from being cheapened by the smirks that haunt the rest of his works, I think they are rather buttressed by them--the tender expression of compassion and vulnerability is that much more genuine when expressed by a jaundiced misanthrope with a dash of slightly addled joie de vivre.

I'm excited to  it.""New World, Inc."" tells the staccato history of England's colonization of the northern half of the New World. Despite the Pilgrim lore we've been fed throughout the 20th Century, the truth is much less vaunted--jealous of the Spaniards and without a route to Cathay (China), the Brits decamped for North America to enrich their realm. It was only after some ill-fated and mysterious fits and starts that the colonies took in the early 17th Century. It just so happens that one of those was the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock, and though they were outstripped in importance and success by their Boston neighbors the Puritans, some famous New England scion ascribed some lofty ideals to them that he hoped would be emulated by his latter-day contemporaries, and thus our dowdy forebears were ennobled and lionized as our spiritual exemplars. The authors of this text take issue with that characterization, given that it was really pretty baldfaced greed and adventurism that animated the first explorers, pillagers, and satraps of the New World. It was only after they had scoped out the fantastic loot to be had in America that they retconned the whole marauding experience as some sort of missionary sortie. I liked this book because it is loaded with trivia and lots of colorful additions to the motives and less famous explorers of the New World, I just am not sure the authors needed 300 pages to make this point. I also would have been interested in a bit of a deconstruction of the Pilgrim ideal in its actual historic context, as well as an examination of how the mercenary character the authors impute to the earliest settlers and founders of this country manifested itself in its early culture, customs, and laws.

At the time, ""Eat, Pray, Love"" was enjoying the éclat of ubiquity, and this bred a contemptuous and inevitable backlash. But people loved reading it! Or they were too afraid to miss out on the zeitgeist! Either way, how to read a book furtively in the era before the Kindle? Well, apparently people would either remove the book jacket or replace it with something higher brow--""Wolf Hall"" was a different thickness entirely and would never fool anyone, but surely there was a Didion or Ishiguro novel that wouldn't miss its book jacket.Well, that's how I felt about this book. I have to admit to being a huge Roth fan. And while I wouldn't defend the man as free of the misogynist taint, I think it's worth noting that (for me personally, at least), the men are almost always the villains of his stories and come off as most repellant, even if they're beastly to the women. But still, ""misogynist"" is kind of his reputation. And so even his most asexual book is going to carry some negative valence. But this is not just some book. This is Portnoy, which was first described to me, over a decade ago before I had never even heard of Roth, as ""A book about a Jewish guy who can't stop masturbating complaining to his psychiatrist.""Not an inaccurate description, and it surprises me that people continue to hold this book in high regard. I read this because a New Year's resolution this year is trying to finish all of the Modern Library's 100 Best Books of the 20th Century. This is Roth's only entry, which surprises me, given how much appreciation I have for ""American Pastoral,"" ""I Married a Communist,"" and ""The Plot Against America."" As always, I enjoyed the lush family dynamics that Roth portrayed. But I didn't care so much for the protagonist's dalliances with ""Monkey"" or any of the Mediterranean women he has shorter flings with. As in Season 5+ episodes of ""The Office"" or ""Modern Family,"" after a while the psychiatrist-as-audience conceit just became unrealistic. But maybe that's unfair; this was revolutionary when it came out, and this book has no doubt influenced everything from Frank and Estelle Costanza to the contemporary Netflix show ""Big Mouth."" But still, I found it got old after a bit, and this was fewer than 300 pages.One totally weird thing about this book was how many strange similarities there were with my own life. In his adult incarnation, Alexander Portnoy works at the very same city agency I do, doing exactly what I do, as a person within a few years of my age, and who used to work at the ACLU. There are other coincidences that are too bizarre and esoteric to mention, but it was weird reading.

Someone said that someone else who had been involved in the drafting had said, ""Don't LGBTQ people want gender and sex to be conflated?"" And without wading into the practical and theoretical morass of that debate, I'm glad we could laugh it off, because though I admire our unfortunately rare moments of solidarity and I hope for more allyship--surely there are few groups more heterogenous than the LGBTQ community! And that is only marginally less true of gay men, a group that has lots in common but, by virtue of our diaspora, so very much that sets our microunits apart from one another. So I had trouble with this book at times, because it treats gay men as if we fall into one to three archetypes for any given complex problem: things like emotional unavailability, disparities in sex drive, substance abuse, etc. etc. Worse still, the lawyer in me balks at any sufficiently squishy and unfounded bugbear like ""shame"" being the villain behind it all. I probably wouldn't even understand their source material, but I want citations, damnit! So I approached this book with skepticism. But it is possessed of quite a lot of wisdom, as well.

An inability to see the writing on the wall notwithstanding, Jaffe was chronicling the revival of leftist unrest in this country, using Occupy and groups like BLM and Our Walmart to highlight the discontent that various race, class, and working groups feel in an increasingly plutocratic and alienating regime. She does a good job, and she relates inspiring tales of struggle and uplift. But a lot of this book feels like she was recapping why things were so bad in the first place. Then when she gets to the ""Necessary Trouble"" piece--the part about resisting, undermining the empowered, using bold new strategies to assert primacy and personhood--it tends to be brief and clinical in her appraisal.

Sarah Schulman is an academic and a writer who was involved with the endlessly creative and transgressive ACT UP group in the 1980s, and she is unsparing in her critique of the sanitized, jejune New York we've inherited from those who perished in the chaos and despair of the plague decades prior. Schulman as much reminds as admonishes, telling us of all the warm souls and incandescent minds the world lost out on because of our sanctimony, or judgment, or indifference. Reading this, I was reminded of tales that my Jewish friends will tell of their grandmothers' non-sequitur lamentations over the loss of not just life but potential in the European Holocaust, something that we in younger generations can accept only because we have never inhabited a world where such horror was unthinkable. Such an incomprehensible, unconscionable loss. Everyone should read this book. Schulman could have just written a maudlin AIDS dirge, but while she honors AIDS' victims, she also challenges us to embrace and cultivate weirdness, difference, adversity, and discomfort. If there's one lesson to take from this book, it's that queerness is about breaking the paradigm, not working to fit within it. And in this unfortunate political moment where anthems are held in higher esteem than the lives of people of color, urban wealth inequality has reached cartoonish heights, and the child survivors of gun massacres are criticized for not sufficiently respecting the politicians who have failed them, I think the following is important to keep in mind: [W]e currently live with a stupefying cultural value that makes being uncomfortable something to be avoided at all costs. Even at the cost of living a false life at the expense of others in an unjust society. We have a concept of happiness that excludes asking uncomfortable questions and saying things that are true but which might make us and others uncomfortable. Being uncomfortable or asking others to be uncomfortable is practically considered antisocial because the revelation of truth is tremendously dangerous to supremacy.

It was pure exhilaration and never really let up.Have you ever known a wrestler? Or a super intense ballerina? I knew a few of each in college and high school, respectively. And there's a kind of terrifying singlemindedness about their pursuit, a deranged embrace of the things that the rest of us quail at, things like pain, mortification, humiliation, and physical endurance, and a monkish insulation from the things that motivate most of us--things like relationships, happiness, pleasure, and doing ""good enough."" But these folks are different, they drown everything else out, and their focus is incredible, if a bit terrifying. I regarded these people the way I view Ph. D candidates and marathon runners today: with certain awe, but not the least bit of envy. Because how can I envy them these rituals and abnegations that I can't imagine having the fortitude to endure, much less wanting to?Stephen is a college student with a single goal: to win the NCAA Division IV championship in his weight class in wrestling. He has such unmitigated tenacity that it makes the aforementioned ballerinas and college wrestlers of my youth look like layabout sluggards, and he has to navigate his way toward his goal despite the physical limits of his body, the freneticism and lurches of his addled brain, the ghosts of his past, the staccato relationships with the few people who get to know him, and the workaday interactions of the wholesome nowhere in which he lives. Having said all that, I doubt the previous paragraph would really make me want to read this book. College athletics? Toxic masculinity? Unreliable narrators? Yuck. But this is a livewire psychological thriller, scrawled in madcap red ink. It's so good that I missed my subway stop on more than one occasion because I was so enthralled. It's so good that I forced myself to read other, lesser books instead of this one, just to extend the pleasure of the experience. And it's a debut novel!

This book is another in the line of fear-mongering and anxiety-inducing books by prominent historians released in the uncertain times of Trump. For whatever reason this one was prominent in a lot of book stores and advertisements, so I thought I would give it a spin.It's not much different from the others, although it does a better job of ""both sides""-ing our current discord, assigning most but not all blame to Republicans, starting with Newt Gingrich and highlighting the perfidy of Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. In the inevitable ""Here's How to Fix It"" final chapter, the book gives a brief overview of the argument I favor: if Republicans keep transgressing norms, it might not be the wisest long-term plan for Democrats to fight back in kind. They make brief gestures to the unfortunate results that countries in other regions and times have earned, judging this to be an unwise approach. Unsatisfying, but I'll listen to what they advocate instead.Instead, they hope that American politicians on the right will stand up to demagogues, expel extremists from their ranks, find common cause with moderates, renounce white nationalism and xenophobia, and call out norm transgression from the bottom to the top. Hmmm. Not putting my money on that outcome. But fret not--there is another option! The American Right might eventually face a crisis so dire (e.g., a civil war or the rending of the country, like in Germany's case) that it will be forced to reconceptualize itself! Cool cool, let's wait until that happens. Surely we can trust this group of amoral sadists--who don't consider their unqualified supplication to a person as boorish and crass as Donald Trump a legitimate crisis--to know when they've gone too far and to suddenly develop a capacity for shame and introspection, we might just have to endure a little civil war or a dramatic destruction of our way of life to speed them there.No, I think we hit back twice as hard. Hopefully the Trump Era has taught those of us on the left and in the middle what is at stake and the passive era of our politics is on its way out. Putting hope in the Right's ability to see the errors of its ways is a fool's game, and after making the case for this for 200+ pages it's surprising to see these professors advocating otherwise....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 18, 2019","Mar 22, 2019","Feb 21, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35356384-how-democracies-die

I loved it.When I first heard about the concept I probably groaned. It made me think of this guy in our section in law school named ""Todd."" I liked Todd, but he harbored one of the strangest quirks I encountered in my law school cohort, a group deserving of its reputation for idiosyncrasy: he had a major chip on his shoulder about growing up without privilege, being rusticated, learning practical shit. The guy went to Michigan for undergrad so the pretense was of dubious merit from the get-go, but he always hastened to explain that college was a fish-out-of-water experience for him, so he was really out of his element in our fancy-pants, elitist, East Coast law school. Whenever we had a certain type of torts case where one of us city slickers would venture our ignorant opinion on the degree of danger one should expect when, say, driving a tractor or operating a saw, Todd would hold forth about the differences between various saw blades/tractors, brands, and their attendant dangers, in ways that were rarely relevant to the subject matter and mostly, I suspected, served to telegraph his uniquely pragmatic set of skills which sharply contrasted with all of our nebbishy backgrounds. It was a curious display in law school, widely regarded as one of the least practical pursuits known to man.One time, my roommate had Todd over and he was opining about something or other; in my memory he was rooting around in our refrigerator, explaining—unbidden—that where he came from, a single bottle of French’s yellow mustard was more than enough to get by, thank you very much. But that story is probably apocryphal. However, I do remember him at one point saying something like ""Well, you know my parents didn't have advanced degrees or go to fancy schools, unlike yours."" I was quick to inform Todd that in fact my parents went to unremarkable local colleges, and had nothing more advanced than BAs, and that this didn't exactly make me hardscrabble, either. An odd sense of parity destabilizing his worldview, I think he fumbled and muttered something like ""Well my parents didn't either... and my dad barely graduated!"" But I saw his pretense for what it was.And that's what I thought this book was going to be—a Mormon, female J.D. Vance, some person writing a book about the path slightly less taken, taking care to embellish the rough parts. But hoo boy, was I wrong. Idaho must be the most dangerous state in the union, particularly when you can't go to the hospital or use medicine for fear of falling in debt to the Illuminati. Westover's story weaves mortal danger, emotional manipulation, abuse, blind devotion, and cultish insularity into a tale that is nonstop fascinating. You never stop rooting for her, and you never stop being surprised by how irrationally and perfidiously her various family members behave. It's simply amazing what this person was able to accomplish from such stunted beginnings—a take she would hate, but I think is true, regardless—and to tell it in such a vivid, compelling manner is a treat to behold.

It's not really I read this because I was dragooned into leading the discussion for it in one of my book clubs, the octogenarian gay men's book club. It's not really called that but that is how it often feels, given that even 40-year-olds are treated like wee babes. Thanks to the MTA I arrived 45 minutes late, but we still had an interesting discussion. Edmund White is an older gay man, HIV+, and the very recent recipient of the PEN/Faulkner Award for American Fiction. He writes lucid, apollonian prose but seemingly without feeling or substance. It often felt like a slightly more modern, American Jean Genet, who out-smutted White but had a similar penchant for flitting between gritty sex and ultra-detailed, annoyingly Knausgaardian recollections. The main theme of this installment in the trilogy is that homosexuality is some curable distraction, where falling off the wagon involves a ton of anonymous, cruisy bathroom sex. White, for the most part, laments his disposition while only vaguely trying to ""address"" it: whether via his fraternity or amphetamine addled psychiatrist or dalliances with half-hearted beards. And it's not clear at the end whether he thinks being gay is something to be cured--he does attack the Russian ""Simon"" and he feels exhilarated by the eruption of Stonewall, but there's kind of a full measure of internalized homophobia and denial to undo here. So this is one conflicted man, and although I was growing a bit weary of the rococo prose without underlying plot development, I may read the third installment just for the sense of closure it might have an outside chance of bringing....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Feb 13, 2018","Feb 19, 2018","Feb 12, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/109726.The_Beautiful_Room_Is_Empty

It is loosely told through the ascendancy within white unity groupsThis book challenged me more than I thought it would, and it still has me reeling. It is loosely told through the ascendancy within white unity groups of a young man named Matthew Heimbach. As a youth, Matthew careened between leftist and authoritarian impulses, ending up with a strange salmagundi of beliefs, most of which are irrelevant to the object of this ethnography of white nationalists. The key thing to note about Matthew is that he believes people of similar races and ethnicities should keep to themselves to preserve their own interests. Absent from his faux-intellectual, faux-neutral worldview is a reckoning with the persuasive arguments that race is a social construction; or even if you can't accept that, he doesn't contend with the idea that ""race"" allows us to arrange people on a spectrum according to the prevalence of certain physical characteristics, but does not instruct us on how to delineate between them in any principled fashion, making it an eminently unwieldy and impractical classification system prone to amplifying the classifier’s own biases more than anything else. But I get the impression that Matthew would find these objections untroubling: people recognize their own and always have, just as they recognize outsiders, based on physical characteristics that we call ""race."" We can continue to poke holes in this logic, but as the bulk of the text points out, the ascendance of white nationalism is potentiated by their weaponization of feelings, not how well its worldview squares with facts or narratives grounded in logic or reality. I think I made peace with the feelings-over-facts idea once this book began to really make me think about and question the political dynamics in the United States at present. The arguments that racists make for why they should be able to have a “white-centric” political org./frat/advocacy group/history month/whatever are so tired and flimsy that I usually don't bother to continue to dialogue with people who clamor for this type of ""equality"" they insist that they lack, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Part of this is because you need a shared orientation toward facts and values if you are ever going to have an earnest, productive, good-faith debate with anyone. But, if I'm being honest, part of me registers such people as some combination of ""stupid,"" “gullible,” and ""bigoted,"" and thereby not worth the frustration. At first, then, Matthew Heimbach just annoyed me. He is a charismatic guy who rose to minor fame by starting the White Student Union at his Maryland college, whose main charge was patrolling the campus to protect white students from chimerical physical threats to which they were allegedly exposed. For a group that is constantly needling ""snowflakes"" for whining and imagining perils, this group sure can fabricate a threat. The author tells us all about Matthew's ""nuanced"" viewpoints--how he dislikes swastikas not only because they're bad optics, but also because they represent a hateful worldview, weighting both considerations equally. In Matthew's world, all races are equal; he just believes that they should be separate, yet tellingly, he rarely recoils when a comrade says the N-word or something virulently anti-Semitic, except insofar as it’s “bad optics” or “takes away from The Message.” And so we are often treated to absurd spectacles like Matthew at some rinkydink white pride rally that he organized, arguing with a hooded Klansman whom he himself invited that black people are entitled to just as much dignity as white people. Part of Matthew's zeal stems from his fear that demographic shift--the prediction that white people will be a minority in the United States in the next few decades--will cause people of color to treat whites horribly; after all, look how poorly whites treated black people when they were the minority, Matthew intones solemnly, relishing his iconoclastic position as the woke leader of the white nationalism movement. I can't argue with his evidence, but the fact that Matthew uses his charisma and intelligence to galvanize whites to unite for the purpose of separating from other races rather than to atone for our racist past and remediate present racism tells you most of what you need to know about Matthew Heimbach. But despite myself, one thing that I couldn't really dismiss about Matthew's ideology, something that every white nationalist in this book says--from the dress-up Nazis to the good ol’ boys who are in the Klan for the camaraderie, barbecue, and beer--is that white people don't have a group that they can affiliate with. Again, I am so used to these arguments by now that my response is calloused with dismissiveness. White people are the default ""in"" group in the United States, and they can feel comfortable wherever they go. They don't need ""their own"" TV shows, networks, or movies because everything is built to appeal to and seem normal to them. They don't need specialized lobbying groups because they are the first and often only group that any other major political power thinks about. Etc. Etc. Etc. Name any facet of society and it is geared toward white people and white culture.As I said, however, the “no one is looking out for us” lamentation is one that reoccurs multiple times throughout the book. And I think through sheer repetition the thought finally broke through my barriers and I began to wonder--is it a problem that white people do not have affiliative groups? Is part of this white nationalist resurgence borne of the vulnerability working class whites feel because their class interests have been steadily eroded while their anomie has exploded because they have fewer groups with which they can affiliate? These were uncomfortable questions, but they're ideas that I hope to investigate more, having read this book.The election of Donald Trump in 2016 set off a wave of our papers of record sortieing on Rust Belt redneck safaris, a trend that has not really abated in the period since. These arbiters of truth and cultural conversation use them to try to gain insight into the mindset of this group of people who went from mere rhetorical sop to political holy grail seemingly overnight: the “forgotten” white American. As someone who used to rage-read these things with embarrassing tenacity, I tended to focus on the hypocrisy of the articles' subjects, the disdain they have for the facts undergirding the promises made to dupe them, and the narratives told to cultivate their hate. To wit, there's a Politico longread about Johnstown, PA, a rusted-out opium den of a town in Pennsylvania's western backwater that talks about how everyone enthusiastically supported Trump but intended to hold him accountable if it turned out that his huckster guarantees of a resurgent steel and coal industry were hollow promises all along, as all and sundry had warned. The coda is as depressing as it is predictable--it turns out that no one in Johnstown really cares that Trump sold them a bill of goods. What matters is that Trump cared about them, and--despite Trump's fabulous promises to the contrary--it wasn't really like any one man could interrupt the forces that had been sapping the life and livelihood of such towns for decades, right? But when I first read the article, I couldn't do much more than curse to myself when I read that some people truly believed that Trump was the hardest working president they'd ever seen, not like that guy Obama, who only ever golfed (OF ALL FUCKING THINGS TO USE TO COMPARE TRUMP FAVORABLY TO OBAMA!). Ugh. Sometimes it just seems like American voters are racially-guided personifications of the Dunning-Kreuger effect and the more ignorant the society becomes, the more likely they are to vote enthusiastically against their class interests.But even in this debased, dystopian future we inhabit, there's a difference (albeit a vanishing one, perhaps) between voting Republican and joining the goddamn Klan. So why are so many seemingly normal Americans taking such an extraordinary leap into extremism and hate? I know I live in liberal, effete, ""out of touch"" Brooklyn--not ""real America""--but isn't the Klan sufficiently toxic that no one could be so thirsty for affiliation that they would think of joining it? I could have stopped there and dismissed these folks as, frankly: deplorables. But instead I considered whether I was underestimating the importance of something so simple as belonging to a group. Yes, it's true that every identity group has socially sanctioned affinity organizations except maybe white men. And it's also true that marginalized affinity groups exist in large part because powerful groups like whites and men (and white men especially) have historically excluded them from equal access to power. And in a world where logic was paramount this might be enough to convince disgruntled white men that they actually are in pretty good shape, on average, and certainly better than almost every single other race-gender group in the United States, even if there aren't a lot of groups like the National Association for the Advancement of White People out there, and only bigots and trolls bemoan that we lack a White History Month. But in a world where logic is paramount Donald Trump never gets close to the presidency, so it’s certainly not one we should hope for. As we said before--facts be damned, and feelings win the day. And despite the facts, the feelings are clear, and boy, do white people feel like they are being shafted.I should probably get around to my point. My concern is not that white people are actually suffering worse than other groups; in fact, I'm quite convinced of the opposite. My concern is that they feel that they are suffering worse than other groups, and they feel that they are being ignored, unlike other groups, and that this is the realpolitik of feelings that we have to contend with. My other concern is that affiliation is an important, underrated need for all people to have, more important than mere ""visibility"" or having your group be the norm. And if white people or white men--whom politeness and norms council against affiliating on these bases because of the terror they have unleashed through such associations in the past--are not allowed to affiliate, they are prone to manipulation by pernicious narratives such as those that they hear from conservative media. And I worry that that leads them to embrace and defend a leader like Donald Trump. As groups that advocated for minority or disempowered interests rose to fight for their rights in the 20th Century, the last respectable institution for white working-class people--unions--died an ignominious death, severing the last institution holding white middle class people--the largest voting bloc in the country--together. And so, as Brian Sims said: when you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression. But it's also true that when you don't have a group to organize you politically, to enforce norms at the granular level, to instruct you on which policies most benefit your own class interests, etc., you become less capable of knowing how to vote, or which party represents you, or what issues are actually important for your well-being as opposed to simply being the red meat of distractions. Instead, the political hucksters and anger merchants promise the ""good old” (read: white-dominated) days, when ""normal"" (white), ""hard-working"" (white) people (men) were much better off. And they ply their wares to a remarkably susceptible audience.But is this the only way it can go? Is there not a way to convince white, working-class people that their natural affinity group is in fact working-class people (of all races), and that the administration of Donald Trump is proof positive that the rich are vampiric overlords, bleeding them of their last remnant of vitality for personal gain and sport? For some reason--people blame the bootstraps/American Dream phenomenon--""soak the rich"" has never really succeeded as a political message in the United States. But perhaps in this time when the election of Trump is proof positive that political truths are in flux and ideas thought to be taboo can propel a candidate to the presidency, the Left needs to rethink its posture on the rich and the middle class in order to win back the bulky and influential working/middle-class white electorate....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 14, 2018","Mar 21, 2018","Feb 12, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/35959824-everything-you-love-will-burn

As with most first-time authors I read, I tried to find out a bit more about Francisco Cantú. Aside from seeing that he is quite a handsome, mustachioed young man, the first hits were all about protests of his book readings, claiming that this book was a vehicle for glorifying the work of the agents and expiating their sins. Thirty pages in, I was pretty sympathetic toward him--it's that moderate lizard brain that I have that makes me instinctively suspicious of hyper-liberal critiques, even if I eventually end up adopting them through experience and reason in most cases. But then we got to the point where the author talked about slashing the water supplies that the migrants and coyotes store in hidden caches in the unforgiving desert, and I thought: ""Man, fuck these self-justifying, soulless assholes.""I'm glad I finished, though. Without spoiling it (I hope), the author grows weary and sick of the work that he's doing, the toll it extracts from well-meaning, decent people, and the violence and ill-gotten wealth it perpetuates despite itself. The story of Jose is particularly compelling, especially the final chapter in his words.I've spent some time in Mexico, and more still with Mexican immigrants just trying to get by in places like Virginia and California. Even if we leave aside the fact that we stole a good 40% of what was Mexico under completely illegitimate pretenses; even if we expose the racism of Americans' unprincipled disparity in attitude toward white vs. brown immigrants; even if we ignore the benefits we all reap from cheap farm labor, despite the dangers the workers endure crossing the border and the hardships they face working the fields without legal protections; even if we forget that Mexico has been a stalwart ally despite our racism and plunder, coming to our aid in WWI, after 9/11 and natural disasters, etc. after all of the times we've spat in their faces; even if we ignore that it is our drug policies that have led to so much violence and devastation in Mexico, and our free trade policies that have decimated opportunities among a traditionally agrarian people; even if we put aside that the danger and uncertainty one faces and the courage one needs to cross the border to come to this country to provide for their family is worth ten times the arbitrary birthright that xenophobic Americans draw on to legitimate their hate against these people; even if we ignore all of the foregoing, I just can't ever forget what nice, humble, welcoming people Mexicans are, and I think that this single factor governs my sympathy more than anything else. It's heartrending stuff to read about their bad luck and persecution in this book, but everyone should read it so that we understand the stakes, and the quality people we are kicking out of this country for formalist reasons that defy common sense and basic decency. Unfortunately, in the short term it's only going to get worse for them.

I wasn't counting on this to be one of those books, but at times it very much felt like one. It's hard to view America any other way after reading ""The election of Donald Trump confirmed everything I knew about my country and none of what I could accept.""In this book TNC reproduces eight of his seminal articles devoted to race and politics and reframes them in retrospect. Coates meditates on the precision and art of language, the meaning of America, and the myths and delusions about race that we refuse to destabilize or contend with. As a white American, it's hard to read at times. Not because of some wounded pride or #notallwhitemen mentality, but because so much of everything that I don't think critically about or don't spend my days fighting--things that I benefit from, things that I believe in--is part of a giant, destructive hoax perpetrated on people of color in this country. The work that must be done is staggering. I don't have a lot of faith that we Americans will ever give reconciliation/Reconstruction/reparations an honest go, or that it would even matter if we did--the manipulators in this country are too adept, the human mind too predisposed to tribalism and rationalization of the status quo to ever do the work to understand and remediate the injustices we have wrought and continue to perpetuate as a country. But I do think that if more people read books like this we'd at least be in a more favorable position to try.ETA: one other thing this book does a great job of is pointing to the many ways in which journalists have cratered as moral tribunes in the age of Trump. Even our most esteemed writers will tie themselves in knots to find ways to wash the charge of racism from the movement that produced a Trump presidency. TNC's point is not that white working class people should be ignored, but that racism was either a motivating factor for a large proportion of white Trump voters, or at least something they thought was tolerable in furtherance of other fanciful hopes. If economic marginalization was really the motivating factor, then black and brown people would have been driven to populist camps for generations, and the single most likely indicator that someone was a Trump voter would not have been whether they thought Obama was a citizen.

Kirsten Gillibrand? *Sigh* Look, the Republicans are a bunch of misogynist moral hypocrites. We all know this, even as the party that fights harder for women's rights and more accountability for abusers suffers the penalties of its scruples. But do Al Franken's churlish acts--all of which occurred before he was a Senator--justify not only his resignation as a powerful and compelling United States Senator and champion of women, but also the unforced error of having to run another election in 2018, when control of the Senate could alter reproductive freedom for a generation? I really don't think so. We have an accused rapist in the Oval Office, and a party full of doubters of victims of sexual harassment and assault controlling both branches of Congress. I like to think that if the Dems were faced with losing the Senate or Presidency because they had to support a credibly accused serial sexual assaulter, they would choose integrity over expediency, as the Republicans have so cravenly failed to do. But the Democrats were not faced with that decision in Franken's case--his behavior was regrettable but it came from before he was in the Senate and at a time when mores about making light of sexism were behind the times for everyone. So the only way Franken's decision can be rationalized is as a reprieve from the distraction that bad-faith actors propounded, and would have continued to harp on even as they do nothing to probe the moral horror presented by their own party's president. I just hope that we remember that Franken is a good man who understands how these things work, which is why he resigned, despite massive popularity and strong progressive (and pro-women!) bona fides.

The straightman in the joke says something like ""Libraries For my penultimate status update on this book, I adapted one of my favorite Simpsons gags. The straightman in the joke says something like ""Libraries are wonderful! See, even Cletus uses the books here."" Cletus then takes a turtle out of his coveralls and lifts Leon Uris's ""Trinity"" (incidentally, where my name comes from) above his head and attempts to crack open the turtle for some good eatin'. Uris' novels were popular but not exactly highbrow and certainly not economical fiction. Aside from the joke at Cletus' expense, I always thought there was a bit of the wry implication that books the size of which he usually produces are more notable for their abundant content than their brilliance. Thus, we find the longwinded Chernow (although in my version of the joke, I misidentified him as David McCullough, though I feel like this is a pretty reasonable misidentification on my part), of whom I suspect saying the same puts me in the minority of Americans. This is a lengthy tome, and I kept notes on my thoughts, intending to write a lengthy  critiquing it. But I just can't bring myself to do that on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The truth is that I didn't love the first half of this book, devoted to the tedium of the Civil War and Grant's role in winning it militarily. It is pretty amazing that Grant was basically a failed businessman with few prospects into his mid-thirties, and his fine command of the armed forces really changed his lot late in life. But aside from that, it felt repetitive and overindulgent with factoids. I liked the presidential years and the nifty world tour he took thereafter much more so than I did learning about his childhood and his role in the war, but it still felt like I was just finishing this because I had invested so much time into it already. Chernow perseverates about how uncorrupt Grant was, instead characterizing him as bumbling and trusting; it's not clear to me what difference this makes given the frequency and magnitude of the times Grant was duped, but the author sure takes up the mantle of exonerating him. Sadly, I think the book undersells Grant's role in two of our greatest national tragedies, the destruction of the way of life of Native Americans and the failure to vigorously uphold Reconstruction. We think of Lincoln as the founder of the Republican Party, and as the man who freed the slaves. We tend to elevate him as the personification of liberty and the anti-slavery crusade. But Lincoln's views were not especially radical or inspired by virtue so much as expediency, and it's one thing to free the slaves, but the decisions that came after about how to expiate the sin of slavery are the ones of most import. Grant, as the first elected president following Lincoln, really held the reigns for that task, and although he can't be fully faulted, we all know what happened. Chernow blames the indignant Ku Kluxing South, unscrupulous media men who used whiffs of Grant's many scandals to try to undermine support for the president, and thus Reconstruction, and insists that Grant was a stalwart supporter of the freedman. But, having heard his evidence, I find that interpretation of history beggared by the facts. Grant calculated just as much as Lincoln, and at a certain point it just seemed like the tantrums thrown by the South were too irritating and uncontroversial for the Republican Party to keep fighting or provoking. To reconstruct an enslaved race was always going to be harder than the war fought to make such an undertaking possible, but Republicans and Northern whites soon began to wonder whether ""all this trouble"" was really worth it. Hadn't the country been disrupted enough? Hadn't we given the African race the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments? What more could they expect? Or so the arguments started to go. And we see Grant swayed by these argument in, for instance, his refusal to remediate Southern uprisings and violations of freedmen's civil rights because Republicans in Ohio claimed that their election prospects would accordingly dim. The rest is history, as they say, and historians such as Chernow can easily lapse into centrism, rehabilitation, and teleological thinking. That may have happened here, it's difficult to say. But my scruples about letting Grant off the hook too easily and Chernow's biases aside, this is an incredibly important moment in American history, and for that other readers might partially enjoy this book for the same reason I did....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 15, 2018","Apr 20, 2018","Jan 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34237826-grant

In a scant 200ish pages, Rothstein bludgeons you with anecdote after anecdote of federal, state, and local officials or policies that disrupted working and middle class white and black Americans' attempts to live in integrated environments, and presents devastating evidence of the wealth gap that has opened between the races in large part because of this government-designed segregation. Whether through evictions, police refusals to protect the homes of African Americans in white neighborhoods from marauding gangs, VA refusals to grant mortgages to black GIs unless they bought in black neighborhoods, or cities' deliberate attempts to maintain the complexions of all-white and all-black neighborhoods while destroying most integrated ones, all levels of government were complicit in the 150+ year long effort to preserve the badges and incidents of slavery and to ensure that blacks remained a separate and distinctly lower class than whites. Sadly, it seems that these are things that are too shameful to admit to ourselves. They cloud our rosy myth of a just, egalitarian, and meritocratic society, and they're too complex to compress into a neat argument in a culture governed by soundbyte discourse. How we could right this wrong is a complex and interesting question, but it's not clear that we possess the understanding and empathy to decide that housing segregation is something that even needs to be redressed. But this is hardly unique: slavery is not particularly complex, nor is substandard schooling post-Brown v. Board, yet none of it registers in the mind of the average American as something deserving of reparations. But the dollar figures that Rothstein presents--the degree to which the government has forced black people in particular into communities where their ability to generate wealth then turns nugatory--are hard to argue with, and the causality is so recent that there are people alive today who were born into integrated communities with which the assorted governments of this country had not yet had the chance to meddle. All of this makes Rothstein's proposed solutions at the end of this study that much more crucial and interesting--chimerical though they may be.When I got back from my vacation this weekend I showed some of the pages of this book to our deputy commissioner, who is currently suing at least one residential community that was explicitly founded for whites, aided by the government in this mission, and forcibly exclusionary of black tenants. We are trying to hold them accountable for far more recent transgressions, but all with the aim of achieving a more equitable society by redressing past wrongs.

But I also have the capacity for reform, if I am sufficiently jarred. I think it was Kanye (thanks, Ye?) tweeting about god knows what nonsense that got me to kick my compulsive Twitter habit, and more recently with all that's been going on in Gaza I have stopped checking the Facebook for reliably horrible hot takes from people whom I'm connected with. And I gave up on reading post-mortems of the 2016 Election because it's just too horrible to relive and we've got enough horror to live through in the present. So just what the hell was I doing reading this potboiler after making such healthy decisions? you might be asking yourself.Well I don't have a great excuse, but I'm very glad I did read this. When this book came out, I remember reading about what an unreliable hack the author was, an assessment that came even from disinterested parties and people on the Left. And the media was mostly focused on the constant ratfucking that goes on in the Trump White House, which was not that surprising (or interesting, really), given how horrible and unqualified and thin-skinned this passel of idiots seems to be. But I think I was running low on books and this was about to expire, so, I figured: why not give it a whirl?I'm glad I did! I still don't find the backbiting to be particularly interesting, though whether it's credible is a different judgment. What I found most engaging was just how deluded these people are, though it's not hard to believe given how truly divorced from reality you have to be to even step foot into that White House at any level and expect any modicum of success or admiration, from the President on down. This White House is a living embodiment of the Dunning-Kreuger effect, of detached, base narcissism the likes of which is pretty amazing to witness. Jared and Ivanka REALLY do think that they can reign in Trump's and the alt-right's impulses! Trump really doesn't think he's treated fairly or acts objectionably! Jared really does think that bringing peace to the Middle East is as easy as having Saudi Arabia and Egypt ally with Israel (!?!?!?) to take out Iran, and then... peace and prosperity will somehow ensue? Ivanka actually believes that she will be the first female POTUS! It's just so amazing, claw-your-eyes-out preposterously stupid. And yet, this is our reality. I will combust in an eternal flame of schadenfreude when this White House is sundered by impeachment, forced retirement, or, ideally: resounding defeat in 2020.Perhaps the most striking thing about this book (hopefully a sign that it's heavily embellished and fabricated? Though I honestly didn't get that impression) was that I came away liking, of all addled-masses-of-cirrhosis-bad-hair-and-tonsilloliths--Steve Bannon! I still think he's a ridiculous pseudo-intellect who makes unwarranted connections between ""dad history"" and present events, but he came across, in the acme of irony, as the most sober person in the room on most occasions. Trump fires Comey and he excoriates ""the geniuses"" (Jared and Ivanka), foretells the passion of Hope Hicks, and decides that Trump is, at most, a one-term president. For all of his supposed wisdom it's hard to sympathize, given how obvious it was to anyone that Trump is too unreliable and broken to be the figurehead for any principled movement. But Bannon has a lot of funny zingers and really has contempt for most of the loathsome people in the White House, including (one gets the impression) Trump himself. Bannon has been out of the spotlight lately, and it's not clear if that's calculated or an unintended consequence of his fall from grace, post-Charlottesville, which is about the point at which this book concludes. The book's final sentence made me laugh out loud, however, because it was so ridiculous, on-point, and *sigh* probably prophetic. Bannon was holding forth on the front steps of his DC redoubt, speaking to the author about how Trump had lost his way, had probably blown up his presidency with all of his dunderheaded mistakes, and how Bannon, having retained the Breitbart crowd and never having lost the faith or patronage of the shadowy Mercers would actually be running for president, in 2020, which he predicted he would win. The final words of the book are his: ""It's going to be wild as shit.""

I feel like the country could possibly recover from the latter, but I'm really not sure about the former. This says a lot about the character of the Court in modern times--its politicization, the wisdom of having life tenure, the desecration of Gorsuch's confirmation, and not a small bit about how lucky we are to have such a brilliant, pioneering, charming person anchoring the liberal wing of the Constitution. But let's focus on her life and not her death, shall we?This book isn't the biography I had hoped for: it's a pastiche of opinions, speeches, op-eds, and a smattering of life details, not really in the proportions I wanted. But it's probably the easiest way to slap together a biography-manque when your cultural profile is at its zenith. Ruth is a champion of women, and she has shaped all of our lives thereby. But she shaped mine in a special way. My first job after law school was at the Women's Rights Project of the ACLU, which she founded way back when. The Women's Rights Project still exists, and my fellowship allowed me to fight discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace (and men! Side note: RBG had the amazing foresight to understand that women won't be equal in the workplace or society until we stop seeing pregnancy/reproductive discrimination as a ""women's issue"" and sought to represent men/fathers thereby. Notably, she is very good about attributing political victories and changes in opinion to women and men. I think this is important, not because men deserve to be thanked in the same breath as women but because men's egos--especially those of allies!--are often quite fragile and it's easier to laud than worry about salving a spurned ego). Impact litigation wasn't for me, but I admire and respect the hell out of what they do there, and while I was reading this I even referred a client there who had been fired the day after announcing a pregnancy--this is still happening in 2018 in California, so one not only wonders how much further we have to go, but where we might be without the trailblazing of incomparable warriors like RBG.Aside from her raw, awesome intelligence, what comes across so clearly in this book is RBG's humanity. She seems like a genuinely kind person, thankful for her blessings and still passionate about the people on behalf of whom she takes up legal battles. I wish I possessed her hope that recent disturbing judicial trends were just blips, or that the Court can remain a bulwark against the political pathologies of the Executive and Legislative branches... but as long as she's alive there's hope!...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jan 07, 2018","Jan 10, 2018","Jan 07, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29868604-my-own-words

I never knew what an imperialist power the U.S. had been, nor how universally meddlesome it had been in the affairs of the (non-white) countries of this hemisphere. In American public school we're taught that the Monroe Doctrine is almost an act of gallantry--a clarion call to the privative nations of Old Europe that meddling in the affairs of free people is a thing that would no longer be countenanced by the United States, the first nation to break those shackles. But, as we all know, that story is a bit too cute and oversimplified. The United States held itself out as a benevolent big brother type in the hemisphere, but really it just used its privileged position and burgeoning might to siphon off what Europe had been doing to line its own coffers since the 1500s. I liked this book, but it felt repetitive and could have been trimmed. Books like this one expose these truths, though often they run to tedium.

Listening to LCD Soundsystem and The Knife's ""Heartbeat"" on repeat, not quite understanding how this city operated but knowing that I was in over my head and that ""jaded"" was a pretty safe default disposition despite being a 22 year old who spent most of my life in the jejune suburbs. This book made me salivate, between its fruits de mer towers, escarole salads, and blue steaks. I've never had much of a palate (nose?) for coke, but I very much envied the drinks this kid got to drink: the endless Viogniers, Pouilly Fuisses, Sancerres, the Macallan 18s, the negronis and the Côtes du Rhône. My god!But aside from the tantric degustation, I think what I enjoyed most about this book was that the main character was not an ingenue. She's a bit green, sure, but mostly as to New York City. Not as to love, men, success, work, older women, etc. The book doesn't end in the trite way I feared it would, and the drama--albeit hardly representative of what I understand restaurant culture to consist of--is interesting and sprightly plotted.

He's also a pundit of sorts, and a professor at the London School of Economics, where my best friend from college also teaches. I went to visit her in London in January and almost got to meet him, but the timing didn't work out. Regardless, he covers authoritarian rule in the modern age and warns of Trump's worryingly authoritarian inclinations. This book is short but very thorough. Klaas catalogues the characteristics and tendencies of the authoritarian ruler through historical example, and describes the method of the autocrat's actions. For each tendency he notes, he articulates the ways in which Donald Trump has exhibited the behavior. The cumulative effect is disturbing.But ultimately, and for the same reason that we all haven't scrambled for Canada, we know that Trump is not going to achieve autocracy in the United States. And this is for no other reason than that he is an incompetent fool. It's unnerving to note how little resistance a competent, determined Trump would find if he were to try to subvert our form of government, but for the time being we can be glad of small but important favors. And Klaas notes the differences. Although he makes frequent comparisons between Trump and Hitler and Stalin and Amin, he is scrupulous about always pulling back and clarifying that Trump is really not in the same league as these folks, they just exhibit the same tendencies. What Klaas really does a fine job of is enumerating the ways in which our norms are being eroded, and how that primes the system for takeover by a competent Trump (""Trump 2.0"") going forward. The Founding Fathers were convinced that democracy was a struggle to maintain, and we have gotten all too complacent with the idea that it can't be subverted, that our core institutions will endure. And none of that can be taken for granted in the age of Trump.

It was often cute and sad, but just as often saccharine, fluffy, poorly constructed, overlong, and wildly unrealistic. I liked the first half of the book much more than the latter, and thought of it as a gay, Irish The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. But after a certain point, I really began to hate Cyril for his cowardice. And I'm not a monster--I know that I speak from a relative point of privilege. But it's not that I begrudge Cyril his inability to deal with his difficulties. It's that Cyril had a few critical choices between actions he knew would ruin others' lives (and sometimes also his own) and actions that would have taken bravery (but not superhuman quantities of it) but would have been the right thing, and he almost always chose the former. I think, in typically Irish Catholic fashion, we're meant to think that the punishment that Cyril receives--certainly proportional to his wrongdoing--expiates his sins, that they redeem him somehow. But I didn't find this to be the case. I want to read the book about the principled man in the face of adversity, whether he is doomed to misery or finds his reward in the end. I don't care as much about the unreliable coward who is callous with the lives of those who loved him, even if he does get punished for it or finds a form of happiness and satisfaction in the end.And aside from that, the storytelling seemed clumsy at times. So many of the plot lines seemed unnecessary, the attempts at humor felt flimsy, the number and distribution of gay characters felt unrealistic, and my god... the coincidences! I run into my neighbors less often over the years than these farflung people ran into each other, always without trying!

I’ve belatedly gotten into podcasts—mostly for when I’m pottering arMy goodreads friend Julie recommended this to me, and I’m very glad that she did. I’ve belatedly gotten into podcasts—mostly for when I’m pottering around my room tending to my plants or doing a half-assed weekly clean—and the boys from Crooked Media have been a nice entrée into the genre. The most famous of these are Jon Favreau, Obama’s wunderkind head speech writer, and Jon Lovett, the consensus funniest speech writer in the room. But while these are probably the two most famous speechwriters, the youngest member of the team was the best known to me, a really great guy whom I got to know fairly well toward the end of undergrad: Kyle O’Connor.Kyle gets mentioned 3-4 times in this book, the first time about 100 pages in. Kyle got scooped up by the Obama team while we were still in college, when his candidacy seemed like a longshot and where a junior speechwriting gig was probably a practical stepping stone rather than a career-altering decision. But we all know how unexpected and whirlwind the Obama 2008 campaign was. Kyle was busy during those years and we didn’t keep in the best of touch, but he gave us insights into this unknowable life through occasional emails and Instagrams from Air Force One.Kyle is mentioned in the book really only as the person positioned right above the book’s author in terms of the hierarchy of speechwriters. He’s also probably not mentioned because—though certainly interpersonally funny—his main assets are probably earnestness, clarity of thought, ability to communicate effectively. The closest I came to influencing political speechcraft was when I found myself on an email chain started by Kyle, soliciting our feedback on how to address the nation in the 2011 State of the Union address. Kyle asked about 5-6 of us for our thoughts on how to address gridlock. At the time, I was apoplectic over the Republicans’ obstructionism and equally upset with Obama’s very patient, arguably overindulgent extension of good will to them and willingness to compromise. We all know how these overtures were rewarded, but if there’s one thing this book really reveals between the slapstick, it’s what a good, fine man and politician President Obama was. Aside from all of the burdens he had to carry as the first Black president, he was also uncommonly deferential, optimistic, and decent toward a Republican party seemingly animated by nothing so universal as simmering racial resentment. We all know the outcome, and history will tell whether decency and proper procedure will once again come to define our federal politics (though I’m not very optimistic). But reading this memoir in the midst of the Trump presidency, characterized by white victimhood, racist and xenophobic dog whistles, hollow braggadocio, inability to accept blame or responsibility, opaqueness of process, and eagerness to take credit for every positive while shirking or blaming others for every liability, I am thankful that we had eight years under a president who cared about good government and operated in good faith. My response to Kyle in that email was that we should lay the blame for the economic miseries of the population on the Republicans, who had control of congress and thereby had far more control over the economy than did the president, who does not enact laws. In hindsight, I understand just how inappropriate this suggestion was; not only does the American public not really seem to understand that the president doesn’t control the economy, and can only do so to the extent Congress is willing to cooperate with him, but it would have been off-message in the extreme. And none of this is to say that Republicans deserve cooperation or the benefit of the doubt. But if we are presently witnessing the conflagration of American democracy, history will bear witness to who brought a fire extinguisher and who brought the gasoline. We very recently had a man in the Oval Office whose decency and good faith were inexhaustible, and we currently have a man whose piggishness, immaturity, and ineptitude defy credulity. May our next choice reflect the temperament of the person we feel better represents us as a people, and may President Obama’s legacy counsel us to make the wiser choice.ETA: I almost forgot to mention what an asshole Harvey Weinstein comes across as in this book, and that's without him even sexually coercing the author!

Kendi takes a novel approach to classifying the actions, thoughts, and actors across these generations, classifying them as segregationist/racist (the races ought and must be kept apart, as they are different), assimilationist (people fundamentally differ by race, but can learn from and aid each other if done properly and at the right pace), and antiracist (all people are created equal and race and anything attributed thereto is a social fabrication).

DuBois, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Barack Obama described as opportunistic assimilationists or even racists, but you can't really argue with Kendi's method, even if you dispute the ambit of any particular classification. He is remarkably consistent and unsparing, reserving unalloyed praise for individuals such as Malcolm X, Sojourner Truth, and other folks whom history has predictably buried because of the radicalism of their embrace of an idea that has still not gained due purchase. The book ends with the election of Barack Obama, with its ecstatically myopic declarations of the end of racism and a post-racial America. You could have been forgiven for gleefully declaring this on Election Night 2008, but I don't think anyone who knew much about race and lacked an ulterior motive was seriously declaring it thereafter. Worse yet--even knowing the depths of and attachments to racism in this country, no one could have predicted the mess we'd have made of it only a decade hence, when ventilation of racist thoughts is practically a requirement for a Republican to win a primary.So where does Kendi fit into this country ruled by rockribbed racists and their toxic and intractable ideologies? I think we are meant to realize that the litany of assimilationist failures, well-meaning and ""progressive"" as they often were, were nevertheless half measures that are never going to cut it. To understand racism is to understand that humans are all fundamentally equal across all spectra he associate with race--skin color, hair texture, the shape of our features, the sizes of our skulls, our weight and height, how hairy we are, etc. etc. Yet one must also acknowledge that vast inequality has erupted based on conglomerations of these factors that we call race. And finally, we have to understand that those inequalities are in large part the direct and indirect result of the policies, power dynamics, colonialism, enslavement, plunder, disregard, paternalism, disenfranchisement, and imprisonment of certain groups to benefit other groups. To be antiracist, one must believe that the power dynamics that have distorted our society (and all others) are unnatural and would not have occurred in any remotely recognizable way absent the weaponization of racism. And, perhaps most importantly, one must be committed to the incredibly drastic, politically impossible measures one must support in order to even attempt to achieve equality at some future point. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Mar 14, 2018","Mar 22, 2018","Nov 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25898216-stamped-from-the-beginning

I think of this often when (mostly white) conservatives accuse liberals and those on the left of being whiny ""snowflakes"" because we bridle at such light-hearted fun as, say, labeling entire races of people as rapists and killers, or making jokes about mass military slaughter. These people laugh off the indignation, considering us fragile and overwrought and even fun to provoke, selling mugs commemorating the pride they take in our umbrage. But of course these are the same people who have conniptions over NFL players kneeling during national anthems, who froth at the mouth when the ""Christ"" in ""Christmas"" is subbed out for the more economical ""X,"" and invest themselves deeply in peddling alternate histories in which Columbus and whole legions of Confederate war dead are rehabilitated as good, heroic people deserving of ennoblement in statuary guilty of, if anything, a few peccadilloes that we would do best to forget because, after all, didn't Hillary Clinton once use a private email server?This book explores the antecedents of these hypocrites in all their plenitude throughout history. Abolition without proper Reconstruction left an uneducated, unmoneyed class of people severely handicapped in their quest for equality, and visibly identifiable as an inferior group susceptible to coercion. Throughout the post-war period ersatz slavery persisted, and for every inch of progress that people of color wrested from the white hegemony, racial resentment emerged in fierce counterpoise.This is the story that ""White Rage"" tells--how it's never enough for people of color in the United States to achieve, against insurmountable odds, the slightest bit of advancement on their own; they also must be humbled, taught their place, taken down a peg--often with violence, degradation, and when all that fails--legal and bureaucratic strictures that undercut the progress so improbably attained. The Election of Barack Obama as the first Black president, being the most visible and perhaps unlikely of achievements, has catalyzed the worst of this reactionism, and we're all living through the aftershocks in the most disgusting and openly white supremacist of administrations in a century. But Carol Anderson ends on a high note, asking us to change our society to reject white supremacy and to inaugurate a better polity.

Much of the stability required for checks and balances requires a predominant buffer class that can mediate between the rapaciousness of the upper classes and the jealousies of the lower. This sounds all well and good, but it seems that if the importance of a strong middle class were so foregrounded in the minds of the Founders, they would have enshrined it in the text of the Constitution in some way, or would at least have provided for stronger mechanisms for sustaining it. Ultimately, I find Sitaraman's evidence for his central premise wanting. Much of it is presumed (e.g., the Founders were erudite students of political history and must have appreciated the peril of allowing an upper class or lower class predominate), or inferred (e.g. the lack of a class requirement for the House-of-Lords-manque U.S. Senate indicates our refusal to empower the upper classes). Also, for all of his impressive grasp of American political and legal history, Sitaraman's conclusion about the incompatibility between the Founders' vision and class inequality of political power doesn't exactly hold. After all, this current Gilded Age is not the first our country has suffered through, nor is the Constitution so allergic to massive disparities in wealth that it has been sundered while suffering them.I would probably give this 3.5 stars, though. Like I said, the author's grasp of legal and political history, particularly of the American type, is impressive. Plus Sitaraman offers intriguing solutions for ensuring that disfavored classes have a say in governance: lottery elections, tribunates, etc. It is to be expected that the gleam of the Founders' vision is dulled in the light of dimmer days, but these are the books we should be reading to understand how we might solve the problems they neither anticipated nor adequately shielded us from....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,Nov 2017,"Nov 06, 2017","Nov 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30780284-the-crisis-of-the-middle-class-constitution

But mostly because I had an image of antifa as black-clad paramilitants, spoiling for bloodshed and this contrasted sharply with the jaunty scarves and light, lambswool sweaters I've been wearing during this uncommonly balmy winter we've been having. For the most part the shame was directed from without--liberal colleagues would snicker, raise eyebrows, roll eyes, etc., the typical dismissiveness that the center-left trains toward the left. And perhaps some of you reading this feel the same way. But I think this really just goes to show how successful conservative voices are at manipulating narratives to bestow false equivalencies.Part of it also owes to the left's ineptitude when it comes to branding: as I'm sure you all know, ""Antifa"" stands for ""anti-fascism."" This is a pretty reasonable position to take, especially given the previous century of violence kindled in fascist conflagrations. But I don't think the general public really does know that, and so the group needlessly forfeits its crucial historical legacy. When I reserved this book I personally was most interested in the ""no platforming"" issue. Perhaps it's my time spent working for the ACLU, but I'd always taken the Millian/Jeffersonian approach to free speech: any idea should be tolerated and allowed to live or die on its own merits. I would tell people that it's the one thing the United States does better than other countries, and our gift to the world. Post-Charlottesville I really had to reevaluate this position, and I remember having a conversation about the incompatibility between First Amendment rights and Second Amendment rights the day before the ACLU changed its position to no longer represent free speech claims if the claimants were armed (I support their change of heart, despite supporting strong free speech rights). Additionally, we have to wonder whether free speech principles require a platform for ideas that have been thoroughly debunked already, which raises the question of whether idiots such as Milo Yiannopoulos are owed one for what amounts to Flat Earth ""ideas"" about women, trans people, immigrants, Muslims, etc.But where does that leave private assembly? The idea of free speech under the First Amendment tends to be poorly understood by the public; in reality, it only applies to government censorship, which is why there's no Constitutional issue when some celebrity says something idiotic and then the public, exercising its speech through its dollars, decides to boycott that product until the celebrity bonehead endorser is dropped from the sponsorship deal. So this is why there is no issue when a private university disinvites someone purely on the content of their speech, or why fascists are free to meet in their own homes and discuss the most vile ideas, organizing anything they want short of open insurrection. When we talk about those types of free speech, we are talking about the ""value"" of free speech, which is one of many liberal values that we all (or almost all) claim to cherish. But because there is no legal/Constitutional component, this value merely rests in equipoise with other liberal values, such as: the importance of voting and representation, welcoming of diversity, the equality of all people, representation by the people, safety and ability to earn a living, etc. These are things that fascists oppose for all but a minority of the population. And so fascist ideas will always exist where there is free speech, even as free speech will always be threatened to the extent that fascist ideas are not kept in check in the theoretical world. Hence: antifa. The question of how much non-violent intervention (glitter bombing, throwing ballbearings upon march routes, drowning out fascist messaging with song, threatening the job security of fascists, etc.), coercion, doxxing, and violence is necessary, and in what proportions, is the thorny one. As an important caveat, it is critical to mention that liberal values and governmental failsafes utterly failed to prevent fascism before, and so the idea that the government or people's good will should save us is painfully naive. But the gnashing of teeth comes about because we worry, rightly, over the slippery slope when we (again rightly) seek to quell fascist rhetoric and action. And here I think is the best thing I took away from the book: not a complete, absolutist prohibition on violence, not an exact formula for conquering fascism, but rather one historical truth, which is that antifa exists only as a reaction to creeping fascism. It has never taken over a government, and it has never mushroomed into a PC police state. And just as we don't wring our hands and decide not to fight forest fires because oh-my-god-what-if-it-gets-out-of-control-and-we-end-up-with-firefighters-putting-out-our-campfires, we have no reason to believe that antifa poses any threat outside of the immediate metastasis of fascism that it forms in reaction to.So please read this book. The first half is somewhat dry history, but the second is practical, interesting, and thought-provoking. And for the love of god educate and push back on those, especially on the left, who have a knee-jerk skepticism about this complex and important phenomenon, because we live in precarious times....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Nov 29, 2017","Dec 06, 2017","Oct 18, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35280441-antifa

As I absorbed the comments and tweets talking about how we forfeiI finished reading this documentary of unnecessary hate killing as another unfolded. As I absorbed the comments and tweets talking about how we forfeited on the gun control debate after Sandy Hook, I couldn't help but wonder whether we might be living in a very different world if one of those grieving parents had followed the lead of Emmett's mother, Mamie Till.Confronted anew by a murderous shooting spree, this country is grappling with questions that are at once horrific and yet somehow hoary. Increasingly, the commentariat vents its frustration with the rote unfolding of events in the wake of heinous gun violence: anti-gun outrage, followed by pro-gun policing of timing and tone, before the wholly depressing and inevitable failure of not only action but resolve amongst our elected politicians, who invariably respond by offering “thoughts and prayers,” differing from each other only over whether they will accept the patronage of the NRA or merely abide its corrosive influence on our society. Commentators and politicians have their constituencies, and they message accordingly; the pitch and amplitude of their rhetoric is calibrated to the rest of us, the many without a platform or a Senate vote who have only our own consciences and communities to lobby, the measure of our agony and outrage as the only limits on what we can push for. And so the failure to make meaningful inroads to gun control brings up an uncomfortable question: if we are truly shocked by these massacres, and if we are, as we say, a truly decent people—why does change never come?The simple answer is that interest groups such as the NRA have a stranglehold on our political process. Until politicians show a modicum of spine, all political capital will go toward defeating absurd pro-gun laws, with no hope of affirmative gun control legislation on the horizon, regardless of the coalitions running the branches of government going forward. And it is tempting to credit these responses, because what else could explain the vast chasms between what even Republican voters want and what our legislative bodies do when it comes to supporting common sense gun-control laws?To concede that the horror we express at these atrocities and the consensus we have reached as a society are not sufficient to override the influence of the NRA is therefore tempting. But to resign oneself to such outlooks is to admit that there are intractable problems in this country, and the heroism and grace displayed by Mamie Till—mother of Emmett Till, the fourteen-year old African American boy beaten, mutilated, murdered, and desecrated for a petty solecism against a white woman in Jim Crow Mississippi—in the wake of her child’s lynching cautions against such defeatism. Since perhaps the Civil War, if there’s ever been a more necessary but quixotic movement, it’s been the movement for Civil Rights for people of color in the United States. Hindsight gives us a bias toward remembering these events as well choreographed by the brilliant women and men who coordinated much of the marquee events of the Civil Rights Movement, but at least one momentous decision was made outside of this machinery: the courageous decision of Mamie Till to show the world what racism and white supremacy had done to her child, and to go far and wide to ensure that anyone who would listen would never have the chance to forget his humanity. If gun violence seems a hopelessly intractable problem in the United States in the current day and age, try to imagine (or remember) what the struggle for civil rights looked like in 1955. As Timothy B. Tyson notes in his new book, “The Blood of Emmett Till,” “Indifference to black lives did not begin in the twenty-first century. Nor was Mississippi entirely a foreign country to the rest of America in the 1950s. It simply did not matter to most white Americans what happened to black Mississippians; they did not know and did not want to know, and routine terrorism did not dent that indifference until the Emmett Till case.” Lynchings, wholesale terrorism, denial of suffrage, and grossly unequal status for Blacks throughout the country (but especially in the South) were not at all unknown to white Americans in the 1950s, but imagine the plentitude of rich excuses available to the typical, decent white American at that time for not agitating for the advent of civil rights. As Tyson tells it, It was only when Mamie Till decided to publish the indescribably brutalized corpse of her young son that the nation was forced to take part in a battle for its soul. That image—which is seared into the memory of anyone who has ever beheld it—not only forced White America to acknowledge its malign neglect toward people of color, as Tyson tells it, it also galvanized a legion of Black Americans, informing everything from Rosa Parks’ refusal to give up her seat on a bus to contemporary protests of police brutality and indifference toward black lives. One reason why there seems to be a paradoxical and unsettling lack of proportionality between the number of victims killed and the willingness to act is that we can’t fathom the loss when the numbers rise. At first, this seems crass, but it is fully consistent with what we know from experience: 20 (Sandy Hook) homicides is an unforgiveable number, and so is 13 (Columbine), but they barely register in comparison with 11,622 and 10,828, the number of gun homicides in the United States in the years when those massacres occurred, respectively. Without serious intervention, these individual “record-breaker” numbers and yearly aggregates are virtually certain to increase, and it is also a near certainty that we will disclaim them as inhuman, beneath us, badly in need of addressing, and a scourge on a compassionate republic. But if nothing ever changes, then of what use is our indignation?Without personalization of tragedy, without empathy, without searing images that reveal the wages of our inaction, we actively abet these 59s and 49s merging into the five-figure homicide rates. This will require heroism, but an appetite for this grace has already been shown. Individuals in the style of Mamie Till, such as Nardyne Jeffries (https://www.thetrace.org/2015/10/guns...) and Jessica Ghawi (http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-wa...) have already begun this important effort, but it is time that the media stopped witnessing these tragedies and did their part to confront them by showcasing the horror—emotional and physical—wrought by a network of gun control laws that has killed literally millions through its sheer manipulability and inadequacy. If the media were to focus on everyday gun homicides with a fraction of the zeal that they reserve for non-white terrorism, and if the victims were given a platform from which to share their accounts, this battle might be in far different shape.Obviously the Civil Rights Movement is far from over, and so personalizing and rendering empathetic the everyday victims of gun violence is no panacea. But no one can deny that Mamie Till’s speeches and her decision to have an open-casket funeral were galvanizing, important events for a civil rights movement that at least held the promise of eventual equality for people of color in this country. When Mamie Till made the decision to have an open-casket funeral, she denied the rest of the country and the world the opportunity to ignore him, to think that maybe his conduct could have merited his treatment, that Emmett’s was a forgettable life; her words were: “Let the people see what they did to my boy.” If we are indeed a decent nation, we need to be confronted by the lives that some consider to be the price of our gun culture. The direction that we take will show whether these are claims of truth or hollow aspirations....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 27, 2017","Oct 03, 2017","Sep 15, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753852-the-blood-of-emmett-till

Witchcraft is rife with contradictions, completely fabricated justifications, and harmful consequences, and once removed from its orbit, we see how utterly silly the belief therein so clearly was.

Not really because I possess any special piety, but because my body just doesn’t feel that great when I don’t eat well. I still eat as much meat and fat as I want, but I grow lethargic without veggies, and soda makes me feel worn out, and anything processed just doesn’t taste great to me, so it works out to be a pretty great deal where I can eat what I want and stay healthy. But over the past two weeks, my local grocery store has had this annoying deal. They are charging a measly $5 for 1.9lbs of sour patch kids. And not just any sour patch kids—it’s the bag with the blue guys in it! I bought one bag and thought, naively, “Oh, this will be a nice thing to have at my work desk, so others can come by for a nice, sweet treat.” Well, so much for that. After a period of several stressful days compounded by hunger because I couldn’t really escape the orbit of my desk, I made it through the entire bag, less a few handfuls for coworkers nearby. The first couple of bites are great, but after a while I really just return because it’s there, and my body remembers being satisfied by it, but as I shovel more handfuls of sour-coated, homunculus-shaped gelatin down my gullet, I do it knowing that I’m not really being satisfied. In fact, overall I think the effect might be a small net negative.And such is the work of Jeff VanderMeer, I am starting to realize. Both of his first two entries in this trilogy (and to a lesser extent, “Borne,” his unrelated but thematically similar newest book) have started out with such promise. About halfway through, you realize that the initial high is illusory, but that doesn’t really stop you. You keep going in, even as it becomes totally clear that each book is going to leave more intriguing topics broached but not satisfactorily addressed. It’s not quite in “Lost” territory yet, but for all intents and purposes it can be properly compared thereto.I’m not really a “sunk cost” fallacy guy, so I wouldn’t have any qualms about not finishing this if I truly didn’t like it. The thing is, it’s all pleasant and alluring enough, even if you know you won’t be satisfied when the end comes. And for the same reason that when I saw that the sale was still on, I picked up a second 1.9 lb bag (do not judge me so harshly, dear reader, for I am too weak and riddled with cavities to bear the shame!) and then proceeded to demolish it in less than a week, I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before I pick up the third installment in this series and piggishly make my way through that as well.

I haven't read the original version; I can't imagine it changed that much, though analysis of how much our country appears to have changed since Sarah Palin was en vogue could suggest otherwise. But at least compared with ""Fear,"" I think he's achieved his object. It does wade tediously into the philosophies of Burke and Locke, et al., but deals less with esoterica than did ""Fear,"" for which I was grateful. The final third of the book is what we came for--the analysis of the conservative mind, from Buckley and Goldwater through to Reagan, the Bushes, and Trump. At base there is a fundamental aversion to peace and tranquility; threats are perceived to greater degree by the conservative mind, and so remaining in stasis--or more likely progressing, though on metrics like aesthetics or social justice that don't hold valence for conservatives--is seen as decline. The remedy for this decline is the exercise of power, the stoking of insecurities and fears, and the gestures to a mythic past when effeminate and foreign-looking others were kept at bay or under heel.

I had been preparing myself for a book about bullying and tortured adolescence. Certainly that's a primary motif, but I was impressed and unprepared for the other heavy themes that pervade this work: extreme white poverty in a non-American ""First World"" setting, and its perilous admixture with toxic masculinity. ""The End of Eddy"" chronicles the disturbing, violent, and neglected upbringing of its author, a young man from Picardy, in the northeast of France. In a town where obesity is prized, insulation and sanitation are rare, poverty spans generations and governs upward mobility, and alcoholism catalyzes all sorts of domestic abuses and wanton violence, our narrator relates his troubled place among it all, where he had to navigate the anti-intellectual and heteromasculine currents that rocked against his nature. His sexual orientation is the source of his torture--he is bullied, he is ostracized, he loathes himself, and his family show disappointment and confusion about his proclivities--but is ultimately the source of his salvation, as it was a break that allowed him to reject all of the other harmful tendencies that his family and his community embraced, either through necessity, justification, or exhaustion, as a result of the poverty in which they were mired.Those of us on the American left often idealize Europe for the successes of their socialized states, for the safety net they have cultivated for the betterment of their societies. Obviously every net has holes, but it seems beyond debate that the wealthy democracies of Europe, Oceania and Canada have deliberately and successfully cultivated much stronger and comprehensive safety nets than we have here. And this being a historical phenomenon, poverty is more familiar to us, a common feature of our national narrative. But when I think of French poverty and misery I think of Les Miserables. Understandably this omits a long portion of the interim history, during much of which the average Frenchman was probably much worse off than the average American. Yet in the modern era, the positions seem to have been emphatically reversed. So to witness a French community infested with the same pathologies that inhabit the poor white communities of this country--where education is not seen as a good in and of itself nor as a way to escape poverty; where homophobia and misogyny are used to shore up the masculinity that poverty has etiolated; where xenophobia and racism are used to paper over one's own community's sins and to scapegoat the lack of economic opportunity; where alcoholism and poor health are predictable symptoms of penury--was jarring, to say the least. And so although I heard about this book through gay friends and it is usually pitched as a gay book (and the s on the back cover are all by famous gay authors), it seems far more accurately to be an ethnography of poverty and metastatic masculinity in a context that is at once familiar and yet unexpected. Definitely a harrowing and worthwhile read....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Oct 17, 2017","Oct 18, 2017","Aug 31, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31574750-the-end-of-eddy

I didn't know much about New York before moving there, but I lived with three of my best friends in a three bedroom apartment on the same block as Russ & Daughters and within spitting distance of Katz's Deli. I grew to love my neighborhood, but I would stare longingly at that gleaming bastion of fun and youth that beckoned to the north of Houston Street. In my mind, the East Village was the quintessence of young Manhattan living, and I crossed the psychic barrier of Houston Street as often as I could for Veselka breakfast sandwiches, Mud coffee, Indian beneath the acid trip decor of Panna II, or this place that sold nothing but poutine whose name now escapes me. I think I swore that one day, when I had a bit more money I would live in the East Village. And no street was more East Village-y in my mind than St. Mark's.A decade hence, the allure of the East Village has significantly waned, and I go out of my way to avoid walking down St. Mark's, particularly east of 2nd Avenue. The street is just too kitschy, and replete with NYU students. The exception is when we go to Holiday Cocktail Lounge, somewhat ironically adopted by my college friends as one of our two go-to bars, but even then I studiously avoid the areas where people spill into the streets and stumble out of Middle Eastern restaurants clutching gyros and pita.I think my new reaction might be of a new type. The East Village seems like a palimpsest, with every new decade comes an older generation lamenting the inauthentic entry of a new vanguard, from the Stuyvesants to the Germans to the Jews to the Puerto Ricans to the Ukrainians to the hippies to the druggies to the punks to the crusties to the yuppies, every group looks on a decade afterward and waxes nostalgic for the St. Mark's of a decade ago. But I think whatever magic St. Mark's had was gone before I first beheld it, because it looks roughly the same and seems to serve the same function--weirdness and kitsch and affordability, all sanitized, despite the persistent patina of grime. As a microcosm of both Manhattan and of NYC in total this should be expected, but the St. Marks of generations past seems like it would have been pretty amazing....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 23, 2017","Aug 26, 2017","Aug 26, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28789718-st-marks-is-dead

Robert Peace was by all accounts possessed of an incandescent mind, talented at everything he did, wise and generous beyond his years, and imbued with values and priorities beyond reproach. A profound sense of loss haunts this book--the loss of this incredible man's potential, what our society is robbing itself of by the waste laid by cycles of poverty, the war on drugs, and racism. Not that I have much faith in the ""American Dream,"" particularly as it is available to the poor and people of color, but there are usually some exceptions, where a mixture of fortuitous innate characteristics, luck, and circumstances propel individuals of exceptional ability beyond their fraught circumstances and into the reaches of power and influence. The unscrupulous and specious point to these outliers as proof that the system works, and the rest of us wring inspiration from these stories and use them to underscore our conviction that success should not be so reliant on the caprice of luck. But a profound hopelessness inheres when an individual possesses all of the traits and circumstances necessary to escape the impossible and to gift the world with his or her brilliance, only to be swatted back down at the lip of success. This book is tragic and necessary, and it fueled my anger and amplified my sadness during a week when America's White Supremacist tendencies were so disturbingly elucidated in my beloved Charlottesville.

Essentially, the United States never had tiered punishments, and things that tended to be high-status crimes in Europe (political dissent, bankruptcy) were not even illegal in the United States. A modernizing impulse on mainland Europe led to a gradual equalization of punishments, first with the extension of the guillotine and beheading (in the West, beheading was the punishment meted out to the elite, while hanging was a form of debasement and defilement left to the lowborn), and then with an extension of perquisites formerly only enjoyed by the rich and well connected. In America, however, our general allergy to aristocracy retarded the modernizing impulse, and then for a variety of reasons we stuck with an egalitarianism of low punishment rather than embracing a more clement approach for all.A few gripes: Whitman probably doesn't get to his main points until around page 170. In a normal book this wouldn't be too much of a burden, but this book was only 210 pages, and it took me weeks to read, it was that dense and dry, so I felt that it was a bit unnecessary. Also, perhaps because it is focused on almost to the exclusion of all other potentially explanatory phenomena (including this book's thesis!), Whitman really fails to address the role of race and slavery in his assessment of America's decision not to ""level up"" status punishment instead of our decision to leave degradation as the common trait among all our forms of punishment.

This book starts with a panoramic chronicle of humanity's earliest offshoots and eventual consolidations. It leaves off where his second book (though the first that I had read) begins: at the point where we start to use technology, genetic modifications, and inorganic accoutrements to diverge from our past and the destiny to which our genes confines us. At times this felt a bit scattered, though I suppose that this is a peril of the genre. But it was very entertaining, provocative, and interesting throughout. As in his other work, Harari is most interesting when he questions our assumptions and vitiates common values and world views. In particular, here, he makes short work of Western ethnocentrism, the hopeful but unsupported concept of a teleology to human purpose, and of our presumed superiority to other life forms. Harari emphasizes, often poignantly, that humans are no stronger, more determined, more noble, more loving, more moral than our co-residents of Earth, the thousands of other types of animals that live alongside of us. The only real differentiators are our intelligence and our ability to cooperate. I think we tend to emphasize our intellectual superiority above all other factors, whether out of vanity, insecurity, or habit. But superior intelligence is the necessary condition, but it is not sufficient for promoting anything close to what we currently call society, progress, technology, etc. It's not especially profound, but I do think it's generally underemphasized that humans' dominance over the planet cannot be attributed to our superior intelligence, or at least not directly. Isolated tribes in the middle of Papuan or Amazonian jungles are just as likely to have the same kernel of intelligence as you or I, but their societies, even if replicated but still atomized across the globe, would hardly be more dominant than any other apex species. Instead, it's our intelligence that facilitates our ability to cooperate, and it's our ability to cooperate that allows us to direct our energies toward making life easier, better, safer, freer, and more numinous. It's only through cooperation that we have been able to do so much, and it's the absence of cooperation--whether in the form of nationalism, war, tragedy of the commons, or other ill--that correlates with stagnation and decline.

He mixes in some interesting and revealing anecdotes--though sometimes it's unclear whether he's using a story to exhort us not to give a shit or to highlight how focusing on one particular thing is detrimental--and tells some personal stories, all while hammering home the same message.

Sadly, it was not to be.""Less"" is the story of a gay man who has lived a minor life of renown on the outskirts of a more luminous circle of literary talents, had great loves that fizzled from his own neglect, and lots of frisky and fun stories in between. On the cusp of 50 and his younger paramour having recently gotten engaged, he sets off on a world tour of escapism and last hurrahs. I think ""Less"" is supposed to be funny, and it does have some whimsy to it, but at heart it's a cautionary tale of the thing that many gay men fear--that our constant vigil for something slightly better will, before we know it, leave us lonely, bereft, and unloved in the not-so-old age bracket where we have half of our lives left but have already graduated beyond our community's morbid, age-regimented standards of desirability. As a 31 year old, I have already incorporated this neurosis. It's difficult to say why I didn't like this book without spoiling it, but I'll make an attempt: I felt like the characters were not very developed, and the vignettes were so tangential to each other that I only found out, to my astonishment, that this book won the 2018 Pulitzer when I googled it to investigate whether its peripeteia was a retelling of some Greek legend I didn't know or had forgotten, a meta-reflection on Arthur Less's book. I think the ending is sweet, but it certainly didn't feel well-earned. ""Spatchcocked"" would have been a more fitting title, and at least a gay-er, less groanworthy pun than the one that actually concluded the book. (ETA--""Eat, Gay, Love"" also could have summed this up well).On a parting note, this was the most recent selection for one of my two NYC Gay Men's Book Clubs, and I had to miss the discussion because I was working that night. One of the things we've discussed in that club is why books written by and about gay men tend to always be harrowing or tragic in some way. And in a group that is supersaturated at 40 people, it was surprising and telling that not one of us could name an exception to that rule.

I was unsure of whether it still made sense to read, but having done so I am convinced it was worthwhile. Since his ouster, pundits have been tripping over themselves to herald the debut of a more polished, less divisive, more independent, and more pragmatic Trump. Many of these assign responsibility to the no-nonsense environment inaugurated by General Kelly's takeover as White House Chief of Staff, but having finished ""Devil's Bargain,"" I'm convinced that Trump is merely a cipher and Bannon's idiot microphone, gone quiet now that his provocative and destructive interlocutor has been jettisoned.But backing up a bit, Bannon is himself an interesting, improbable creature. He's certainly smarter than Trump by leaps and bounds, and wiser, too. The only area where they both seem to have preternatural skill is in the realm of instinct, where each has a knack for tapping into the wounded id of the brooding and unsuccessful white person, typically male. But neither is a genius, Bannon just arrogated that title because the comparator intelligence of the group surrounding him was so paltry. Bannon is a voracious student with eccentric and quixotic hobbyhorses ranging from Christian mysticism to Marxist nationalism, but ultimately he just seems like a person possessed of a crystalline vision of the inevitable future, but lacking the short term specifics and pragmatism to bridge the gap; a man possessed of far more persuasive ability and powers of manipulation than wisdom or goodness. But perhaps more than anything, Bannon is the product of a perfect storm of luck. It's not that a Harvard Business School and Goldman Sachs alum would be surprising to find in the upper echelons of any presidential administration, especially one that is so nakedly plutocratic and morally nihilistic--on the contrary. But Bannon didn't follow the normal trajectory. Instead he was out shilling weird Tridentine Catholic propaganda films to the Vatican, which led him to make films about Sarah Palin's run for VP (mystifyingly called ""The Undefeated""), but not before falling into Seinfeld royalties by accident, representing Fred Durst and Ice Cube, and most recently running a scheme with Brock Pierce, aka the young star of the ""Mighty Ducks"" franchise, to use abusive Chinese labor to generate computer loot that would in turn be sold to Westerners for real life cash. It all sounds like a conspiracy theory, but also totally plausible in this increasingly unbelievable world that we inhabit.Once Bannon got connected to the Mercers (think of the Koch brothers but with more secrecy and less restraint), there was a brief flirtation with the Cruz campaign before he realized that Trump could be his Trojan Horse, the man who would deliver him to the apex of power and allow for the destruction of the corrupt political establishment from the inside. I guess it still remains to be seen whether the GOP or the two-party system will survive the Trump presidency, but it's staggering how much discord Bannon was able to sow in only a few short months in power by completely shredding norms and alienating every politician he might have courted.While I do think that much of the hooplah over Bannon's genius and longview is overblown, there's no doubt in my mind that he was singularly powerful for two reasons: he picked a winning (if insane) strategy for the 2016 Election, and he really did maintain a Rasputin-esque control over Trump's messaging while in office. As to the first, there's no evidence that the American people ever really liked Trump, nor that they had much faith in his policies--certainly not enough to win him the election. Instead, Bannon seized on the distrust of the Clintons, the antipathy to dynasty, the rank misogyny simmering in so much of the uncourted electorate, and the chimerical grievances of young, disaffected white men to gin up a whirlwind of sustained hatred against Hillary Clinton, an imperfect but highly qualified and generally moderate candidate who came to be seen by all but the totally committed left as dishonest, corrupt, untruthful, careless, and unlikeable. Bannon pulled out all the stops--I was sickened when I remembered that Trump intended to seat all of Bill's accusers in the front row of the second debate to unnerve Hillary, but unsurprised that this was Bannon's scheme--and wrecked just about every norm we could have marginal pride in while doing so. With the help of the Mercers, who refused to condemn Trump even after the ""Access Hollywood"" ""grab 'em by the pussy"" tape emerged, they savaged Clinton, and with the godsend of the Comey letter, that was just enough to pull off what was the greatest--and most upsetting--upset in American political history.As to the second, Bannon amplified Trump's tendencies to refuse to apologize, to dogwhistle to all sorts of reprehensible bigots, to energize his base, and to make statements of great, hubristic bravado. Because everything is terrible, this book reveals Bannon's personal motto: Honey Badger don't give a shit. And it's true: as manager of Breitbart, Bannon would routinely make false statements, or trump up claims that were demonstrably false at the time, and would refuse to retract them. Why? Because honey badger don't give a shit. To people who only want politics as entertainment, for whom hatred sustains and is a pastime, objectivity does not matter one stitch. In a fragile world of wounded male id, apologizing is what these people think they have been doing their entire lives, and the dominant narratives and policers of truth are all biased anyway, so why capitulate? Instead, Bannon took the factual nihilism and allergy to objectivity that characterizes so much of the right and rightwing media in particular and turned it into an art form. This played into his successes with the destruction of Hillary Clinton, as mentioned above.So now that he's removed from office, whither Bannon and his baleful influence? It's unclear, but I have a hunch. Throughout the first part of this book I found myself pining for a liberal/leftist Bannon to come onto the scene, who could exploit the bugbears of the other side and animate the left's anger and sense of scandalization, because as it is now we're still struggling to decide whether Clinton or Sanders should shut up and accept blame for the 2016 loss. But there's a reason why these rumor mills and fake news outlet enjoy so much currency and sway on the right but not the left--the former trades in absolutes, a black-and-white view of the world, while liberal policies and trains of thought always inhabit the grays of the spectrum; and if you let in a bit of doubt, a caveat here or there, there is always going to be room to critique and accept blame for something that you recognize is imperfect but support all the same. While this can often make liberals seem milquetoast and self-defeating, it's a conscientious way to think about things as complex as dignity, punishment, society, government, and justice. But conservatives seem far more susceptible to the non-nuanced point of view, far less susceptible to question anything that they believe or that seems superficially to adhere to their core principles and values. I speak in embarrassingly overbroad terms here (it is a book , after all), but I believe these things to be true about both sides, especially as the pitch and ardor of each side increases.But with Trump lacking his Rasputin, it's not like he's become more moderate, he's just easier to kick and bully about. By all accounts Bannon was a ""real alpha""! But now Trump is surrounded by moderate Republicans who want to govern in a reasonable conservative way and understand the need for compromise and decorum. He's also surrounded by Democrats, through whom he has found he can obtain rare and highly coveted plaudits by cooperating just the slightest bit. With Gorka out, there's maybe only Stephen Miller left in the ""burn the whole world down"" cabal that Bannon unquestionably led. So does this mean that Trump will have more or less success? Well, it depends on what you think ""success"" means--I think it will be better for Democrats, and certainly he will be less incendiary, which is a good thing for our country. But having read this book, I am confident that his chances of winning reelection have never been lower. Bannon was a master assassin of character, and he knew that by continuously launching preposterous stories backed by a loud and angry constituency in the alt-right, he was able to enlist the media in his efforts to show Clinton to be just as bad as Trump, if not worse because Trump, at least, was a wildcard who might really pan out. We know that no amount of hypocrisy or flip-flopping will ever be enough to alienate the majority of Trump supporters from his cult of personality. But without a bogeyman in 2020 as seemingly perfectly engineered for exploitation as Clinton was, and lacking an enthusiastic constituency to rally behind Trump (presumably without a ""Wall"" or Obamacare repeal to show for his first term), and with Bannon-helmed Breitbart now using its influence to undermine Trump's support and mystique, he's absolute toast.

I never really felt strongly about Hillary Clinton either way--I frowned on a lot of her politics and her seemingly cautious approach to things in the primary, but thought she would be a very capable and even-handed president; I thought she herself was inspiring even if her leadership would likely be worryingly neoliberal. When Trump became the nominee, I clung to her by default, but I never grew to love her as a candidate. Sure, I phone banked for her every chance I got from her Brooklyn office, and yes I am a bit taken by identity optics narratives (though: queery whether things have gotten better for people of color in the United States since the first non-white president was elected...), but I only really got excited about a Hillary Clinton presidency insofar as she was the last bulwark against Republican lunacy.Having read this book, I think that we can only really blame Hillary for this catastrophic and seemingly avoidable cataclysm of an election result insofar as she is responsible for picking the team that ran the election and the people who defined it. The role of sexism in this election is beyond question--a disgusting revelation about where we are as a nation despite our lofty rhetoric, and a vivid reminder of how much farther we have to go. And the media's complicity in furthering Trump's antics and approbating his childishness--harming our civic debate and eroding our norms for short term ratings boosts--is almost as appalling. But even given these X factors, this result was far from inevitable. Aside from Hillary's own ""scandals"" (honestly--fuck anyone who thought that Hillary's emails were a legitimate reason to not vote for her and/or to vote for Trump) and the campaign's inability to handle them, data fetishists like (the aptly named) Robby Mook seem most to blame for this disaster. A mix of hubris and a preternatural focus on the numbers really seem to have doomed this campaign from the start. Additionally, the book focuses heavily on the primary and the damage it may have inflicted on the general campaign. What I took away from it is just how arrogant and dismissive the campaign was toward the nearly equal number of Democratic primary voters who preferred another candidate, and one with a very different agenda. The fact that Elizabeth Warren was one of the final four VP candidates--the result of campaign aides insisting that this would be a way to mend relationships with the Bernie wing--and that they went with ""duller than a year-old razor"" Tim Kaine, really shows how arrogant, spiteful, or out of touch the whole group was. The worst is that Hillary took the blame for all of this, despite her openness to Warren as VP, her skepticism of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and her strong interest in economic justice for all, especially minorities and women, as expressed through her wonky and detailed policy positions.In the end, I divided the major players into heroes, villains, and neutrals:Heroes:* Hillary & Chelsea Clinton* Michelle and Barack ObamaNeutrals:* Podesta* Huma* Bernie* Kaine* BidenVillains:* Mook* Debbie Wasserman-Schultz* Bill Clinton* Comey* Intransigent Bernie supporters (but only after he conceded the primary)The inside story, really, is wild. It really me relive the rollercoaster, for better or for worse. I guess the worst part was reliving the awful night of when the terror of unreality set in; but happily, a mixture of incompetency, internal strife, and corruption have conspired to keep the impact at bay. At least for now. Let's hope the next campaign learns all the lessons it can from this book....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 17, 2017","Jul 21, 2017","Jul 14, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/33874545-shattered

It's her shortest book by far, but it looks to have been conceived of, written, edited, and published over... 4-8 months? Kind of remarkable. So I wasn't surprised to see that much of it recapitulated many of her old books: the ""No Logo"" portion talks about Trump as a hollow idea, something that is set at a remove from reality and that achieves its power through spin and association, not through any connection to quality or to any efficacy with governing; the ""This Changes Everything"" frame basically talks about how we're already way past screwed when it comes to the environment, and how we need to frame any goals for our future within the environmentalist paradigm and the decolonizationalist and reparationist frameworks that this increasingly entails; and ""The Shock Doctrine"" frame talks about how Trump is going to use this model--not coincidentally a model perfected by his antecedents in the GOP and through his buddies in the Kremlin--to concoct the apotheosis of kleptocracy. So, basically, if you've read the rest of her oeuvre, she tees up how you should think about Trump through each of its overlapping lenses. But she adds in a part at the end where she clarifies the title of this work. She emphasizes that it's not enough to be opposed to bigotry, ignorance, rapaciousness, greed, and crudeness; we need to be the party or parties or movement that suggests permanent, appealing, and prosperous alternatives to the untenable habits that characterize our modern world and most impactful societies. She concludes with a declaration of sorts that lists several high-minded but not totally inconceivable goals and aspirations, which has apparently achieved some currency within Canada. Sadly, they seem like they might be totally implausible in a United States in which Trump could become president, but he seems to be making such a hash out of it in only six months that the Shock Doctrinaire in me wonders whether this isn't the time to push for some really bold reimagining of what is possible......more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 14, 2017","Jul 22, 2017","Jul 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34814047-no-is-not-enough

""Shock Doctrine"" is one of the most eye-opening pieces of non-fiction I've ever had the privilege of reading, and ""This Changes Everything,"" about climate change, has changed my behavior and attitude toward my surroundings probably more than any other book. ""No Logo"" is not as impressive an entry into her pantheon, but it prefigures the talent that she would display in her later works. Perhaps it's because it was a bit dated--references to the influence of MTV and Nike abound; brand hegemons like Apple--whose share price has since increased by a factor of about 300x--do not even merit mention. Sweatshops were the cause celebre of the 1990s, and it's hard to say whether we hear less about them because corporations recognize that it's no longer profitable to employ exploitative sweatshop labor (as Klein points out: revenue and not morality is always the gravamen of this calculus), or because we grew fatigued by the effort and tolerate them now, or at least their slightly less exploitative post-1990s iterations.One highlight of the book came toward its end, when Klein talks about the agency of youth consumers and of disenfranchised yet culturally relevant black and brown youth who live in the nation's cities. It's pretty incredible that brands as powerful as Nike and Disney caved to the pressure of these individuals, who understood themselves to have been chumps for paying 30x the cost of a shoe, and having engaged in the exploitation of other marginalized people throughout the world in so doing, all to pad the larders of megarich companies who had co-opted their sense of style and fashion to begin with. It's kind of great that people won't tolerate hostile corporate forces invading their space. To wit, I've been venturing beyond my West Brooklyn/Lower Manhattan ambit of late, and have found myself in the Bronx, in Central Queens, and in white ethnic enclaves like Greenpoint. Milo Yiannopoulos, the smugly execrable male Ann Coulter/low-rent Oscar Wilde with a bronzer problem who is currently afflicting our society with his ""provocative"" yet wholly warmed-over ideas in the Trump era, is putting out his own book, entitled ""Dangerous."" I'm all for free speech, and come from the Millsian/Skokie line of ACLU types who think that one of the only things America is truly great at, and has benefited from, is its staunch defense of freedom of speech in the public arena. Even if they were repellent, which they surely are, I would defend Mr. Yiannopoulos' right to advocate his views. But freedom of speech is important for allowing new ideas to surface, not for perseverating the same ""Muslims are bad!"" ""White men are responsible for all cultural innovations!"" and ""Women make up rape allegations for attention!"" tommyrot that has been around since the Crusades, if not earlier, and has been widely discredited for centuries; we need this type of public voice like we need lectures about why the Earth is flat. Mr. Yiannopoulos is a gadfly, and he has never propounded an original idea other than that he is somehow noteworthy, as far as I can tell. Anyway, I noticed that ads for his book, ""Dangerous,"" were cynically posted all over the subway stations in less gentrified areas, ostensibly because people in the other areas would not tolerate their living spaces being desecrated by such an inane, bigoted idiot and his quest to enrich himself by sowing dissension. And happily, I noticed that of all the ads on the subway, even in the areas not teeming with effete latte liberals like myself, these ads were almost always the only ones torn down, desecrated, denounced, destroyed. As Klein notes, there may be no legal theory to support these actions, but one of the most powerful ways in which people can revolt against the invasion of their spaces and communities by hostile, capitalist attempts to make money off of them and their neighbors is through hostile, pointed destruction of the property that these forces use to accomplish their aims. I'm sure that Mr. Yiannopoulos would have some tired quip about the breeding of these people or their motivations, and how it shows that the left (read: the not extreme right) is intolerant of free speech, but this really just reflects an overbroad view of the protections to which private property and money are entitled, and a cramped view of the ways in which speech, protest, and dissent can, should, and will increasingly be expressed....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jul 09, 2017","Jul 12, 2017","Jul 09, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/647.No_Logo

We rotate hosts, and to avoid a tragedy of the commons situation, whoever hosts supplies all the food and wine (occasionally beer and liquor, as well), and gets to select three books that the group may vote on. I selected this book, in addition to Beartown by Fredrik Backman and The Master Butchers Singing Club by Louise Erdrich. Private Citizens squeaked out the win, and I took to reading it without much prejudice as to whether or not I’d cotton to it.Another tradition of this book club is that we go around the circle and say what our initial thoughts were, starting with the host. So I piped up and said what I thought: the book was funny, smart (but perhaps “too” smart), clever, and well-written. It had its rough spots, but particularly for a debut novel it was excellent, and I was eager to see what the author put out next.Well that was the last encomium the book was to receive, because everyone else pretty much hated it. One person mentioned the editing, many mentioned the sloppy, self-aware grasp of feminism, the Oedipal ending felt too heavy-handed, everyone disliked pretty much every character, and many found the despair-amongst-such-privilege theme to be downright offensive. The thing is, I don’t disagree with any of the above. And so maybe it’s just that I can deemphasize the foibles and have a greater affinity for what the book did well, which I thought was tell interesting stories, offer up witty banter, explore a microcosm of society, etc. Everyone did agree that the writer had talent and would in all probability write something good one day; but I’m still a bit too sheepish to recommend it to others with any degree of confidence…...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 29, 2017",Oct 2017,"Jul 07, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25817440-private-citizens

Meacham doesn't paper over or apologize for Jackson's most execrable qualities--namely his tolerance for slavery and his unapologetic and genocidal attitude toward Native Americans--but he undertakes to tell a more personal tale of Jackson. In a way, it's admirable, because we have a tendency in this country to consider all Great Men either untainted heroes or unregenerate villains, when few seldom resolve so cleanly. But in another way it's a bit disturbing that the balance of this book favored Jackson's warm paternal side (not only to his adopted family but to the nation as a whole) and his more admirable qualities (his loyalty to the Eatons, for instance) while giving disproportionate short shrift to his most unpardonable sins.In a way, I see why Jackson and Trump are often compared: both represent departures from long traditions of ""establishment"" politicians, who had both the experience and the polish of politesse; both were regarded by Coastal and Northern elites as unlettered idiots who whipped the people into frenzies reflecting the baser sides of their natures; both used novel ways to communicate with the public (John C. Calhoun, roguish as he himself was, accused the president's communication with the Boston Globe of being unconstitutional, since he thought the only legitimate means for POTUS to communicate to the people was through speeches and addenda to laws!); both were thought to portend the downfall of the experiment of American Government. I suppose we shall see whether this last comparison's inaccuracy credits the 45th president as significantly as it does our 7th...But I couldn't help take note of the rather more pronounced ways in which these two presidents differ radically. Jackson was a lawyer who had a strong (if idiosyncratic) understanding of how the government should work, and its relationship to The People. Jackson apologized when he thought it necessary. Jackson believed that the power of the presidency derived from having been chosen by the majority of the people; Trump crows about his Electoral College victory, an institution that Jackson regarded as anti-democratic and elitist. Jackson was legitimately religious and had a knowledge of scripture, and took the separation of church and state so seriously that he refused to join a church until after he finished his presidency; Trump has probably never read a page of scripture in his life. And of course Jackson grew up in poor, marginalized circumstances, orphaned from a young age and never very rich, and we all know Trump's story.Bad as Jackson was, he seems to have at least been principled, if deeply misguided with terrible consequences. He seriously enlarged the power of the presidency, perhaps inexorably, and cherished the integrity of the union above all else. He seemed to have cherished his family and intimates, and endeavored to be the father to others that he never had himself. And there are all sorts of amusing anecdotes in which he threatened to murder people who gave him their slack jaw and attacked armed assailants with little more than pluck and his cane. Definitely a badass, if also a bad apple. In comparison, Trump lacks the drive, intelligence, and strength of will to accomplish his own, modern version of the evils Jackson wrought, and he lacks all of the few but considerable virtues Jackson possessed. We can at least be thankful for that....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 06, 2017","Jul 09, 2017","Jul 06, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3147367-american-lion

Shame, shame, shame on us. When I worked at the ACLU's Women's Rights Project we started taking on a lot of the nuisance abatement cases, wherein typically female victims of abuse are given the agonizing choice of enduring intimate partner violence or calling the cops, where the latter option runs the risk of spurring a for-fault eviction, imperiling present as well as future housing security for the person and her family. I can't imagine how thick, or unfeeling, or incompetent one would have to be to think that such policies are equitable or necessary, and yet they are by no means an aberration, but rather a feature of the system. They blanket our state and local legal regimes, and it's only the advocacy of impact litigation outfits like the ACLU that is stemming their tide; for every story we hear about in Desmond's book or in a federal district court, you have to imagine there is an unceasing stream of silent others who skulk away with what dignity they can salvage and whatever important items they can carry with them, no practical solution anywhere close to imaginable. Desmond actually talks about landlords who discriminate against mothers with children, because children are more likely to be tested for chemical and hard metal poisoning, leading to landlord liability. Think about the layers of inhumanity and depravity it takes to keep poor families from living in shitty housing, just to protect an already unconscionable rent money haul.

Taxes are boring, everyone has unlettered and predictable opinions about them, and the subject is endlessly abstruse. But they're also very important. Beyond clumsy suppositions about liberals favoring more taxes and conservatives loathing them, I found this account fascinating for revealing one of the few political areas of substance where conservative and liberal policy goals are consistent with each other. It is in fact possible to raise more money and lower tax rates! We can lower the taxes on the richest, not chase away corporations, implement a VAT without it being regressive, and do all of this while raising more money and radically simplifying the nature of our byzantine tax code! BBLR! Suffice it to say, it'll be interesting to wade into the promised tax reform debates and not immediately assume that our government is run by a cabal of greedy idiots intent on ruining anything good about this country/world for plutocratic purposes. I mean, I'll probably end up that way, but at least I can come in with an open mind and a lack of presumptions about what conservative policies do. So if there's a fix out there, then why not adopt it? In a word: politics. And also a hefty dose of the ridiculous idea that American exceptionalism means ""everything we do contributes to us being the greatest!"" rather than ""almost everything that we insist on doing differently has become an embarrassing albatross with nothing more to justify it than convention and stubbornness.""Anyway, this book, I gather, is written by a frequent NPR commentator.

This book even occasionally dwells on these facts, and when it does it's at its best. There are lots of careening asides about Scrabble and the author's dubious claims to laziness (do lazy people write books?), but this book has a lot of interesting insights into how our culture demonizes and misconstrues the (eminently unobjectionable) idea that women and men should be equal. It's never as simple as wishing it, and we all--through our conscious and unconscious biases and behaviors--do our part to prevent the idea's reification. When Gay gets into a groove, she is spellbinding. She can launch into a screed like few others. But while I found this to be powerful and important in most cases, at many other times it felt like she was adopting a strident view not admitting of nuance. For example, Gay says something like she wanted to slap a colleague who said that a text on racism should perhaps be taken more seriously because it was written by a white woman. Fair enough. But then in later chapters Gay floats the idea that a commentary on gender and sex by (male) artist Thornton Dial could maybe be taken more seriously because it was created by a man. I don't think Gay's suggestion here is hortatory--she is not suggesting that this is the only way it should be considered--but she is at least allowing that there might be some merit to considering the viewpoint of the less marginalized group. Yet this charitable and open-minded approach is often something she denies to others. By the end of the book, I was distracted by what a different Roxane Gay 2.0 might have said in her antiphon to this book: saying that Wendy Davis' hair looked perfect during her 13-hour long filibuster against restrictions on reproductive health care? Rank sexism. Her claim that it is a shame that derelict and abusive black men in cinema are left off screen because it purposefully signals black male absenteeism? Society's desire to visually gratify their belief that black men are brutish misogynists. Etc. etc.Because of her skill with pointing out our hypocrisies and loss of proportionality when it comes to gender and race, I couldn't help being reminded of another great commentator of our times, Ta-nehisi Coates. But unlike Gay, Coates takes a less judgmental stance, allows for the possibility of redemption and nuance, and directs you to come to the conclusions on your own. I couldn't help but think that Gay's approach could have been still better had it adopted elements of this approach....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 13, 2017","Jun 15, 2017","Jun 13, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18813642-bad-feminist

Think The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay with less tragedy and more laughter and 50 years hence.I kind of forget what I wanted to say about this book, and/or maybe just conflated it with what others said about it last night.

Our hero is a hip, sharp, octogenarian Manhattanite out on a stroll on New Year's Eve, 1985. During her excursion we are treated to her encounters with a true salmagundi of New Yorkers, during which she displays her Rabelaisian wit, her fearlessness and openness, and her fondness for reverie. The jaunt and the encounters are usually vehicles for exploring both the city as it looked in the 1980s and Boxfish's life, lurching ever upward from ingénue bluestocking to Peggy-Olsen-esque dominance of the advertising world through her confidence in her competence, male predominance therein notwithstanding. I'd give it a solid 3.5 stars--this was a warm and alluring book, but it did seem to lose some steam in its second half.

Harari takes our current predisposition toward and ability to take part in upgrading ourselves and commentates upon the frangibility of our underlying presumptions. Moreover, he skewers (what he considers to be) the naiveté of our thinking of ourselves as, variously: fundamentally different from animals, immune from obsolescence, or unique in a way that cannot (eventually) be replicated by the most mundane and thoughtless of automata and algorithms. I will say that it seemed like this (very impressive, very trenchant) book was weakest when Harari glibly asserted that we humans are mere aggregations of algorithms. Arguments often merely asserted--using ""possibility"" rather than ""plausibility"" as their main ballast--that it's not a matter of whether things as complex as language, emotion, and feeling can be *perfectly* reduced to algorithms, but when. From the purely legal/logical perspective--an industry whose perseverance, by dint of its reliance upon the ambiguity of language, would seem safer than most others--we would say that just because something is feasible, possible, or seems probable, this has no bearing on its eventual occurrence. But maybe that's just a lack of imagination on my part... or prideful antipathy toward anything that suggests my own jogtrot mundaneness ;)Either way, you should read this.

I kind of wanted to see how sensationalist he was in one of his books, and I'm always eager to try to use history as a way to understand the present.The thesis of the book comes most succinctly in its final pages:Gustaw Herling-Grudzinski, . . . wrote that 'a man can be human only under human conditions.' The purpose of the state is to preserve these conditions, so that its citizens need not see personal survival as their only goal. The state is for the recognition, endorsement, and protection of rights, which means creating the conditions under which rights can be recognized, endorsed, and protected. The state endures to create a sense of durability.Snyder focuses his attention for most of the book on elucidating the Nazi/Soviet destruction of the states that buffered them, and how this immiserated the majority of world Jewry scattered amongst them. The findings are really quite shocking; in addition to the barbarity that is never forgotten yet freshly sickening upon each renewed encounter, the differences in treatment between Jewish citizens of Denmark vs. Estonia, and those of France vs. those of Greece, are truly astounding. Snyder makes a really strong case for the idea, certainly not new, that Jews and other atomized, conspicuous minorities have only the bureaucracy and protection of the state when passions grow enflamed and institutions and customs break down.Perhaps this is why he is so choleric about the Trump presidency. While I agree that our mores are in complete shambles, and the heralded destruction of government gives me pause, I think (hope) that the Trump administration's incompetency and lack of coherent ideology will be enough to stave off the horrors of Nazi and Soviet atrocities, and anything resembling them in form if not size. But it's still so sad for our country. And really, the United States (and Britain, as it turns out) should stop applauding itself for intervening to stop the Holocaust. As Snyder mentions: by the time the doughboys landed at Normandy, most of the worst of it was over. Bureaucratic interposers are the unlikely heroes of this book, with diplomats from China, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and other less congratulated nations issuing sham passports that saved tens of thousands of lives. Meanwhile, in an America demonstrating its tendency toward miserliness and apathy to the travails of ""others,"" our Jewish refugee policy was contemptible in the extreme. To wit:""Between July 1942 and June 1943, only 4,705 Jews were admitted to the United States. Fewer than the number of Warsaw Jews who were killed on a given day in Treblinka in the Summer of 1942.""Perhaps if we spent less time congratulating ourselves we would understand our humane obligations better? Maybe if we understood how short we've fallen in past times of need, we would be more charitable, neighborly citizens of the world....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"May 24, 2017","May 27, 2017","May 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23995415-black-earth

Interrogators hope to get access to secret, front-of-mind information; attorneys seek an uncharacterized narrative; psychologists aim to obtain insight into thought processes free from outside coaxing. Regardless of the outcome sought, the outpouring is meant to be purer and more precious than that which can be elicited through the normal foxtrot of conversation, where the give-and-take permits more time to regain one's footing, and to predict through experience where the conversation will go. For this reason, and perhaps for a sense of verisimilitude, this type of soliloquy is rare in novels. And while I’m not sure I would call “Outline” a novel, I’m not sure the distinction much matters. I see this book as an additional entry in a list of recent books that blur the boundaries between the short story collection and the novel, and do so with stunning prose, a masterful grasp of tone, and the impressive inventiveness required to gin up the cast of disparate, quirky, and realistic characters.

I did my undergraduate degree in history at UVA, and focused on American history in the South, specifically in the past Century. As someone who figured he would one day end up in law school, and Constitutional law seeming far more majestic in undergrad than in law school, I paid special attention to seminal American case law during my undergraduate studies. Carrie Buck, the plaintiff in this case, went to school at Venable Elementary School, a magnificent Palladian building where I often voted and more often passed on tippled walks to frat houses. Buck's story is somewhat incidental to the setting of this book, but it is tragic and important to know: after having been raped and gotten pregnant thereby, Ms. Buck was sterilized by the state of Virginia for having ""loose morals"" and for being ""feeble minded."" These were the rough categories (they also lumped in epileptics, a group whose stigmatization seems even more bizarre than the others in retrospect) that somehow defied substantive due process analysis over the years and resulted in 60,000-70,000 Americans being sterilized--most of them against their will, many of them without their knowledge--in the Twentieth Century in the United States. Carrie Buck wasn't even of low intelligence, and neither was the only daughter she ever had, but the justifications never really mattered to anyone who supported eugenics, a slippery pseudoscience that prospered in the United States and gave Hitler and his ilk some of their most reprehensible and destructive ideas about racial purity and inspired their histrionics over civilizational decline. I think my favorite feature of this book was the deserved savaging of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., a towering walrus-visaged elitist whom we are instructed to adulate as law students. Holmes' legal writing is held up as some sort of Olympian standard, and legal writing instructors practically swoon over the supposed brilliance of his prose. But I could never get it out of my head that he wrote this case--including its famous epigram that ""three generations of imbeciles [was] enough""--and from this book I learned that he was not only proud of his role, but drew energy from it!

The concept would be missing something or regretting not having had the chance to appreciate something that you've never encountered. I suppose I've felt this way about monuments--the Hanging Gardens of Babylon! the Colossus of Rhodes! the old Penn Station!--and about the ultrarevered and legendary--Abe Lincoln! Emma Goldman! Nikolai Tesla! Benjamin Franklin! Buddha!--but almost by definition it's difficult to have such feelings about people you didn't know were great. Cursory Google searches have yielded some promising contenders--the German Sehnsucht and probably most closely the Welsh Hiraeth--but I've yet to come across anything that captures the sensation of feeling deep regret over never having met or enjoyed the potential of someone you didn't know was great, someone like President James A. Garfield. This book is largely about him, his virtues and his seriously improbable rise to the presidency, and the demented, deluded maniac who laid waste to his great potential. Garfield was in the style of true reformist Radical Republicans, and one wonders if more like him were raised to the position whether we might have had an actual Reconstruction and a more equitable society in the modern era. At least as Millard portrays him, he is virtue crystallized, and an honorable, friendly, hale man at that. Aside from Garfield's rise and brief reign as president, the book is composed of explorations of Garfield's murderer's delusions, Alexander Graham Bell's quixotic attempts to deploy science to save the moribund Garfield, and pre-modern medicine's fumbling attempts at curing the ailing president, who likely would have lived had he been left to simply rest and not been surrounded by prodding, cleocentric mountebanks lousy with bacteria and positively covered in surgical goo.

I'm not sure it got me there, but there were some interesting points, however briefly they were explored. The book uses the heuristic of The Colony (inhabited by racial minorities, most of whom are Black, and the poor, most of whom are minorities) and The Nation (where the rest of us live) to expose the ""Two Americas"" that we inhabit. The Colony receives order (submitting to the police state or risking death, even absent Constitutional authority) in return for giving profit (in Fergusson-type scenarios where fines for petty crimes subsidize the rich and white) to the Nation. None of this is a particularly fresh take, nor is this topic much enhanced by being interlarded with stories of Hayes' white-boy privilege, the only thing that really sets this book apart from the works of other, earlier (mostly Black) authors and social critics. So for most of the book, my assessment was ""So what?"" But Hayes redeems himself slightly toward the end. He explores some interesting ideas about American's love for retribution (compared with our European counterparts' more humane approaches) being rooted in our election of prosecutors and (ironically) our lesser tolerance for aristocracy (the idea being that Europeans began to think that more clement ""aristocratic justice"" should eventually be extended to all, while we in the colonies started with a perhaps admirable tradition of treating all malefactors to the stocks, even if the days of throwing the book at the rich with equal frequency are long past us). He also touches on the role of guns in maintaining racial hierarchies, and highlights America's incarceration mania by mentioning that if America were all white, we'd still have the 16th highest incarceration rate in the world, a simply staggering statistic given how suffused our society is with the doctrine of white supremacy.The problem is that he never really explores these interesting points!

Some of them I had previously read and some of them sounded familiar. Among the latter group was Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist, the sole book that I snatched up. It's a taut thriller related in one sitting; a short but suspenseful and well-crafted book exploring Western and non-Western values and power balances. It was entertaining if a bit over the top, and I was eager to see where the author went next. So when this book started generating a lot of buzz, I became intrigued. I reserved it from the library in an avalanche of other books, and until a friend whose taste I respect lauded it, I thought it would be one I just ended up returning to the library before fines began to accrue.In this, Hamid's next book, the author takes on the global refugee crisis, imbuing a story with humanity, uncertainty, and intrigue through a simple but effective science-fiction conceit. As with his previous book, this one is remarkably short. But unlike with his last book, I didn't think the economy of words or plot lines did the story any favors. This book felt a little thin on plot--like there could have been a hundred more pages exploring Nadia and Saeed's futures (not to mention 50 fewer of the tangential stories featuring unnamed characters whose place I'm still not sure is justified).Hamid is an excellent writer--poetic, truth-giving, compassionate.

Law school debates, which strain in principle under the most fabulous of hypothetical facts, would often devolve into discussions of whether or not necrophilia should be illegal--not for anyone's prurient interest (as far as I know, that is!), but as a way of teasing out what interests we had in our bodies after we ceased to inhabit them, and whether this prohibition wasn't just the most culturally defensible (but ultimately incoherent) manifestation of society's exercise of its ability to police under the aegis of moral authority, even absent any identifiable victims. Inevitably this would dredge up conversations regarding what constitutes an injury/victim, and the whole conversation would be very illuminating (if you could stand the particular hypotheticals). More than anything, the reactions from genteel passersby were priceless. These reactions and several of my more hidebound friends' outright refusal to participate led me to assume that there was some predisposition animating our collective preoccupation with how we treat corpses. Cremation--an act of commission that destroys the body shortly after it becomes a corpse--seemed to be the preference of the secular and agnostic/atheist types, whereas plain old burial represented a more catholic (and big-C Catholic, it turns out--the process became much more popular following Vatican II's relaxation of prohibition on cremation, according to this book!) and traditional Western means of disposing of a body. I suppose I dismissed the preoccupation with burial remains and whatnot as a parochial tendency to want to elevate humanity above everything else, or as sentimental attachment to esteeming ourselves as more than matter and the electric impulses that animate us. I considered myself on the former end of this spectrum until reading this book. It made me squirm more than a few times due to the author's ribald take on death and the human body, but it turns out that even she had her limits, spare as they are in appearance. The author takes a very dry, humorous approach to death without seeming disrespectful, and covers a lot of ground, sharing interesting anecdotes and facts in the process.

Vance was a legit maverick and not some sociopathic hack, but I think that ship has sailed with his move to Ohio (post-venture-capital stint) and full embrace of Trump's worm-brained worldview. Don't waste your time with this complete prevarication of a book. Original :I've got mixed feelings about this, but that's a required caveat for books ""of the moment,"" I suppose. ""Hillbilly Elegy"" is Vance's tale of growing up poor and backward among loving but unstable characters in the increasingly common areas sapped of opportunity and inhabited by white people. Vance's story is simply astounding, from the ""hillbilly justice"" that his grandparents meted out for the smallest affronts, to the myriad anecdotes of conspicuous consumption, domestic violence, drug use, and atrocious parenting, to Vance's miraculous ascent to the acme of American professionalism and the intellectual elite. And he's an able writer, too, avoiding the tortuous sentences to which lawyers are attracted (*ahem* and which so often infect the ramblings on this page!), writing in a clipped, pithy voice.But there were a few things that bugged me about this book. First, I am the product of a pretty stable and normal middle class suburban upbringing, so I really could not relate to much of his childhood or adolescence, which make up the vast bulk of this book. Accordingly, I took Vance at his word and didn't assume anything was embellished or exaggerated for effect. Yet our legal educations were about as similar as you could get--his third year of law school at Yale was my first year at Harvard, and I knew several people in his small class--yet the world that he describes seems different from anything I've been witness to either first-hand or close second-hand. The central motif of the book seems to be that ""hillbillies"" are hardworking, goodhearted individuals who have lost the ability to get by in today's society, and this has amplified their more destructive tendencies--violence, pride, fear of the foreign/new, substance abuse--to their collective detriment. Vance is the object lesson in why that is so sad, wasteful, and regretful--he holds himself out as someone for whom a rare permutation of fortunate factors conspired in his favor, rocketing him to the top of the legal and professional worlds (and look out for him in the next Ohio gubernatorial race, folks, because I bet Vance will bill himself as the anti-Trump Republican in the Evan McMullin mold), where he flourishes. There are a few different ways to take this: the cynic would say that Vance is exceptionally intelligent, and a gifted and charismatic writer the likes of which are hard to find, even in the vaunted gothic halls of Yale Law, while the optimist would think that there are probably so many people just like Vance yet not so lucky whom the poverty and cultural vices of Appalachia undercut unnecessarily, arbitrarily depriving the world of their considerable gifts. I would agree with both positions, but the conspicuous thing is that Vance spends so much of his time detailing how unprepared and untutored he is for the professional, academic, East Coast urban world. And I think he's laying it on a bit thick.At one point in the book Vance mentions that elite law schools such as Yale are never ending rat races: getting in, getting good grades, writing onto law , wangling prestigious clerkships, trying to plot your career out decades in advance. This, in sum and substance, is accurate. But it's less accurate in the specifics of his description. Vance tries to demonstrate the importance of law  by suggesting that there are certain jobs that won't even look at your application if you haven't made it on the Yale Law Journal, but that is almost verifiably untrue. Sure there might be some crusty old Eli judge who only hires Yale people and has a snooty preference for law  types, but even Supreme Court clerkships--the shiniest of prizes to which law students aspire--don't require that you were on law , nor even that you went to an Ivy League/top 10 school. There's another point at which Vance describes his confusion at the 15 different forms of cutlery at an unimaginably stuffy New Haven dinner thrown during the offensively decadent law firm courtship process, and laments that he didn't have any idea where to start or what to use for which dish, but I'm willing to wager that the vast majority of Yalies who don't remember this scene from Titanic wouldn't have a clue, either. Later in that same vignette he wonders what the office of career services meant when they instructed students to ""act normal"" during interviews, likely overlooking (or not understanding) that for folksy, ""regular"" guys like himself, he had nothing to worry about; that instruction was likelier for the legions of cerebrally brilliant but socially inept and off-putting folks pullulating at the elite law schools of the country, yet he turns it into another secret handshake to whose meaning he is not privy; it's just not the case. There's also the one time far earlier in the book when he casually drops that his mother and whichever man she was dating at the time pulled in over $100,000 per year between them, which is an ample amount on which to live, even with children, in all but the most expensive areas of the most expensive cities in this country, and must be practically royalty money in the area of Appalachia from which he hails. And finally, I could never get it out of my head that Vance's linkedin profile lists him as having worked in venture capital for the past year (in San Francisco if I recall correctly), one of the few lucrative paths for elite law students that is not easier to go down than a greased slide, indicating to me that his whole ""I'm a rube, but I'm a smart one! I just needed some instruction that all these other kids seemed born with!"" shtik is a bit disingenuous. I certainly have an upbringing, undergraduate experience, and post-college resume more conducive to private equity than he does, and arguably attended a law school that is likelier to send you down that acquisitive path, but I wouldn't have had the foggiest idea of how to go about becoming a speculative financier, and it's telling that all but the most calculating of law school peers forewent that path as well. A final point about authenticity: I was even surprised at the end of the book when Vance announced that he'd voiced the audiobook himself; he belabored his Southern twang and yet his voice for the hours I listened to it sounded as Mid-Atlantic as your average cosmopolitan newscaster.My second point is less a critique, because I don't think this is really up to Vance, but I feel like this book is being read by white liberals who are eager to ""understand"" why Trump won the election (or at least to be able to say they've read this book and to push for more complex explanations of disaffected white America, which was the goal of yours truly), and less by the individuals whom it was designed to paternalistically admonish--Vance's fellow hillbillies. There's a lot that I don't like about the book--it takes a far too sanguine view on things like white Americans' reasons for disliking President Obama (unstated but impossible to miss was this future-Ohio-gubernatorial-candidate-friendly takeaway: it has almost nothing to do with race!), and it gives manipulators like Fox News and prosperity gospel churches far too much of a pass considering how much of the book is dedicated to describing a warped, unhealthy culture. But it is written by an insider (the above criticisms and skepticism notwithstanding), and it does charge these people with taking seriously the deterioration of their lives and with recognizing the etiology of these various pathologies as of their own making. I think it could be very useful, but I would imagine it's being read far more frequently in Brooklyn than in Kentucky.

The Founders made a lot of assumptions, many of them incompatible with the 21st Century reality that we inhabit. Namely: * That the citizenry could count on media of repute to champion and effectively disseminate truth* That citizens would not stand for corrupt or inept politicians, no matter their sympathies to the ends those politicians aimed to advance; and * That good ideas would prevail on their own merits, not on the wealth or standing of those espousing them. I'm of the opinion that we are too oversaturated with ideological news sources, too mired in bureaucracy to effectively deal with corruption and ineptitude, and too polarized by the two-party system, respectively, to cope with serious threats to democracy that the Kochs--ultimate fagins of malversation--present. So on that count, this book was depressing. Paraphrasing my friend Christine: this book was great, but in the end it just made me really angry without much of an outlet for that frustration.But it did get me thinking.First--why are these moneyed interests so viscerally anti-Obama? Only in myth is the Democratic party anything but the handmaiden of corporate America. Sure, Democrats might slap the absolute worst offenders with effectively meaningless fines for actions that in any peer nation would constitute high crimes, but the stock market has soared under Democrats, and the rich have reaped the vast majority of it. I would like to think it's something more than racism, but that also doesn't account for the Koch's militarization behind Trump and against Clinton. And I think simply swapping sexism for racism in the equation is a bit too simplified. But I'm baffled by the business community's desire to leave Trump in power instead of a relatively moderate, corporation-friendly--not to mention temperamentally stable--candidate like Clinton. Could it be that the Kochs and their constituency have lost it? That their emotions carry the day? Unclear, but unanswered by this otherwise trenchant text. Second--one of the things that this book chronicles so well was its delineation of the Kochs' role in legitimating marginal libertarian thoughts through little more than tons of pressure and money. Conservatives have achieved significant success through their use of indispensable funds and brinksmanship to first present, then normalize, radical ideas. Far from aping this strategy, Democrats have responded in typically feckless fashion, glancing nervously to an ever rightward-shifting middle for their choices of policies and bugbears. Part of this is an ingrained, generational fear of being labeled ""anti-American"" and ""communist,"" holdovers that will hopefully die off with the expiration of the old guard who still search beneath the bed at night for Joseph McCarthy. But it made me wonder: what could a left-leaning plutocrat propose in order to re-center and make more progressive the current narrative for Democrats in politics? One thing that most people seem to agree on is that the Democrats lost the 2016 Election in large part (if not primarily) because they failed to address or offer solutions to the economic marginalization of the poor and middle classes, especially among more-likely-to-vote rural whites. If these people are really so desperate, are we still inhabiting a political climate in which it is taboo to embrace class consciousness and wealth redistribution? If these people were desperate enough to vote for a clownish charlatan like Donald Trump, are they really going to sour on a politician who boldly admits that she supports, nay demands, a strong redistribution of wealth? That healthcare should be paid for by the rich of this country? That the richest only get to hold on to their wealth and power because we have forbeared from gibbeting them and taking their stuff, which is the historical way of things when the hardworking poor and middle classes are pushed to the brink by greedy and unfeeling plutocrats?This is all probably too Jacobin for an America where Donald Trump could be elected president, but part of me believes the timing is more opportune than ever.

It's a bit grandiloquent and certainly misnamed, but the logic is sound. Essentially, he maintains that you're totally free to cry in public in New York, because of some combination of 1) people are accustomed to emotional outbursts in public here; 2) we're all too rushed and self-absorbed to really notice anyone else; and 3) it's hard to spot people you know amidst the throngs of humanity.

My smallish Brooklyn apartment doesn’t allow for much accumulation, but I have crammed it full of all sorts of unnecessary raiment and gewgaws that I sometimes have to pause and purge. This gives me a week or so of calm, but then I just find uses for the new space I’ve freed up. Books are part of this pathology, and I have a pile of library books at the foot of my bed, some of which I have renewed more than 20 times from the Brooklyn and Manhattan Public Libraries. Why do I keep getting new books to the neglect of these ones gathering dust on my floor? I don’t really know. A normal reaction to this accumulation might be “I should read or return them before I collect any others!” but my reaction is “I don’t have any more space to fit physical books, but my iPhone has all of this space and the libraries’ websites just make it so easy…” so I end up downloading a ton of books that way. I listen to audiobooks on double speed, so I make short work of them, but there are definitely some books that lie moldering in my eBook “pile”—apologies to Don DeLillo’s “Zero K.” Anyway, given that there’s no downside to collecting these books—you can’t even be charged overdue fees! They automatically expire after 14 or 21 days!—the worst of my acquisitiveness occurs at these moments.In one of these binges, I came across a book that seemed to be popping up quite a bit in others’ s and had been displayed prominently in a number of visually alluring bookstore windows. But other than that credential, I didn’t have much reason to believe that it was good or that I would like it.But this book was so good! It is taut and interesting, clever without spiraling into metaphysical minutiae, has a protagonist whom you’re rooting for, and touches on some really powerful questions, like what would it be like to have taken the path less traveled? What are the tradeoffs of ambition and cultivating a personal life, and what lengths you would go for—and what you might sacrifice—in order to protect the ones you love. To do all of these in a highly conceptual theoretical physics milieu (I will spare you my amateurish concerns and observations about the relationship between human nature and observation and the fabrication of multiple universes) is all the more impressive.Bravo, Blake Crouch!...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Apr 03, 2017","Apr 05, 2017","Apr 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27833670-dark-matter

This was a right enjoyable picaresque, telling the story of a quirky and wily John Brown, who raided Harper's Ferry in the lead up to the Civil War. The narrator is a Black boy of twelve who spends the greater portion of the novel in a state of bemused ambivalence about the quixotic adventure.Probably my favorite part of this book was its folksy Southern sayings, whose amassing is all the more remarkable given that the author was raised by his white, Jewish mother in Red Hook, about an hour's walk away from where I live in Brooklyn. A sampling of my favorites:* ""His hair was so nappy you could light a match on it""* ""She was so pretty I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers""* ""He was jangling so much that he sounded like a walking hardware store""* ""She had a face that could make a train leave its track""* ""Her breath smelled so bad it could stop a clock""* And in one single paragraph he not only describes a woman as ""pretty as a peeled onion"" but also ""calm as lettuce""... whatever that means.Brown is so headstrong and confident of the righteousness of his plan, not only for the country but for the Black folk who might get killed in the process, that I thought that this tale might serve as an object lesson in the perils of white saviorhood. It reads like an affectionate but quizzical look at this strange man, at least up until the tender last scenes.Overall the characters are well developed and the action is spritely and entertaining.

I think I may have been handicapped a bit by the fact that I wasn't really familiar with the legends of Theseus on which this book is based. Because of this, interactions and scenes that may have been exact analogues ended up seeming a bit spatchcocked, and the book caromed around Philadelphia and New York with an almost dreamlike cadence--transitions were largely elided, characters would enter and interact with undue familiarity, and the drama vacillated between the mundane and the bizarre.

Their opposite messianic narratives are ones we know well: Reagan's, that government is the bane of freedom and enemy of prosperity; and Johnson's, that government checks the baser instincts of man and is the only force potent and restrained enough to inaugurate peace and prosperity. It's an intriguing premise, but one that mostly just bookends the bulk of the book, which seems to be a narrative of the psyches leading these men to the presidency and the internal tribulations that rankled their ambitions. In other words, it was informative, but it perhaps overpromised. I liked this book, and it sure as hell made me want to read an unbiased book about Reagan, much as this will probably earn me the same stinkeye on the subway that I reserve for people wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats (or really any red hats these days). I'm both more impressed with LBJ (my god he accomplished a lot!) and more jaded for learning of his machinations (the idea that Democrats had to embroil the nation in Asian land wars with Communists just to parry claims that they were Red sympathizers strikes me, albeit in hindsight, as so ridiculous and so sad, given the toll it took on our country and on the browner peoples of the globe; and it makes me admire Obama that much more for undertaking healthcare without a rattling saber. And the way LBJ treated that loyal gay aide was really shameful), and disgusted and intrigued by Reagan (he used to be a New Deal Democrat? And why are we talking about Mike Pence calling his wife ""mother"" when Reagan called Nancy ""Mommy""? *shudder*). Like so many pre-2016-Election books, this one ends on a hopeful note that seems almost comical in hindsight. This is literally the last paragraph of the book:The problem for today’s political system—and it is an existential one—is that people no longer believe those myths. To fix its broken politics, today’s America needs new stories. Or, perhaps it just needs a new version of an old one: the shared version that Johnson and Reagan discarded in the course of their 1000 days. The old consensus vision of Roosevelt and Kennedy contained lasting wisdom that today’s leaders would do well to adopt. In that world view, politicians had to be deeply realistic and humble when making promises for the future. For they knew that the future never turned out exactly the way it’s going to. But they also had to have the courage to tell people that though government would never be able to solve all of its people’s problems, it had a sacred obligation to try. That old vision could serve America well in an often frightening new century. The answer to our problems may come from a leader who brings such a simple message. It is a message that neither Reagan nor Johnson had much use for, but that the story of both of their lives confirms: what lies ahead of us is not the certain promise of utopia, but the infinite possibilities of life itself.*Sigh* One can hope we'll sober up before it's too late.All in all, an informative and interesting book, even if it was more underappreciated historical summary than anything else....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 28, 2017","Mar 30, 2017","Mar 28, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17288749-landslide

I feel obligated to mention how I came to this book. I did my undergraThis gets a solid 3.5 stars, but more for effort than for objectivity or verve. I feel obligated to mention how I came to this book. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Virginia, which Thomas Jefferson founded and which ranked as one of the three accomplishments that Jefferson deemed worthy of constituting his epitaph (he didn't even list ""President""!). The love is no less genuine or intense going the other way, either, with the school's unofficial sobriquet being ""Mr. Jefferson's University."" You could characterize the adoration as distortive, as honest conversations about the man's slaveholding and relationship with Sally Hemings were frowned upon in a Victorian way, such honest accounts being viewed as somehow ""untoward."" Gradually over my years in Charlottesville I adopted the approach that Jefferson's sins did not cancel out his accomplishments, but nor did his accomplishments expiate his sins. But as with my approach to the Catholic religion that I inherited but disavowed, though my appreciation for the original became complicated by nuance, my hostility to the enemy of the thing I originally revered never much abated. Hamilton being Jefferson's well-known bête noire, I've always been suspicious of the man. Throw in a wildly popular musical whose ubiquitous approbation among liberals beggars credulity and my hefty skepticism for the capitalism, monarchism, and corporatism with which he imbued our early country and, well: that's a sizable deficit of antipathy to overcome. So that was my predisposition before starting the book.""Hamilton"" is shopped as a biography, but veering as it did into hagiography at times, it felt less even-handed than most biographies I've come across. Chernow seems to me a small-""c"" conservative, and that is only lightly occluded by the thrust of the text. Chernow repeatedly displays a clear reverence for incrementalism and tradition over Jacobin impulses, and this flatters Hamilton's approach to politics. There were moments where my jaw dropped at Chernow's pearl-clutching, particularly regarding the French Revolution. At one point, Chernow approvingly repeats a quote by William Pitt the Younger, stating that the beheading of the French monarch during the Reign of Terror was ""the foulest and most atrocious act the world has ever seen."" I gasped at the myopia of the statement, knowing little but sufficient enough of what gory mischief European monarchs themselves have commissioned in all of their majesty throughout the centuries; reactions such as these gave the impression that the author doubts whether the French Revolution was really worth ""all the fuss,"" history's consensus notwithstanding. But it's not just Chernow's approval of Hamilton's critical influence on the formation of the modern neoliberal regime that seems less than objective. Slanders and calumnies against Hamilton are dismissed almost peremptorily in a way that seems wildly inconsistent. For example, despite knowing, as we all do, that Hamilton died for his bastardry-informed inability to let stand any affront to his honor, Chernow mentions a rumor voiced by a certain Nicholson that Hamilton spirited away 100,000 pounds sterling in British banks while Treasury Secretary; curious then, that although Hamilton knew of this slur, he apparently never did anything to disprove it or ""demand satisfaction"" [challenge its accuser to a duel]. Yet Chernow just dismisses it as ""ridiculous."" Overall, Chernow tries to paint a nuanced picture of Hamilton, and one gets the sense that his obfuscations and unevenness are not deliberate, yet when he insists that Hamilton loathed the slave trade and ""only"" bought *a few* slaves for his brother- and sister-in-law, one wonders how truly critical he has been of all of Hamilton's other faults and inconsistencies.Hamilton seemed by all accounts brilliant, as capable a leader of men as Washington and even more of a polymath than Jefferson (whose was certainly dulled by this account, slanted against him as this work may have been). I truly have never felt less adequate for my age than upon learning that this bastard from the Caribbean was aide-de-camp to George Washington at age 25 and is still one of the most storied politicians in American history, despite having died in his 40s! But this book falls victim to that peculiarly (or perhaps acutely?) American foible of treating our Founding Fathers like heroes, rather than the deeply flawed, complex humans that they were. In a way, reading about fake news in the National Gazette (Jefferson said that anything was made suspicious, merely by dint of appearing in a newspaper!), and about partisan recriminations of the most vile character made our present situation that much more palatable and, well... normal. Not because I think we'll get through it (ha! who knows?), but because we've always been a nation led by self-interested, flawed men, and this is not necessarily much, much worse, just a different variety of bad. By casting the Founding as a time of pure virtue, selflessness, truth, honor and country above self, and unity above all, we do unnecessary disservice to our modern selves. So: let us embrace the flaws in our forebears with the same tenacity with which we bemoan them in the present!...more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Mar 22, 2017","Mar 28, 2017","Mar 22, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16130.Alexander_Hamilton

Looking at the vast differences between men and women, whether value-laden or not, scientists, anthropologists, sociologists, gender theorists have all concluded that testosterone is a hell of a hormone, and must be responsible for spurring all of those masculine qualities in men that lead to these disparities. But Fine trenchantly demonstrates that in almost every situation, the case is overpleaded for the role of testosterone. Rather, we as a society (or really all liberal democratic societies) have decided that--unlike for race, say--there are differences between men and women. So naturally, some of them are going to be expressed in ways that work out to benefit men for the most part in some cases, and women in others. And Fine doesn't disagree with this idea, she just thinks it is wildly overblown, and that far more often than not, ""boys will be boys"" and testosterone and masculine entrepreneurialism are scapegoats for what amounts to our refusal to deal with the (considerable) remnants of sexism in society.Recommended for anyone with daughters and for anyone who suspects that intrinsic differences between the sexes can't add up to our sex disparities and seeks proof thereof....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 25, 2017","Apr 30, 2017","Mar 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30231724-testosterone-rex

As others have mentioned, the first 1/3 or so reads like a “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” and is devoted to explaining the trappings of extreme plutocracy and the ways by which the purseproud rich have bent the machinery of government and the economy to their wills and fortunes.

But the book redeems itself in its latter parts. Freeland ably demonstrates the maudlin lamentations of the persecuted rich, who imagine themselves besieged by business friendly regimes such as the Obama administration. She explores what are, amazingly, sincere beliefs held by moderate and democratic stalwarts such as Chuck Schumer (ugh) and Mike Bloomberg (ugh), who earnestly believe that “overregulation” of the financial industry is inimical to the prosperity of places like NYC and the United States. And she concludes with the cautionary tale of Venice, once the most prosperous and populous of Europe’s cities, which launched to prominence on the strength of inclusive economic policies and stagnated on a retrenchment of opportunity.

Joking (?) aside, this book was really informative. It traces the disconnect between the imperative of equality mandated by the Declaration of Independence and the unequivocal defense of property and class fissures enshrined in the Constitution, and how the parties have tried out various forms of compromise between these two mostly incompatible visions of America. The Republican Party, the Party of Lincoln, was founded (according to Richardson) in support of values of meritocracy, equality, and anti-plutocracy--essentially a party against the symbolism and actual power of the benighted Plantation South. Unfortunately, shortly after prevailing in the Civil War when those ideals were put to the test and prevailed, the GOP lost its way and became bedfellows with big business. Things carried on pell-mell until Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson sparred over which party was heir to the aegis of progressive politics. The concept belonged to no one, but when the revanchist Taft wing had their bid sundered by Teddy Roosevelt and his progressivism, and when their Democratic opponent had progressive tendencies, the GOP began solidifying its image as the party against progress, though I'm sure that even then they had better branding. Although some progressive notes were sounded in the interim, the first half of the 20th Century was claimed by Democrats; ultimately, the hidebound ""Taft Wing"" of the party wrested control, leading to the Movement Conservatism that has afflicted us and the world over the past few decades. The true hero of this book seems to be Eisenhower. Eisenhower represented perhaps the last great hope for sanity from a party opposing what experience and peer states have proven to be the superior system, and the rest has been a shambles of manipulation and cynicism. He accepted the New Deal as not only popular but good, and seemed a true statesman, capable of putting country over self and especially over party, a skill of which the modern incarnation of the GOP is wholly bereft. In addition to his baleful warnings about the Military Industrial Complex, Eisenhower realized, we are told, that . . . economically dispossessed people were natural targets for political and religious extremists. They could easily be manipulated by a strong leader to back a cause--any cause--that promised to resurrect a world in which they had enjoyed prosperity and cultural significance. Such extremism had been dangerous enough in the hands of the Nazis, but 1945 gave quite specific shape to Eisenhower's fears. The atomic bomb . . . changed the meaning of human conflict.Richardson's coverage of Sen. McCarthy also rings bells for those who lament our modern political dysphoria: Party that they could advance an agenda by use of fiction, as long as that fiction spoke to Americans' fears and could be kept from pen scrutiny. McCarthy's demagoguery gave Taft's die-hard followers a new style. He yelled; he made crazy accusations; he leaked fragments of truth that misrepresented reality; he hectored and badgered. He got in the faces of people who mattered. His antics got attention. Although a senator--about as inside a job as one can get--he posed as an outsider taking on what he insisted was a corrupt system. Claiming his opponents were bent on destroying America, he promised to defend it.And more presaging of Trump:Conservatives' anti-intellectualism became a strength. That their rhetoric did not address reality mattered less than that it seemed to offer a comforting route to bring back the prosperity and security voters associated with an idyllic American past.There were some periods where I would have been proud to have called myself a Republican, but the influence of business interests seems to have been too strong on the whole. Principled past leaders aside, the current incarnation of the GOP is exactly where the past fifty years has intended for it to be. The grand experiment begun by Lincoln has failed spectacularly.

The trajectory was London (solo), Marrakech (with my best friend from high school), then Lisbon and Madrid (with my best friend from college). The weird thing was that I was in Lisbon and Madrid with a bunch of friends who had been teaching in Morocco, and in Morocco with a group who had been studying at London School of Economics. Weirder still--the college friend whom I was visiting in Lisbon and Madrid is now teaching at the London School of Economics. This is a web of phenomena that I feel like Murakami might be interested in. I mention this because at the time I was a very slow reader and not particularly interested in literature. But my friend in Morocco was reading an intriguing looking tome by Murakami called The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. I kind of ended up having a total friend crush on this charismatic friend-of-a-friend, and the way he described the book to me sounded irresistible. I bought it upon returning to the United States and commenced reading. I was a different person then with different tastes, but I loathed it. And the length of the book, highlighted by my pre-law-school glacial pace of reading, combined with the way that certain storylines frayed and seemed wholly unnecessary made me resentful of Murakami.But friends and colleagues have been reading him lately and I have been left wondering if I hadn't been too hard on him. So, on a recent trip to Cuba where I had last minute fears that I would run out of books to read, I took to feverishly raiding the Brooklyn and New York public libraries' audiobook collections.

Not so wiWith most of the political screeds I consume, I find myself thinking about them in two- (Congressional) and four- (Presidential) year terms. Not so with Klein’s trenchant call to action. Klein examines the incompatibility between our current zealous capitalism and the continuation of life as we know it on planet Earth, and strikes an appropriately baleful tone throughout. Our tendencies and habits are both so baked into our way of life and yet so harmful that we are headed for a calamity, either of our comforts or something far less weatherable and reversible. When I read about other issues that engage my sympathies, I tend to think “A better President/Congress will enact this, if we’re lucky,” but the warning Klein issues is that we are already past the tipping point, and even if we took drastic measures we might not avert the disaster she warns of. And because we are nowhere near the point of coordinating for such massive austerity measures, I wonder if there’s much hope for us at all, aside from the magical thinking of global engineering that Klein views with appropriate suspicion.Climate change is something like healthcare reform or educational policy for which I toe the liberal line but which has never been forefront of my concerns about society or the world. I live in the city, I recycle, I take public transportation, I don’t travel much, I buy second-hand clothing and get my books from the library, but I’m sure there is a lot more I could be doing. I’m not sure it will keep the rivers from boiling off the land or the seas from turning subacid, but I’m scared enough to investigate.As with her other works, Klein is brutal, thorough, and brilliant.

It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-surviThere are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human.

I wish I had read this earlier, because I think I was woefully ignorant of the abuses and unconstitutional postures taken by the Bush administration until at least the beginning of my law school days, but the scope creep of the executive from Bush to Obama to Trump is almost too baleful to contemplate under the current administration. In highest dudgeon I've certainly lobbed my fair share of insults at the current president. I wonder if I'll be flagged as a subversive? A few things in particular stand out as prescient--particularly regarding ""fake news""--after a grueling first week of the Trump presidency:""The great masses of the people will more easily fall victims of a big lie than a small one"" Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf. Fascists rely on perception management: what the intelligence community calls ""info ops"" because their tactics won't stand scrutiny by a free press. So, in a fascist shift, as real reporters are being frozen out, smeared, or faced with unemployment, there is an increasing use of spectacle in conveying a message, and the spectacle is accompanied by the production of fake news and false documents. The messaging, combined with the spectacle, can be stunning in a fascist ascendancy. Fascist messaging has advantage that democratic communications and advocacy, even of the highest sophistication, just cannot demonstrate. You can use a monolithic, harmonized voice and vision, unimpeded by dissent, rather than trying to break through a clash of pluralistic arguments. This power of epic messaging--in combination with power of spectacle--is a well known aspect of the seduction of fascism.Dictatorships specialize in faking news and falsifying documents. Hitler wrote that ""All effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points, and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand."" He argued that good propaganda speaks to feelings and not reason, and that it should never admit a glimmer of doubt in its own claims or concede the tiniest element of right in the claims of the other side.After a certain point in a fascist shift, it doesn't matter whether most people believe the faked news or not. Eventually, they simply don't have access to enough good information to assess what is real and what is not.Sending a current of lies into the information scene is part of classic psychological operations to generate a larger shift, a new reality in which the truth can no longer be ascertained and no longer counts. In this reality, citizens no longer feel empowered or able to establish the truth on either side, and therefore give up their agency. At this point, people can be manipulated into supporting almost any state action, for how can citizens know what is right? Truth itself has been cheapened, made subjective, and internal, not absolute and external.And this profoundly sad final note from the last part of the book reminds me of a joke a friend told me recently. He said that in the 1980s a Republican went over to a Democrat's house to play a game of checkers. They agreed on the rules, made a few moves, and then at some point the Republican got up, threw a bomb at the house, and began spraying kerosene everywhere. Meanwhile, inside, the Democrat is looking out for double-jumps and opportunities to get kinged.We in America are used to a democratic social contract in which there is agreement about the rules of the game. When Congress demands an answer, for instance, the President does not simply refuse to pick up the phone. So we keep being startled when the steps of the democratic interplay are ignored. ""He can't do that!"" It's time to notice that they are playing a different game altogether.It's long past time to wake up....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 26, 2017","Jan 28, 2017","Jan 27, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/503432.The_End_of_America

Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.The shoe fits! Pomerantsev is a television producer who brings his knack for setting up dramatic scenes to his account of his ersatz home of Moscow in the modern era. He describes a Russia bereft of ideology and faith in humanity after decades of Kafkaesque bureaucracy, failed policy, destitution and poverty. Where perestroika led not to a Western-style capitalist state on the Scandinavian model but a corrupt kleptocracy no longer fettered by pseudo-communist compunctions about mass accumulations of wealth from a captive people. In this Russia, the only rule is that those with the power to physically compel--whether Putin and the Kremlin or local gangster panjandrums, to the extent they are even separate entities--get their fat cut, and anyone who argues against this dynamic gets killed--the system is far too dear to be criticized. The book explains that this is why in Russia you can now criticize Putin, agitate for gay rights, etc., without especially fearing reprisal. But woe betide he who threatens the money train.Aside from being an exploration of this new cohort of conspicuously consuming NYC-London-Moscow set of Russian billionaires, there are other little vignettes of what happens when anomie and ennui settle in over a people and truth has less intrinsic value. There are tons of interesting stories about gangster auteurs, high class prostitution, and ""sects"" (cults) that pop up and exert extraordinary pull.

I guess I don't understand why people don't like Roth. Yes the parents are always so overbearing and the Jewish-Newark-blue-to-white-collar transition is always at the forefront, but he writes with such intensity. There's always such real anger, regret, indignation (!)... I always try to be vigilant for the pungent misogyny but the women in this book seemed real, complex, admirable. It's true that I strongly doubt that Roth could ever passably write a protagonist not of his gender while maintaining his level of virtuosity, but that's a high standard for any author.And I think he's a writer particularly suited to double-speed audiobook. The intensity almost becomes narcotic. This is maybe my fifth or sixth Roth book... certainly not his best work but a strong reminder of why I adore him as a writer.A final thought, and hopefully not a spoiler: is the book's ending meant to serve as a warning to those who refuse to capitulate? Knuckle under or else? That it's only the grass that stands tall that gets the blade? I'm not really sure how else to read it, but it's a horrifically depressing and terse finish....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 04, 2017","Jan 04, 2017","Jan 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3015764-indignation

Back in 2011 when I was considering law schools, I got a call from a 3L at Harvard who was trying to pitch me on its merits. He was impressive, but not the finest salesman: he was perhaps too honest (he straight up told me that NYU had better clinics, not even attempting to qualify the statement); and he misread my priorities (he told me that one of the advantages of going to Harvard is that you can party at your friends' places in the Hamptons or Martha's Vineyard on weekends and during summers...gag). But he also told me that you had the option of taking classes with the most superlative academic minds in the legal firmament, at which point he dropped the name of Elizabeth Warren, a person whose run for Ted Kennedy's old Senate seat had introduced her to watchful liberals throughout the country. Thankfully Warren became Senator, but with the minuscule disappointment that I never had her for a professor. I didn't really even know what I missed out on until inhaling this book. I mean this in the most admiring, reverential way possible: she is an absolute battleaxe. She is sharp as all get out, not afraid of political fallout, understands this nation's priorities and shortcomings, and fights like hell for the living. It's impossible to say what would have happened had Warren taken up the yoke of the presidential race in 2016, and I'm not entirely sure, given her priorities, whether she would have had the slightest interest (though see Barack Obama's stance on same circa 2006). But I pray that this courageous and tireless woman continues to serve our country in whatever way possible until her outrage--and mine--is exhausted.Also: this audiobook would make a great gift for a liberal/progressive, certainly, but also for moderate or even moderate-conservative friends/family this holiday season.

This is the excoriation that Democrats needed six months ago. It's not a book that presages a lapse Another great and quick listen from Thomas Frank. This is the excoriation that Democrats needed six months ago. It's not a book that presages a lapse into demagoguery, but it does lambaste the Democrats for their unforced error of alienating the working and uneducated classes, classes which the book notes are the bulwark of every successful left or left-leaning political base in the Western world. This book savaged both Clintons (Bill much more so than Hillary), which felt a bit raw. But I appreciated the culmination, a powerful jeremiad against the Clintonian ideology (with a few strong jabs included for good measure against the Clintons' heir and bien pensant Barack Obama), one that feels at once bitter but also necessary medicine in the wake of the 2016 election. I think this is a book that everyone who has thought ""WTF?"" since Nov. 8th, 2016 should read, if only because--having been written before the election--it avoids the backward-looking, still-divisive critiques of HRC's electability and instead inveighs against the entire Democratic Party/left (to the extent they can be said to overlap at all these days) for its folly and its perfidy toward the lower- and middle-classes, while still imparting object lessons we should all be studying assiduously.One curiosity about this book (aside from its failure to mention the whole Allende/Pinochet/""Chicago Boys"" bête noire of the other economic screeds I have been reading lately) is that it doesn't really have a ""recommendations"" section, the way Stiglitz and Huffington and Krugman and other liberal solons typically shoehorn in at the end. It is pure fire, and I'm half tempted to look Frank up, hide my educational credentials, and ask him what the hell we can do about the world we haven't just inherited, but have caused as well. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 07, 2016","Dec 08, 2016","Dec 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25666062-listen-liberal

It's still so hard listening to these books, knowing just how much more unequal this country will become in the coming years (and decades, via the federal judiciary, which is sure to be savaged). But it's also probably more important than ever to understand these things in the wake of the election, especially given the degree to which inequality seems to be animating (or at least permitting) so many of our most shameful political impulses. It's probably not unrelated to my having finished this book that I told a gay staffer for the richest member of Congress, Republican Darrell Issa, that he should go fuck himself shortly after meeting him at a Christmas party in DC this weekend. Political animosity runs both ways, and frankly I think we have more to be angry about.One thing in particular to mourn about our gaping inequalities that Stiglitz has brought up in both of his books is the extent to which the increasingly lucrative field of finance now leaches all of our best and brightest, people who formerly invented, thought, governed, and ran nonprofits.

Overall this book was a bit too long and a bit too academic to really grip me, but there were eerie parallels to our present situation that would grab my attention:On today's complaisant GOP:The attraction which the totalitarian movements exert on the elite, so long as and wherever they have not seized power, has been perplexing because the patently vulgar and arbitrary, positive doctrines of totalitarianism are more conspicuous to the outsider and mere observer than the general mood which pervades the pretotalitarian atmosphere. These doctrines were so much at variance with generally accepted intellectual, cultural, and moral standards that one could conclude that only an inherent fundamental shortcoming of character in the intellectual. . . or a perverse self-hatred of the spirit, accounted for the delight with which the elite accepted the 'ideas' of the mob. . . . What the spokesmen of humanism and liberalism usually overlook, in their bitter disappointment and their unfamiliarity with the more general experiences of the time is that an atmosphere in which all traditional values and propositions had evaporated . . . in a sense made it easier to accept patently absurd propositions than the old truths which had become pious banalities . . . . Vulgarity with its cynical dismissal of respected standards and accepted theories carried with it a frank admission of the worst and a disregard for all pretenses which were easily mistaken for courage and a new style of life....on the flourishing of callousness and the demise of decency:Since the bourgeoisie claimed to be the guardian of Western traditions and confounded all moral issues by parading publicly virtues which it not only did not possess in private and business life, but actually held in contempt, it seemed revolutionary to admit cruelty, disregard human values, and general amorality, because this at least destroyed the duplicity upon which the existing society seemed to rest. What a temptation to flaunt extreme attitudes in the hypocritical twilight of double moral standards, to wear publicly the mask of cruelty if everybody was patently inconsiderate and pretended to be gentle . . . ....on the elevation of economic self-interest over societal good:The mass man whom Himmler organized for the greatest crimes ever committed in history bore the features of the philistine rather than of the mob man, and was the bourgeois who in the midst of the ruins of his world worried about nothing so much as his private security, was ready to sacrifice everything—belief, honor, dignity—on the slightest provocation. Nothing proved easier to destroy than the privacy and private morality of people who thought of nothing but safeguarding their private lives. ...on the refusal to disavow repugnant behavior:The Nazis did not strike at prominent figures as had been done in the earlier wave of political crimes in Germany (the murder of Rathenau and Erzberger); instead, by killing small socialist functionaries or influential members of opposing parties, they attempted to prove to the population the dangers involved in mere membership. This kind of mass terror, which still operated on a comparatively small scale, increased steadily because neither the police nor the courts seriously prosecuted political offenders on the so-called Right. It was valuable as what a Nazi publicist has aptly called 'power propaganda': it made clear to the population at large that the power of the Nazis was greater than that of the authorities and that it was safer to be a member of a Nazi paramilitary organization than a loyal Republican. This impression was greatly strengthened by the specific use the Nazis made of their political crimes. They always admitted them publicly, never apologized for 'excesses of the lower ranks'—such apologies were used only by Nazi sympathizers—and impressed the population as being very different from the 'idle talkers' of other parties.The similarities between this kind of terror and plain gangsterism are too obvious to be pointed out....on the contempt for facts, and the interest would-be totalitarians have in anomie and destruction:Mass leaders in power have one concern which overrules all utilitarian considerations: to make their predictions come true. The Nazis did not hesitate to use, at the end of the war, the concentrated force of their still intact organization to bring about as complete a destruction of Germany as possible, in order to make true their prediction that the German people would be ruined in case of defeat. The propaganda effect of infallibility, the striking success of posing as a mere interpreting agent of predictable forces, has encouraged in totalitarian dictators the habit of announcing their political intentions in the form of prophecy. The most famous example is Hitler's announcement to the German Reichstag in January, 1939: 'I want today once again to make a prophecy: In case the Jewish financiers ... succeed once more in hurling the peoples into a world war, the result will be ... the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe.' Translated into nontotalitarian language, this meant: 'I intend to make war and I intend to kill the Jews of Europe.' . . .As soon as the execution of the victims has been carried out, the 'prophecy' becomes a retrospective alibi: nothing happened but what had already been predicted....This method, like other totalitarian propaganda methods, is foolproof only after the movements have seized power. Then all debate about the truth or falsity of a totalitarian dictator's prediction is as weird as arguing with a potential murderer about whether his future victim is dead or alive—since by killing the person in question the murderer can promptly provide proof of the correctness of his statement. The only valid argument under such conditions is promptly to rescue the person whose death is predicted. Before mass leaders seize the power to fit reality to their lies, their propaganda is marked by its extreme contempt for facts as such, for in their opinion fact depends entirely on the power of man who can fabricate it....In other words, the method of infallible prediction, more than any other totalitarian propaganda device, betrays its ultimate goal of world conquest, since only in a world completely under his control could the totalitarian ruler possibly realize all his lies and make true all his prophecies. *sigh* It's not that I believe that we are going to have a Holocaust redux, it's just that I don't understand how people can be so calm, so willing to give the benefit of the doubt. As Primo Levi and others have pointed out, these things rely on manipulable people and incremental deterioration of societal norms. Are we not experiencing that to degrees seldom seen before? Having read this book I feel fairly certain that the evil genius and psychological understanding of men like Stalin and Hitler is beyond the capacity of a lummox like Trump, but I take such little solace in this because I do believe that he is surrounding himself with the amoral semi-deep-thinkers who are fully capable of wielding extreme power (see, e.g.: this) and trading on bureaucratic inertia to accomplish unknowable and untenable ends.Fuck.

I'm still on board with Stiglitz, but Frank is endowed with a much more gimlet eye and sharper tongue. And it's delightful to find someone whose playfulness of diction matches his playfulness with the subject matter (some great vocabulary here, though perhaps an over-reliance on the word ""boodler"" and really no need to use the word enragée more than once). The main thesis of this book, as I take it, is to point out how well made the GOP has it in modern Washington. This is a party whose ethos is ""government does not work."" Thus they have cover for their efforts to dismantle whatever is good and that people almost universally like about government (taxes on the very wealthy, corporate and environmental responsibility, gun restrictions, enabling voting, taking care of our veterans) because, after all--it's still ""government."" Yet when they can be shown variously to be obstructionist, to have not accomplished anything, or to have bungled something good, it's always that liberals got in the way, or that government was never competent to handle it in the first place. Frank does an excellent job of showing, too, that conservatives benefit from having the corrupt and incompetent pollute our last stalwart beliefs in civic virtue, and that conservatives can even get on board with government when they are the ones who control it, either through domination or deep capture (the Northern Mariana Islands/Saipan anecdotes are especially poignant in this regard). Truly a cynical but believable tale of why people vote against their best interests, and why a party of incompetent, sociopathic, and kleptocratic morons currently stands to inherit all branches of our government in a few months.

I don't know quite yet, but I enjoyed this installment more than its predecessor. I think I began to sense the richness of the dialogue and the deft hand for storycraft that I perhaps did not fully appreciate the first time around. Two thoughts that stuck with me the whole way: 1) Growing up in a middle class, Irish-American background, casual racism (ethnicism?) toward other groups of white people--typically other ""ethnic"" types such as Italians, Poles, and Jews--was practically de rigueur. When my eldest cousin got married to an Italian (Catholic), I remember a relative wringing her hands over whether their prospective children would suffer from their conflicting identities. As a four year old, I knew enough to understand that this was ridiculous and overwrought.But especially after I moved back to the East Coast, traces of this tendency began to percolate into my consciousness. For example, it was schoolyard gospel--taken with only mild umbrage--that the Irish were fecund, given to fighting, and fond of the drink; we parried these insults with relatively innocent ethnic stereotypical barbs/jokes of our own: the Polish were prone to building such contraptions as the submarine with a screen door, or the rocketship to the Sun; the British had bad teeth; the French were lazy and subsisted on snails and red wine; and Italians were irascible firebloods with a predilection for gesticulation. As with all racial and ethnic stereotypes, I have learned them to be pernicious and baseless as an adult, notwithstanding their somewhat durable currency. So it was odd to see one of them resurrected so comprehensively in a contemporary novel, especially one written by an Italian herself. How many times do these characters threaten to kill each other, or explode into angry conflagration upon the slightest provocation? So much passion! Is this a realistic portrayal of the impoverished Neapolitan experience? Was there much gesticulation?!2) Why the continued loyalty to Lila from all characters, most especially Lenu? I get that she is this smoldering femme fatale type, but it's unclear why an intelligent woman such as Lenu would be so loyal to and forgiving of her, especially given her frequent maliciousness, unpredictability, lack of redeeming qualities, and her (view spoiler)[affair with the object of Lenu's occasionally requited affection, Nino Sarratore (hide spoiler)]? I found myself wondering this about the first book, but dismissed it as the callowness of youth blinding the characters to the fact that mature friendships are voluntary rather than the product of proximity and circumstance. As the characters mature to adulthood, I find it somewhat more baffling, but I will assume it is merely an element of Ferrante's deft storytelling that is taking a bit longer to unfold....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 08, 2016","Nov 12, 2016","Nov 08, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17465515-the-story-of-a-new-name

Klein presents to us a world that is so paralyzed and bamboozled by entropy and bureaucracy that the only way to catalyze meaningful change is to either take advantage of or foment massive disasters--whether in terms of disaster response, warfare, or regime change. She starts with Allende's Chile, as all books of this ilk do, and moves on to show how blights as diverse as Putin, apartheid Israel, post-Katrina New Orleans, and post-Bush II Baghdad are interlinked, less outliers than harbingers of our coming norms. The ""Green Zone"" of Baghdad in particular stuck me as baleful, especially juxtaposed with Sandy Springs, GA, its analogue in our own country. Could things get so divided by class, government so privatized, and safety so compromised that we all end up in Atwood-esque compounds determined by our socioeconomic status? Klein at least makes a case for how we might.

I had high hopes, because people liked Room so much, but it was kind of a snooze until the last forty or so pages. At times it felt like an irritating Beckett play with the main character running around being the only sane person while everyone else acted completely absurd and as if nothing were awry. Lots of subtle and not-so-subtle commentary on Anglo-Hibernian traits and relations, doubtless Donoghue's own, sparing neither in its critiques.It picks up, sure, saving it from the two-star rating I was reserving for it, but overall this didn't feel terribly substantial or suspenseful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 03, 2016","Nov 15, 2016","Nov 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28449257-the-wonder

She floats around the Village with childlike wonder. She haunts some of my favorite places in the world--Mexico City, New York, Spain, South America--and discourses on some books that have moved me--The Master and Margarita, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, and Lolita. A picture she had snapped at the West Fourth Street station, a glum column with a ""W4"" placard on it, appeared the moment I pulled into that station, halfway to Hudson Yards to embark on a frantic 10-hour trip to Philadelphia to be with my oldest friend, who is going through some difficult and alarming mental distress.

Bennett can definitely write, but this also very much seemed like a debut novel. Plot wise, there was just a lot that seemed missing—boyfriends introduced over several chapters were extirpated in single sentences, others who were introduced briefly (Nadia’s grandmother, her law school boyfriend, etc.) seemed like they would be late introductions but ended up as enigmas, and tragic mysteries involving both Aubrey and Nadia’s mother went thoroughly--perhaps purposefully--unanswered.

One gets the impression that there is no world in which Chomsky can be satisfied, but that should not take away from his dressing down of many valid targets of derision and ridicule. There were times in this book where the slant was palpable. For instance, he praises Hugo Chavez, of all people, for making a (hollow) call for environmentalism, while savaging every one of his other targets for any deviation from stated intention; much of the same for Israel and Palestine. It's just irritating when he lets traditional scallawags off the hook, ostensibly to provide a balanced view, when he holds all of our traditional powerbrokers to such a (justifiably) high standard.Despite his errant hypocrisies, we need more public intellectual iconoclasts like Chomsky in our society.

This is so critical to bear in mind because otherwise it's easy to get distracted by the litany of questions that crop up for the Western reader: ""Why would you ever tolerate this life?"" ""How could people love this regime/dictator?"" ""Did no one see through all of this absurd obsequiousness and pageantry?"" But I think all of these questions assume that critical thinking is something innate, rather than acquired, which is something this book made me question. In a world without alternative narratives, with only binary political truths, where all who are not devout loyalists are traitors, I found myself wondering: would I be bold enough to question and escape the confines of the state or would I accept the narrative that I was responsible for upholding the beleaguered vanguard, that questioning the state's motives or integrity was playing into the enemies' hands? After reading this book, I am honestly not sure.It's painful to take in at times--the human suffering is so acute and widespread, but the stories we are told make the forbearance of these people relatable, understandable if not rational.

But I was mainly surprised by how sophisticated the research was: how many international cities he visited/polled, how many august dating sociologists he consulted with, and the breadth of topics covered. Not that this book was peer ed or anything--broad pronunciations on how French men regard monogamy or Argentine courtship rituals leave some nuance to be desired--but it was undertaken with more seriousness than I'd anticipated.As someone who is woefully familiar with the travails of online dating, much of this book rang very true, especially given that I recently ended a relationship over a disagreement over it being ""open."" This book centers on the new paradigms of dating--how the digitalization of dating has raised our expectations over those of previous generations, how the paradox of choice can both enable and thwart finding happiness, and how the Internet's role in making us more picky has eroded traditional conventions like monogamy.

I am a sucker for television, and that miniseries, even acting talent aside, was breathtaking. There's something about an author who can tap into suburban regret and recrimination that I really cannot get enough of, especially when they can do it without the bleakness of Yates.This novel is another masterful entry into that genre. The book dwells heavily on gossip and jealousy, on class and abraded familial relationships, and on unrequited devotions. Although I could not relate to much of it, the world that Strout adumbrated in such economical fashion sucked me in entirely.

I decided to listen to it in Spanish, because I'll need to use my Spanish for the new job I'm starting in a month, and I never read (or listen) to something in Spanish whose plot I don't already vaguely know. Hillary's pre-Senate life was less known to me than I had anticipated, but the bones were there and my Spanish compensated where something about which I knew very little (like Whitewater) came up. I must say, Spanish really humanized Hillary (and certainly made the revelation of Bill's perfidious cheating that much more dramatic!). I liked the book overall, and Hillary is much more of a badass than I knew. Like me, she started off as a conservative/Republican and gradually but deliberately developed more liberal positions when she left her little bubble. I can see why people don't trust her--my god, the Clinton scandals never cease!--because for every scandal, instead of contrition there was just a bunch of ""total ignorance,"" ""just a big misunderstanding,"" or calumny of some sort, and this starts to wear a bit thin after 600ish pages. But despite these troubles with each ""page"" I also grew less and less tolerant of the visceral hatred of Hillary in this country. There are plenty of reasons to hate Hillary or wish for a better candidate, but I feel like the vast majority of the reasons animating the general public's dislike and distrust of her are the illegitimate, misogynistic ones.I had hoped that this book would touch on her Senate and Secretary of State stints, but unfortunately I think those come in subsequent memoirs, memoirs which the Brooklyn Public Library does not have in Spanish audiobook.

I liked the story of the poor peasant rising through poverty by dutifully working the land and eschewing common vices. I liked that the great house got its comeuppance. I liked that Wang Lung and O-Lan forged a relationship built on mutual respect and interdependence. I even liked when the family came upon hard times, with extreme famine necessitating its hushed elements of infanticide and cannibalism. It had the agrestic character and sense of triumph over adversity of ""East of Eden.""But at some point I really started to hate Wang Lung. He's such a loathsome little cockalorum, vain and self-reassuring, disloyal and proud. He owes everything--the stability of his home life, his initial ability to acquire wealth, his later ability to turn stolen wealth into land, and his many children--all to her, yet he treats her terribly over and over again. He is prone to sharp bouts of anger and is cowardly and self-congratulatory for every irritating failure we witness, from his disinclination to interfere with his layabout father's uselessness during famine times, to his decision to take his first and then second concubines, to his caving to his sons regarding a servant's burial posture, a servant whose generosity years before had likely saved those sons from succumbing to starvation.

Like most of the comedy books I consume, this was an audiobook. I had recently made my way through a few mediocre audiobooks by Demetri Martin and David Cross, and I just downloaded this one because Black's name was recognizable and I hadn't really researched anything else. I certainly wasn't a huge Michael Ian Black fan before selecting it.As I've said elsewhere, I think writing a comedy book is an almost intrinsically doomed enterprise. In my mind, the author's best bet is to try to tell a story or impart some wisdom filigreed with (rather than dominated by) humor. This is what I loved about Bossypants, and this is what I love about the TV of comics like Louis C.K. If that be a genre of book, this book is its standard bearer. MIB tells brutally honest and surprisingly heartfelt tales of love and loss, growth and stagnation, all interlaced with refreshing, clever, appropriately apportioned humor. He can be dark as his name at times, and some of the ways in which he described his marriage and/or his coping mechanisms for his life left me thinking that they would be followed up with ""we ended up divorced"" or ""things are much better now"" or ""so, obviously I went to rehab."" But none of these neat little qualifiers ever appeared, because that's not what life is like. But I still finished this book a bit choked up, confident in the hard-won strength of his relationships and the often grudging devotion he has to making them work. Like Louis C.K. and others of his ilk, Black is a bit more acerbic and honest than we non-comedians might be when describing the most intimate details of his life and relationships, but there can be no doubting the sincerity of his love for his family, and the struggles and doubt he describes underscore rather than undermine this conclusion.This was elegant storytelling and surprisingly poignant.

It's a rollicking, decades-long panorama of New York City in the style of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, and at times I liked it just as much. Weaving together stories of gentrification, substance abuse, mental illness, adoption, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and family dynamics, ""Christadora"" tells the story of one Alphabet City family--as well as those locked in its orbit--in poignant detail. I really enjoy books based in New York, because I get a thrill from the mention of places I've frequented--I used to live on Orchard and Houston in the LES, so I habituated Katz's, Russ & Daughters, Two Boots Pizza, The Blue and Gold, Tompkins Square Park, etc.--but it was also gripping to read about organizations I've actually worked with, like Gay Men's Health Crisis, and to understand a bit more of the saga decades before things had stabilized from Tim Murphy, a herald as entitled as any other to tell it. There were times when the ""white guy writes dialogue for non-white people"" trope got a bit awkward, and at times plot points felt too forced or realizations were made too hastily or clunkily. And I think that perhaps Jared's redemption was never realized and a few others left out or hastily concluded, but overall this was a highly enjoyable page-turner and tear-jerker. And for the dignity that it gives without sanitizing the HIV/AIDS rights movement, ""Christadora"" is a standout. It humanizes people who won small and quiet but vital (in the truest sense of the word!) victories in the face of imposing odds and social antipathy, and it does not airbrush out the scars they earned in their battles. As Murphy puts it, That was the thing about the [HIV/AIDS] movement, wasn't it?

Not something you should find yourself thinking in a comedy book.But I would give this book 3.5 stars. Also, as this was the audiobook, the first half of it featured John Hodgman riffing with Jonathan Coulton, whose bed I once drunkenly slept in one New Year's Day with my friend Alice and her then boyfriend.

I'm hesitant to criticize him, as he spent a good portion of this book callowly criticizing others who had criticized him in the past, telling them why they were wrong and also why they sucked. Then again, he always made it seem like he was righting some cosmic untruth or evenhandedly supplementing a skewed account, so I will try to be fair. Also I doubt he's haunting esoteric goodreads.com accounts...I like the guy's acting, and I assume without knowing that I must like a lot of stuff he has written. I doubt he had much to do with writing Arrested Development, but his performance in it is brilliant. He was likely much more involved in Todd Margaret and Mr. Show, both of which are excellent. But the book is not always the easiest medium to demonstrate one's sense of humor. Nonfiction memoir-y books by comedians tend to be good when they are conveying lessons or observations, and those things are framed with humor. But translating stand-up to audiobook--which is what a lot of this felt like--is bound to fall flat. Also, what is with straight guys who are ""with it"" feeling licensed to throw ""faggot"" and its derivatives around? In a way that mirrors misogynistic language but distinctly cleaves from practice with racial epithets, these mostly white guys, often comedians, deploy homophobic (and misogynistic) language to be transgressive and edgy or whatever. But Cross, himself a secular Jew who spends a considerable amount of time ridiculing Judaism, never uses any anti-Jewish slurs, even in his transgressive ""that's not what I say, it's what that type of person we hate would say."" Walk it back, assholes.Whatever. My biggest gripe was that this did not seem worthy of his talents.

I can only compare it to taking a class with Prof. Jon Hanson in law school in terms of the scales it pulled from my eyes. How could it be that someone who majored in History--with a focus on 20th Century American history, no less!--and who studied separation of powers and was forced to grapple with the limits of executive power in law school could be so ignorant of the seminal events in Grenada, Iran/Nicaragua, and Iraq I? I didn't even have a passing understanding of the first imbroglio, and Iran-Contra was something about which I could have offered you maybe two uncertain sentences. The first Iraq War was somewhat more developed in my mind (perhaps because it was the only one of the three that started after I was born?), but even then, I had no grasp of its indelible connection to the first two situations.Maddow emphasizes that the Founders strongly abhorred the idea of a standing army, and having studied history and understood that the spoils and glory of war accrue to the executive branch (and with the common-sense notion that the ability to make war should not be vested in a single individual) decided that the decision about whether to go to war should be something committed to the people who would be paying for it with their fortunes and their lives, something that they could affirm through the Congressional organ only if they truly thought the sacrifice merited suffering. Starting with Reagan and continuing with Bush I, she explores how Edwin Meese conjured up the idea of the president's unencumbered right to take swift military action in the name of American interests, and how that has unraveled so disastrously and alarmingly through the Bush II and Obama presidencies. She ably points out that the Cold War was something of a chimera, the Soviet Union mostly a stalking horse used to project American power and enrich contractors' coffers which should not have been recognized as a military equal or superior when the Politburo could not even keep its own people fed and was perpetually on the brink of collapse. The twin themes of military folly and transposition of the power to make war are followed through to show what led us to become this hectoring belligerent of a country, and how scary and contradictory to original intent it is that our military forces are now composed so substantially of contractors, guardsmen, and the CIA, who bear none of the accountability and little of the connection to public sentiment that were intended to make war an unpalatable last resort.But going back to Reagan--I want to know how all of these Republican dickheads who apotheosize Reagan can perseverate about Benghazi when Grenada was a way worse oversight, caused far more deaths, pissed off our most important ally, deceitfully circumvented Congress, and violated international law. Worse yet, Benghazi was a passive boondoggle, whereas Grenada was volitional. I suppose it's based on some glib distinction about how soldiers are supposed to die and Reagan, clumsy and senile as he was, was at least trying to protect American interests, whereas Benghazi involved civilians and an alleged disinterest in American integrity. But, as Maddow convincingly demonstrates: the idea of defending ""American interests"" is an almost laughably pliant concept used to justify all manner of deadly, destructive mischief, and these days the CIA more resembles our military wing than anything civilian....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 17, 2016","Aug 19, 2016","Aug 04, 2016",,,view (with text),/book/show/12143200-drift

The story revolves around a Jamaican family of women, variously victims of sexual depredation, exploitation, incest, and rape, who pin their hopes to the reluctant youngest daughter of the group, whose prescribed ambition of becoming a doctor in order to lift the family from poverty begins to flag in light of a nascent interest in becoming an artist. The sacrifices that each endures are unfathomable, as is the degree to which the family members feel entitled to trammel on the others' lives to ensure the betterment of the whole. But without adequate communication this would-be alliance devolves into mutual recrimination, everyone focusing on her own sacrifices and unable to see the other members' means as anything but a selfish wrench thrown into the works.This book is heartbreakingly depressing and poignant, and it spares no one. There is a ""Gift of the Magi"" quality to the book, and from early on you can tell that things are not positioned to end well for any of the characters.

It started off strong--the prologue is a flash forward (featuring Clarence Thomas angrily interrogating the protagonist) from the bulk of the text--but the actual body of the book was spent skipping around.

Unlike ""East of Eden,"" it was economical with its storytelling and engrossing from the outset.

I was apprehensive because of how immensely beloved yet controversial it is in the worldI picked this book up with not a small amount of trepidation. I was apprehensive because of how immensely beloved yet controversial it is in the world of gay literature aficionados who make up large swathes of my friend groups, my book clubs, and this website's users. Around the time that the movie came out, the book was the topic du jour of the gay world, and I found myself buttonholed by even pointedly illiterate gays asking what I thought about it. Its plot and writing aside, it makes for energetic discussion: it's written by a straight man, its movie acted by some straight guys, full of purple prose, etc. About a year prior my friend Toby was the first to tell me about Mr. Aciman. He was justifiably skeptical of this ostensibly heterosexual author--just why was he writing indulgent poetry about youthful gay escapades? ""How good could it really be?"" we wondered. Toby loaned me a friend's copy of Enigma Variations, and I confusedly thought that I had CMBYN stored away for whenever I was ready for it. So, when I made it through my queue of book club books and finally dug around in my literal pile of books for this title, I came up empty handed and had to wait quite a while behind the rest of the frugal, straggler, New York gays who rely on the public library to see what all the fuss was about.I admit that I'm less interested in/concerned with the straight writer thing than most people seem to be--I think it's kind of impressive for this guy to write this book that different generations of gay men--a famously persnickety crowd!--can moon over in common. It really is quite the feat! I'm sure there is a normative question in there about whether privileged individuals should be writing the stories of marginalized individuals, but I'll leave that criticism for a clumsier production. My hesitation had a separate etiology--I'm just generally skeptical of anything involving taste that people all gush over. It's why I've almost entirely stopped seeing ""critical darling"" movies--people talk about them as if they're life-changing and then curse you if you don't have the exact same intensity of reaction. And, if anything, the expectations were piled even higher for this at-most biennial cultural phenomenon--the book that all and sundry cannot stop discussing.So I was ready for CMBYN to underwhelm me. About halfway through I might have described myself as only mildly impressed. The writing really is poetic, but often it felt belletristic, nothing I would describe as genius or breathtaking. And some of its devices fell flat for me--for example, the whole ""call me by your name"" bit seems like something a straight person would imagine would be the acme of erotica for gay couples, something that only same-sex couples and the rare Alex-Alex, Jordan-Jordan heterosexual couple can ever achieve. But it just struck me as kind of odd and not adequate for the amount of gravitas the author hoped to invest it with. Yet the book is peppered with freshets of reflection and lyricism that are truly magnificent, and overall the effect of reading it is a highly pleasant, engrossing one. But I think this book stands out above all else for its faithful recreation of youthful infatuation and concupiscence, the all-consuming, excruciating, ineffable experience of a first true crush. Reading CMBYN recreates all of the aching pain and unbearable excitement of young love, but also of honeyed summer days, self-consciously trying out the nascent freedom of young adulthood, and the plummy charm of handsome youth. It's a masterwork of nostalgia, and I enjoyed it. Who knows, I might even go see the movie...!...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Mar 24, 2018","Mar 26, 2018","Jun 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/98687.Call_Me_by_Your_Name

Roth has such a marvelous imagination and knack for conjuring credible emotional and conversational dynamics.

I couldn't help wondering, wryly, about how different this book might have been had it been written in 2017 instead of 2004. Roth is painstaking in his portrayal of the ascent of Lindbergh as a rational, sober, and dispassionate choice only tangentially and incidentally connected to the racist regime of the Nazis. He resists the urge to portray Lindbergh as a vitriolic messiah who rides to power on a wave of bile cultivated through inflammatory rhetoric and unstatesmanlike conduct.

This book wasStory time with Papa, and it's worth it just for the quirky little anecdotes you get about the Lost Generation's most remarkable rogues. This book was a bit thin on substance and not very long, its vignettes slightly picaresque and only loosely strung together in a way that recalled Calvino's ""Marcovaldo."" I came away with two distinct impressions:1) It is a wonderful thing to have just enough money and to live in a city that can lay credible claim to serving as capital of the world. When Hemingway says:There is never any ending to Paris and the memory of each person who has lived in it differs from that of any other. We always returned to it no matter who we were or how it was changed or with what difficulties, or ease, it could be reached. Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it. But this is how Paris was in the early days when we were very poor and very happy.I can substitute ""New York"" for Paris and every word rings true. I don't do it nearly enough, but every once in a while I walk around marveling at the city: its people, its mechanics, the improbable semifunctionality of the whole endeavor. I proselytize in only one way--by encouraging people to live here--mostly because I haven't the vocabulary to convey what it is to be part of the Leviathan. 2) I've always thought it strange that F. Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway were buds. Hemingway is so brusque and confident and hypermasculine and contemptuous of ornamentation. F. Scott is insecure and epicene and lyrical, with an arriviste's obsession with the trappings of the Eastern elite. And the stories Hemingway relates don't much hint at some uniting factor that transcends these incongruities: F. Scott is importunate, hypochondriacal, can't hold his liquor, and married to a sociopathic loon. But Papa tolerates him anyway, showers rare (and appropriate) praise upon The Great Gatsby, and his infant son's cat is even named F. Puss!! Amazing.But I really wish this relationship had been the whole book. Who needs fusty old Gertrude Stein or that coxcomb Ford Maddox Ford. I want more of this odd couple; someone should write ""The Untold Tales of Fitz' and Ernie."" I mean, how about that bro-mantic moment when F. Scott asks Hemingway if his endowment is adequate, and then Hemingway takes him to see a bunch of statuary at the Lourve!? And then Fitzgerald doubles down by confessing that he's a shower--not a grower--and Hemingway reassures him anyway?

As such, I resolved to read the rest when I had the chance, but was in no special hurry to do so.Fast forward about a month and I was walking around SoHo on a particularly beautiful day. Contrary to my usual custom I was neither looking at the ground nor lost in a book (far too much foot traffic in SoHo for the latter), and happened to be a bit lower than eye-level with one of those monstrous pine green transformer boxes affixed to a streetlight. Sitting atop it were two books: ""Cold Mountain"" and this title. ""Cold Mountain"" was in better shape, and the cover of the 1971 copy of ""Rabbit Redux"" crumbled away completely before I was halfway through the book, but I kept it anyway and hoped the other book would be descried by someone in search of it before the next rain came along.I'm not sure what to make of this book, really. It's amazing (though a bit jarring) that the infanticide (babyslaughter?) from the previous entry is so papered over. Instead of forming the main dramatic pretense for the book, it is only mentioned in passing, typically deployed by Rabbit as lightly mordant jabs without much counterreaction. Instead, our protagonist begins the book as this fusty, almost comically hawkish racist/misogynist/idiot bigot who, for whatever reason, takes in an 18-year-old debutante manqué and her Leninist African American lover and rather seamlessly transforms into an unholy Archie-Bunker-meets-Colonel-Kurtz pastiche. The debates (many of which--focusing on wealth and power and the wisdom of blindly supporting one's government--we are only just thawing out 40 some years later) are very interesting and intense, but the weird voyeuristic sex triangle and drug-addled interpersonal conflict between the debaters felt tedious and disruptive. One final thought: Updike gets a lot of flak for his misogyny. It's true that there are a lot of dumb (Janice), weak (Jill, Peggy) women in this series. But there are also intelligent, liberated women (Mim, Mrs. Angstrom). And I think we have to view all of the characters in the context of Rabbit, who has plenty of quips but whose opinions verge on regurgitated and whose behavior is the most deplorable of any main character in the series. Aside from Skeeter (maybe) or Nelson, this book lacks heroes of either gender. They are stories of industrial frustration and interpersonal pettiness followed by inevitable reconciliation, and neither men nor women come away smelling of roses.I'm probably less certain that I will finish with the tetrarchy having read the second installment (sorry, Steve!), but if Rabbit Angstrom teaches anything, it's that life is long, full of unexpected twists, and that connections endure, even in the absence of strong affection. I'll keep glancing at transformers and see whether the universe will conspire to put the third book in my hands, one way or another. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 27, 2016",Jun 2016,"May 27, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46917.Rabbit_Redux

I have no reason to believe it was embellished or fabular, and thus it resonated with me more than the fictive bildungsromans we read in school by the likes of Twain and his ilk. Wolff fits the fairly common ""deposed patrician"" mold, living in unstable, spartan circumstances with his mother while his father shacks up with millionaires and his brother bops around Princeton, both mostly exhibiting the sense of invulnerability and studied aloofness that one would expect of Deerfield and Choate (respectively) men of that era. Despite the reader's knowledge of this lofty pedigree, in the end Wolff's (view spoiler)[acceptance to the Hill School (hide spoiler)] seems almost a deus ex machina, because it so radically reshapes his circumstances and his character. Although the circumstances of his life amply justified his desire to escape the proximity and circumstances of Dwight et al., Wolff discloses how he actually covets status and money, the liveries thereof, and all the other elitist trappings that an Eastern prep school imparts. This not only sets him apart from the relatable, ""every boy"" protagonists of Twain's novels, it makes him, in my mind, a bit contemptuous, especially given his other failings (most especially(view spoiler)[ his failure to apologize to the destitute Welches, but also his continuous lying, moral failings, quiet betrayals, manipulations and misrepresentations (hide spoiler)]).But you don't have to like or admire the boy to enjoy this book. Reading it felt a lot like that recent ballyhooed film ""Boyhood."" It ably displayed the simultaneous naivete and wisdom of young children, how quickly and completely pettiness metastasizes within failed men, and the anxious bargaining and hand wringing that cramp the autonomy of single mothers. Most memorably for me, it was a view into the small-town white America of the 1950s, of which my father tells me stories and whose frustrated masculinity and omnipresent practicality instinctively repel me, yet whose sense of childhood wonder seems so much more vivid and capable than my own....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 22, 2016","May 24, 2016","May 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11466.This_Boy_s_Life

Glancing through the s of this book from the GR users whom I follow, there are many ""I loved/hated [this DeLillo book] but hated/loved [this other DeLillo book]"" and many other ""DeLillo is my favorite author whom I would never recommend to anyone else""-type comments.It's curious. But I found myself without an explanation for why I was undertaking my third DeLillo book this year despite having had only mixed impressions of the first two. And these were not short books--Underwold clocks in at over 800 pages, while Libra is 500+. Granted, Mao II is much shorter and I finished it on bookended weekend bus trips from NYC to Philadelphia, but I have dozens of other books awaiting me in my room from authors who only exist in my mind as unblemished potential. So why persist with DeLillo?I had a suspicion about this book: the things that I didn't love about DeLillo in his longer works (too many characters tenuously sketched, difficult plot development, rambling stories and anecdotes) would likely be precluded by necessity in a shorter book. Unfortunately, I was wrong. In fact, I think it must be DeLillo's style, regardless of the length of the work. He's like one of those pendulums you see in museums, with a pencil attached to the bottom: he swings in wide arcs and soars in dubiously related tangents but every once in a while deigns to add to the plot he is continuously teasing us with by scratching a bold stroke right through the story's center. It can be frustrating but also very rewarding. His books are sprawling and betray a numinous imagination, an unsurpassed talent for developing unique perspectives and dialogues and vernaculars, all leavened with a healthy shot of good old fashioned Americana. And throughout it all, it's unmistakable that he is a gifted writer. There are passages in DeLillo that you have to watch out for (lest you miss them amongst the gratuitous perambulating) that will leave you gobsmacked. Mao II was so loosely constructed and its characters underdeveloped that I really did not enjoy it. It makes three DeLillo books/1500+ DeLillo pages with an average of fewer than three stars.

I picked up ""A God in Ruins"" (which deals with very similar subject matter) but then left that at a bar after an unusually lively Friday night that saw me climbing into bed at 4am. Before I committed to juggling three books at once and risked ferhoodling the details of the books' very posh, wartime-British protagonists I decided it was time to retrieve my briefcase, in which I had stuffed ""Atonement.""I wasn't totally enamored of the book throughout its first third. There was too much ambient description and not enough character development(view spoiler)[, which is something that the young Briony is criticized for in the letter she receives from her editors. If we're meant to believe that she wrote the first part as a young girl and honed her writing skill as an adult following this advice, I'm not sure to what extent it shone through. I also thought that the relationship between Robbie and Cee was too tenuous to support the believability of the ardor and devotion that followed--after all, these people had gone years without speaking to one another. Robbie had carried a torch for Cee, certainly, but the basis of her love for him was a childhood intimacy wholly glossed over, then teenage detente, then classist segregation at university, before receiving a crude note, followed by a single instance of making love--""fucking,"" as Robbie amends--in the library the very same night a ghastly accusation is made. It seemed like something that could have been developed at the expense of the excruciating description that plagued many parts of this book, as it did Briony's first novella (hide spoiler)].But where there was dialogue, things seemed to move apace. Sometimes too quickly, actually. And when others saw me reading this book I encountered similar dissatisfaction with McEwan's pacing--""I wish he would write short stories"" and ""That is certainly a plodding book,"" etc.Ultimately the ending I thought was very well done and rescued this from a two-star rating.

I'm not sure if that was just because I was 17 or if it would have been as impactful had I picked it up for the first time today, but I have a hunch that the balance tilts toward the latter. During my pre-law school days of glacial reading, I picked up ""Pale Fire"" and ""Pnin"" and the sense of awe was only renewed. Three for three, and a fecund postgrad period of reading recently upon me, I decided I should check out the rest of his oeuvre. I read ""Bend Sinister"" a few months ago, but was not very impressed with it. I flew to California this weekend and wanted a long book to occupy me on my flight, and chose ""Ada, or Ardor""... a (non-rhotic) pun is in the title! How could I not love it?Ada is Nabokov's longest work by a considerable margin. It is also very recondite and often difficult to follow. Most notably, it is supersaturated with details of an incestuous love triangle between three siblings. Given these details, I think that old Vlad would forgive me the anachronism of dubbing it ""Infinite 'Cest.""But I got fatigued by this book. The word play is savant-level, as always (perhaps eclipsing Lolita, here), and I looked up literally hundreds of words, many of them presumably made up by Nabokov himself (for comparison, I have since read a 300 page John Updike novel and am 100 pages into McEwan's ""Atonement"" and haven't hit up the dictionary once). But at 600+ pages it gets a bit self-indulgent. I felt the same way about Roth's Sabbath's Theater -- clearly written by a master, but it could have benefited from more exacting editing. Even if we acknowledge Nabokov's amazing ability to make incest seem normal and even tender at times, we have to contend with all of the other child rape and pederasty and violence and gourmandise and it just begins to feel gratuitous. Ditto for all of the other Nabokov peculiarities (parenthetical editing, toggling between French, Russian, and odd pidgin languages that may or may not exist in the real world, etc.) in this book.I understand that he synthesized this novel from two book concepts he intended to pursue. But Nabokov was enough of a genius to pack nuance and humor and insight better than anyone into 300 pages. It begins to become garbled at 600+. So I'd say give this book a shot if you're curious--lots of folks I respect adore (*pats lips with napkin affectedly*) this novel, but it really is an investment in time, patience, and fortitude.Finally, random Nabokov fanboy thought: stop trying to make ""limpid"" happen, Gretchen! Honestly that word appears probably 20x in this book, disproportionately in his other works, and maybe five other times in all of English spoken or written word.

Or at least that's how the book was pitched to me.In reality the gay prostitution only seemed incidental, and this to me was a powerful tale of the teleological nature of class and economic opportunity. It is hinted that Mitko came from relative prosperity, but that means little in a Bulgaria where the students at the author's high school--the most prestigious one in the country--continuously bemoan their lack of economic opportunity and yearn to leave the country, never to return. Instead, Mitko turns tricks, cadges gaudy tech baubles from his suitors, and maintains an exploitative relationship with the author that is seemingly more ambiguous to the audience than to the author himself. When the exploitation turns to desperation--a worrying reliance on alcohol and drugs, medicines incidental to the sex trade that are hard to come by outside of the West--we (Westerners) are faced with the grim and discomfiting reality of the capriciousness of our own access to comfort, dignity, and opportunity.I think this is best reflected in the title--at first, it appears to be a reference to the inability to claim one whom you love, especially when that person is very obviously entangled with others and may not reciprocate your affections, or at the very least their intensity. But just as importantly I think it invokes the concepts of privilege and position that are in so many ways our most vital and determinative--if wholly unearned--possessions....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 12, 2016","Jun 12, 2016","Apr 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22929602-what-belongs-to-you

I asked her whether the subject matter was too heavy for her, that being the only reasonable reason I could conjure for why someone would dislike this book, but it just didn't resonate with her, apparently.I can't really understand why. This book contains so much of what makes good storytelling. The characters are endearing and flawed and they evolve. They operate in a complex and richly detailed world. Their interactions and connections are human and realistic. It is a heady mix of tragedy and hopefulness that is deftly achieved.And the writing is something to behold. As a younger man I would take stock of my more famous coevals when they would host, for instance, SNL. At a slightly riper age I am astounded by the empathy, imagination, patience, and lyricism that Marra had to marshall at my current age to generate a work like this. Surely there are conventions that he leans too heavily on--the omniscient narrator noting that ""in X years, [character] would [do something],"" for instance--but overall the sense of perspective and knack for storytelling is something close to numinous. This book prefigured the marvel that is The Tsar of Love and Techno, and augurs the career of a talented author and gifted storyteller. Through personal connections I have it on good authority that the author is currently working on his next book, which will have the same Slavic setting as his previous two books but with an Italian-American narrator more closely approximating the author's own experience (""It's something subtle that I can't really define, but it's clear that you're not really a Russian"" my first generation Russian-American roommate advised him at a wedding last month); I cannot wait!...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jun 14, 2016","Jun 18, 2016","Apr 01, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18428067-a-constellation-of-vital-phenomena

Also, because of student loan thriftiness, I tend to buy most of my books from used book stores online, which typically precludes my buying anything published in the most recent 2-3 years, save for the most popular fiction. Third (and fourth?), both my roommate and one of my best friends from college (independently--small world!) are good friends with the author’s long-term girlfriend (mentioned in the acknowledgements), and I met her when she stayed at my apartment a few months back, finding her lovely and charming. Fifth, some friends wrote encomiums about Marra’s debut effort.Having just finished it, I’m not sure what to make of this novel. But let’s be clear—despite lots of (in my opinion: odd) reports of prejudice against this book for being a collection of short stories (which it also very much is), the plot lines are sufficiently interconnected that they form a cogent whole. And not in the “Mad About You” and “Friends” way (sophisticated analogy, I know), but rather the “Cheers” and “Frasier” way—deep and important connections between characters that you are meant to recognize and which enrich the experience considerably. I don't believe you can appreciate the significance of any one story without absorbing each of the others.When I first picked this up I was dazzled by the lyricism and the frabjous tableau that Marra had begun painting. Perhaps it was inattentive reading, or a fatigue with the Russian gulag/oppressive state trope of late (“Libra,” “House of Meetings,” “Bend Sinister,” FX’s excellent “The Americans”), but my interest flagged in the middle—five star potential, lowed to a 4, perhaps approaching a 3!

With an admirable lack of hatred but a searing battery of accusations, he takes German excuses of ignorance and attitudes of resignation to task, backing his analysis with his own experiences in the Lager and communiques he had with Germans following his antecedent books' publications.This book really made me begin to examine my complicity in the horrors of systems like capitalism and mass incarceration, especially when exposed to Levi's disgust with the self-serving ""Well, /really/, what could I have done?"" plea that I might be tempted to put forth. But aside from those inchoate, still-unprocessed thoughts, the most baleful of passages were those that admonished us not to be too sanguine about our own failsafes--cultural, legal, or human. I am not one for casual Nazi allusions, but reading this in the current moment of great ferment, it was impossible not to worry given Levi's well-pleaded case that Hitler's rise was not the result of some perfect storm of military, economic, and egotistical debasement or uniquely German capacity for manifesting hatred, evil, and violence. Aptly:""Few countries can be considered immune to a future tide of violence generated by intolerance, lust for power, economic difficulties, religious or political fanaticism, and racialist attritions. It is therefore necessary to sharpen our senses, distrust the prophets, the enchanters, those who speak and write 'beautiful words' unsupported by intelligent reasons.""Later on, Levi observes that Nazism's military opponents likely organized so staunchly against the ideology and its state because of how ruthless and dangerous it had shown itself to be from the very beginning. He leaves unsaid that a slightly more restrained, slightly less hectoring entity might amass power more slowly, in imperceptible increments rather than alarming bounds, like the frog that allows itself to be boiled alive in a slowly heated pot, despite the same inevitable outcome. Certainly this level of alarm can be directed at any potentially dangerous nascent political coalition or movement. But I think that's beside the point--Levi himself explains why so many Jews, himself included, failed to escape the creeping specter of Nazism, even as the signs appear to us so obvious in hindsight. As the above quote shows, Levi does call us to resist the rise of disquieting systems of power, but the obligation to resist is proportional to the certainty with which one knows (or, critically: should know) that an injustice is being perpetrated.Levi's object is not so much to call on us to prevent some prefigured cataclysm as it is to obligate us to actively and consciously resist participating in a system that is manifestly hateful and oppressive to any human who does not willfully cultivate his ignorance. Regardless, may we draw on formidable reserves of our knowledge of human behavior and human tragedy to rise to either challenge....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 20, 2016","Mar 22, 2016","Mar 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6176.The_Drowned_and_the_Saved

This time it was a Fleetwood Mac remix dance party, so I feel especially bad, as I think our hero Stoner would have felt very out of place there indeed. But he would have borne the burden stoically, manfully, taking stock of the young people enjoying their merriment and wondering why he'd never jigged to Stevie and Lindsey when he'd had the chance.I really liked this book. The writing is spare and the title character endlessly sympathetic. He is the last honorable man in a world where less principled and measured people are arrayed against him. He cannot stop their assault on what small dignities he has carved out of his austere life, but he has his small victories and wins our admiration.At various points when Stoner foregoes the happiness that he so truly deserves because of his sense of principle, I wanted to reach into the pages and throttle him. It made me think of how the world will conspire meanly against you if you are inflexible and do not look out for yourself. I doubt that this was the conclusion the author intended to promote, but for a while it made me feel tainted and unscrupulous. Ultimately it's got to be a balancing act; I'm not Stoner, and I don't envy him his fate, but he certainly sets an example to which the aspirationally honorable should seek to repair....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"May 20, 2016","Jun 10, 2016","Mar 22, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/166997.Stoner

Maybe not a duty, but I am often contemptuous of people who say that such and such is just too painful to watch, listen to, or behold. This doesn't hold true for fictionalizations, and I'm not referring to situations that would trigger past traumas that the beholder has experienced him or herself--in that case, one's personal knowledge is educational enough, and any further exposure is just gratuitous and painful. I'm talking about the person who has no experience with something but who refuses to engage with it for fear of how painful they will find it. It strikes me as some mix of cowardly and disrespectful to the person who actually endured it, whose sharing of the experience indicates that they believe that there is something to be salvaged from the experience.But I have to reevaluate this after reading this book. It was remarkably difficult to get through.Borowski was a Polish (gentile) political dissident who survived Auschwitz, arriving less than a month after Aryans had ceased being gassed there. As such, he enjoyed some informal authority and escaped the worst treatment. He describes the typical mistreatment of prisoners, the disregard for human life, and both tormentors and captors come away shamed. In particular, the dissolution of familial bonds is used to underscore the dehumanization of the camps, with one woman being clubbed for abandoning the encumbering child wailing for her upon entering the camp, one man sending his father to the gas chambers right after reuniting with him rather than deal with him, and another man describing dispassionately how he had his son hanged for stealing commissary bread. Daily life for the Aryan is punctuated by absurdities--at one point the narrator remarks that ""[b]etween two throw-ins in a soccer game, right behind [his] back, three thousand people had been put to death."" There are plenty more grotesque and inhuman details that I will refrain from sharing here.Details aside, there are the familiar meditations on the dangers of hope and what makes man capable of such atrocities. And on this latter point, perhaps because (unlike most Holocaust narratives) Borowski was both captor and captive, he sees the natural regression proceeding from fear to duty, and duty to habit, but hastens to add how quickly habit can give way to taking pleasure in cruelty. The portrayal of humanity is irredeemably bleak, and despite reuniting with his wife after the War, Borowski, like so many Holocaust survivors, took his life (asphyxiation from gas) in 1951, three days after the birth of his only child....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 26, 2016","Jun 28, 2016","Mar 21, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/228244.This_Way_for_the_Gas_Ladies_and_Gentlemen

I think I have a pretty expansive vocabulary, but I rarely made it a page without typing a word into my cellphone dictionary. Sure enough, Nabokov invents his fair share of words and, unlike his idol Shakespeare--whom he eulogizes in this book without apparent relevance to the plot--his words have not yet made it into the English canon, so I never felt too badly about coming across one. As plot goes, I was underwhelmed. Nabokov pillories the bumbling autocratic state, but I think it was too easy of a target for the man who somehow successfully made pedophilia sympathetic. I'm sure it had more depth to the author as a Russian émigré, but as an American, it seemed like a bit of a lazy straw man for leftist big government. Reading Lolita or Pale Fire, the temptation to anoint him as a genius is irresistible. This book had many of the same ingredients, but the sum total felt underwhelming....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 04, 2016","Mar 08, 2016","Mar 04, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/142529.Bend_Sinister

It felt like the last episode of a season of the show ""Justified"": humor and some dust-ups gradually resolve and we are shown the lilting genius and earthly evil of reclusive and unadorned country folk. Underestimate them at your peril!I won't go into the plot too much, except to say that it struck me as a bit clumsy to have a woman be at fault for each of the disasters and inhumanities that befalls one of the central characters. I don't think this is a misogynistic book, but it seemed like something that could have been avoided. But the voice in this book is incredible. It mixes that hardboiled stolidity and economical-yet-esoteric diction common to the masculine, agrestic type of book, with a poetic side, and somehow did so seamlessly. There's plenty of intrigue, ghastly horror, gore, violence, and seedy underbellies to pull you through the nearly 500 pages without any noticeably dull gaps.A funny thing this book made me realize: sometimes--especially now that the collapse of society feels so nigh--I look around at my fellow epicene New Yorkers and take stock of my natural assets in comparison with them: I don't eat much, I don't sleep much, I'm a pretty decent sprinter, I speak Spanish, I can cook, I have an almost X-man-esque ability to tolerate cold temperatures, I can win over animals like St. Francis himself, and I'm a good driver. I have my deficits, too: quick to anger, poor vision, intolerance for canned and shelf-preserved foodstuffs, weak hand-to-eye coordination, loss aversion, and like most effete liberals I've never shot a gun outside of a videogame.

The writing is minimalist--I've heard his prose described as ""dense""... what?--but Updike paints vividly, even though he sticks to primary colors. Some of the dialogue--any character upbraiding that meddlesome Rev. Eccles, for instance--is crackerjack stuff. It seems like it's going to be another psychological profile of a young, feckless all-American white man in mid-century exurban hell: lots of ego (check), overly forgiving women (check), and a conspiracy of factors that manfully prevent the protagonist's life from spinning off its axis, despite his most destructive motives and efforts, setting us up for a dawning maturity (check?). And Updike almost wrote that book, but then he hits us with a gut-punch plot twist that converts the lives of the main characters from somewhat depressing to completely wretched. Like, we're talking can't-bounce-back, drink-the-bleach-before-they-find-you type stuff. Tainted as they are, the rest of the rogues' gallery of characters have circumstances that arguably mitigate their guilt. Rabbit, on the contrary, is loathsome throughout the book, and his antics in its coda make me wonder how Updike wrings enough sympathy out of the rest of his life to merit three subsequent novels and a novella.

I think I understand the appeal--it's a very nostalgic look at Edwardian England. The subject matter is a little stuffy but excellently written. For myself, when I feel a voyeuristic craving to immerse myself in the cosseted world of breathlessly aristocratic Brits, I prefer more modern, humorous writers such as Edward St. Aubyn and Kate Atkinson. Brideshead often felt like something written by our own chronicler of the hoary elite, F. Scott Fitzgerald: the first half was ""This Side of Paradise"" and the second ""Tender is the Night."" And I suppose that that is my main complaint about this book: it felt too disjointed. It felt like two novellas clumsily tethered together. Sebastian, the object of the narrator's affection in the first half of the book, is dropped out of the second half of the book entirely, only mentioned in passing as a dissolute waif off pickling in spirits in some dusty forgotten corner of the Levant or Sahara. We never really even get a satisfactory answer for why this beautiful, charming, naifish, obscenely wealthy and well-connected young man turns, suddenly, to a life of unregenerate alcoholism. If we are meant to infer that Sebastian's thwarted sexual desires are the reality he seeks to escape through drink, I think we could at least have been given more to chew over here. Instead, drinking to excess is presented quite accurately as mere tedium, the tediousness exaggerated given the lack of any apparent cause or reflection on the condition. And can I just say that I was scandalized by how very not gay this book was? Did I receive a bowdlerized version, or is my literary gaydar on the fritz?...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 19, 2016","Apr 23, 2016","Feb 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30933.Brideshead_Revisited

The first half of the book reads a lot like a Greek 100 Years of Solitude--all incest and curses and lovemaking and old country and indistinguishable names and superstition (I even started referring to it myself as ""100 Gyrs of Socratude""). I think in most books, it would be permissible to tell the epic from the very beginning. But this book is different; it beckons with its lightning rod premise: the narrator is a hermaphrodite. And while each chapter usually begins with an adumbration of the plot we all came to behold, the details are always so skinflinty as to make it seem like a tease or a gimmick. It gets tiresome to drink in gallons of Anatolian drama in exchange for every few sips of gender formation. But, when snow and incompetence conspire to bugger your return trip from Colombia and it takes you 36 hours to get home, you can afford to be patient with your literature.I can understand why friends have put this book down. It's long, and the first half (and maybe more) does not live up to the hype that surrounds this book, in my opinion. But I don't think it's being too forgiving to say that, in the end, it deserved to be included, that it makes sense and also enriched the story. The most prominent theme in this novel is that seemingly dramatic changes are not fundamental, and everyone has one foot planted firmly in the past. This is true whether we talk of Detroit--with its moldering landmarks and racial divisions--or Desdemona--whose incestuous relationship with her husband seems to rise and fall from consciousness continuously throughout the novel--or Cal--who lives like a man but still fills the role of daughter, who reveals his gender transition over plates of baklava, the acceptance of which is facilitated by folklore from the old country. To the extent that it was pitched as important to frame Cal's genetic provenance, I think it was a miss; but to the extent it underscored the notion that we all retain our core identities, regardless of what we encounter or how we're perceived, I very much appreciated this thick novel as a whole....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 16, 2016","Feb 20, 2016","Feb 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2187.Middlesex
