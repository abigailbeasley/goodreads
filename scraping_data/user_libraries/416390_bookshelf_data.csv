When I wrote Yesterday I went round playing it to random people and I asked them Did You Write This Song and they all said no, so I realised I’d written it in my sleep. Then it became the most recorded song of all time. I was quite surprised. In the early days we tried to keep things very simple, Love Me Do, that’s very straightforward, but She Loves You, now that’s sung by an intermediary so it’s already getting sophisticated. When we moved to London we learned words like intermediary and we discovered Stockhausen. It’s hard to believe that when I was growing up in Liverpool they had only just invented the motor car. I go back so far I’m in front of me ! John was never violent, people have got the wrong idea. He didn’t need to be – he just gave you that look and you’d beat yourself up. His Aunt Mimi was a tough lady. Twice a week she would break his guitar over his head and every time he would buy another for eleven and sixpence. That’s old money. Young people wouldn’t know what shillings and pence were, or things like radios or horses. I get told I’m a real boomer. I’m not sure why. When I was growing up there wasn’t any such thing as The Beatles. It’s hard to imagine that now. I’m a keen ornithologist.I really enjoy dancing, cooking, driving fast, composing for large orchestras, painting, writing poetry, playing drums and meeting the Queen. She was very cool. Not as tall as Elvis. Young people today won’t remember that but she wasn’t. She asked me, did you write These Boots are Made for Walking? I said no ma’am, that was somebody else. You have to call her ma’am. And you have to walk backwards. It’s true I’ve met quite a few people, Willem de Kooning, Harold Pinter, Bertrand Russell, Dustin Hoffman, you know.

In order to get to grips with the whole thing we hTHE CONSPIRACY ICEBERGThis book is a practical guide to deprogramming your friend or family member. In order to get to grips with the whole thing we have to start by understanding this other conspiratorial way of thinking, beginning with the conspiracy iceberg. I thought this was a useful way to think about conspiracy theories. There’s a hierarchy. At the top is the almost reasonable, and the bottom is the clearly batshit. This is Mick’s little list:1.	Big Pharma – they conspire to sell drugs that people don’t actually need. 2.	Global warming – it’s a hoax.3.	JFK – blah blah4.	9/11 – it was an inside job.5.	Chemtrails – they are putting something sinister into the atmosphere.6.	False flag shootings – the LA and the Sandy Hook shootings were false flag fakes.7.	Moon landing – look at the shadows, sheeple8.	UFO cover up – blah blah9.	Flat earth – now you’re talking10.	Reptile overlords – yeah, those shapeshifting rascals. The Queen of England was one, you know. In fact the whole royal family.It turns out that someone who believes in 9/11 theories thinks flat earthers are crazy and quite likely government shills paid to make decent conspiracy theorists looks like idiots.Now the next excellent point : within the mainstream theories there are also hierarchies of believability. The 9/11 stuff gives the clearest example. The most believable version of that one says that the Bush government knew it was going to happen and deliberately allowed it. In this entry-level theory, you can agree on the rest of the official version, that the planes brought down the towers. The next set of 9/11 theories say the US government made the whole thing happen themselves, that it was a gigantic false flag operation. Controlled explosions, not planes, brought down the towers. Then down there in the bottom of the barrel are the “no-planers” : a group who thinks that all the television footage was faked, that nothing hit the towers and that all the screaming running crowds were paid actors and the planes were CGI. The mainstream truthers think these no-planers are either raving idiots or quite likely government shills paid to make decent conspiracy theorists looks like idiots. In order to begin extracting your friend from the rabbit hole, says Mick, you need to locate their demarcation point – the line where they say this bit is what I believe, but that bit is silly. And then you can start investigating the bit of the believed theory that is closest to the demarcation line, and start to move the demarcation line inch by inch towards reasonableness. It might take a long time, and you have to do it with maximum respect. No name calling. No sneering!YOU ARE MIRRORED IN THE EYES OF YOUR OPPONENTHe says you have to remember that the conspiracy believer thinks you have been fooled by bad information into believing something that is clearly impossible. Hey, just exactly what YOU think about HIM. So, proceed with caution. You can let him try to convert you. You can restate his argument and improve it! This reminded me of the Stones’ 19th Nervous BreakdownOn our first trip I tried so hard to rearrange your mindBut after a while I realized you were disarranging mine IT WON’T BE EASYFor example, the difficulty in rebutting the truthers’ controlled demolition 9/11 theory is that this was a unique building collapse, so when they all say well, it just doesn’t look right, how could they fall down so neatly we can’t point to other examples where 102 storey buildings fell down. THREE COMPLAINTS, KIND OFThis is a pretty good well meaning book but of course there were a couple of things wrong with it. Mick began his debunking by spending years investigating chemtrails so this is his big expertise, and I myself wouldn’t care if twenty chemtrails fell on my house, I have zero interest, so pages 85 to 128 were useless, and should have been devoted to something of more general interest. Also – a bigger question is glanced at but never confronted, which is : what kind of world do the truthers think we are living in? If the US government is so evil they will murder 3000 of their own citizens to provide themselves with a pretext for a couple of foreign invasions (that seems to be the gist of the argument) then – are Americans actually living in a democracy at all or is this elaborate Congress and elections and political parties set-up just shadowplay? If the deep state can steal one election, why won’t it steal the next election too? And by the way how come they allow all you truthers to run about undermining their total information control? And also by the way what are we supposed to do with all this truth? If enough people believe in the 9/11 theory will that mean we can rise up and catch the criminals and put them in prison? Is that the point?Also – and this is probably true – in order to rebut most of the conspiracy theories you have to arm yourself with the most arcane knowledge, because that’s what the theorists do. When they quote Newton’s second law of thermodynamics at youyou tell them that Newton’s laws only apply to abstract point masses, and they will tell you that’s bullshit. You try to tell them about point masses versus rigid bodies versus articulated bodies, elastic versus inelastic collisions, conservation of momentum versus conservation of energy, potential energy in the building versus chemical energy from explosives, static force versus dynamic force, vertical support cross-sections, and the square-cube scaling law. They tell you that’s all a bunch of handwaving because they think “every action has an equal and opposite reaction” proves the buildings could not have simply collapsed as they did. THERE’S PROBABLY A CUTE NAME FOR THIS FALLACYThe 9/11 theorists can’t abide the idea that 19 guys with box cutters caused all that horror. It can’t have happened like that, there must be something more to it.This is the same thing as thinking that weaselly nobody Lee Harvey Oswald could not have killed JFK either at all or by himself. One nasty little guy killing the most powerful man in the world? Come on. Must be more to it than that.I LIKED THISThe common concession in debates that “the truth is somewhere in the middle is a fallacy. The world is not half flatI BELIEVE IN THE GOVERNMENT AND I LOVE THE FBI AND THE CIANon-theorists are always in the invidious position of sort of more or less accepting the Official Version of 9/ll or climate change or vaccinations, etc, for which we are continually mocked.

He would do a video about one of these every now and then. The titles were suggested to him by his booktube followers and friends, and you can imagine they were mostly the usual suspects. One must-read on this list was Notice by Heather Lewis. He discovered it was out of print & shelled out for a second hand copy. Then he read it and was mightily impressed and contacted Serpent’s Tail, the original publishers, asking why they’d let it go out of print. Lots of back and forth later, and lo! Because of his enthusiasm and encouragement they republished Notice in February this year. How nice – it’s like finding out that us book fans actually count for something! Power to the people!THE MOST DISTURBING BOOKSOlly read Cows by Matthew Stokoe and quite rightly called it The Least Disturbing Book Ever – that was great (I agree). Anyway, after all this extreme reading he nominated Notice as The Most Disturbing – much worse than American Psycho, The Wasp Factory, We Need to Talk About Kevin, etc etc. (BTW Lolita was on the list, quite rightly.) So naturally my curiosity was somewhat piqued. Why do we read disturbing books anyway? Same reason as we watch horror films. Which is? Well, sometimes I think it’s just a macho thing – do you dare to watch The Human Centipede Full Sequence? (Answer : no!!!) Like – do you dare to ride the great big scary rollercoaster? (Answer – no!!!!) I’ve read a bundle of these Disturbing Books and there’s another bundle I would never ever read – 120 Days of Sodom by de Sade, Hogg by Samuel Delaney, anything by Peter Sotos, My Absolute Darling…. CONNECTIONSHeather Lewis writes somewhat like Dennis Cooper and Mary Gaitskell, the subject matter is ghastly, awful, horrendous, but it’s recounted in a lacksadaisical, lacklustre, affectless zoned-out style, quite appropriate for the first person narration, because this first person is severely traumatised and gets retraumatised at least twice. And Notice can be filed next to some other narratives of female self-immolation, like Story of O and The Piano Teacher. It’s in that unhappy orbit. WAS IT ANY GOODWell it was strange – nothing like the vortex of horror I was expecting. This is the story of a self-destructive woman who drifts in and out of prostitution and runs into a couple of horribly sadistic clients; but mainly it’s the story of her lesbian relationships with two women, and these take up the great majority of the book, and are written about very tenderly, but also in a blank ghastly can’t-escape-from-my-own-head kind of way. The language is distant, desiccated, debilitated, and frankly very wearing :I glanced at Beth because I hadn’t been keeping an eye on her and had just now noticed it. She was looking right at me. This put me further off base because until then I thought maybe she hadn’t been paying attention. Realizing she was confused me all the more because I’d been both wanting her to and not. Or I’d been wanting her to but at the same time was afraid of it.There are pages of this kind of mad waffley sub-psychobabble. It was like Henry James if Henry James was a 14 year old girl strung out on quaaludes.

In 1896 this preacher Charles Sheldon thought up the famous challenge and had the lightbulb idea of incorporating it into his sermon in the form of an ongoing story – come back next week for part two, everybody! See what happens when our characters try to live their lives asking WWJD all the time! The idea was a huge hit, his church was packed, and at the end of it he wrote it up as a novel and serialised it in a religious magazine and tried to get it published. The publishers turned him down flat. So the magazine decided to publish it as a novel themselves, and they sent off the manuscript to be copyrighted but they didn’t send the whole manuscript and the copyright office said their application was invalid.So the magazine version sold out immediately – 100,000 copies, apparently, and of course other respectable publishers spotted this phenomenon and also saw that it was out of copyright and pirated it and sold millions, and poor Charles Sheldon didn’t get a dime. How sad. But it was God’s will, you know!I read all this in the preface, which also tells me In His Steps has beencarefully edited and updated for modern readers. Hmmm…. What could that mean? I don’t think they did a great job because quite soon we have Rev Sheldon introducing a young female character like this :A statuesque blonde of attractive proportions, Virginia had an appealing face. The spectacles she wore simply emphasised her gifted intellect.Well anyhow, the story is located in the town of Raymond and focuses on the big cheeses in the church who take the WWJD pledge, such as the editor of one of the main local papers. He immediately decides to stop publishing accounts of prize fighting and he cancels all adverts for alcohol and tobacco, much to his manager’s consternation, who loudly proclaims they will go bust within the month.Transposing the moral teachings of first century rural Judea onto late 19th century middle America throws up some bizarre questions, which Rev Sheldon acknowledges :It is a different age. There are many perplexing questions in our civilisation that are not mentioned in the teachings of Jesus. How am I going to tell what he would do?Apparently if you feel that’s what Jesus would do, then that’s enough. So we get some ludicrous stuff like :The three agreed that, whatever Jesus might do in detail as editor of a daily paper, He would be guided by the same general principles that directed His conduct as the Saviour of the world….Jesus would not issue a Sunday edition. [image]The big idea is actually most interesting – what would happen if Christians actually took the teachings of Jesus seriously? The characters are convinced they are at the beginning of a social revolution. And yes, you can see that could very well be. But the novel fritters the big idea away, and its band of well-meaning wealthy types spend their time and money improving the lives of the poor by singing beautifully to them and closing down saloons. There are cringe-makingly pat scenes such as the one where it is discovered that a member of the church is the owner of some slum tenements – he immediately weeps and promises to fix all the plumbing. (In fact there is a whole ocean of religious weeping here, the pages are wringing with it. )But I will give the Rev Sheldon credit for one scene, in which a bunch of working men let the do-gooders know what the real solutions are, as opposed to the weeping, singing and nourishing soup. One guy frankly says that revolutionary socialism is the only way forward, none of this mystical nonsense. And indeed there is a lot of Christian self-criticism in here :The bishop was appalled to discover how few of his wealthy friends would really suffer any genuine inconvenience for the sake of humanity.Well, as a novel this is hopeless, the reverend was no writer, his characters are thin puppets, and he has no idea of a plot, but we can’t complain about that, it’s all about the Big Idea; and I don’t think he worked it out well enough or went as far as he could with it.

What would success look like to a conspiracy believer? 3)	One conspiracy pusher explains the difference between him and Marianna : ”You believe all people are good. I believe almost everyone is bad.”[image]4)	Marianna asks herself why she doesn’t believe in conspiracies:At the heart of it is a simple answer: trust. I have faith in a system and institutions that have no on the whole let me down, plus a doctor for a dad and a mum who was once a nurse. OMG, this sounds truly naïve, and I can hear even non-truther readers failing to stifle guffaws. And yet, I agree with her. I believe in double blind clinical trials, I believe in peer-ed scientific papers, I believe that the government is real and that I and my fellow citizens can throw the rascals out when we vote, and get some new rascals in. 5)	But! If you oppose conspiracy theories you are quite often in the sorry unpleasant position of having to defend the findings of the FBI and CIA etc about such matters as 9/11 and JFK. It’s invidious. [image]6)	The conspiracy believers will take the official version of a particular event and give it unrelenting scrutiny and dismantle it and mock it. The arguments against the official version, however, are given zero scrutiny, they are instantly accepted. 7)	You might think that the conspiracy believers get involved in their campaigns in order to feel better, to gain what they call “agency” these days. But you’d be wrong (I was). The true believers become even more powerless, because ultimately thy can’t resolve the fabricated plot they think they’ve uncovered. They also find themselves exploited by new powerful people – the leaders of this conspiracy world.That was an interesting insight, on page 46. Unfortunately on page 47 we read :Conspiracy theories and falsehoods help believers feel powerful in a world where lots of people feel powerless.So, er, which is it?8)	Isaac Newton was an alchemist and Conan Doyle believed in spiritualism, and also fairies. Some scientists are full of irrational thought. 9)	The Russian state conspires to promote conspiracy theories about the West, NATO, Ukraine, etc. A real conspiracy encourages fake conspiracies. 10)	The last part of this book is very repetetetive. Marianna sets up a number of fake accounts with the Big Five (Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter/X, Tiktok) using various profiles and checks what stuff their algorithms send to her. No surprise, as, for example, a profile for a fake 14 year old boy, after he clicka and likes some videos, is quickly sent by Tiktok lots of videos glorifying gang life and knife carrying. Or a profile of a concerned 40 year old woman is sent antivax stuff. This is the stuff the companies say they don’t allow. When Marianna shows them proof that their vetting procedures are not working, they refuse an interview and fob her off with a bland statement. “Snapchat strictly prohibits bullying, harassment and any illegal activity…[we] provide confidential in-app reporting tools”.Marianna is contemptuous in a polite sort of way :These are the sorts of responses I often receive from social media sites. They are practically interchangeable, and often describe policies that my reporting contradicts or reveals to be inadequately enforced.11)	Conspiracy theories rely on the belief that many many people are almost superhuman, capable of plans that would be incredibly difficult or even impossible to pull off. When backed into a corner, conspiracy theorists afford magical powers to the cabal of powerful, corrupt people they believe are pulling all the strings.12 ) Between 1 January 2023 and the end of June that year the BBC received 14,488 warnings about abusive social media posts relating to their personnel. Of this number, 11,771 relate to me.Because Marianna has been exposing online conspiracy tolllers for a few years. They know who she is and they hate her.

Unfortunately it’s out of print. I was always amazed by JJ’s scorched-earth policy towards writing – one single short story collection; one single conventional(ish) autobiographical novel; one play; one exploded-multiverse reinvention of the novel; and one final work which leaves the English language behind completely. What JJ would have done next if he hadn’t been so remiss as to die at the age of 59 is beyond our tiny imaginations. I myself am not so much of a Joyce fan, really, I’m a Ulysses fan. I think Finnegans Wake is unreadable. JJ in his madness took 17 years to write it, that’s 17 wasted years for me, falling down a rabbithole he himself made, entranced as he fell like Alice. It was a grossly self-regarding experiment. As for the other stuff, Dubliners is excellent but oh so miserable (Gross says “the prose, for all its artfulness, tends to level off into an even drone”) and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is tiresome (except for the hellfire sermons) and pompous, or I thought so when I read it many years ago, I should give it another go. (Gross says “The portrait of the artist turns out to be the dissection of a second-rate aesthete”.)But all introductions to great authors should be like this – short, sweet, pungent.

I would not myself describe these books as “pure pleasure”.

One person said about him at age 17Ray was a rather boisterous young boy. He liked to imitate Hitler and WC Fields. It’s a wonder we didn’t strangle him.Like Jack Kerouac and Bob Dylan, Ray Bradbury had a golden decade of high productivity – everything he got famous for was written at speed between 1947 and 1957, Fahrenheit 451, Dandelion Wine, The Illustrated Man, The Martian Chronicles. A LOVE HATE THINGHe had a very conflicted relationship with science fiction. He loved the wonder but didn’t care a hoot about the science. Damon Knight said that though Ray Bradburyhas a large following among science fiction readers, there is at least an equally large contingent of people who cannot stomach his work at all, they say he has no respect for the medium…that – worst crime of all – he fears and distrusts science.He was in fact a technophobe – never learned how to drive, didn’t fly on a plane until age 62, owned a computer but didn’t use it. In the 50s wrote for television but didn’t own a set.Author Sam Weller of the unlikely Dickensian name saysRay’s Mars was beautifully impossible. His planet had an atmosphere and it had blue hills. For the author, science was not the point… it was the metaphor that mattered. To sf purists he was an often-resented outsider and of course to purveyors of literature he was a lowly sf writer who should quickly be shown the door. When the beautiful fix-up novel The Martian Chronicles was published Ray wrote to his publisherI think we could have gotten more s from the big people on Chronicles if it hadn’t been for that science-fiction label… Can’t we do something about this, please, Brad? Must the light remain under the bushel-basket?FAMOUS FRIENDSHis stuff was so good that hoity-toity intellectual types who wrote proper literary books noticed it and he got a good  from none other than Christopher Isherwood who invited him round to tea. Some time later at chez Isherwood who should turn up but Aldous Huxley. They offered our Ray some mind-expanding mescaline. They wonderd what effect it would have on the Bradbury brain. He declined and said :I don’t want to have a lot of perceptions. I want to have one at a time. When I write a short story, I open the trapdoor on the top of my head, take out one lizard, shut the trapdoor, skin the lizard, and pin it up on the wall. Ray was afraid that if he took mescaline, he would be unable to, as he put it, “ shut the trapdoor and all my lizards would escape”.As he got more famous (without having any massive blockbusters – but quite quickly stories and novels started popping up in syllabuses) famous people would be encountered quite regularly. Typical evening for Ray Bradbury : I went to the theatre and John Huston was there with his girlfriend Olivia de Havilland.SPEAKING OF JOHN HUSTONThe tall booming Hemingwayesque director was his favourite and he longed to scriptwrite for him and lo! It came to pass in a highly be-careful-what-you-wish-for way. Mr Huston decided one fine day “Ray Bradbury will write a script for my film of Moby Dick!” And Ray found himself on a boat to Ireland (at this point he refused to fly). The reason Ray had been summoned to Ireland to work on a screenplay for a film that was to be shot largely in the Canary Islands was so Huston could make the foxhunting season.John Huston loved to roam the world shootin huntin fishin drinkin and womanizin and directin. He fancied murdering some Irish foxes and they did it in a very wild way, apparently, so Dublin it was for Ray, where he spent months of misery as the butt of Huston’s malicious unpleasant humiliating humour (think Joe Pesci in Goodfellas if Joe Pesci was over 6 feet high and a big shot film director). BRAND NAME RECOGNITIONSam Weller saysShort stories. Novels. Radio. Comic books. Movies. Television. The stage. Architecture and design. Arguably, no other twentieth-century literary figure can claim such sweeping cultural impact. What he is saying is that After writing his handful of famous books (there is a larger armful of non-famous books because he never stopped) Ray Bradbury turned himself into a brand, and affixed his name to all manner of cultural enterprises involving world fairs, Disney, tall buildings, Apollo missions and whatnot. And all without going to college or university. His only college was the local library. It’s a rather large claim. If it’s true it couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy. I read this because RB was my first beloved author and I think I still love (some) of his stuff, and I realised I knew absolutely nothing about him. And I’m glad I found out. It’s not especially dramatic as life-stories go, but it left me with a warm glow.[image]...more",Notes are private!,5,51,1,"Mar 06, 2024","Mar 09, 2024","Mar 02, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9635.The_Bradbury_Chronicles

He was the biographer of various writers including Hemingway and Fitzgerald and John Cheever – the last one got him into trouble and nearly into court, it’s a sorry story. He proposed a biography to Cheever’s widow 6 months after his death and at first everything was happy and welcoming but then the Cheever family realised he was the competition as they were putting together their own memoirs and volumes of journals and letters, why give it away for free if you can get paid for it. It all turned quite ugly. After 6 years the biography came out (John Cheever : A Biography, 1988) and 20 years later was flattened by Blake Bailey’s massive Cheever : A Life (how do they come up with these titles?). I liked his rueful ponderings on being so thoroughly relegated, and his list of “Mistakes” he made in so successfully turning the Cheever family into enemies. The life of the literary biographer is mired in drudgery, says Scott. Take the case of Mark Schorer, whose subject was Sinclair Lewis. Mark wrote dolefully that writing his biography meant reading Lewis’stwenty-one novels, all but five of them of small literary worth and some of them almost unbelievably poorAnd then the 100 or so short storiesalmost all of them worse than poorAnd then as SD saysreading most of this execrable fiction a second or third time, in order to arrive at a pattern of the mind that created itAnother biographer, Justin Kaplan, remarked thatyou need oxlike endurance, resignation to the swift passage of time without much to show for it, and the capacity to feed on your own blood when the sources run drySD says that the biographer needs to be a drudge, a critic, an artist, a historian, an investigative reporter and a polymath. And a psychologist. So not only is the work involved laborious and fraught, the end result is dubious, based on inadequate material and addled self-serving witnesses, and has the result of deflecting attention from the writer’s work to the writer’s life, which is very likely the opposite of what the writer would have wished. Literary biography is a mug’s game.That said, I love a good meaty biography. Here are my top ten favourites (in no order, and including everybody, not just writers)Life of Samuel Johnson by James Boswell[image]-	This isn’t a biography in a modern sense as Bozzy doesn’t really dig up much about SJ’s early life. It’s more a documentary, with hundreds of pages of actual verbatim conversations from the 1760s to 1780s. Very amazing.The Silent Woman by Janet Malcolm[image]-	This is not so much a biography as an exquisite meditation on the bitter war waged via biographies between the Plathophiles and the Hughes fans. Brilliant! And unlike all the other book in this little list, short!The Marquis de Sade by Donald Thomas[image]An amazing life – de Sade may have been revolting but he was never boring, even when he was shut up in an insane asylum for years.Adolf Hitler by John Toland[image]The recent even massiver bio by Ian Kershaw is probably better but this is a rollercoasting riot, not a dull page in its over 1000. The Passage of Power by Robert Caro[image]Book 4 in the series about Lyndon Johnson. This is the part about how LBJ became president in the worst way. Caro is quite repetitive but the story he tells is riveting.Dostoyevsky by Joseph Frank[image]Dosto’s life was not a placid one and he showed how you can write masterpieces whilst on the run from your creditors. This is probably too much of a giant biography so this is probably a Stockholm syndrome entry.The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammed by Andrew Clegg III[image]Malcolm X : A Life of Reinvention by Manning Marable[image]These two brilliant books should be read in order so you get the full sweep of the strange story of the NOI and what caused the tragedy of Malcolm X. Both are great.James Joyce by Richard Ellmann[image]Kind of solid and respectable, you know, but JJ was such a weirdo.

We are never sure what Stalin thought communism was, what the whole point of it was, how long it would take to achieve; what he thought of Hitler, when he realised the Nazis were lethal, is also unknown. The Stalin in this book is a valueless paranoid who endlessly signs orders for purges, for exiles, for transportations and for executions. He sees enemies everywhere so at some point the only purpose of his dictatorship is to maintain himself as dictator. Stalin becomes the point of the Russian revolution.Another great swathe of this book is concerned with the sterile jockeying of the top politburo cheeses for position, also value-free. Did these horrible bureaucrats think they were benefitting the Russian people? We must assume so, in some way, but really we have no idea. At some point it kind of looks like they’re doing it for themselves (see Animal Farm). So this book leaves out too much! He should surely have mentioned that one of Hitler's main obsessions was the destruction of Bolshevism - he made no secret of it - so what did Stalin think of that ? He doesn't even tell us what Stalin thought communism was for! I mean to say, if all it did was oppress the peasants, liquidate millions of innocent workers, create unintended famines by wrecking agriculture and eventually reaching a standard of living way below anything experienced in the west, what was it all for? You have to wonder. Did Stalin think revolution was possible in the west or in other countries? The Chinese revolution occurs offstage until 1949 when suddenly it happens without any warning and without any hint of what Stalin thought about this huge event. Instead of investigating all this our author keeps us in a claustrophobic space where all we can see is the endless jockeying for position and power amongst the politburo, enlivened by the endless recurring purges.WHY DID IT ALL GO HORRIBLY WRONG?He had no expertise whatsoever when it came to dealing with the economy and probably sincerely believed it could be forced into whatever mold politics dictated. [image]USSR WAS NEVER COMMUNISTIt was state capitalist.Wikipedia gives us this definition : A state-capitalist country is one where the government controls the economy and essentially acts as a single huge corporation, extracting surplus value from the workforce in order to invest it in further production.Indeed, the Stalinist version of communism seemed to have been the mirror image, at the level of the entire state, of the standard idea of the capitalist enterprise, in which the greedy bosses mercilessly exploit the workers, whose wages are kept as low as possible, strikes forbidden, no holidays. And all profits go to the directors who live their lives of luxury, spending their millions on vanity projects. According to the author, this is exactly what happened in the USSR from the 30s to the 50s.HOW IDEAS ABOUT AGRICULTURE DESTROYED THE USSRThe main reason it all went wrong, it seems, is that Stalin and his mates had a deep loathing for the peasants. You might be thinking that the communism is all for the working class and you’d be right but wrong if you thought that the toiling millions of Russian peasants were considered to be working class. No! they were exploiters! The better-off ones, anyway. The working class were the industrial workers only. So it was perfectly okay, therefore, to maintain a kind of war on the greedy food-withholding peasants. As soon as he could, Stalin forced all the peasants into collective farms :“Communes” – agricultural and social utopias, the brainchild of socialist fanatics – were proclaimed to be the ideal form and goal of collectivization…. Peasant property became the property of the community, right down to family chickens and personal items. These insane and bloody plans fully reflected Stalin’s ideas and intentions. …. One factor in Stalin’s calculations was his belief (shared by many party functionaries) that a moneyless form of socialism based on the exchange of goods was right around the corner. They could never figure out how to make collective farms productive; they seemed to be crippled by a universal foot-dragging fueled by a gut-level hatred of the Soviet government. If your agriculture is on its knees for 30 years your country is going to fail. There will be regular famines in various areas. The USSR could never seem to fix it. THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONSThe Bolsheviks were committed to their revolution in the sincere belief that life in Russia was intolerable and communism would make things infinitely better. They didn’t intend to cause famines but they did. Because they had no knowledge of how to run an industrial state they made many horrible mistakes :Vast sums and resources were poured into undertaking construction that was never completed; into equipment for which no use was ever found, purchased from abroad out of Soviet gold reserves; into wasteful redesigns, the inevitable result of excessive haste; and into goods so poorly produced as to be unusable. This is heartbreaking. **[image]HITLER/STALINThough this gruesome twosome were the big dictator opponents in WW2 and ruled their empires with amazing cruelty they were utterly different. Hitler rose from nothing and nowhere by the power of his charisma and rhetoric, galvanising thousands with his iron dreams of glory. The German people were in love with Hitler. He had them in a trance, listening to him spit fire for an hour, all without notes, they thought they had caught a glimpse of German heaven. He was their great leader. But Stalin spent ten years toiling tirelessly for someone else's revolution; he slowly wormed and connived his way to the top, nothing was handed to him, he wangled and backstabbed and he also worked 25 hours a day. He hardly ever spoke in public, he was stumbling and rambling and dull. It took him another ten years after the revolution to eliminate his rivals and become supreme dictator. Hitler's cult of personality was spontaneous and heartfelt, Stalin's was manufactured by the Party - but it's true, eventually that became a deep heartfelt thing too.******Compare this with the new biography of Sylvia Plath Red Comet by Heather Clark – 1154 pages on a life that ended at the age of 30.** Grotesque errors made by democratic governments are of course not uncommon – there’s an entertaining book about the subject called The Blunders of Our Governments by Anthony King. But they are fairly mild compared to the Stalin gang’s mistakes....more",Notes are private!,10,38,1,"Feb 13, 2024","Feb 23, 2024","Feb 12, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23360199-stalin

It started with some literary pretensions – the first one included CS Forester, LP Hartley, Muriel Spark and Angus Wilson. By volume 6 that had been ditched and the brilliantly named editor Herbert van Thal (a real person!) had discovered a group of young writers who thought all the old spooky stuff was lame and just wanted to write stuff about ever more horrible people doing ever more repulsive things to each other.

One reason you may be reading his book is that you’re not that interested in music at all, but you loved The Crimson Petal and the White or Under the Skin or The Book of New Strange Things and, in the absence of any more novels by Michel Faber, you thought you’d give my non-fiction a try. I loved all three of his novels and I’m a music fan, so this book was in my hands as soon as I saw it.WE ARE NOT ADULT ORIENTATED[image]What this book isn’t is Michel Faber’s 100 Favourite Records and why you should like them. But I am hoping that he will rapidly produce a follow-up called Michel Faber’s 100 Favourite Records And Why You Should Like Them. What this book is is a whole lot of essays on all kinds of interesting aspects of music such as why people who don’t like music at all are considered to be freaks*, whether there is a hierarchy of greatness in music, the sadness of not being able to sing, the macho ridiculousness of very loud concerts**, music and babies, music and elephants, and so on. Some way more interesting than others. I skipped over the little babies and the elephants.He has a chapter on how we are supposed to deal with music we love when it is made by men we loathe*** subtitled “On Rolf Harris, R Kelly and Morrissey” and one which trashes vinyl snobbery and one which says autotune is perfectly fine, and so is lipsynching the vocals at live gigs (Aretha never had to leap and cavort like a ballerina whilst hitting every big note). Meaning that the Milli Vanilli scandal was fashioned out of pure naivete. And a melancholy chapter about how the charity shops are silting up with the MOR albums bought in the 60s and 70s, brought in by 50 and 60 year olds when their 80 and 90 year old parents have died. THOUGH THE WORLD IS MY OYSTER IT’S ONLY A SHELL[image]Michel has some pleasantly waspish observations to make about this stuff called music. He is keen for us to understand that it’s mostly used as a mental room spray and is not listened to as a thing in itself:The sort of engagement with music in which the person focuses on the music for its own sake, rather than “having it on” in the background, during some other activity, accounts for just 2 percent of all listeningAnd whilst being a fan of avantgarde stuff like Einstürzende Neubauten and even Revolution 9 on the White Album he has a perfectly old fogey-style get-off-my-lawn rantlet about this modern rubbish (modern = the last 20 years) :In the 21st century, even those records which are deemed to be “catchy” are seldom melodious in the way that songs by Cole Porter or The Beatles or even Nirvana were. Typically, they rely on a perseverating pattern of two or three notes, which the songwriters of yesteryear would’ve regarded as a mere fragment rather than a tune or a riff worthy of the name.And his out and proud tirade against classical music and all its insufferable superiority is such fun. All those prestige orchestras…are nothing more than tribute bandsHa haah! That is, just like Nerdvana or Pink Fraud, they try to perfectly reproduce the sounds of their heroes, in their case Beethoven and Mahler and so on. AIN’T NO SWEET MAN WORTH THE SALT OF MY TEARS[image]He has a chapter on music that makes him cry when he really isn’t a crier. There was one part of this chapter that nearly made me cry – he quotes these lines from a sad Sandy Denny song:And maybe, by the evening, we’ll be laughingJust wait and seeAll the changes there’ll beBy the time it gets dark And he adds this note :Readers may be interested to know what was involved in quoting these lyrics for you And he gives the history of which big companies successively owned the copyright to Sandy’s song. In the end, Warner Chappell charged me £1000 to quote from the song. A thousand quid for those three lines? They ain’t Shakespeare you know! I would have told Warner Chappell to shove their thousand quid where the sun don’t shine. I was wondering which song would be most likely to draw tears from my ducts and I think it would be ""The Green Fields of France"" by Davy Arthur and the Fureys :Well, how do you do, Private Willie McBride?Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside?And rest for a while in the warm summer sunI've been walking all day, and I'm nearly doneI see by your gravestone you were only nineteenWhen you joined the great fallen in 1916… it all gets too much….WILL I LOOK BACK AND SAY THAT I WISH I HADN'T DONE WHAT I DID?[image]This is of course RECOMMENDED, like a few great evenings with a dear friend chattering about everything and anything but mostly about that magical stuff that can cause ecstasy and pain, love and regret, excitations and melancholia and make new worlds appear in a second, and sometimes all of this at once.Notes*Vladimir Nabokov: Music, I regret to say, affects me merely as an arbitrary succession of more or less irritating sounds. …the concert piano and all wind instruments bore me in small doses and flay me in larger ones.**The ultimate in contemporary absurdity is a concert where the performers and the audience are all wearing ear plugs.

But his classy upbringing gave him fluency in German and French and he became very useful to the US Army. Meanwhile at age 20 he had decided he would be a writer, beginning with short stories about rich privileged young New Yorkers. The magazines do not roll out any red carpets but he gets to slot one in here and there. Life in the army was 2 years training in the USA, not so bad, then WHAM off to England and the hell on earth that was D-Day. He was in a unit which was at the sharpest point of the sharp end of the invasion. It began with 3000 soldiers; in one month two thousand of them were dead. Salinger was lucky. The only damage he got was a broken nose and PTSD which wasn’t considered to be a thing back then. In the middle of the hell on earth, with body parts to the left and right, he would find a foxhole or an uncollapsed shack and write more short stories about effete young New Yorkers, and continue a surreal correspondence with his agent about whether Mademoiselle magazine would accept his latest one.After the shooting stopped he thought he would be going home but no, now they had the job of liberating concentration camps, so he got re-traumatised. In his teens he had stayed in Vienna with a family his father knew and had a chaste romance with the daughter. He took some leave and went to find them again, to see how they were, but he didn’t find them, they were all dead.Out of the blue he married a French woman named Sylvia and was living with her in Germany. They had a Skoda and a black schnauzer named Benny. He never gave anyone any information about Sylvia, his friends got the idea she was maybe an osteopath, or a psychologist. Actually she was an ophthalmologist who spoke four languages, and she was German.The problem was that US soldiers were forbidden to marry Germans, so JD got her a fake passport. He informed his family he wasn’t coming home; they were shocked and horrified. He was discharged from the army and transferred to the Defence Department. He now became JD Salinger: Nazi hunter. Also JD Salinger: Rescuer of Orphans.Finally in April 46 the happy couple took a boat to New York. Immediately his mother and his new bride began World War Three and by July Sylvia was on a boat back to Europe. He was finally getting somewhere with the stories and by 1948 he was HOT. Incandescent, you might say. The New Yorker gave him an annual contract (guessed to be $30,000 but this sounds crazily high to me) to be the first magazine to receive any new stories. About half of the first half of this book is a catalogue of which stories got rejected or accepted by which magazines and that is not remotely interesting. After Catcher in the Rye exploded (and reached the dizzying heights of No 4 on the bestseller list) the story becomes an equally dull list of tiffs and quarrels and snippy telephone calls with a parade of editors and publishers.If you skip that stuff this is a very nice account of a guy whose measurable life stopped in 1965 while he had another half century to go (he died in 2010). 1965 was the year of the last Salinger story.JDS might have been a well-heeled middleclass sophisticate seen at the nicest places where well-fed faces all stop and stare but he was in fact on a religious quest because he was a spiritual person. In 1952 he found what he was after : Vedantic philosophy as expounded in a book called The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna[image]and he wanted everyone to read this, come on, only one thousand pages of dense Hindu-Buddhist fusion. He got married again to a very young woman and at this point he decided to drop out and buy a fixer-upper in the middle of nowhere, New Hampshire - there were no mod cons, there weren’t even any old cons, no running water, no phone, nearest hospital 20 miles of bad roads away. He grew organic vegetables and meditated, very solitary. He was ahead of the curve. He gradually fixed up the barn and put up a fence. Keep Out. He built a shack aka bunker aka hermitage away from the barn/house and would retire there every day for 12 hours writing the Glass family stories. He gradually assumed the shape of a guru himself in the minds of Young America, these were kids who in six or seven years would be at Woodstock. Photographers and reporters came around and he hated every single one of them.After 1965 there were no more stories and no more nothing. No photos, no interviews. This book takes 350 pages to move the story to 1965, then another 40 pages for the next 45 years, because in that almost half century there were only three known facts relating to JD Salinger.One conclusion the author reaches is that JD did indeed continue writing every day for the last 45 years but his writing became a form of prayer, a religious exercise, and merged, as it were, so completely with JD’s personality that it became far too personal to conceive of publishing, that publishing became the equivalent of assault.

So she had never heard of the Holocaust, Martin Luther King, civil rights – most of the common furniture of the American mind in fact.

But the pressure is on us readers to believe the victim/author. How dare you think of not believing the victim? You would surely be colluding in the abuse she suffered! There were moments when my good angel turned green and flew away and my bad angel said – huh, a likely story, this could never have happened. I confess, there were several moments. Given all the cultish total ignorance of her first 15 years I couldn’t quite see how Tara could glide into college, get a degree, & then be wafted on clouds of intellectual admiration to Trinity College, Cambridge, England, no less, to do a PhD no less. That is the kind of vertiginous ascent a Cape Canaveral rocket would aspire to. But it seems that every tutor, lecturer or professor she encountered instantly perceived her excellent brain power and found a grant she could apply for and wrote a letter of recommendation to the next gilded seat of learning (ending in Harvard). ESCAPE FROM IDAHOTara at the university is like Dorothy in Oz, but this Dorothy feels like she has to go back to Kansas every summer for more scrapyard shifts. There’s a huge, longwinded and (so sorry!) tiresome battle with the family about her memories of maltreatment and violence at the hands of one brother, and this dominates the last third of the book. Since she no longer talks to her family you can see how that all panned out. I don’t know – this is a very uneasy book - I felt I was gawking at a roadside crash a lot of the time.FURTHER READINGAfter reading her daughter’s memoir, the mother decided to self-publish her own version , called Educating.

Full of itself, you could say. I heard it at night muttering “You’ll never read me…Quail before my mighty unreadness.” Unquailing one day, like a pelican swooping down to pluck from the mighty torrent a squiggling fishy, I cantilevered the mighty volume from its roost, blew off a cobweb and committed a month to reading its 1120 pages.And it turned out to be great! And also tremendously peculiar! This is an excellent combination, and it was my novel of the year. It inspired me to read the author’s biography[image]And no surprise, he turned out to be a real weirdo. That reminds me I also read a novel called Weirdo. [image]It was a deeply so-so comic novel. I didn’t do well with comedy novels, but this one was actually funny :[image]and I reread this outrageous almost-masterpiece :[image]just in time, before the recent terrible events turned this novel into something now completely unreadable. WEIRDEST NOVEL OF THE YEARThe Temptation of St Antony by Flaubert – no contest. I mean, what is that?MOST POPULAR NOVEL OF THE YEAR I READ[image]I ditched it half way so me and popular taste seem to have parted company for the moment. Although having said that, I did love Barbie.WORST NOVEL OF THE YEAR[image]I read it because of a very nice booktuber who loves cheap nasty horror and said it was great. He lied. It’s really not great. It is so not great. I will still watch your vids, Criminolly, but I will not take your recommendations. No offence. ODDEST BOOK OF THE YEAR/MOST UNPOPULAR BOOK OF THE YEAR(joint award)Perhaps not too surprisingly, this guy wrote it -[image]Francis William Newman, brother of the more famous John Henry, wrote it, all about his truly agonised and immersive journey from one microhabitat within the Protestant faith to another microhabitat within the Protestant faith. He was in search of a perfect understanding of God and his plans for the universe and for Francis William Newman. Very glad I read it but I wouldn’t recommend it to ANYONE. I see that only five other Goodreaders have rated it. This is all for the best. BEST ANNOTATED BOOK OF THE YEAR[image]Every home should have one. Just gorgeous and like a little encyclopedia. ANGRIEST BOOK OF THE YEAR[image]This is a blazing hot book about racism in the USA, a great follow-up for anyone who enjoyed (if that is the right word) Ibram X Kendi’s fantastic Stamped from the Beginning.BEST BIOGRAPHY[image]According to Ian Kershaw’s introduction, they had to twist his arm behind his back for several minutes before he would agree to write a biography of Hitler. In the words of the Lovin’ Spoonful (1965), he didn’t want to have to do it. But he did it and I read both vast parts of this vast book. Amazing story, and no hifalutin professorial language either. 100% recommended. COMEDY OF THE YEARNovels did not provide me with great comedy this year but unexpectedly some oddball literary criticism did – Stephen Moore wrote two very funny books which demonstrate that a) you shouldn’t turn your hobby into your job and b) you shouldn’t get to know your heroes. He is a gentle-hearted edgelord literary critic who has read more unreadable books than anyone else and loved every one. He has garded every avant there is so naturally it was a dream come true ™ when he got a job with the Dalkey Press, who specialise in publishing completely unreadable books. And what a miserable time he had of it! This is recounted in horrible detail in his memoir :[image]Through that job he got to work closely with Alexander Theroux, brother of the more famous Paul Theroux, a moderately obscure novelist who loves to grind out vast unreadable books filled with words like geloscopical, kalkydri, post-lapsarian, solisequious, malneirophrenia, ignivomous, chantepleure, rosydactylate, panmoronium, chrysopoetic, zielverkooper, cataphatic and so forth, and who loves to portray himself as a human vortex of sesquipedalian misanthropic nastiness. To his shuddering horror Stephen found that OMG when you get to know him he is really like that! It’s not an act![image]MOST INSANELY DETAILED BOOK OF THE YEARA very clear winner : The McCartney Legacy Volume 1 1969-1973 by Allan Kozinn and Adrian Sinclair – 770 pages about four years in the life of Paul McCartney.

I read two, the blazingly angry Stamped from the Beginning by Ibram X Kendi, and The Wrath to Come by Sarah Churchwell, also written with white-hot intensity; and I also read Manning Marable’s exhaustive terrific biography of Malcolm X. This excellent book fits perfectly together with those three, another piece in the difficult jigsaw puzzle of America in the 20th century.The story of Elijah Muhammed is the story of the Nation of Islam. He was the supreme leader from 1934 to 1975 .In these early years, everything the NOI did, everything it believed, was a reaction to the profound racism black people experienced every day – just to mention one statistic, from a peak of 161 lynchings in 1892, there were still 24 in 1933. Elijah Muhammed said that by the age of 20 he had witnessed three lynchings. He said :I’ve seen enough of the white man's brutality to last me 26,000 yearsSo it is perhaps not surprising he preached a religion that condemned white people as devils and looked forward to the day when all black people could live lives in their own national homeland without any contact with white people. Sounds extreme, but the emotional logic is right there in front of your face.  Muhammed called for a place in the Western hemisphere for African-Americans to establish an independent state. He admitted that the American government would probably not accede to this demand.IN THE BEGINNING WAS FARDThe founder of the Nation of Islam was a very mysterious man named Wallace Fard Muhammed. They think he was born around 1877 and that in his life he used over 50 aliases. His first 50 years are obscure, then he arrived in Detroit in 1930 and over four years he created the movement known as the Nation of Islam, inventing its complicated and weird theology, renaming all his reportedly 8000 followers by X-ing out their slave names, and discovering his successor Elijah Muhammed; but then he got into some heavy trouble with the cops who told him to leave town and not come back in 1932. Two years later he vanished and no one since has ever turned up any information on what happened to him.You have to say it’s very impressive, starting up a new religion in three years with a complete radical ideology, one that still flourishes nearly 100 years later. [image]Fard Muhammed constructed an elaborate world history explaining how it came to be that once the black man (which he called the “original” man) ruled the earth and then the white man came along and enslaved him. Like, what happened? * The explanation he came up with sounded like science fiction – there was a renegade evil black scientist named Yacub who for murky rebellious reasons created by means of genetic experimentation a completely white race of people. (It’s way more complicated than that of course.) Professor Clegg tries so very hard to maintain a scholarly Wikipedialike neutral tone to his detailed exposition of the Nation’s beliefs, but he can’t refrain sometimes from comments such as this :The myth of Yacub’s creation of the white race and the murderous, deceitful and evil nature attributed to whites by the NOI has given it the distinction of being the most racially chauvinistic black organisation in the history of the United States… his [Fard’s] doctrines were a tragic variation of the ideas of Hitler, racist eugenicists, and other racial purists of his day…. To some, the Muslim history of the Black Nation made perfect sense and explained a great many things; to others it was sheer lunacy The author clearly states that this creation myth was a product of “the imagination of Fard Muhammed”. There was also an elaborate Judgement Day scenario in which the white race would be condemned and the black race saved by a giant spaceship called the Mother Plane. Professor Clegg says :Perhaps second only to the Yacub myth, the Mother Plane story was the most peculiar element of the theology of the Nation. Unless one was predisposed to believe in flying saucers, this tale could hardly be told without raising serious doubts even among the most open minded of listeners…. Another extremely bold element of Fard’s belief system was that Christianity was identified as the religion of the white devil and totally rejected. In Fard’s origin story Jesus was the second prophet sent by Allah after Moses, and he was a black man who built the city of Jerusalem and was killed by bounty hunters and was not crucified. The true teaching of Jesus was Islam but the white people falsified history. (The Pope was the head of that conspiracy.) The third prophet sent was Mohammed and then Allah much later saw that the black enslaved people in America needed a fourth prophet, and so sent Fard Muhammed. The point of this whole enterprise was to enable black people in America to regain their original culture, names, strength and intelligence, and rejoin the Tribe of Shabazz and prepare for the judgment of the white race which will surely come soon.ELIJAHHe began life as Elijah Poole, seventh son of a sharecropper in a small town in Georgia in the year of 1897. He moved to Detroit, as thousands did, finally encountering Fard Muhammed’s group at the age of 34. He was converted and, for sure, although uneducated, and not a great orator, and a physically small man too, he must have had a quiet charisma, because in a short while Fard realised that it was Elijah who should lead the Nation when he departed the scene, in 1933/4. Elijah didn’t change much of what Fard taught except for one massive detail : he identified Fard as Allah himself (p123). That is, not a prophet from Allah, but Allah in person. Right there is why orthodox Muslims would reject the NOI teachings as blasphemous. But it took a long time for Elijah to get any grasp of what actual Islam preached, even though he used the Qu’ran all the time; and likewise it took a long time for orthodox Muslims to notice the Nation of Islam. When they did, neither wanted to fall out with the other, so most of the time they politely ignored a whole herd of elephants that were in every room. Occasionally there would be hotheads who would get mad at Elijah. One orthodox Muslim quoted by a Chicago newspaper “denounced Muhammed as a fraud and a convicted criminal who taught racial hatred contrary to the true teachings of Islam”. But mostly the heat that Elijah brought down was from the usual cops and FBI and hostile press, and that was because the fiery speechifying and the disciplined strength of the Nation of Islam made them all nervous.QUIET RADICALISMThey were consistent and firm : the black people of America have to do it for themselves, no one is going to help them. They therefore built slowly and painstakingly a string of businesses and told their followers to buy only from those where possible. They got tremendous respect, even, grudgingly, from white opponents. They were a refuge for a lot of people who had been living dissolute lives. ELIJAH MAKES A HAJJThis was a big turning point – in 1959 he toured Middle Eastern countries for the first time and performed the hajj. His travels confronted him with some unpalatable facts, such as In Saudi Arabia and the Holy City itself, African blacks were being legally held as slaves by Arab Muslims p124At the same time, the Muslim clerics who met Elijah realised that he was preaching some strange belief system that wasn’t Islamic at all. This was awkward all round.BACK IN THE USABy now it was the Civil Rights era. Black people “who had risked life and limb” struggling for civil rights and desegregation looked on with horror as Elijah Muhammed made it clear in speech after speech that integration was wrong, the races should be physically separate, Christianity was a trick and any dealings with the US government in the form of voting or education were useless. All other African American leaders, like Martin Luther King, were “hungry for a place among the white race instead of their own race” and had ”turned many potential freedom-fighting Negroes into contented, docile slaves” p131. Not too many people slagged off Martin Luther King, but Elijah did. This thinking culminated in a horrible period of rapprochement between the Nation of Islam and two white groups, the American Nazi Party and – believe it or not – the KKK. Well, once again, the logic was plain to see – the white groups wanted total racial segregation and so did the Nation. It led to several NOI meetings being attended by the Nazis (in full regalia) or the Klan. Elijah was trying to figure whether they could work something out. In the end, they didn’t. MALCOLM XThis is where the story gets positively Shakespearean – the doting loving father sees his favourite son betray him, but the favourite son believes in his heart he is rescuing his beloved father from tragic error. Malcolm came to the view that Elijah’s resolute rejection of any political involvement was a big mistake, and essentially, the NOI was not fighting for black people as it should but was waiting for some kind of divine intervention, which was not going to happen. Elijah stuck to his principles – no dealing with the (white) devil. Aside from that there was a lot of paranoia about who was going to succeed Elijah. It was complicated. Well, in 1965 as we know, Malcolm was assassinated, and although three NOI members were later convicted of the crime, Professor Clegg is less than clear, unusually, about whether any order was given by Elijah Muhammed. On the one hand, nothing major happened in the NOI without Elijah’s approval; on the other hand, it was completely out of character, he was not a leader who threatened people with violence. His hair-raising rhetoric was in complete contrast to his gentle demeanour. He was unusual. THIS REVIEW IS WAY TOO LONGIt is a most fascinating story, that’s my excuse, and this book is a brilliant piece of original detailed research. Highly recommended.[image]*I was reminded of a more succinct story from Jomo Kenyatta. He said : “When the white man came here we had the land and he had the Bible. Then he taught us to pray with our eyes closed. When we opened our eyes, he had the land and we had the Bible.”...more",Notes are private!,7,35,1,"Dec 20, 2023","Dec 28, 2023","Dec 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21888014-the-life-and-times-of-elijah-muhammad

For the madman appeals to what is fundamental, to passion and the instincts…At that exact moment, in 1921, there was a guy just starting his political career in an obscure minuscule laughably unpopular political party over in Germany. Of course, he was Hitler, and he was a madman. It gave me a shudder.That was an unintentional serious note - this is a sweet, funny book.

A guy will spend years writing a long book about sexual health in marriage, knowing that it will be a big hit when published, and when he meets a total stranger one day he will whimsically sell him his manuscript for whatever cash the guy has in his pockets (a few rupees) and the total stranger will take the manuscript and get it published and become rich and the author will never ask for any royalties, not even when he meets the random guy again later on. And no one will ever mention the total unfairness or borderline insanity of such an occurrence. 2.	A 15 year old son will run away from his family because of a fight with his annoying father, and the parents, realising he has gone, will fall into despair, weeping and wailing, but they will never think of asking the police to find their son. In fact they will not make even the feeblest attempt to trace him. It seems registering a teenager as a missing person is not something anyone would do.3.	After the income from the sex book dies down, the guy thinks hmmm I need a job, I know, I will become a financial expert and get everyone to lend me their cash. How can I do this? Of course! I will offer my customers 25% interest when the bank only offers 5%! So this is an offer the whole town of Malgudi cannot refuse and they shower our guy with all their stashed cash caches and lo! they get their 25% and everything is peachy. How this guy is able to do such a thing, what he does with all the money to be able to afford such a Himalayan altitude of interest, is not explained. Maybe it was only ever a Ponzi scheme.

I was visiting the revered geologist minerologist Professor Otto Lidenbrock, or as I call him, uncle, and I was idly flipping through a priceless unique 16th century Icelandic manuscript he had acquired, when I found a mysterious page inserted within the parchment. It was in an unknown code. How exciting. Naturally we spent many amusing hours trying to figure it out, hoping that it wasn’t just a recipe for asparagus soup but something of critical worldshaking scientific importance. But we couldn’t crack it. He ran out of the house to find some other eccentric professor to interrogate.

He thinks he’s being kindly-funny when he’s being revolting. Well, of course, that was the taste in polite humour back then – patronising little children mercilessly. And he doesn’t stop laying it on with a trowel :These articles Phœbe accordingly supplied, and, as a mark of gratitude for his previous patronage, and a slight super-added morsel after breakfast, put likewise into his hand a whale! The great fish, reversing his experience with the prophet of Nineveh, immediately began his progress down the same red pathway of fate whither so varied a caravan had preceded him. We are taking the whole first page of chapter 8 to hack through all this arch blathering about a gingerbread whale and the fun stuff about Jonah and the red pathway. And he will not stop wringing every last morsel of hilarity from the small boy.This remarkable urchin, in truth, was the very emblem of old Father Time, both in respect of his all-devouring appetite for men and things, and because he, as well as Time, after ingulfing thus much of creation, looked almost as youthful as if he had been just that moment made.Finally the kid leaves – phew, maybe we can get back on track now. As the child went down the steps, a gentleman ascended them, and made his entrance into the shop. Okay – a new character. Ah, wait – in 1850 that meant that you had to spend a page describing what he’s wearing because no one in those days knew what anything looked like. It was the portly, and, had it possessed the advantage of a little more height, would have been the stately figure of a man considerably in the decline of life, dressed in a black suit of some thin stuff, resembling broadcloth as closely as possible. A gold-headed cane, of rare Oriental wood, added materially to the high respectability of his aspect, as did also a neckcloth of the utmost snowy purity, and the conscientious polish of his boots. His dark, square countenance, with its almost shaggy depth of eyebrows, was naturally impressive, and would, perhaps, have been rather stern, had not the gentleman considerately taken upon himself to mitigate the harsh effect by a look of exceeding good-humor and benevolence. Owing, however, to a somewhat massive accumulation of animal substance about the lower region of his face, the look was, perhaps, unctuous rather than spiritual, and had, so to speak, a kind of fleshly effulgence, not altogether so satisfactory as he doubtless intended it to be. A susceptible observer, at any rate, might have regarded it as affording very little evidence of the general benignity of soul whereof it purported to be the outward reflection. And if the observer chanced to be ill-natured, as well as acute and susceptible, he would probably suspect that the smile on the gentleman’s face was a good deal akin to the shine on his boots, and that each must have cost him and his boot-black, respectively, a good deal of hard labor to bring out and preserve them.My dear fellow goodreaders, this was page 116 and I could take it no more.

He covers the waterfront, meaning the wide span of white Southern music recorded between 1923 and 1932 mostly with a sprinkling going up to 1940. So as well as the usual bust-downs, turkey trots, rags and stomps we have topical songs (Woman’s Suffrage, You Can’t Make a Monkey out of Me), murder ballads based on real cases (The Death of Floyd Collins, The Bluefield Murder), cowboy ballads (When the Work’s all Done This Fall), sacred songs (Where We’ll Never Grow Old, Just Over the River), parlour songs from the previous century (Sweet Bunch of Daisies), comedy turns (I’m a Stern Old Bachelor*, When the Roses Bloom for the Bootlegger, Who Broke the Lock on the Hen-House Door?, Prosperity is Just Around Which Corner?), comedy sketches (A Corn Licker Still in Georgia Parts 1 and 2), satires on local conditions (Eleven Cents Cotton Forty Cent Meat Parts 1 and 2, Down on Penny’s Farm) – so it's not all rocketing fast fiddle and guitar music.There are also many delightful pix.[image]The DeZurik Sisters.

The hippies, the yippies, the Black Panthers, the Weathermen, the Manson Family, the assassinations, blah blah, you know it all. This particular story of the Zebra murders is strangely not so famous. It’s very easy to see why : it’s a horrible tale about racists. The location was San Francisco. The time span : October 1973 to May 1974. The number of victims : 15 dead, eight more who survived.All the victims were white. All the perpetrators were black. This wasn’t coincidental. I had thought that that was why these crimes were called Zebra murders but that would have been gross. No, it was because the Z channel on police radios was cleared for use only by the cops working on this case. Z is always for zebra, you know. This is a story of American terrorism, not serial murder. Beginning in October 1973 the homicide cops in SF were confronted with a seemingly unstoppable series of random shootings. It was a worst nightmare situation. Usually with murders the cops have something to go on – witnesses, evidence, motive that can be deduced, money, drugs, sex, connections between the corpse and the killer that spin a thread the cops can follow. But in these cases, one after another after another, there was nothing. All the witnesses, when there were any, said the same thing – a guy walked up the street, pulled out a gun, shot this poor person twice, three times, then walked away. Description? Kind of tall, nondescript clothes. A black man. And it didn’t take the cops long to connect the shootings, they were all done with the same gun. And the cops also noticed the thing about the victims – young, old, men, women, quite random, except they were all white. The bodies kept falling : five in December, five in one single evening in January. The story is told by Earl Saunders, the black homicide cop who worked the case from the very beginning. After the five in one evening, he said“It felt like the gates of hell had opened up and something evil swarmed out. It was a feeling that grabbed your stomach and wouldn’t let go. Because as bad as that night was, what made it worse was we didn’t have a clue when it would end.”Earl and his black partner shook down all their informants in the black community and got stony silence. Usually they could pick up a whisper here, a word there, not this time. That made them think – it’s not ordinary criminals doing this. Who then?Eight months and they had nothing, not a single clue. Eventually the case was cracked when the cops finally released some police sketches of suspects (they were reluctant to do this for some complicated reasons). And plus, the city put up a $30,000 reward. One of the group recognised himself and thought he could convince the cops he hadn’t killed anyone but he’d been along on the ride for a lot of the time, so he could turn state’s witness and get the thirty grand. And that’s what happened. So who were the killers and why did they do it? If they weren’t called the Zebra murders they would have been called the Black Self-Help Moving and Storage murders, because the five guys who had been doing all the shooting met when they worked for this small company. It specialised in employing black guys recently released from prison, and it was associated with the Nation of Islam. The book states many times that the Nation of Islam that existed in the early 70s was a totally different organisation to that which exists today. It then goes on to show that the teachings of Elijah Muhammed, especially one inflammatory passage about killing white devils, was taken literally by these guys. Earl says :From what I could see, the one thing that seemed to guide every other possible motive, whether it was to start up a race war or just avenge what they saw as injustice, was rage. A crazy, insane rage over what they thought whites had done to blacks. Once you got to that realisation, if you were black, you had to pause. Because the truth was there wasn’t a black I knew who didn’t feel at least an inkling of the same thing.Earl later became the first black police chief of San Francisco. Although this is a fascinating and horrifying crime story, I nearly had to rate the book only 3 stars because it tries to tell two stories at the same time, the main one being, of course, the story of the murders and the investigation, and the other one the struggle of Earl Saunders and the very few other black police officers in San Francisco against the awful racism of the San Francisco Police Department. It’s a very worthy subject, surely, but, no offence intended, it gives the first half of the book a draggy stop-start effect. You want to get on with the what-happened-next of true crime and you are continually being informed about the lawsuit black officers were bringing against the SFPD and how the white officers tried to sideline the black minority, etc. But I can see that from Earl’s perspective the two are intertwined.Final note : the 4th victim, who survived two point-blank bullets in the chest on 13 December 1973, was a guy called Art Agnos. 15 years later he became Mayor of San Francisco.

A tale full of naïve heartstopping optimism, a rare quality in science fiction. Psychologists create a community of orphan children (grabbed up from all over the world) with the idea of discovering what would happen if such kids were shielded from the toxic environments they usually grow up in and brought up with love. What happens is that they discover their innate mental abilities – telekinesis, telepathy, flying, whatnot – and seal themselves off from the rest of the world. As you would. -	""Build Up Logically"" by Howard Schoenfeld. Frank put his hand out in front of him and moved it back and forth a couple of times, inventing the rabbit. Getting to feel the creature’s fur, he built it up logically from the feel. It was the only animal that could have produced that particular feel, and I was proud of him for thinking of it. -	 ""The Tunnel Under the World"" by Frederik Pohl. Starts off as a Groundhog style repeating day (stories (and movies) like that are a whole genre of their own), then gets wilder and crazier. Then more crazier.

It’s a brilliant, careful, deadly, even-tempered, forensic dismantling of Freud and his palace of misconceptions. I was utterly impressed by Richard Webster’s huge task – all the stuff he had to read and absorb (“stuff” is a technical term), all the judicious filleting. So the short version of this  is : if you’re interested in Freud, read it now.REAL SYMPTOMS, IMAGINARY ILLNESSESFreud’s early career : patients present real symptoms which are diagnosed as imaginary illnesses to be cured, or most often, not cured, by fake procedures.In those late 19th century days doctors really didn’t know what most diseases were. So they blustered and theorised. You can’t blame them, they were doing their best. From the time of Plato onwards, physicians had frequently explained a particular set of physical sensations reported by patients by suggesting that it was caused by the womb moving upwards through the body towards the head.Imagine that! It was called, of course, hysteria. Of which Steyerthal said in 1908 “there is no such disease and there never was”.So it became a blanket term given to what we now understand as MS, syphilis and other ailments.Another “syndrome of convenience” was neurasthenia, invented in 1869. The term “neurasthenia” thus came…to function as a catch-all diagnosis which offered both physicians and patients a way of escaping from feelings of therapeutic helplessness. … It functioned both to protect physicians from having to admit the depths of their ignorance and to prevent patients from losing faith in the medical profession altogether.Freud was very big on both these syndromes. This was the diagnostic miasma from which he emerged.SOME QUOTESWalter Kendrick wonderedwhy an egregious card-house like psychoanalysis, ready to crumble at the impact of any feather, was bought wholesale by an entire culture that still dwells in itRW adds the following remarks :Freud’s own internal and idiosyncratic logic is treated as though it were a real, external chain of causality. The most charitable observation we can make about this kind of reasoning is that it is neither odd nor abnormal. For it is exactly the kind of reasoning habitually encountered in necromancy, astrology, phrenology…As to why Freudianism was such a hit, RW answers (mildly, conventionally) that, mostly, it was because psychoanalysis so neatly replaced religious faith for generations of intellectuals. (Confession, which was ejected from the Christian faith as superstition by the Protestants, was reintroduced by Freud in the name of Science.)RICHARD WEBSTER TELLS IT LIKE IT ISDetermined to categorise those who profess systematic knowledge as either scientists or charlatans, we find it difficult to believe that any thinker who makes a genuine contribution to scientific knowledge can either, simultaneously or subsequently, become the propagator of folly, error and misjudgement.In psychoanalysis human behaviour and human consciousness are treated as intrinsically misleading phenomena which are supposedly devoid of meaning until they have been illuminated by insights drawn from a secret inner realm – which is dominated by sexuality and which is supposedly accessible and intelligible only to those trained in psychoanalysis. The Unconscious is not simply an occult entity for whose real existence there is no palpable evidence. It is an illusion produced by language – a kind of intellectual hallucination.There was no method of testing out these theories or of assessing their worth which was not predicated upon the assumption of his own genius. Richard Webster's unflappable ponderous Johnsonian prose style is perfect for this kind of radical assassination.In the name of full disclosure I admit that the last section is not useful and can be skipped and the whole thing could be said to be somewhat too long.
