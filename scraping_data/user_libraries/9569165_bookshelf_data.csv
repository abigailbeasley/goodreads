This author is very good at that. This is a story about a man named Nathan who finds a new born baby abandoned in the woods while he is duck hunting. The baby is eventually given to his grandmother who names him Nathan but calls him Nat. As the child grows up he becomes hostile and his grandmother has many problems with him. She ends up giving the young boy to Nathan, the man, because she can't control him and she thinks Nathan can help him.

This one gave me such good feelings the whole time I was reading it, really more than her big hit book. The story is called confess because everyone in the book has a confession to make. The two young people who fall in love both have confessions and then others in their life do too, such as father of the young man. A young woman meets an artist whose studio is down the street from where she lives and they have immediate attraction. This artist has seen this young woman in the past and does not want to tell her their connection and feels he never can. The connection has to do with her young boyfriend and also father of her son, who died and this young man, Owen, had crossed paths with him while he was in the hospital dying and they had a pact which he never wanted Auburn to know. This is a feeling good love story but there are lots of twists and turns in the story as some of the confessions are revealed.

Second book in a row with no chapters. It's so hard to be able to stop reading! This young woman got a job in an antique store after she had been involved in a scandal and a stay in a mental hospital. She had to move back to Boston from NYC to live with her mother again. But the antique store was a very enlightening experience for her. This is not one of those books where she meets someone wonderful and lives happily ever after but is a story about her learning to figure out her life and the finale was that she found out one of her friends was safe and sound away from Boston.

This whole series is about Atlee Pine, female FBI agent, trying to find out what happened to her twin sister who was kidnapped when they were 6 years old. This is book where she finds out a lot of information that can lead to her sister, so book 4 should be about her finding the sister.

So many books about missing sisters and so many books with back and forth time periods. By the end of the book I ended up really liking it. The sister was not actually missing. She was diagnosed as a psychopath and her younger sister had seen her kill many people who resulted in the younger sister being commited to a mental hospital. When she decides to get out and go home, that's when things really start happening between her and her crazy sister. She does get redemption. The back and forth time line was between the young sister in the mental hospital telling about what's going on with her in the present and ther other time period is the mother telling what happened in the past to lead to her older daughter being diagnosed as a psychopath. There is a crazy aunt in her also.

This one was a little different to me, it has a lot of emotion, especially at the surprise ending. It's the story of a woman whose husband is killed in an accident and she is trying to figure out why her husband and her sister were both killed in accidents.

Even though I was not happy that things were not explained by the end I still gave it 4 stars because it was very well written and I know the author was telling a story about the relationship between the people who were sort of trapped in this house and not why everything happened. So, it's a story about a family that goes on vacation to a remote home kind of like Air BnB and right after they get there the owners of the home show up and tell them that NYC is in a black out so they had to come here to get away. So they all stay in the house and talk about leaving but nothing is ever resolved. It's a story about how their relationships evolved and you never know what happened to cause the blackout in NYC.

All the stories are about Joe as the game warden and everything he gets into, not just with animals but with people also. I have a great love for all animals and so I love reading about this. This story is about Joe being asked by the governor of his state to take some tech genuises from CA on a elk shoot and many things happen on this outing and Joe and one of the men barely come out alive, the rest of them don't make it.

It kept changing and you never knew ""who did it"". She also uses short chapters which I love because to me, it's easier to keep reading and reading. It's a story about a wealthy family and the parents are murdered leaving three adult children to fight over their estate and the police to investigate what happened. There are other family members involved and it seemed to me as I finished the book (and if someone else who read this, has another idea let me know). It seemed that no one was every punished for the crime becaue police had no positive evidence.

This is a book that has an Apple TV+ series based on it and it looks really good so I wanted to read the book before I started the series. LIke I said, the first half of the book was very hard for me. The book is not long, but the chapters are, and in the beginning it's hard to get into the main story because the author is telling us everything going on with all the characters. The ""slow horses"" work at Slough House which is where spys who have gotten in trouble are sent to work. They are easily bored because they don't do much but look at paper and computer. Someone in the group plans a crime and it's a hoax but it takes everyone a while to figure this out. The story got pretty good in the second half, I guess because we were already introduced to all the characters involved.

It's not something I would usually read but was chosen by my ladies book club. I'm just not a rom/com Hallmark movie type person but the two main characters in this book were so good and believable and everything they went through was so real. It's a story about two sisters who are both trying to help the other make their life better and they do it! I also figured out before the story that the younger sister would ""save the day"" with the family book store! But it was really good.

To me, it started off very slow but then I found I could not quit reading it and read in only a few days which means to me, that is a really good book (when you don't want to put it down). This was first book by this author and another reason it surprised me that it was so good. It's a mystery, of course, my favorite genre. A young woman is found dead in the home of a man she was having an affai with, both of them are married to other people. The police arrest the man who owns the house for muder and his wife is a winning attorney who represents him. There is more going on here than you ever can figure out.

It is dystopian, but never could figure out whether things were happening in the past or the future. I am watching the Amazon series hoping it will explain things better but so far not sure. It is a story about women & girls who are given all the power in the world because they develop this special ability to give an electric shock to people whenever they want. There's lots of references to the Bible and i did not understand that completely ever. So, it's a good story, well written with very good characters but confusing.

I've read almost everything she's written and they're always good but this was a strange story in the way it was told. I read s on here of the book before I read it and I agree with most of the ones I read. This is a story of 6 adults and 3 children being at a barbeque in one of the couple's backyards and something happens that changes all of them forever. You don't find out what it is until you are over half way finished with the book. In the beginning, there was a chapter about the present, then it went to one about the day of the barbeque and it kept going like this all the way through. You found out a little bit more about the day in every other chapter. Then when you find out what happened, you find out about something else that happened on the same day and no one knew it was related. Very interesting story but it took a while to read. I liked the characters but it was trying just figuring out what was going on....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Mar 20, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27831371-truly-madly-guilty

It was slow moving and mostly consisted of correspondence between two of the main characters but then it picked up and ended up really like the story. The author's writing is excellent and she makes you care about of the characters, there are 3 main characters and quite a few secondary. This is the story about a black man falsely imprisoned for a crime he did not commit and what happens to his life while he's in prison and after he gets how and sometimes goes back to his life before prison when he was doing really good. It is also a love story between the three main characters, two men who are friends and the woman they were both in a relationship, and how sometimes love can turn into friendship. I really liked how the story ended and will definitely read more from this author. This story takes place in Atlanta which is where I live and love so that definitely made it better....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Feb 17, 2023","Feb 23, 2023","Feb 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38136827-an-american-marriage

This was supposed to be a play on ""The Scarlett Letter"" but to me also it was similar to ""The Handmaid's Tale"". A future in America where the system of punishment for crimes has changed and people are injected with a colored dye depending on the crime committed and of course Red is for the worst crimes. The main character who tells the story is really wonderful and it is interesting to hear her tell her struggle. The main thing that made me give the book 3 stars instead of 4 was the last page. I just thought the end of the story was too weird. She was dreaming of her life and then it was real. Crazy IMO.

I have read a few more books by this author but after this one I will read more. The story starts out slow and Sugar and Salt are the names of a adjoining restaurant and bakery in San Francisco. The owner of the restaurant has moved there and started the business to make a big change in her life. We don't learn what happened to her until she falls for the owner of the bakery and she tells him her story and it is sad. She was in jail for shooting the man who raped and attacked her. She fought him and eventually he as shot and killed. He was the son of a very prominent family in the county and they were determined to destroy her. While in jail she found out she was pregnant by the rapist and she tried to get an abortion and the courts, because of the family, drug things out until it was too late for this. She knew she could not have the child of the man who attacked so she gave the baby up for adoption to a wonderful family. While going through all this she became involved with several advocacy groups that really helped her.

This is another of those stories that goes back and foth in time. The present is a young girl who was sent by her father to live with friends from his past. The future is told by a gypsy lady who told everything through stories to this young girl. It was a little confusing to me because one of the main characters had a different name in the past but i knew there was a reason for it. Also, the stories from the past seemed to go on and on and liked the present stories better.

It was a good story and a little different the main characters were very likeable, after a while. It took me a while to understand them. Mostly to me, the book did not flow that well. It was a little confusing to me how each chapter had a time at the beginning and I did not always understand those times because they went back and forth over each other. Also, I thought there was too much information about the forensic side of the story, Too much information, took up too much time. I do realize that this is the author's speciality, but the tape deal drove me crazy. Most everyone in the book club said they would read another book in this series just to see what happened to the two main characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Aug 07, 2022","Aug 11, 2022","Aug 07, 2022",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29895192-that-darkness

AS most people know about this book by now, this is a story of a woman and her child trying to get across the border from Mexico to America and what they went through. Very hard to read. As someone who was in Mexico a lot when I was younger, this was very interesting to me. It was in the 1980's that I was there a lot and it was nothing then like it is now. I loved the Mexican people and their culture and was so happy to make friends with so many of them. But this woman had to get away because her whole family was killed and she knew she would be next.

I won this book but would have picked it out anyway because anytime there is the word ""book"" in a title, I will read the book! LOL. This is a story about a woman who was a prisoner in a camp during WWII. She was Jewish. Her husband and her son died but she survived and moved to Australia to open a bookshop.

He was devastated and so she was she but they came together and started a wonderful life of ups and downs.

Compare to stories by Isabel Allende, magical realism at it's best. Lots of it. This was a question on Jeopardy two nights ago. What type of writing is Isabel Allende know for - magical realism. This is a story about Orquidea who was a grandmother who had made a deal with a type of man who was a ""shining star"" and with this deal for his freedom she could have anything she wanted. She called all her relatives to her home when she knew she was dying but instead of just dying she turned into a huge tree. At the same time some of her grandchildren developed roses and vines growing out of part of their body. One of the granddaughters wanted to try to find out how all this happened to her grandmother and they went on a journey back to Ecuador where it all started. This is not really my favorite kind of book but it was a good read and very well written and loved some of the main characters.

So it kind of focuses on different characters but still brings back others you are familiar with.

I love Myron and Win as fictional characters, they are among my very favorites. There's always a lot of humor in these stories and that makes it more enjoyable. It is great to have characters like this who you can enjoy learning more about. I also enjoy reading them because I live in NJ for a while and I can identify with lots of the locations mentioned in the book in NY and NJ. This story tookd place a lot in France but then the French came to the US to help Myron solve the crime. They had a growing friendship and that was fun.

The main part of the story takes place over two nights in Lisbon, of course, and goes into great detail about everything that happens when this woman's husband is supposedly kidnapped. As you keep reading, you find out there's much more going on than that and all types of law enforcement are involved and they can't figure out what's really going on either. the Epilogue at the end finally tells you everything and I ended up pretty satisfied with the story.

This series' main character is a female FBI agent and she's very likeable. There are two plots going on in this story and of course they end up being connected. Atless, the FBI female, is looking for her missing sister who was kidnapped years ago by a supposed gangster or his brother. So years later she is looking for the brother who is also missing. There is another crime connected with the gangster people that she becomes involved in because of this search. The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did not feel that she ever resolved what happened to her sister. She found some pictures and a VCR tape and also found a lot more information about her parents and the missing gangster but was disappointed because I did not feel the missing sister part of the story was completely resolved.

The subject matter is hard but the way the story is told is what makes it so good. To tell it very quickly, a transgender girl is found dead, her boyfriend is arrester for murdering her, there is a trial, the boyfriend's uncle represents him and his lawyer and he brings in enough medical experts to create doubt in the jurys mind where they find the young man ""not guilty"". There is a lot of background about the transgender girl and also the family members of both her and the boyfriend.

I have read other books by this author and liked them. This book was hard to read, IMO, too many words on a page and did not really see the point of the story even at the end. This story is similar to The Dutch House but sorry to say not as good. It's a familyll story: mother, father and 5 children. The mother is very unhappy and the father tries all the time to overcompensate for this. His children all know this and the ""crusade"" is an idea to find something to make their mother happy. She's an artist and eventually moves away to have her own studio and live her own life. This story was not so bad that I gave up on it. I really wanted to like it a lot but I couldn't, sorry. The youngest son was a problem child and he never outgrew this and I never figure out if he got to realize his life dreams as the others did.

This is an unusual story **spoiler alert** Chris Bohjalian is one of my favorite authors. try to read everything he writes and am never disappointed. This is an unusual story that takes place decades ago when people were just changing from going on Afridan safaris to African photo shoots and they did not want to shoot the animals although there were of course some who always tried. Part of this story is based on Hemingway's life and all the pictures we saw when younger about him on safari with other Hollywood celebrities. So this is a story about a hollywood star who decided to take all her best friends on an African Safari after her wedding as a celebration. But there is always discord in Africa and a group of Russian terrorists invaded their camp and took them hostage, killing many along the way. By the end of the story when everyone was back home you see that not many in the group survived but it was their story of trying to survive that made the story so good. Definitely recommend if you enjoy drama but not so much if it bothers you to read about people being killed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 26, 2023","Sep 03, 2023","Feb 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58537058-the-lioness

I had just read another book very similar to this where a young girl's body was found murdered and thought to be raped. This one goes back and forth in time, telling you what led up to what happened and also about the investigation after it happened and the two finally meet at the end. Lots of bad things happen to more than one person in the book but it is a very good mystery. I did not figure out everything until the end of the book. The Sheriff was the good guy who got everything straightened out. Definitely recommend.

It was not the best book I've ever read but I am giving it four stars because I read it very quickly and it did hold my interest. The whole story is about CIA and FBI people trying to find this ""spy"" called The Neighbor. By the end of the book, several people confessed to be The Neighbor and I'm not really sure even after finishing it who I believed. The main character was IMO not very likeable because she seemed to think she knew everything about the case and of course, she did not. But her family and all her friends were also involved and she made most of them mad at her before it was over with.

I know it has been made into a series on Peacock and I am starting to watch that too. Of course, I saw episode 1 last night and it has already been changed from the book. Don't know why. IMO the book is perfect. It's a story of a woman who disappears from her family and due to a series of unfortunate events, such as leaving a note for husband that the dog ate and none of her children answering the phone when she called them, no one knows where she is and she is reported missing to the police. On the day the police decide to arrest her husband for murdering her because of circumtantial evidence, the police go to the house and she is there. Then we find out what happened.

Very interesting and to me, written in a different style. The title comes from a poem by Rumi read by the main character during her adventures. This story is told in the first person and you never know her real name and the name of most of the characters. But the main character is on the run from her life. She had a baby for her twin sister who could not conceive. Then found out her twin sister was having an affair with her husband. She left her home and went to stay with a friend who was Casablanca and she tells this woman about it and the woman decides she loves the stories on want to go there. So she does, then her backpack is stolen with her passport in it and she travels over the North Africa with no ID using different names and she goes from one adventure to another, even involving a job as a stand in on a movie set. Like I said this was a strange story in the way it was written but I could not stop reading it. Very quick read too.

I read another book by this author and really liked it so when I saw she was coming to a local book store to promote her new book I went hoping I would like this book as much as the other. It is better. This is a story based on Jewish people who were hiding from the Nazis in the great forests in that area and a young woman who helped them. This young woman had been kidnapped as a child and raised in the forest by an odd woman and taught everything she knew. In the beginning I wasn't sure I would enjoy the story because the young woman and the young girl had special abilities which were kind of like being a ""witch"" but everything they did was based on their faith in God and the story ended up being wonderful.

I love Karin Slaughter and have read almost all her books. She is one of my favorites. This book was very hard for me to read because the two main characters, sisters, were so dysfunctional and had had so many bad things happen to them. Their mother was psycho crazy and the neighbor who they babysat for was a pedophile. They did some really bad things when they were young and years late it caught up with them and they have to find their way out. This was a sad situation and things did turn out okay but it was not happy. As is typical with this author there was a big twist at the end that I don't think anyone would see coming. But it was kind of like redemption for the main character so it was good. I will give it 4 stars but not 5 because it was a really hard story to read.

I got an ARC from the publisher and I really appreciated it and sorry I cannot give but 3 stars. It was a good story and very well written but just not for me. The story was more of a fantasy and I expected reality to step in. I read s on Goodreads before I read the book and it seemed that most people liked it. This is a story about a town that has a spring that people believe have healing waters. I grew up close to Warm Springs, GA where there were warm springs that people believed were healing, even the president of the US and then in a town nearby there was a cold springs, Pine Mountain, and they had a swimming pool fed by this spring and it was wonderful. So I grew up with the healing waters around me and part of my life. But in the book the water were not only healing but they were evil in a way. I had hoped that with the ending it would have a basis for this based on reality but it was fantasy all the way. I wanted the story to make sense in a realistic way but it never did.

Were strange to me and I'm sure it was meant to be this way, could never tell for sure whether it was a male or a female writing it. That could be just me or the author could have planned that. So I definitely recommend. Not a big fan of Greek tragedies but there wasn't too much in this book to understand. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 13, 2024","Mar 18, 2024","Mar 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45300567-the-maidens

There is a warning on the book that the subject matter of the story is very harsh and it is but the way the story is written is lovely. The main character, a teenage girl named Roan is wonderful and so brave. The story is about a horse farm and a young girl who wants to ride on the Olympics team, first because she loves horses and second because her father was an Olympic winner. The father is a very controlling man who controls all her life, including having had sex with her since she was a small child. The mother is absent all the time giving the father total custody of her when they divorced. The story is about this young girl being strong enough to stand up to this man who had always abused her and the courage she had. She is a teenager so she meets a boy in school and develops a relationship with him which makes her realize how wrong the relationship with her father is and all she wants to do is put him in his place and she does. LIke I said, a really good story and beautifully written. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 09, 2021","Mar 15, 2021","Mar 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57234161-dark-horses
