For it I'm rereading all the books that meant something to me when I was that age. I discovered Anita Brookner through Hotel du Lac and went on to read everything she had written. The Debut opened my eyes to how literature shapes our world view. It begins with the line: ""Dr. Weiss, at forty, knew that her life had been ruined by literature."" She then recounts how different her life might have been if she'd taken lessons from Balzac rather than Flaubert and Cinderella fairy tales. (This, of course, led me along a path to Balzac.) As always, Brookner writes seemingly quiet stories. And with her earliest books, there are shades of autobiography. Ruth Weiss is the daughter of two self-absorbed people, and as she navigates her first years as an adult, her attempts to shape a life for herself are affected by their dramas. Reading this book now, I can appreciate its nuance; reading it when I was young, I was starstruck by the literary references and the London and Paris settings - tres exotic to a kid from small-town Washington. I've read this book perhaps half a dozen times over the years, and it has never disappointed....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Nov 2023,"Nov 27, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/84518.The_Debut

Not the risque ones from the 70s, but the more demure ones from the 1950s that I bought five for a dollar at strip mall, paperback bookshops. I grew out of my romance-reading phase, but for some reason I kept one of those books from my teen years: Under the Stars of Paris. Decades later, who knows why, I looked up the book and discovered that the author, Mary Burchell, was the pen name for Ida Cook, an opera enthusiast who used that passion, along with money from writing romances, to help Jewish people escape from Europe at the start of WWII. This memoir is heavy on the opera story - Ida and her sister Louise lived and breathed opera - and very modest when it comes to their efforts. But they risked their lives, and sacrificed even their own apartment in London (they lived with their parents so refugees could use their apartment when they arrived), to bring people safely to England. Is this the best-written book I've read? No. So why a 5 rating? Because it's genuine. It's sweet and inspiring.

Her best friend, Edi, who is dying of cancer in hospice. Ash's very modern daughters. Her lovely estranged husband Honey. I could go on and on. I connected with this book so deeply that as soon as I finished reading the e-version, I ran out to Vroman's and bought a physical copy because it's a book I want to hold in my hands - paper touching skin - as I read it again, which I am going to do ASAP. It probably helps that Catherine Newman and I are the same age, so have generational references in common - this novel is awash in them.

I fell in love with MI've read this book half a dozen times, at least, but it has been years (decades?) between the last time I read it and this one. I fell in love with Moon Tiger when I worked at the Elliott Bay Book Company in the early 1990s. I'd never read a novel like it before. The shifting points of view. Not just between characters, but between first and third person for the same character. Claudia, the main character, is tough and somewhat unkind, judgemental, tender at her very center, and determined in a way I'd never encountered before. It's interesting to think of who I was when I first read this book and who am I now, rereading it. Now I've known women like Claudia. I've read stories far trickier with their handling of POV. What I realize is that this book most likely stayed with me all this time because Penelope Lively is simply an excellent writer. I've read almost all of her novels, and her characters always ring true. In this case, Claudia is never not Claudia. Even when her heart breaks, it breaks in only the way it could break for this specific character. When she is selfish, the selfishness is hers and no one else's. I admire that ability to let a character be who she is, since I'm the kind of person who always wants everyone to be happy - even in books! Moon Tiger has so much to offer, about the way we look at world history and the way we look at our own personal history. About how we see our lives and how others see our lives.

I had an old hardcover copy with gilt letters on the spine that belonged to my Great-Aunt Emma. As an aspiring writer, of course I related to Jo. But I remember all of the sisters' stories. What I didn't remember was how progressive LITTLE WOMEN is for its time. Yes, it's mired in traditional female roles (it is of it's time, after all), and yes I realize I'm about to quote a section that uses the term ""old maid,"" but there were parts that made me pause. That I don't recall, perhaps because as a kid I didn't understand how unusual they were. For example, in talking about marriage, Mrs. March declares it's better to be ""happy old maids than unhappy wives"" and advises, ""Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are not."" Basically, she's saying it's okay to be single, she just wants her girls to be happy. In 1868! I also admired the tongue-in-cheek humor that also went over my head when I was young. The sisters are funny, loving, loyal, and oh so complex. What a pleasure it was to read this again in mid-life. I can't wait to read it in another 10 years and see what stands out for me then....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Sep 2023,"Oct 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1934.Little_Women

I'd been an avid reader all my life, but the usual wonderful kid stuff and otherwise romances (teen and then Harlequin) - the books I'd been exposed to growing up in small towns. I picked up a Jackie Collins novel in Greece, and after reading it decided I would never mindlessly grab another book off a hostel bookcase again! On a train, I told my woes to the guy from New Zealand sitting next to me. He reached into his backpack and pulled out 3 books. One was HOTEL DU LAC. So this was what a novel could accomplish! I was mesmerized by this quiet, painful, elegant story of disappointment, exile, human nature, and love. Jump ahead 35 years. I'm in Copenhagen with my husband, and we turn down a narrow street and see a row of green metal carts containing used books. We have stumbled upon Vangsgaards Rare Books. What a treasure! I perused each bin of fifty cent and dollar books, English mingling with Danish, and to my delight I came upon a pretty pocket edition of my beloved HOTEL DU LAC. Rereading it all these years later only cements Anita Brookner in my mind as a superb literary portrait artist. There is nothing quite like the first time you read a book that moves you, for whatever reason. It can be just as special to reread that book and remember a time in your life when the world was first opening up to you....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Sep 2023,"Oct 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/251665.Hotel_du_Lac

It’s easy to sympaI keep thinking about how unlikable the main character, Bigger Thomas, is, and how his being unlikable is the genius of this novel. It’s easy to sympathize with a likable character. With an unlikable character we have to go beyond personal feelings to the difficult place where we acknowledge the belief that every single human being is deserving of dignity and equality—no matter how unappealing we find that human being. There are so many layers to this novel, and it will break your heart over and over as you read Wright’s stinging prose: “They don’t even let you feel what you want to feel. They after you so hot and hard you can only feel what they doing to you. They kill you before you die.”“He stood up in the middle of the cell floor and tried to see himself in relation to other men, a thing he had always refused to try to do, so deeply stained was his own mind with the hate of others for him.”“But once you see them as a whole, once your eyes leave the individual and encompass the mass, a new quality comes into the picture. Taken collectively, they are not simply twelve million people; in reality they constitute a separate nation, stunted, stripped, and held captive within this nation, devoid of any political, social, economic, and property rights.”“… his hate toward the whites; for he felt that they ruled him, even when they were far away and not thinking of him, ruled him by conditioning him in his relations to his own people.”There are so many exceptional novels and nonfiction books written now that demand we look without excuses at what a comprehensive system of racism has done to individuals and to our country—making it easy to forget how bold Wright was to publish such an unapologetic, damning book in 1940. This should be in every high school’s curriculum, and if you’re like me—I read it in middle age and felt ashamed by how many of its ideas were new to me—I think about something a woman I admire said to me. We were on the board together at a woman’s transitional residence, and the conversation was about some of the stupid things people say about race and homelessness. In her gentle voice, this woman said, “Don’t blame them.

Reading it, I knew this would be an author I would follow with every book she wrote. Sea of Tranquility did not disappoint. Mandel's language is not necessarily poetic, but it conveys the precision and delightful surprises of good poetry. There is complexity to this story, the suspension of disbelief required by time travel tales, that finds a firm foundation in each of the personal stories being told over different points in time. Mandel's handling of a pandemic is straightforward and visceral, and I love how she doesn't shy away from her talents as a crime writer. Because a novel like this requires you to pay close attention to each thread so you can tie them all together in the end, I'm looking forward to reading it again, knowing what will happen - so my mind, freed from hanging on tight to the plot, can savor descriptive passages and Mandel's thoughtful technique. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Oct 2023,"Oct 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility

I admire West for how she can tell the surface story of a wedding, and also weave in lines like these without making them jump out from the story to deliver a message: “Show me one white man who can look at a colored man without saying to himself, I see a colored man.”“That strange habit of whites of prefacing any and all mention of colored people with the identifying label or race.” “A generation half afraid that all the insidious white stereotypes contained a germ of truth.”West is a craftswoman with language, turning it gently to guide the book to a shocking ending that doesn’t embrace shock value, but instead leaves you reflective and grateful to have been trusted with this intimate story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2022,Jan 2022,"May 22, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/915481.The_Wedding

As a lifelong reader, and as a former indie bookseller, it always excites me when I get to be an ""insider."" Better yet - when the book is terrific. I've long been a fan of Naomi Hirahara. It think her Mas Arai series is exquisite with insight and subtlety. Clark and Division has the insights, but the story isn't subtle - nor should it be. Too little has been written for mainstream audiences about the imprisonment of Japanese and Japanese Americans during WWII. Most of us read Farewell to Manzanar in school at some point; and that was enough, as far as our educators were concerned. It wasn't. Because this story is so complex. I'm not talking about what the government did. That was woefully straightforward. But the way the Japanese community lived, existed, and rebuilt itself both in and out of the prison camps is multi-layered. In this case, the story focuses on those people who were allowed to leave the camps during the war so long as they relocated to the Midwest, where they couldn't easily serve as spies for Japan. Yes, this is a crime novel, but the crime is a tool Hirahara uses to explore family, displacement, race, love, identity, and so much more. As always with her novels, she doesn't go for mega-drama. But that gives the story a kind of weight that propels it from entertainment (it is a page-turner) to essential reading....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Apr 24, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56661003-clark-and-division

Seven months ago, but it feels like another lifetime. It was a surI read this novella at the start of the shelter in place orders here in California. Seven months ago, but it feels like another lifetime. It was a surreal feeling to read about the flu pandemic of 1918 while living with the complete uncertainty of what the Covid pandemic would bring. It's a subtle story, gentle almost, following a young woman as she comes down with the flu. Wondering, as a reader, if what is happening to her is in fact happening, or is it a fever dream? The story is simple: two people attracted to one another. The context is complex: a backdrop of deadly illness and WWI. The power is in the way Porter uses nuance to give the simplest scene--young would-be lovers passing yet another funeral--a multitude of layers.

Story and character—this book is a master class in both. During the first year of the pandemic, those late autumn days still rolling one into the other with little to differentiate them (at least, inside our house; outside in the world was another story), I followed Hortense from Jamaica to London right after WWII. I love being introduced to a world I’m not familiar with. While this novel addresses heavy issues such as immigration, racism, and PTSD, it’s funny and has many moments of great tenderness toward humanity.

There weren't many, but I came across this one, and it seemed like a good bet: interesting story description, not to mention nearly 500 pages (perfect for two transatlantic flights and three weeks away). This book about twins conjoined at their heads turned out to be so much more than a story about biological outliers. Their physical situation is a tool for exploring larger themes of identity and individuality, as well as academia and nationalism, as the sisters pass through adolescence and their early adult years on the inner rim of the wars that broke up Yugoslavia in the 1990s. I was fascinated by the details of daily life in a former Eastern Bloc country on the verge of independence, and I found the sisters' story engaging, from the intimacies they had no choice but to share, to their jagged relationships with their family and friends. Specks of happiness are scattered throughout the book - they are necessary to keep both the reader and the girls from falling into despair. Each can feel the other's heart beating in her temple; each can feel the other swallow a lump in her throat. When it comes to being unique in any way, the girls have only their dreams--as opposite as can be, and impossible to achieve because of their bodies' unforgiving restriction....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 02, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28593020-a-spare-life

It's so hard to explain what I loved most about Coming Through Slaughter because it's all about the way Ondaatje uses language. He's an incredible poet whose prose is ethereal and earthy at the same time. I could read this story of Buddy Bolden, a jazz musician who went mad in New Orleans at the turn of the 19th century, a hundred times and find it fresh every time. Ondaatje clearly loves jazz, and passages often feel like lyrics: ""Her loon laugh. The dull star of white water under each of us. Swimming towards the sound of madness.""

I loved how this book took a major leap from the ""smaller"" stories told in The Bluest Eye and Sula. All of Morrison's books are important (essential); I'm using the word smaller in the sense of the plot, which is intricate, tricky and demanding in Song of Solomon. I admire how Morrison puts her characters in a context, often of their own making. Here, Macon Dead Jr. is at the center of a world that expands far beyond the boundaries of his family (who are the cause, or so he thinks, of all his troubles). ""He just wanted to beat a path away from his parents' past, which was also their present and which was threatening to become his present as well."" The book immerses itself in justice, revenge, romantic love, parents, children, betrayal, needs, wants, lies told as lies, lies told as truths, friendship, community, society - and in all instances the strands connect to Macon, although sometimes finding the path takes serious work on the part of the reader. It's been a while since I've read a writer who trusts her readers as much as Morrison does. As soon as I finished this book, I felt the need to read the first 50 pages again - there is something circular in the telling of this story that makes the ending want to chase the beginning until it catches up with itself....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 02, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11334.Song_of_Solomon

She arranged glass, bowl and book on the window sill and climbed out on the fire escape. Once out there, she was living in a tree. No one downstairs, or across the way could see her. But she could look out through the leaves and see everything."" One word in there, that's all it took, added to the rest: book.

One of my main goals in reading this was to get back my attention span. The trilogy is 900+ pages, and I knew it would require my brain to focus and recall, which I find harder to do these days. What a pleasure it was to luxuriate in this story for nearly 3 months (yes, that's how long it took me!). I followed Guy and Harriet Pringle to Rumania at the start of WWII. And from there to Greece with various characters meandering in and out of the plot, showing up after a long absence and pleasantly surprising me as if I was running into an old friend. I also got a new education when it comes to WWII history. Manning is a writer who should not be forgotten. Her observations are concise and authentic, and her ability to capture the day-to-day living of expatriates in a country on the verge of war made me marvel at the significance of the mundane. On top of that, her descriptions are exquisite. I lost count of how many gorgeous descriptions of weather alone that I highlighted. Her ability to capture sense of place made me pause often to reread and admire. Was this book worth the half dozen shorter books I could have read instead in the same amount of time?

As someone who has always used books for comfort, this was devastating. As the election neared, I couldn't imagine any book that would draw me in, and certainly not one that would engage me fully and make the world feel okay. Girl, Woman, Other did just that. I couldn't put it down. Twelve ""short stories"" tell of twelve different women (and the women in their lives); some overlap obviously (mothers & daughters) while others overlap in ways that feel almost tangential but turn out to be significant in the story’s big picture. The layers are rich and fulfilling. I felt as if I’d been given back my love of reading.
