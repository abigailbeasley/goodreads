It's beautiful and profound, and at times so brutal I could barely keep reading. I sobbed and sobbed while reading the last 150 pages or so. It's been a long time since I felt so close to fictional characters. At first, I felt the novel's withholding of information was too designed by the author, but eventually it began to feel more natural and right, and I loved how the book I thought I was reading--about 4 college friends--became something far different, far scarier, far deeper, and far more meaningful. This is petty, but I had a hard time with some of the names. I mean, a first name like Citizen--and no one mentions its oddness? What's also odd is the lack of historical/social/technological/political context for these lives--for covering so much time, we get very little texture outside of their private worlds.

I just finished writing a piece on The Millions about the third person, and had I read this before that, I would have suggested Packer's book as his voice and writing style alters with each new person he's writing about and following--it's lovely.I thought a couple of the passages about famous people were dripping with a bit too much cynicism for my taste; the one on Oprah was just plain mean (even if I agree with a lot of what he says, he seemed to always attribute self-serving motives to her actions, which felt too easy.)

This novel really gets at how challenging distance can be between a couple and I felt Peter's frustration and disconnection, as well as Bea's longing and deep resentment.

The novel felt about 100 pages too long overall, like it could have been swifter in various places.

My only small complaint was that the book seemed a little too enamored with social media. For instance, in the stunning, oft-quoted passage about what the flu has taken away (""No more blank, no more blank...""), it felt a little too heavily-weighted to the loss of the internet.

This was the perfect setting to read this novel beI read this book in two days while at Ucross, an artists' residency in beautiful northeast Wyoming. This was the perfect setting to read this novel because, 1. The author may have written parts of it in the very same studio I was reading/writing in, which felt magical and impossible-possible in a way that echoed the book's magical yet realistic tone and premise. And, 2. Because I had hours to do with what I wanted, and what I wanted was to write for a couple of hours, and then read for a couple of hours, write and then read, until bedtime. Ah, bliss!I fell into this book immediately and I loved Zal, the man who was raised as a bird by his uncaring mother. Khakpour's prose is exuberant and free-wheeling and so fuck-you-I-am-writing-this-nutty-paragraph-and-you-will-giggle-with-delight. It's fearless in this way that I admire greatly. It's also an engaging read--the first day I read 150 pages in a sitting and loved being absorbed in this imaginative world.I was less enamored with the magician, Silber, and that subplot--it felt less immediate and more...designed?...compared to the other parts of the novel; that might be hard to avoid, since Silber himself is a pretty contrived human, speaking in silly magician jargon and whatnot. It's all very fun to read, but it didn't move me in the way that the book's other parts did. The ending didn't quite land for me either, though it never stopped being compelling.

After feeling so disconnected from reading I was able to fall into three absorbing novels while on this trip--hallelujah! Emily Gould's Friendship was one of these novels.Gould's novel is a fun, funny, engaging and surprising read. I felt invested in the lives of Bev and Amy, even when I didn't like them. I really liked the novel's attention to money, or the lack of money, in the lives of these middle class (or affluent) white women. I came into this book knowing nothing, and I found the detours in the plot wonderfully unexpected. It was interesting to me how this book adhered to a normative plot about young women, and how it didn't. There was some darkness here, a little weirdness, just at the edge, that I liked a lot. Occasionally the prose felt a touch generic, and I wished the writing and the scenes felt more particular and specific. But, again, it was the perfect holiday read.

I love Emma's prose--it's buttery and smooth and precise and funny and fluid and fun to read. I loved being in Mallorca, in this magical house with its magical swimming pool, eating such magical food and watching the Post family in all their functional dysfunction. (Ha, I was in California eating leftover Chinese food but I was somewhere else entirely!) I really liked Bobby Post's girlfriend, Carmen; she is so different from the other bookish folks, so misunderstood and isolated, and Franny's distaste of her and her gym-life was funny and sad, and also believable. I liked the tensions of the the book overall; there is an inevitable pressure exerted on a narrative when people with issues are packed into a space together. Also: I was very proud that this book had some sexy bits--a nice development in the ouevre of Ms. Straub!Sometimes I wanted the narrative drive of the novel to be stronger--the premise is rich but occasionally the book captured the wandering timeless quality of vacationing a bit too well. Don't misunderstand: the novel was never ever boring, but sometimes I felt a lack of tautness, a diffusion of energy. I also wanted a bit more about how and why a particular character came to an important decision (I am being vague so as not to give any of the plot away!)The final scene took my breath away and made me love this book....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 16, 2014",not set,"Oct 26, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18641982-the-vacationers

I was in love with Nao's great grandmother and moved by the letters written by her great uncle. I found myself emotionally engaged throughout, which seems a wonderful feat considering the heady structure of the narrative. I was less interested in the sections with Ruth; those felt very wooden to me, and I was continually surprised by the use of the third person--it just kept feeling contrived and somehow wrong: they made me conscious of the writing in a mechanical way, almost as if I was teaching/reading an early draft. These sections felt like life, but their verisimilitude also leached the drama from the narrative, particularly in comparison to Nao's section. Ozeki is a masterful writer, and I sense a desire on her part to have Ruth's chapters feel workaday, to bring into question our notions of time/drama in fiction. Still, I was less engaged, less amazed in these chapters. I love the unresolved quality of the story, and how much it made me think about time, consciousness, writing, the internet.(A silly aside: though I wasn't rooting for cat Pesto's demise, I did feel annoyed early on by all the cats in the book. I get enough cat shit on the internet! I wish they wouldn't lulz in my literature too!)Overall, I loved this book and I can't wait to discuss it with friends.

The structure of each section was fun to read but also almost always the same, which made for a less surprising book than it otherwise could have been.) I really loved Mitchell, I found Leonard intriguing but perhaps a touch one-note, and our heroine Madeleine was a dolt with nice legs. She was a fan of Jane Austen, et al, but she didn't seem particularly bright--not nearly as bright as an Austen heroine. And not emotionally astute either! But she also was a believable human being to me, and I cared about her. I love reading about college life and love, and though there were times when I wished the author's treatment of both had been less surfacey, I still delighted in the novel, with its graceful turns of phrase and zippiness of paragraphs.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 22, 2012",not set,"Oct 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10964693-the-marriage-plot

I really disliked Bernadette in the first 20 pages, in particular for how she addressed her ""virtual assistant"" in India, and at first I thought, ""Oh God. Private school white people! I hate private school white people!"" (Sorry--must be my LAUSD defensiveness and pride growling to life!) But that antipathy faded as these people's lives came into focus and depth. I loved Bernadette by the end, and I loved her most for her flaws.I adored the epistolary format of the novel, and I was so interested in how we came to understand Bernadette and her family by these various sources--their identities were collaged together in such a readable and fascinating way. I was actually going to give this book 5 stars, but the ending didn't really land. The epistolary structure mostly ended and the straightforward 1st person narrative was less memorable. The twists and turns for the plot were a touch too unbelievable. Still a good read, just not as amazing for me as before.

Sometimes this book did indeed amaze me.I really liked the sad, dark places this book went--not only in the events, but the feelings of its main character, Tess. She has some pretty unsavory thoughts about her sister; they are selfish thoughts: immature and complicated and utterly, utterly true. This made for a complicating reading experience that I think readers--young and fully-grown--can get into. I also liked the fairy tale old-timey quality to it: it's a contemporary world, but there are old-school carnivals and fluttery feelings about boys, and doll houses, and make-out sessions in the woods, and melting ice cream. The tone felt in-tune with the graphic sections, which were beautifully drawn and perfectly mysterious, and sometimes so dark and scary I felt ill (in a good way). There is an other-worldly quality to both sections; they're otherworldly in different ways, but they complemented each other.The loneliness in this book was my favorite part. It's a deeply lonely book--it captures that feeling with a PING! There were a few sentences I desperately wanted to rephrase to be cleaner and more fluid. Overall, I liked the prose (trademark Castellucci!), but sometimes it felt less polished than it could have been. And I wished the graphic sections and the prose sections interacted in a more surprising and clever way at the end. I think my expectations were way, way too high, but whatever, it's worth saying: I thought they were going to seriously collide, and they didn't exactly.This is the strongest Cecil Castellucci book I've read so far: it's lovely, strange, unique, sensitive, sad, insightful, heartfelt.

I loved the humor, the deft compression of time, the sharp observations of contemporary east coast America (most of takes place in the Chicago-area but there was a section about New York that amazed and amazed), and the way we came to know each member of the Middlestein clan. It was also incredibly moving at the end: there were some really beautiful moments that were deeply compassionate. I was also impressed that Attenberg took on food addiction as a topic and as a character trait--it felt fresh, and also believable, and complicated. Food is beautiful, food is love, food is dangerous, food is nothing, food is everything. Occasionally, the omniscience stuck out to me: not that it didn't work, just that I always noticed it, and kind of in a strange, craft-thinking distracting way. Also, I wanted MORE. I wish this novel had been 100 pages longer...I think we could have gone deeper with these characters, and seen more of their present conflicts. More! More! More!

We were in our nonfiction workshop at Oberlin together! I attended her Russian Nightclub house party! We've double-dated! Emma and I got reacquainted a few years ago, after college, and found we had much in common, particularly that were both (still) writers and lovers of books. I have been SO excited to read her debut novel! It didn't disappoint.I love the prose here: it's as milky and winsome as the book's namesake, Laura Lamont. For a week I neglected my child to get back to this story of a woman's life as she goes from Wisconsin playhouse sister to Hollywood movie star. For a novel that's not particularly plot-driven, it's very hard to put down! I really admired the compassion Emma had for her characters, and the ways she made me feel connected to Laura (nee Elsa). I also loved learning about the studio system of Hollywood; despite being an L.A. native, I know nothing about movies and cinema history. I also liked the way this book compressed time. Wooh, I love this kind book: alighting on moments that matter, gliding over years. Again and again this book jumped forward in time, starting a new chapter with this terrific authority that set the scene, the time, the tone, in my mind. I L-O-V-E-D that. I wish I could do that! I was very much interested in how juvenile and naive Laura seemed at times, and how in control her second husband Irving was. I thought that relationship was going to implode at some point, that Laura would crave independence. That it didn't intrigued me, and had me thinking a lot about Laura's conception of self, and my own conception of her and her self. She was certainly a product of her era. Also: the ending was lovely, just lovely.There were a couple of weird geography things (sorry, Emma!!!). For instance, I don't think Los Feliz was considered the eastside in the 1930s, though I might be wrong. Overall, I wish LA had been a larger character, as much as Wisconsin was. I didn't often *feel* place in this book. I also felt like there was too much attention paid to her sisters and her traumatic past. It sometimes felt repetitive to me. I also longed for more social complications in the book, perhaps with her black housekeeper Harriet, or with her kids, when the 1960s and 1970s hit full swing. But I don't think that was Emma's project here--she's after an intimate view, not a Forrest Gumpian one--and I can accept that.A fun and thoughtful book! ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Aug 07, 2012","Aug 17, 2012","Apr 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13588166-laura-lamont-s-life-in-pictures

I enjoyed many of these essays, particularly the one about him as a writer's assistant. Sullivan can surely craft a sentence, and he's no doubt a bright MoFo. The thing is, for me, many of these pieces felt overly mannered, like intellectual experiments in voice. His narrative ""I"" didn't always feel true to me, whatever that means. I was engaged with these pieces on a brainiac level, but I was never inside of them, never truly invested. I don't read many (any) essay collections, so who knows what I expected/wanted. I just know that I'm marking this as ""read"" even though there are a few I haven't read and don't feel like reading. Side note: I believe Sullivan's work is sometimes compared to the nonfiction David Foster Wallace. And the novel Skippy Dies was compared to DFW's fiction. Neither book I loved (I actively disliked Skippy Dies). This makes me think I won't enjoy Infinite Jest, or Consider the Lobster, when I finally get to them...and now I am not rushing to get to them.

Margot Livesey was my writing teacher--and one I am incredibly grateful to have had. She's well read, so compassionate, insightful, and her accent makes even the harshest criticism go down like molasses. I've enjoyed keeping up with her since graduation, and her last book--The House on Fortune Street--was incredible. I highly recommend it to anyone new to the Livesey ouevre. I'd definitely start with that one. Gemma Hardy kept my attention and I loved comparing it to Jane Eyre, which I re-read not too long ago. It was interesting to note how Gemma's story echoes Jane's, and where it diverges. I liked the prose a lot--so easy to fall into, and smooth, the rhythm like a big duvet I wanted to wrap myself up in. Gemma is spirited like Jane, and unloved, like Jane, and I was interested in her plight from unloved orphan to self-possessed young woman. I will read any story about orphans, governesses, and the like. Make it take place in remote Scotland, and I'm yours forever.Something is keeping me from really liking this book, though, and I'm having trouble articulating what that is. The echoes of Jane Eyre kept me reading, but oddly, they also made the story predictable, because I was just waiting for the next similarity to arise. (Mr. Rochester stand-in? Check. Etc etc.). In general, the plot seemed to lack a certain, I don't know, verve or something. What made Jane Eyre seem transgressive and new isn't present in Livesey's version; I don't know what that special something is though.I also would've loved for this to have taken place in the modern era, rather than the 1950s-1960s, which at times felt as antiquated as the 19th century that Bronte wrote about. I wondered what Jane might do in the era of crop tops and internet dating. Just a thought...I enjoyed this book, but I wanted to enjoy it more. In the end, Margot Livesey can write a beautiful paragraph and loveable characters. This one, though, didn't quite hit the spot like some of her other novels...(God this is such a dumb .

The book is actually more nuanced and compassionate than that, and I found his discussion of sleep cycles pretty illuminating and helpful. My baby can fall asleep without nursing, which is great, since it not only means Daddy can be The Bedtime Master, but also that my baby knows how to go to bed on his own, self-soothing and all that--this is a skill he will need for life! (I should say that I figured out he could fall asleep without nursing pretty much by accident; he just fell asleep one day, on his own, and it was clear he didn't need my boob as much as I'd assumed.) Ferber helped us realize that Dixon doesn't need to eat at 10 pm, 3 hours after he's fallen asleep. It's more likely that he's entering a new sleep cycle, and that he can figure out how to get back to bed on his own. On the first night after reading this book, he cried at 10:15, and my husband and I waited, breathless, on the couch, to see what would happen if we didn't run to his rescue. 20 seconds later, he was fast asleep and didn't wake up again until 1:30! He hasn't woken at 10-ish since. Now we're trying to figure out which night-time feeding is truly necessary--for his belly, for his soul--and which one(s) can be eliminated. It's a bit touch and go, but we're learning. I'm trying to balance some of Ferber's ideas with my own instincts. I'm hoping Ferber can next help me get some more naps into my kid! When baby sleeps more during the day, the nights are far more peaceful.This is an informative read for anyone with young children who is struggling to figure out nap schedules, bedtime routines, night feedings, and so on. Don't be afraid to Ferberize! (God, that word--it's scary, right?)And, sometimes it's okay if a baby cries. My mom said I used to cry for 2-3 minutes every night before bed, and then slept 12 hours straight. I needed that little cry, to expend some energy before my nightly coma. Don't knock it! Also, don't let your kid cry for hours while you surf the internet.

So the momentum of the story/mystery was slowed a bit, taking away from the intensity of my reading experience. Still, until I went into labor I could not put this novel down, and the fact that I finished the book during the first days of nursing speaks to its pull. The Likeness is certainly far-fetched, premise-wise, but that was fine with me. I totally dug The Secret History vibe of this close-knit group of graduate students, as well as the Gothic tone of the big ancestral home they live in.

IThis is the first police procedural I've ever read, though I enjoy them on television and the big screen, so it's hard for me to critique this book. I mean, what do I know? I loved French's prose--it's rich and its rhythms and imagery were pleasing--and I loved how readable the book was. I thought Detectives Rob and Cassie's relationship--their friendship and working relationship--was nicely depicted and complex. I liked that Rob, the narrator, was such a dolt, emotionally-speaking. It made him human and real to me. My main beef with the novel is that the ending is a bit of a let-down. I have a hard time when questions get answered via a detective's smooth operations in the interrogation room. Does ANYONE fall for good cop/bad cop anymore? More than that, though, our narrator becomes stupid at the end. He doesn't see what's coming, and I didn't buy his denial. I mean, even I--reader of quiet literary fiction--saw what was coming! His foolishness rendered him a far less interesting character than he had been for previous 385 pages. Things didn't feel quite true.Still, I enjoyed this novel, and I look forward to reading more of French's delicious prose. Check out these lines:""I wish I could tell you how an interrogation can have its own beauty, shining and cruel as that of a bullfight; how in defiance of the crudest topic or the most moronic suspect it keeps inviolate its own taut, honed grace, its own irresistible and blood-stirring rhythms; how the great pairs of detectives know each other's every thought as surely as lifelong ballet partners in a pas de deux...""...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 02, 2011","Jun 10, 2011","Jun 02, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/237209.In_the_Woods

The final chapter is my favorite for the way it just takes charge, and lets time fast forward. This is a great first novel, and so hard to put down. Read it!

I liked Skippy, Howard and Ruprecht a lot, and I respected the formal risks the narrative took. Overall, though, the book moved at such a glacial pace. The events that occurred unfolded so very, very slowly, that it was hard to enjoy even the few surprises in the plot. I quickly fatigued of the jokey sections with the kids--though often funny, they were the same scene, over and over again. Some of the minor characters, in particular the acting principal, were so flat that their scenes also became repetitive, and thus, boring. I either felt like I was a step ahead of the storyline, understanding what the scene wanted to do or establish, and just waiting for that to happen in the scene itself. Or, I was very confused--a lot of the chapters open in a such a close third person perspective that it's unclear what the hell is going on--since each chapter switches to one of the many, many characters. There was one chapter early on with a ton of sound effects and three characters I hadn't met before, and the work it took to figure out what was happening was just too taxing for little old me. Ay!Also, and this isn't bad or good, just an observation: A lot of the interactions between characters felt particularly visual. Like, it would have been dramatic and funny on screen, but that it took too many steps to make it clear on the page. I felt like I was doing a lot of translating, if that makes any sense...As I said, there's some great material here, but I was ultimately disappointed,and I don't quite understand the craze for this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 06, 2011","Apr 24, 2011","Apr 06, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7146335-skippy-dies

In the end, I've decided tAt times I felt this was a solid 3 star book, and other times I felt it was totally 4, with moments of dazzling 5-starness. In the end, I've decided to round up and give it a 4, as I've found myself thinking about its characters and their pain since I finished it yesterday. Firstly, this was an enormously pleasant book to read. The prose and voices of the two first-person narrations are smooth and engaging, and I found myself absorbed by the story without trouble. Often, I'd read 20, 40 pages without even realizing it. As someone who is about to have a baby, and in need of a distraction, this was fabulous!I loved reading about Atlanta in the late-seventies and eighties, and I found Dana and Chaurisse to be compelling characters. What connects them--their father--gives this book power and injects the novel with suspense. But, really, it was the little stuff that I liked best: descriptions of their (very different) mothers, the beauty parlor Chaurisse's mom runs out of her house, Dana's relationship with her boyfriend who won't acknowledge her in public, stories of the world before they were born...it's all so rich and vivid, and compelling. In Dana's first half, I felt like the book was a little too obsessed with the issue of her father's bigamy. I know, I know: that's the book's subject, but it felt like her section didn't have a center, didn't have anything pulling it forward beyond premise and theme. Although I enjoyed reading her part, I felt it was too on-the-nose at times, and that it lacked some narrative oomph. It felt a little too easy, or on-the-surface,or just too neat--I'm not sure what the problem was, for me. I loved moving to Chaurisse's section, to get her side of the story, and there was a nice narrative zing! each time Dana came on the scene. At times here, though, there was an odd lack of drama because we, as readers, had the information that Chaurisse didn't, and getting to the inevitable felt a bit tedious. That's too harsh actually, as the book itself is never tedious--it's always fun to read, and I was always emotionally connected. I just kept wondering, if there might have been a better way to structure the narrative, to get the most of out of its premise and plot.I loved, LOVED, the epilogue. It was fucking sad, and I felt like Jones just let things suck for her characters--because that was the only true ending. This was satisfying and moving, and it's what kept me thinking about the book after I'd finished it....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 12, 2011","Jun 16, 2011","Feb 18, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9749711-silver-sparrow

So cool! This style of narration was a perfect, modern example of an authorial, knowing narrator who is wholly present in the story, even if he's not a physical character (unless he is, momentarily...but that was just a bit of PoMo cleverness). This point of view allowed the narrator to step back and analyze the characters' actions in the context of the time they existed, and to compare their era with that of 1960s England (the narrator's time). That was great fun, and the book overall was an example of experimentation that can feel meaningful and useful, and not simply smart or strange for strange's sake.But, oh, dear lord, this book was so SLOW. There were times when I cursed its asides and its allusions that I did not understand. It's been a long time since a novel made me feel stupid. It seems Mr. Fowles and I live in entirely different worlds, where our points of references barely intersect. I also had a hard time understanding Sarah's motivations, and at the end of the book I felt totally lost with regards to the characters' emotional arcs. I refuse to blame this on myself, for I am a careful reader. Also, I couldn't understand Sarah's attraction or love for Charles. He seemed like a wet blanket, whereas she was mysterious and sensuous and even I wanted to see her with her hair down. Fowles successfully created desire for his female character, but I think he failed when it came to making his male character as magnetic and desirable.At times I found this book truly amazing and admirable and utterly original.

At first I worried it was a bit too easy, a bit too smooth, but as it went on there were passages that really made me pause to think, to revel in the beauty of the prose and the cleverness of its intertwining tales. I liked reading about motherhood and what's passed down from mother to daughter. This was a book I kept reading, especially when I should have been writing or washing dishes or paying attention to my dog. It was a wonderful morning-book--it seemed to match the warm light of my apartment as the day's just getting started...Sometimes I felt like the chapters were a bit too short. Each one focuses on one of three women, and I'd have to switch to the next character right as I was getting into the current one. I would have like more sustained attention on each character, I suppose. Also, occasionally, Violet's sections--which are historical--were so colorful that they felt almost too cinematic, if that makes any sense. I did like how Meadows focused on one day in the life of Sam, the contemporary character, a mother of infant Ella, and then, for Sam's mother, Iris, the chapters covered a few days (which took place a year before the Sam sections). Violet's sections--from the early 1900s (or late 1800s?)--cover quite a bit more time. These shifts in time were seamless, and I didn't even notice the differences until near the end of the book. Some of Sam's sections reminded me of Mrs Dalloway (because of Sam's 1-day, and the crises therein), and the whole book had a similar appeal that The Hours by Michael Cunningham does. It's fitting that Iris is reading Woolf (To The Lighthouse), in her sections...Oh, and I love the evocation of setting in the novel, from Madison, WI to Sansibel Island, Florida, to the early tenements of New York City. It was all wonderfully detailed and rich.Overall, this a pleasurable and thoughtful novel. (If only the cover weren't so goddamned PINK and CHEESY!

The rest of the book didn't offer much new information for me since I've read a few other birthing books and have taken a Bradley class, but I appreciated Gaskin's straightforward  of labor and midwifery v. hospital practices. I loved reading about orgasmic births (wowza!), and about the amazing talents of the punani, and I am taking her kissing-during-contractions tip with me to the hospital!

To read such a scary portrait of motherhood a few months before I myself am to have my first kid was somewhat of a mind fuck, but perhaps that's why I couldn't put the book down. I appreciated its darkness, even as it made me uncomfortable, and I loved its dark comedic tone as well as the very real pain of its narrator, Eva. Sometimes the darkness was oppressive and I had to take a break--but not for long, because the story was so readable. I appreciated the places Shriver was willing to go, and I admired the dexterity of her prose and how thoroughly and bravely she excavated this complicated narrator, flaws and all.From page 51 (of the paperback)--the narrator on her pregnancy:""Meanwhile, I came to regard my body in a new light. For the first time I apprehended the little mounds on my chest as teats for the suckling of young, and their physical resemblance to udders on cows or the swinging distentions on lactating hounds was suddenly unavoidable. Funny how even women forget what breasts are for.The cleft between my legs transformed as well. It lost a certain outrageousness, an obscenity, or achieved an obscenity of a different sort. The flaps seemed to open not to a narrow, snug dead end, but to something yawning. The passageway itself became a route to somewhere else, a real place, and not merely to a darkness of my mind. The twist of flesh in front took on a devious aspect, its inclusion overtly ulterior, a tempter, a sweetener for doing the species' heavy lifting, like the lollipops I once got at the dentist.""...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 30, 2010","Jan 09, 2011","Nov 22, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80660.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin

Sometimes the prose dazzled, sometimes it exhausted, a few times it left me underwhelmed. There were a couple of good laughs, but I wished it had been funnier. I found Patty's third-person autobiography section to be unbelievable in terms of voice. Franzen, you can't just capitalize a few words here and there and call it someone's perspective! It was clearly just Franzen, being Franzen. I wished he would have truly tried to write as Patty would have. Really gone there. Why didn't he? Also, I found two anachronisms. It says that when she was a kid, Patty received remaindered books from Barnes and Noble as gifts from her grandparents. Um, era? Also, in Joey's 2001 section (stupidly in the 2004 section--did I misread something?), his aunt disparages Tina Fey and Sarah Silverman. But in 2001 Fey and Silverman weren't well known enough! I was annoyed by these slips, however small. There's one paragraph near the end that's truly exceptional and beautiful and moving.

The prose is slick and clear as glass, and I loved the non-linear, mosaic-like structure, and the way Mandel presented a character's memories with a simple phrase, word or name, followed by a colon, and then a description of such phrase, word or person. It was so elegant, even sexy. Lots of sexiness in this book, guys: naked girls, singers with guns, recording devices, criminal families, Italian islands and payphones, cats eating tuna in airport bathrooms...At first, I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the novel, as its premise felt a touch absurd/whimsical for my taste. Its main character, after all, is sent to wait out his work days in the 'dead files' room of the building's basement, and he just lives with it. But as the story gathered history and weight, I got really invested in the world and found it believable, if a little technicolored and poetic. And, in the end, I loved these qualities of the book, as it made everything feel heightened and lovely and deep in the way our lives often aren't in their quotidian accuracy. Sometimes, the book emphasized too much its themes, namely: work, feeling lost, disappearing. But I also enjoyed these themes, so I'm not sure how they might otherwise be handled. And perhaps this tight-grip on the deeper subject is a byproduct of the taut quality of the storytelling, which was really appealing. Seriously, I could not put this book down. And it was beautifully written to boot! My only real complaint with this book are its double prepositions. They drove me crazy! ""She turned to him and pulled her nightgown off over her head"" (84) would be so much graceful as, ""She turned to him and pulled her nightgown over her head"" And ""Elena began walking forward across the room..."" (202) would be sleeker as ""Elena began walking across the room"" and ""Climbed up onto the breakwater rocks"" (225) could be, ""Climbed onto the breakwater rocks..."" These double prepositions were all over the text, and my neurotic language-reader winced at each one. I am sure Mandel's next book, sans all the unnecessary prepositions, will be a masterpiece!Emily St. John Mandel is such a talent.

Mr. Hibma (kept at a distance with his teacher-title throughout the book) gives his students posters of old movies. And? So what? When I described this characterization to Patrick, he said, ""They sound less like characters and more like Facebook profiles."" It's not that bad, but there is something to this analogy, for the soul is made up of more than a series of strange inclinations and obsessions. The book tells us these characters want more, want something--but the telling of those desires, the declaration of their existence, still doesn't accurately capture them in all their complexity and terror and beauty.

TThis was such a beautiful and moving book, and felt particularly modern for Forster--and not just because of the gay relationships depicted therein. There was something spare to the writing here, it felt less embellished to me than the prose in his other novels. It also did away with the comedy of errors and parlor room dramatics of A Room with a View or Where Angels Fear to Tread, and that felt modern, too. I appreciated how Maurice could be quite frustrating, and that he wasn't all that smart. It's difficult to write a character like that, and still make the reader care about him. I also loved that he took a definitive stand at the end of the novel, his mind finally nimble enough to connect the self to what mattered to it--I loved to see ""the muddle"" of his mind fall away as he embraced his long-suffered-over sexuality.I can't give the book five stars because there were whole passages that confused me. At the beginning especially, Forster speaks in the abstract to the point of confusion. I felt like I wasn't getting a joke. Later, there were plot points or emotional shifts that I didn't understand as they were happening. For instance, I didn't realize until the very end that Maurice and Clive hadn't actually had sex--I assumed they had until it was revealed in the final chapter that they'd kept their relationship platonic. I had wrongly assumed the sex scenes had simply been implied. Silly me! I fault myself for his mistake, but even so, I was bothered, and there were other interactions and details about his schooling or whatever that went over my head. It's weird to read a giant talent like Forster and think, ""This needs an edit"" or ""This could use some elaboration"" but there you have it. Perhaps writing a book privately will produce a work of raw honesty and power, with the occasional obscure passage.The rhythm of the prose in this book took my breath away: ""Drawing the curtains, he gazed long into the rain and sighed, and struck his own face, and bit his own lips.""

What a gift and burden Rose has, to taste feelings and lineage in every bite! I was also really compelled by her brother Joseph, and his own gift/burden. I loved how the novel skipped years and compressed time. That was a real surprise to me, each time it happened. I liked the book overall, thus 3 stars (goodreads has a bad inflation going on, guys! 3 stars means ""I liked it""). I didn't love the book, though, or really like it because the family narrative felt a touch too flat to me, or shot through with whimsy at times when I wanted the mucky complexity of reality to be dealt with straight on.

That sounds cheesy, I know, I know, but it's true. Narrator Sebastian is just earnest to his soul (I suppose that's what happens when you're raised by your Nana in a geodesic dome), and you can't help but love his overly-formal speech and innocence about the world and his geometry skills and his bad hair and weird flannel shirt. The dialogue is terrific throughout--so funny and taut, particularly in the scenes between Jared and Sebastian--and I really loved the final talent show scene. I feared it would be predictable, and it wasn't, it let me just sit back and enjoy the drama as it unfolded.I do wish the book were a little more complicated. I thought perhaps there could have been a more subtle way to thread in the Buckminster Fuller stuff, for Sebastian to have a more nuanced relationship with this figure he's been raised to exalt. Also, I wanted the drama between the characters to get a little more complicated. This feels like a young adult novel at times--and that isn't a knock against it, it's just not what I prefer to read.

I don't know how accurate This book is a fast and engaging read, and it's often quite funny, even as the subject matter is also sometimes horrifying. I don't know how accurate the narrators' voices in this book were--I've never been to Mississippi, so I can't speak to that--but critics who say the voices of the two black maids, Aibileen and Minnie, are not wholly believable, are pretty convincing. (I found all three narrators engaging nevertheless.) Overall, the black characters are complex and interesting; it's mainly the character of Hilly, the white villain, that was unbelievable and flat for me. It seems to me, that by making the biggest racist in the book incredibly unlikable and unsympathetic, Stockett allows her contemporary (most often white) readers feel an immediate disconnection from said racist, and thus, feel relieved and even self-congratulatory that they are not like her. I'm more interested in narratives that investigate how we are complicit--either consciously or not--in racism and prejudicial behaviors. Skeeter, the white woman who writes the book of the black maids' stories, is perhaps the most interesting character to me, because, even as she disowns the Southern traditions of racism that she's been surrounded by since birth, she still, especially at the opening of the book, doesn't seem to see her own white privilege. I was also curious how she is, in a sense, an ""other"" among her white peers: she is tall, and unmarried (which, by the way, allows her to bow out of the white wife-black housekeeper relationship--convenient, yes?), and she even has kinky hair). Even with these differences, however, she moves freely through the world in the way that Aibileen and Minnie don't, and can't. Her realization of her own white privilege is clunky and not always so deep, but I was engaged by the evolution of her understanding, this loss of innocence. The ending felt too neat. Everything turns out okay! And Hilly's comeuppance was satisfying, but also too easy. Oh, and when I looked up book club discussion questions for this one (as I read this to run a book club talk), I found this totally inane question:""From the perspective of a twenty-first century reader, the hairshellac system that Skeeter undergoes seems ludicrous. Yet women still alter their looks in rather peculiar ways as the definition of ""beauty"" changes with the times. Looking back on your past, what's the most ridiculous beauty regimen you ever underwent?""Um...so is *this* the kind of bullshit that passes for book club discourse these days?

I loved slipping into this novel because the world Nelson writes of is both familiar (it's America, and accurately rendered) and surprising (she writes of it in a new, refreshing way). Of course I loved the stuff about teenage girls and their complicated, funny, meaningful, temporary friendships. Of course I loved the various dogs in the novel.I was curious about the structure of this novel, which seems to float from one chapter to the next, some of them like little stories, some more like traditional scenes in novels that rest on previous ones. I loved the slightly elevated point of view that gradually grew closer, and how easily Nelson moves from one character's consciousness to the next. After reading a few of Nelson's stories (""Female Trouble"" and ""OBO"" most fresh in my mind), the male character from Bound, Oliver, seemed familiar--a certain type of male character that Nelson explores often; he's vain and insecure, secretive, and not very likable. I wonder if he might have been given more humanity earlier in the book--she seemed harder on him than the others in the novel.The story did indeed lack narrative drive. Sometimes that was all right, the characters and the language moving me along. Other times, I longed to see the narratives connect more quickly, or in a more satisfying way. This is definitely a ""quiet"" novel, as they say.

The opening chapters were particularly funny, as they document Ms. Klam's single life with her beloved Boston Terrier Otto, the first Boston she fell in love with. (And I thought Omar was spoiled!) The rest of the book illuminates just how many people and how much it takes to rescue, foster and find a dog a permanent home. Those who volunteer their time, space and hearts to these dogs are truly incredible, and this book does a great job of depicting their efforts. My only real critique is that the self-help-style ""lessons"" at the end of each chapter felt a little forced, and unnecessary. I would've much rather have read a straightforward my-life-with-dogs memoir, without the framing device. Fortunately, as the book becomes more event-focused and subject-driven (about rescues), the framing device falls away somewhat, or, the lessons complement the chapters more, and the book reads more smoothly.

This is a dark tale about self-destruction and the limits of intimacy.

Fortress of Solitude had moments of brilliance, but the language felt too wanna-be DeLillo. Motherless Brooklyn was a bit dull for me, though others I know really love that book. I resent his novel about Silver Lake--I have not read it, nor will I. I realize it's merely ""an entertainment"" in an ouevre of more serious books, but after spending a whole novel complaining about the gentrification of Brooklyn, why go and write a novel about an east-side LA neighborhood, post-gentrification, without being sensitive to the area's fraught history? Not cool.Mike Reynolds wrote a terrific  of Chronic City, which I urge you to read right away. Just skip my stupid musings.I found this book dazzling in its strangeness. I love books about stoners, I think. Perkus reminded me of a friend my dad might have, if Perkus had moved to LA in the early-eighties and become a stand-up comedian, or gotten really into astrology. Or both. I can just see him sitting on the couch with my dad, dissecting movies on TCM, passing a joint, picking up and dropping with disdain the various magazines that litter the floor of the living room. In this scene, I'm in junior high, walking through with a big glass of Coke and a quesadilla on a paper plate, rolling my eyes.I loved the chaldrons in this book, and I love that I Googled the word to find that Lethem had made them up. I love the Second Life-type virtual universe. I loved the New York Lethem created--finally, someone gets at the fakery of that town! Lord, am I sick of hearing about how geniune and raw and authentic New York City is. This alternate-reality Manhattan was gloriously rendered. All of this made the book a fun read.A few times, the prose was a touch on-the-nose. Usually when Chase Insteadman (his name itself, a little on-the-nose) waxes poetic about his role: ""I might love Janice, yes, but what I showed these people was a simulacrum, a portrayal of myself"" (35). Duh! This line is like a 20-year-old English major's wet dream. Why don't you just write the paper for her, Jonathan?! Other times, the prose was difficult to read, clumsy. I'd read a sentence twice, and it dissolved before my eyes. A few just seemed overly complicated: ""Richard bolted from his taxicab, punching black shoe prints in the dusty covering that had begun to whirl from the sky"" (397)--there was real confusion for me here, with the use of ""covering"" to describe the layer of snow on the ground. And this one was just a mess: ""Now she'd taken a new assignment, covert as ever: an autobiography of Laird Noteless, who'd received the commission for the Memorial to Daylight popular sentiment had demanded in reply to the gray fog downtown"" (96). Huh? In both cases, I was yanked out of the fictional dream, so to speak--and if you're about to say, ""But, man, that's Lethem's project! He wants to remind you that you're reading fiction, blah blah blah!"" just shut the fuck up. Most of the time, I was in the fictional dream Lethem created--it was bizarre and complex and not-quite-real, but it worked, because the language was accurate and smooth, even if syntactically complicated. I wished the whole book had been flawless in this regard. Near the end, the language exhausted me, especially after a pretty upsetting event that I was emotionally affected by. I wanted to see the moment head-on, but the narration wouldn't allow it. Perhaps that was an aesthetic choice, but it's still one I didn't like.But, overall, an incredibly fun and ambitious book, and I'm glad to have read it!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Dec 31, 2009","Dec 14, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6085191-chronic-city

All it takes is imagination, which perhaps, is the truest form of empathy, no matter how much fictionalization is required.Also, major props for another book with dog consciousness. Oh, poor Trixie!

I felt like Atwood had already created such a rich world with that novel, so that a lot of the totally awesome things imagined in this book are from the previous one.

It's smart, it's really fucking funny, the world I was pulled into was fascinating and weird and utterly believable, even as it was absurd and playful. And I loved the narrator. Ricky Rice is probably one of the best voices to come out of literature in the last...oh, ever probably. The prose here is stunning, smart, beautiful, and funny in the way that I want it to be:""This guy was no bigger than a bunion"" (32).""Taking heroin is like sinking into a tapioca hammock"" (64).""Seeing America by bus is like touring the Louvre in a Porta Potti"" (250).""She couldn't have been older than me. Thirty-eight or thirty-nine. And her thighs were so thick that she wobbled when she walked. Now, let me say that I don't mean this an insult. In fact, I mean it as the highest compliment. She was shaped like a bowling pin. The kind of figure that makes a man like me feel vigorous. And if I hadn't seen her at the Washburn Library, I would've asked that thick little woman on a date"" (56).And what I love about this book is that it's still very sad, too, and the emotions are raw. Many terrible things happen, and the action doesn't exclude meditation or reflection or lyricism. Alas, I must give Big Machine 4 and not 5 stars because I didn't love the direction it took in the last quarter. I wasn't into the turn to the supernatural. Really, I could've stayed in the Washburn Library the whole time and taken the cult history and the feral cats along with me. The final hijinks were just too nutty for me. I will say, however, that I admired that LaValle went wild with this novel. He just did what he wanted to.

I was really impressed with the structure of this book, which balances and braids multiple time frames and places. I read this in a few days and really enjoyed myself--the mystery and secrets build as the story goes on in such a delicious way! My main critique of the book is that one of the story's main characters, or at the least the character we begin with, Eli, is pretty uninteresting, almost a cipher, and although I thought his research on lost languages was intriguing, I didn't believe that someone would actually be writing a dissertation on this broad of a topic. It felt like an excuse for the writer to talk about something cool--and disappearing languages are so cool--but I think it could have been done in a more subtle manner. Why not have him writing about a specific dipthong or something, and then spread out to the more general topic from there? Overall, I kept coming across other stuff that felt too precious to me (traveling circus, for example), and I felt like Mandel wanted very much for all these ideas to echo the idea of disappearing, of being lost. Don't get me wrong, it was all so fun to read about, but sometimes I wish the author would let go of her grip on the story's themes. I have the feeling that Eli is supposed to be a cipher, because he really doesn't have any sense of self or identity--but, at the same time, I didn't really care about his plight. I kept thinking, ""No wonder your girlfriend ran away from you, you're boring!"" And, another knock against this book--though it's not the author's fault: What is going on with this cover?! It's so terrible. It will hurt sales, and that sucks because this is a novel from such a promising writer!

Is this the British version or something? Yes, a girl in A Mercy does insist on wearing shoes at all times, and actually travels in her dead master's boots, but this aspect of the book is no way akin to a kid borrowing her mom's shoes to play pretend, as this cover suggests. This looks like Sasha Obama borrowing Michelle's heels after the Inaguration Ball! Geeze....Okay wait, I'm editing myself. Once you click on the cover the shoes look a lot less opulent, and her dress is clearly ragged, and I guess--I guess--it alludes to a very important scene in the book. Still, it's like a stupid Hallmark card.***Anyway. The prose in this book blew me away. The language is so strange and beautiful, whether speaking in Florens's tense-less voice, or as Jacob, or Lina. The syntax of this book was always shifting depending on the character, as were the images, but from start to finish the prose put a charge through me. I actually felt this prose in my body--as a tingling in my wrists and up my arms. The language itself transported me to this historical era--my mind had to shift to accommodate the language, and thus, this particular past. I was pretty convinced the book was going to be my favorite of the year--and it's only January! Maybe it still will be, but the ending felt rushed (it could have been 60 pages longer!), and the last two chapters were a bit too on the nose for my taste. I liked the book more when its world and the relationships between the characters confounded me a little...at the end Morrison seemed to enjoy explaining things to her reader. I want to say more about the animal imagery throughout, but I have to clean my apartment and take a shower before teaching, so I can't right now. I also want to re-read this one.

Men are stupid."" In The Robber Bride we get a peek into the lives of three women: petite academic Tony, new age, delicate Charis, and gregarious, fashionable Roz; the histories of their marriages, their childhoods, and their current day-to-day experiences in 1990s Toronto, are fascinating. All three of them have suffered at the hands of Zenia, the man-eater, who is not so much a woman as third-gendered--she is without a verifiable past, she is almost mythic in her actions and in her ability to disappear and renew herself, and she does not suffer as the other women, or men, in the novel do. She uses her body to get what she wants, in a way that the others cannot, but she uses something else, too, which remains a mystery to the characters. She has large breasts but they aren't real. At first I worried this novel was a little too cartoonish in its depiction of Tony, Roz, and Charis, but as the story went on, all three women gained depth. I loved falling into their individual stories. And the writing! Atwood is just too good. Reading this, I did think the relationships between men and women, as Atwood depicts them, feel a bit dated--there's a generational gap. This book is a historical text in that way, or at least it seemed like it to me. These women were born in the 1940s, and are in their fifties when the book begins. None of them can communicate with their partners, and all three of them have a maternal, ""I need to take care of poor little him"" attitude about their men. It feels authentic, but I think it's either specific to this milieu, or that a lot has changed. Even at the end of the book, one of the women (Tony?) sees Roz's teenage daughters as more confident, more honest, than she and her friends ever were. The women in this book don't have any male friends, and they don't seem to take their partners seriously, although they do exalt them in a strange way, and fear their leaving. There's a real, uncrossable chasm between men and women in this book, which feels foreign to me. Anyway, I'm rambling now. Here are some of my favorite sentences:Here's Roz:""Then she [Zenia] turned to go down the steps, lifting her hand in a gesture oddly reminiscent of a newsreel general saluting the troops, and what was it she'd said? Fuck the third world! I'm tired of it!So much for proprieties, So much for earnest old Roz and her poky, boring charities, her handouts to the Raped Moms and Battered Grannies, and, at the time, the whales and the famine victims and the village self-helpers, dowdy pump mommy Roz, shackled to her boring old consciousness. It was a selfish, careless remark, a daring remark, a liberated remark--to hell with guilt! It was like speeding in a convertible, tailgating, weaving in and out without signaling, stereo on full blast and screw the neighbors, throwing your leftovers out the window, the ribbons, the wrapping paper, the half-eaten filo pastries and the champagne truffles, things you'd used up just by looking at them.""Woo!Then, here's Charis's part, where we learn about her getting molested as a kid:""""Scamper upstairs,"" he tells her. He's trying for his fake voice, his uncle voice, but he hasn't got it back; his voice is desolate.""Wow. ""Desolate"" is such a perfect word there.And this is Tony:""Meanwhile, the Zenias of this world are abroad in the land, plying their trade, cleaning out male pockets, catering to male fantasies. Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? ...Even pretending you aren't catering to a male fantasy is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair, unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else.

A pretty fascinating look at how one comes to understand and accept one's own identity.Read and re-read this!...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jul 24, 2009","Nov 16, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/166997.Stoner

I'm not even interested in my own spirituality, let alone that of some woman I've never met! Still, this book actually won me over. Gilbert writes an enjoyable and funny narrative, and I found myself first wanting to go eat pasta in Italy, and then wanting to try meditating in India, and then...wanting to find a lover in Bali and have my latest healer friend find me an ancient cure for my sex-related urinary tract infection. I can see why this book is so popular--Gilbert presents her spiritual quest in an accessible and entertaining manner. In the end, I found Gilbert a wee bit too cutesy and every time she brought up that God guy I was like, ""Who?"" There are limits to how invested an atheist can get with this kind of book. I also didn't get a strong sense of how her intense time in India affected her once she left--and I really wanted to read about that.

Wouldn't we all like to go on a year of self exploration? But, overall, this was a fun one. So, I say, fuck all the haters. This book is a best seller because people actually enjoy reading it.

Here, Moore has given her characters a variety of existences and situations, calling into question the idea of authenticity and truth in fiction writing. I found myself favoring one version of a character over another, and I would have to stop and ask myself why this was. I also loved the rearranging of images throughout--the way, for instance, Moore used ""bathmat"" as a metaphor in a number of different ways.With all these ideas strolling through the book, Moore was smart enough to also give us great humor and beautiful prose, making the reading experience a joy. Lorrie Moore is one of my favorite writers because she is so damn funny and her cleverness and ability to turn a phrase feels effortless. I am in love with her puns, her similes, her whimsy, her bitterness. My complaint with the novel is that the one storyline that got the most pages didn't interest me as much as some of the others, and although this section's shifting third to first person point of view felt meaningful at the end, it was otherwise jarring and overly cutesy for me. Also, because of the nature of the book, if I went too long not reading it, I had a difficult time coming back to the characters and feeling invested in them.And now I will rewrite one passage that made me laugh out loud in the bathtub. There are other ones, but you will have to read the book the find them:""The problem with a beautiful woman is that she makes everyone around her feel hopelessly masculine, which if you're already male to begin with poses no particular problem. But if you're anyone else, your whole sexual identity gets dragged into the principal's office: ""So what's this I hear about you prancing around, masquerading as a woman?"" You are answerless.

It's as if Abigail can only exist as she relates to the other characters we've read about--the scenes in her section feel too loaded, too obviously echoed.

There's a pleasing boldness to the syntax and diction, and there were a few passages that felt, well, wise, and when I gave myself some time to really dig into the text, I was impressed by the fluid time shifts and how the story felt unstructured and impeccably structured at once. But, the novel never pulled me in; I never really felt inside of the story. It felt a bit too over-manicured, a bit too studied. A bit too perfect, perhaps? I haven't lived in New York, either, and so all the descriptions of the city didn't do much for me, as wonderfully written as they were. (I must admit, I hate when people wax poetic about NY. Yeah, yeah, we know, it's amazing there--the pizza, the energy, blah blah blah...) Likewise, I've never played cricket or seen it being played, and even now I feel the need to look online to understand the sport. I liked how cricket managed to be a metaphor for many things for Hans, but I only liked that on an intellectual level. I felt nothing. I found myself, too, frustrated by Hans' continual memories of his boyhood--I had a hard time caring, to be blunt. I would also hit passages that overwhelmed me with their abstract quality, like this one:""Unlike many others, I managed to stay awake; and could not help thinking, as I endured an ominous dramatization of the loss of vision produced by alcohol and by nightfall and the disastrous consequences thereof, of my father's life ending in a smashup presumably just like those being presented on the screen, and of the fact, unconsidered by me before, that on top of everything else his early death had given an unfairly morganatic quality to his marriage: he had been posthumously robbed, in his son's sentiments, of a ranking equal to that of his wife.""Maybe people do think like this, do make connections in this way, but I'm having a hard time believing it. I know this is a retrospective tale, but at times that studied retrospection has the effect of filing down and buffing (to keep up this manicure metaphor) consciousness to something overly designed.So, I'm giving this three stars not because I necessarily liked it, but because it's a truly admirable novel, and I can understand why someone else might love it.

Weight is always a factor when choosing beach reading, isn't it?Some of the prose here is lovely, although most of the time it strains to be lovely, making it less so. Greer likes to repeat phrases throughout the novel, such as, ""We think we know the ones we love..."" and usually these refrains sounded cheesy and obvious to me. It feels like Greer was nervous his readers wouldn't get the themes of the book, so he felt the need to announce them on every other page, all the while playing the violin and spraying lavender-gardenia-memory perfume in my face. The weirdest thing about this book is that the narrator is a black woman talking about her marriage during the 1950s--but she doesn't reveal herself as a person of color until page 48. I have the feeling that Greer wanted to trick all of us readers who just assume whiteness on characters (how dare I!), and then say, ""Aha! Gotcha!"" It felt like trickery because there are many times in the first 47 pages that she would mention her race, or someone else's, and doesn't. For instance, when an important character first comes to her door, she mentions that he's blonde, not that he is white. Come on! A black woman in the 1950s opens her door and doesn't see race? I don't buy it, and it seems to me a failure in authentic perspective. Greer also has a habit of being cryptic in scene and then making me wait to figure out what's going on. This didn't produce narrative drive, it just made me put the book down and reapply my sunscreen. Let's just say I didn't get sunburned until I started reading other books that caught my attention and kept it there. Overall, the book was an easy read and often the passages about San Francisco in that era were fun, but I didn't understand the narrator's conflict and her motivations. And I even saw the ending coming...and that NEVER happens to me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,not set,"Jul 29, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1972091.The_Story_of_a_Marriage

The largest section of the book, the first person testimonials, is by far the most successful. I fell in love with a lot of these stories, and I liked how some characters knew Lima and Belano (either or both of them) fairly well, and some had just barely crossed paths with the two poets. Bolano has an incredible ear for voice, and these testimonials felt authentic to me in a way that fiction often doesn't--I could hear these voices in my head as I read, and I understood the speakers as people, not characters. There were moments when I was definitely on the ""Me Encanta Bolano"" train (tren). Unfortunately, not all the testimonials were effective, and I wondered why there were so many. I also felt the second Garcia Madero section was boring, sloppy, and so ineffective compared to the beauty of the previous testimonials. I am sure people on the site will curse me out for saying this, but here it goes: I didn't care about their search for Tinajero! It seems to me that Bolano should have made me care. So, in the end, I loved The Savage Detectives at times, and I was bored with it at other times, and sometimes I felt pretty apathetic about it. I also wonder at the sloppy/blah language in places. I know Bolano is inhabiting the voices of various people, but does that mean that he has to use ""still as a statue"" like a zillion times? Also, ""shrug your shoulders"" could be simply ""shrugged"". What else can you shrug, Bolano, aside from your shoulders? (I do wonder if this is a question of translation. I don't recall what the Spanish verb for ""to shrug"" is, and perhaps in Spanish, one must say ""los hombros"" with shrug..hmmm...anyone know the answer to this?)Maybe I'm just not the right reader for this book.

The point of view tired me out on my first attempt, but a month or so later I returned to the novel with an open mind (and heart, I suppose), able to fall into the 'we' without a problem at all. The way in which the book brings individual characters into focus is pretty terrific, actually. I am forever attached to Tom Mota, for example, after what he did for Janice--and I'm impressed that Ferris was able to connect me in such a way, given the somewhat alienating distance of the ""we"" voice.

I understand that this is the point of the book, but it just didn't mesmerize me (except for the 'buckshelves' section, which I still laugh at). The third-person section about Lynn Mason fell flat for me.

I didn't like all the stories in this book, but many of them ask some interesting questions regarding structure, character, point of view--that is, they're useful for teaching, and learning.Some of the stories that really stood out to me this edition were: -""A Real Doll"" by A.M. Homes (A boy fucks his sister's Barbie, who speaks to him and may or may not be alive despite her unwavering dollness--I loved this story!)-""The Disappeared"" by Charles Baxter -""The Ceiling"" by Kevin Brockmeier (A favorite of mine since it first appeared in McSweeneys)-""We Didn't"" by Stuary Dybek (Sigh, so lovely)-""Stone Animals"" by Kelly Link -""Two Boys"" by Rick Moody -""Caveman in Hedges"" by Stacey Richter-""The Pugilist at Rest"" by Thom Jones.-""Sarah Cole"" by Russell Banks, ""Marie"" by Edward P. Jones, ""The School"" by Donald Barthelme, ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien, and ""The Management of Grief"" by Baharati Mukherjee, all of which are also in the first edition.There are others I enjoyed and admired, but I won't bore you. Perhaps I didn't like this collection more because I'm simply a little sick of reading a handful of stories every day. Also, I lament certain absences; where is Lorrie Moore (!), Alice Munro, Jim Shepard, Aimee Bender, Dan Chaon? Also, they replaced Junot Diaz's ""Fiesta 1980"" with ""Nilda""--not as good, in my opinion, but maybe the former is over-anthologized? I would've switched out ""Marie"" for a newer Jones story, but now I'm just rambling from the soap box...My point: This anthology is worth reading, especially in tandem with the first edition.

Buford gets thrown into the frantic kitchen at Babbo, and we learn this world from his newbie perspecitve, getting a better sense of the gluttonous and ingenious Mario Batali along the way. Those parts can't compare to the ones about old-word-in-the-present Italian pasta making and butchering. Buford has a deep respect for cooking and eating, and his efforts to understand people's devotion to such ancient modes of food preparation are admirable, and the information he gathers is compelling. A few parts lagged here and there (nut not for long enough to really matter), and sometimes the prose was a little awkward (particularly in the opening section).

I liked your book!Here's my official :Radiant Days is a compelling story about a fairly unlikeable and hapless twenty-something guy in the mid-1990s who follows a beautiful Hungarian woman to Budapest and then to war-torn Croatia. The language is conversational, with an interesting use of fragmented sentences, and occasional lapses into pleasing lyricism. (There's this great passage where the narrator describes these moms waiting for their kids to get out of school--I loved it). The book is funny, and also quite serious; I was impressed with how Fitzgerald wrestled with big international issues, and the ignorance of our American narrator. Some of his reactions, and people's reactions to him, reminded me of my own travels through Europe. I didn't think Gisela, the Hungarian woman, was particularly compelling, which rendered the narrator's journey a bit underwhelming at times. I couldn't pin down his interest in her. On the flipside, I loved the depiction of Marsh, the British war journalist.This is a promising debut.

Mostly plants.""So begins In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto, Michael Pollan's informative, frightening, and ultimately inspiring new book. Pollan explores the dangers of nutritionism and traces how we became a culture of fat people eating ""Heart Healthy!"" Fritos in our cars--and/or a culture of eaters obsessed with health, and yet eating food-like substances that are in fact incredibly harmful to our bodies. He urges us to to ignore the noise of diet fads and journalists (uh, except him) and return to whole foods, prepared ourselves and enjoyed at the table with family and friends. Eating is more than just fueling the body.Since this book fell into our laps, Patrick and I have been making regular trips to the farmers market to buy not only local fruits and vegetables, but also grass-finished beef (rather than beef made from industrial feedlot cows who are forced to eat corn and pumped with antibiotics), for we're not only what we eat, but also what we eat eats. It's been a joy to discover turnips and parnips, and to experiment with various eggplants (so many sizes and shapes!), and to try a bison burger. Patrick and I have always been big cooks, and we stay away from fast food and twinkies and the like, but we have come to see that spending more time and money on food makes even more sense than we originally thought. We hope to start an herb garden soon. Yea!I gave this book only 4 instead of 5 stars because its lack of narrative made it sometimes difficult to a fiction reader like myself. I appreciated all the information, however, and don't think Pollan could write it any other way.

During the event, some questions concerned main character Ben's unsympathetic nature--but I really liked him, despite, or perhaps because of, his insecurities and negativity.

I decided not to read it because, as the teacher explained, it was about World War Two and time travel. For one, I was not interested in time travel (I remember imagining Bill and Ted getting in that damn phone booth and shaking my head), and I was afraid I'd drown in too many war references. What if I didn't get it? I chose The Crying of Lot 49 instead. (Joke was on me, I guess.)Fast forward to 2007, and I'm doing a casual study of Kurt Vonnegut. Slaughterhouse-Five is my second pick. What's the verdict, you wonder? I am delighted to report that I loved this novel! Whereas Cat's Cradle struck me as clever but perhaps forgettable, Slaughterhouse-Five was funny, playful, structurally fascinating, and damn moving. I was interested in how ""So it goes"" repeated throughout the novel, changing with each use: first the casualness jarred me, and then I was surprised to see it, and then I expected to see it, and then I was exhausted by it, and the cycle went round and round again, a little different each time. It emphasized how much freaking death is in this book. A lot. I also found the prose to be quite lovely.

In this novel, however, Drury tries something new plot-wise, adding supernatural elements and what the summary on the back cover calls ""neo-noir"". I wouldn't go that far, but there is a sinister storyline here that occasionally feels at odds with Drury's trademark silliness and anti-plot scenes in which people talk about nothing in particular. The end was well-handled and risky, though, and I appreciated the ideas of fate and destiny therein--it got me thinking about Drury as author, setting up all these plot dominoes, which in turn creates the thematic subject of the book. Did these ideas of fate interest Drury because he was trying so hard to write a book that he wouldn't normally write? That is, a book with a strong sense of cause and effect, with an overarching conflict and inevitable conclusion? Here's a typically wonderful Tom Drury exchange from The Driftless Area:""It's just that I thought life was going to be fun. That was really the impression I had.""""It is fun,"" said Pierre. ""I mean it's not Adventureland. But you write your poems, the leaves move, you get laid sometimes. Isn't that fun?""""The leaves move?""""You know what I mean.""""Oh, joy, the leaves are moving.""""Honest to Christ, I believe that.""""I know you do.""Then Pierre heard a muffled sound and Carrie took a silver cell phone from her purse and checked the number on the screen and shut off the phone.""Let me see that,"" said Pierre.She handed it to him.""Very modern,"" he said....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Sep 2007,"Sep 06, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1593886.The_Driftless_Area

I'd been taking my time between books by reading various lit mags, and was so taken by Bender's story in an old issue of Tin House that I picked up her book. It had been on my shelf for over a year, and suddenly I was reading story after story--4 or so at a time. They are all swift reads, the prose simple and lovely, all of them strange: a boy has keys for hands, a woman raises potatoes as her children, a motherfucker (literally, he fucks mothers) falls in love with a starlet. Some of the stories are a bit thin, and a little too arbitrarily kooky for my taste (too ""hey I had this crazy dream, so now I'm writing a story as if it really happened!""), but overall this was a pleasing, often dazzling, read. I'd pick Aimee Bender to win in a wrestling match with Miranda July, any day.Oh, and: Last summer I was having a really bad writing day so I went to LACMA to distract myself from my lack of talent and motivation. I was at the lowest depths of self-misery when I realized Aimee Bender was standing right next to me! Of course I didn't say anything, but I was thinking: ""You and me, Aimee, you and me."" I felt much better after that.Oh, and: The story I found in Tin House is still my favorite in the collection. It's called ""The End of the Line,"" about a man who buys a tiny man as a pet, only to torture him. I will leave it at that, but I related the entire story to Patrick after reading it breathlessly, my hand over my heart, and the tears in my eyes as I described the story to him made him fall in love with me all over again.

As I read this book (about a whole lot more than a model who gets a new face after a car accident, by the way), I often had to stop and admire the fluidity of Egan's narrative, how she moved in and out of action, in and out of flashback, in and out of a character's head. This book seemed so effortless, yet complicated, and I learned a lot about novel-making from reading it.There was a chunk of about 60 pages near the end when I suddenly was tired of the book, exhausted by the prose (a pretty sentence everywhere I looked), and trying hard not to skim. This was a shock, since before that I was reading the book whenever I had a free moment. I think the problem stems from Egan suddenly focusing on characters whom I didn't care to know more about.Also, I was reading the hardcover edition and there's a great error on page 202, when someone is perusing a ""desert menu"".

We met once a week in a different apartment (though I can only imagine us at Kiki's place), to drink champagne and discuss the novel. Complain is really what we did--and then I went home with a champagne headache. None of us liked this novel, and I believe only a couple of us finished it. The Golden Notebook moves at a glacial pace, and it's probably the only book that has ever truly depressed me. Usually I like depressing books! This one just made me feel sick for humanity and myself, and for this terrible sad narrator writing these notebooks. The only good part to talk about, of course, was the orgasm section: is it true that the man who really loves you can give you both a clitoral AND a vaginal orgasm? Kiki told us her mom's opinion, and we all leaned in, attentive. But really, this too is an outdated discussion--if my memory serves me correctly (and it doesn't always), in the book, her lover refuses to believe that the clitoral orgasm is a real orgasm, and only wants to give her the other kind. I think nowadays men and women are more accepting of all orgasms. Yea for the world and the progress we've made! In the end, this book was a disappointment.

Once the humor ran out (and it did), there was little left to hold the novel up. I feel guilty writing bad s, but I must fight against the unwarranted praise this book has received (Best Book of the Year? Please!). I liked Shteyngart's first novel, The Russian Debutante's Handbook, much better, and I read an interview with him where he said he wants to try something not so satirical for his next book.

A guy gets 8.5 million pounds in a settlement for an accident he's not allowed to disclose (part of the settlement's agreement), and soon after gets the urge to re-enact an experience that feels like a vivid memory but isn't. This part of the book is pretty compelling and strange, but after that the novel simply depicts the narrator's thirst for one re-enactment after another as he falls farther and farther away from reality. I hated this guy--he reminded me of an eccentric millionare with a mental problem, a la Michael Jackson, except rather than create a theme park at his house to lure and fondle innocent children, and impregnate some woman and then name the child after himself and make him wear a blanket over his head, this guy forces all these people to create one set after another in attempt to feel all tingly while inside these performed movements. Who cares? Not me. I was initially interested in the book's ideas about authenticity, the fluidity, or lackthereof, between a thought and an action, between truth and an acted truth, but the novel never moved forward with these ideas.
