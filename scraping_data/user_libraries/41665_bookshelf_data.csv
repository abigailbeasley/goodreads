Here we have the under-the-radar (so far) 2024 novel I'm going to be annoying about foisting on people. This is REALLY good. I love stories like this about salt-of-the-earth people just trying to get by. And this novel is full of them. But I thought this novel is exceptional for two reason:1) The voice of the narrator (and this is all third-person) perfectly matches the voice of these characters. The cadence and diction of people who live in places like Perris, California (or the rural south or small towns in the Midwest) are just different, and so unique. And Stark NAILS this. Authenticity is so crucial, and this feels authentic. Also, though this is not a thriller, Stark's writing pulls you along quickly and smoothly. The best compliment I know how to give a writer: I didn't even realize I was reading as I tore through novel this in three days. 2) The characters. They're complex. They're real. They're flawed. We know who we're supposed to root for and we do, despite the fact that they do things like yell at waitresses and meddle in the affairs of their family members. The exception here is the villains -- they're pretty villainous.Still, I loved this book. The bookstore's publishers sales rep recommended this to me as a book he thought I'd love, and give it up one more time for publishers sales reps who are the most underrated people in the publishing industry for getting it right 99.9 percent of the time.GIVE THIS BOOK A SHOT!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 07, 2024","Apr 09, 2024","Apr 07, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/179548545-perris-california

In Nevada, no one really cares about the reason for your divorce. Nevada will happily take your money, sever your connection, and send you on your way.This little-known corner of history is the backdrop behind The Divorcées, the terrific, juicy, gin-soaked debut novel by Rowan Beaird. Lois is a mid-20s woman living in Lake Forest, Illinois, and married to a fellow named Lawrence who she decidedly doesn't love. She only married him because that's what women do. They get married. After four years of marriage, Lois has decided, mostly because she doesn't want to have children (an even more courageous decision in mid-century America) and Lawrence does, along with a several other indignities to which he subjects her, she wants out of her marriage. So even though her father is furious, she goes to the Golden Yarrow, a divorce ranch in Reno, Nevada. After six weeks, she can establish Nevada residency, and get a divorce with very few questions asked. When urbane but mysterious socialite Greer arrives at the ranch, her face bruised and her past shrouded, all the girls are immediately drawn to her. But she chooses Lois, for reasons Lois can't begin to comprehend, as her confidante. Who is Greer? What's her story and what does she want? And will she help Lois forge her own path, or will she lead Lois to her demise?How society looked down its nose at divorced women is a major theme of this novel, as is the idea that women weren't truly free to choose their own best lives. The Nevada divorce ranches make for super fertile ground for exploring this idea through the characters of Lois, Greer, and several other women, each with her own reason for being there. We root for these women, even the ones who seem flighty and superficial, but we root the most for Lois. The novel slow burns through the first half, as Lois gets situated and attuned to the day-to-day of her new home. But the lushness of Beaird's writing carries us through. You truly have a sense of place at this desert ranch. When the story really gets going, it's tough to put down. In fact, I read the second half of this novel in one day. I couldn't wait to see whether Lois makes it or not.This is a really accomplished debut, and I can't wait to see what Beaird does next! ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 27, 2024","Mar 31, 2024","Mar 27, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127306119-the-divorc-es

And then he does it again? And then again?... AND IT'S ALL FASCINATING! That's what it's like reading Hanif Aburraquib generally and this book specifically. But what's truly amazing about reading Abdurraquib is that he somehow is able to connect all these tangents into a cohesive whole. He'll start a paragraph about baldness or being a witness or any of a dozen other topics, that seemingly has nothing to do with the previous several pages, but by the end, he'll connect it to aging or his skepticism of religion or whatever it was he'd been talking about previously. And you're just kind of awed about how that worked. Here, Abdurraqib uses his hoops obsession as a take-off point for everything from biographical details of jail time and being unhoused to violence in his neighborhood to police brutality to ideas of aging, love, religion, racism, class divisions, inequality, and so much more. Also, LeBron. This is several degrees deeper than any sports book you've ever read. It's not even really a sports book, frankly. Basketball is just the bones.

Not a craft book at all -- a point she makes clear at the beginning -- but this was super helpful in thinking about how to frame elements of personal narrative.And then there's this: On a recent writing retreat, we were asked to discuss some of the challenges we thought with our work. I explained that I think the biggest challenge for my project is: Who cares? Why would anyone else want to read about the inside jokes of one middle-upper class white midwestern family. But then 24 pages into Febos's book, I found this line: “Sometimes, while writing this book, a question intruded: who cares? I snapped out of the reverie of my work, struck by a sudden fear that I was wasting my time, indulging subjects that had already been written about.” That was like a smack in the face. People will care. I also really loved this paragraph about how she thinks about successful memoir: “Successful narration of a memoir depends upon the careful interplay of the past I and the present – whether it be explicit or implicit in the text. Self-knowledge, the insights unavailable in the past and acquired in the time since, are what give memoir its depth. It is not experience that qualifies a person to write a memoir, but insight into experience, and the ability to tell a story of the past that contains both dimensions. That is, past experience has been integrated into the larger narrative of the author’s life.” So...if you're writing memoir, this book -- though there is a lot about writing sex scenes and trauma, which may or may not be completely useful -- is fantastic for equal parts advice and simply ways to think differently about how you write....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 21, 2024","Feb 27, 2024","Feb 21, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58393129-body-work

You're connecting to a piece of art on a very deep level, and suddenly, totally independent of the content of that art, you start getting choked up. Like you feel so overwhelmed and awed by what this piece of art is doing that it literally causes you to get emotional. It's sounds dramatic, I know. But it does occasionally happen to me. And it happened to me reading this novel. It's that good. There's not much of a plot, per se. It's about one Iranian American dude's search for meaning. You'll have to trust me it's not boring. Not even a little bit boring. I honestly didn't know you could do with words what Kaveh Akbar does with words here. Rather than a regular , here are 10 thoughts on this truly one-of-a-kind work:1. This is a novel not about the meaning of life, but the meaning of death. Our protagonist Cyrus's mother died in the Iran Air Flight 655 disaster (the US mistook the commercial flight for a war jet and shot it down) in July 1988. Cyrus was a baby when this happened, and doesn't remember his mother, but this has always haunted him. When someone dies before their time, what does it mean? Is the way they died meaningful? Why? How? Cyrus, depressed, a recovering addict, and just floating through his 20s in a small college town in Indiana, wonders if he ""martyrs"" himself (commits suicide), would anything about his death be meaningful since his life to this point has been so devoid of meaning? Is that the only thing stopping him from doing it?2. This is a novel both about the inadequacy and also the power of language. This argument throughout the novel is one of its strengths. Regarding the former, one character says: “A photograph can say ‘This is what it was.’ Language can only say ‘This is what it was like.’” But regarding the latter, another character says, “An alphabet, like a life, is a finite set of shapes. With it, one can produce almost anything.” I'd submit that this novel itself is a testament to the power of language. It's one of the more profound and beautifully written pieces of fiction I've read in a long time!3. This is a novel about addiction. Cyrus is a recovering addict, and now that he's mostly kicked his habit in his late 20s, he's lost his way again. At least booze and drugs gave him direction. Now he's trying to fill that void by writing poetry. And failing. 4. This is a novel about ass-backward American values. We don't value art anymore. We should.5. This is a master class in craft from a structure standpoint. What we think are flashbacks or background info slowly start to gain momentum and then absolutely EXPLODES into the real-time action as crucial facets of the story. To say more would be to spoil. Just trust me -- and trust the writer. He knows what he's doing. 6. Cyrus's uncle Arash has a most unusual role in the Iranian military. During the Iraq-Iran war, he dresses in a dark cloak, holds a flash light to his face, and rides around a battlefield where men are slowly dying. The idea is they seem him as an angel, and they're convinced, then, to be ""martyred"" honorably, rather than committing suicide. This detail is not just significant to the story, it's one of those things you read in a novel that just blows your mind. This blew my mind. 7. Some of my favorite -- and the funniest -- parts of this novel are conversations Akbar gives us between, say, Lisa Simpson and Cyrus's mother, or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Cyrus's younger brother Beethoven (who doesn't actually exist, neither in the real world or the fictional world of the novel). They're dreams Cyrus has, which would normally be kind of annoying. These are not only immensely entertaining set pieces, they also further the themes of the novel. That's to say, they do have a purpose. 8. The blurbs! I basically picked this up because of the blurbs. Lauren Groff, Tommy Orange, Leslie Jamison, JOHN GREEN, and Mary Karr. You get a collection of writers this varied to all offer immense praise on a book, you read that book. 9. One of the reasons I almost DIDN'T pick this up is because I HATE the cover. It's cartoonish, almost like a Monty Python sketch as cover art. There are definitely funny parts to this novel, but this cover design belies the novel's profundity. I hope they'll go back to the drawing board for the paperback.10. Two more fantastic quotes: “At the intersection of Iranian-ness and Midwestern-ness was pathological politeness, an immobilizing compulsivity to avoid causing distress to anyone."" AND “She was Christian but American Christian, the kind that believed Jesus had just needed a bigger gun.”Summary: READ THIS. I read the last 200 pages of this novel in one day. I'm going to have to go back reread it to let it sink in more. But on first reading, just WOW. It's February 5, and I already have my favorite novel of 2024. ...more",Notes are private!,3,5,1,"Feb 02, 2024","Feb 04, 2024","Jan 24, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/139400713-martyr

But weird is par for the course.Far be it from me to buck a trend. The Book Of Love is equal parts strange, irreverent, funny, confusing, and in total, very much Linkian. You'll get some David Mitchell vibes here, maybe some Leigh Bardugo, a little Haruki Murakami, but all Kelly Link. It's not magical realism, per se, and it's not fantasy, and it's not science fiction, but it's some weird mash-up of all three. Here's the story: Three teenagers, Daniel, Mo, and Laura, wake up in the music classroom of their former high school, and are informed by their weird former music teacher Mr. Anabin that they've been dead for a year, but are now back. Sort of. Not to worry, though: Their families think they've been on a music study abroad program in Ireland. Because Mr. Anabin is magic. And so are the other two ""beings"" who join them in coming back from the realm where they'd spent the last year: A guy named Bogomil who can turn himself into a wolf and other animals, and another really odd guy named Bowie.So the three teenagers rejoin their lives and try to figure out what the hell happened. Laura's older sister Susannah, is the other principle character, and she's a little salty she's been left behind for the past year. Daniel and Susannah had been a not-so-discreet couple, but had broken up right before Daniel (and the other two) died -- was this heartbreak part of their death? The big mystery of the novel is just exactly what happened the night all three died. From this reasonably simple premise, the ""rules"" for the world of this novel grow ever more complex. There are alternate realms, a magical missing key that opens doors between realms, a goddess named Malo Mogge, and hundreds-year-old feuds being played out as the three teenagers try to figure out whether they're going to die again soon. It's a lot, and as it gets more complicated, it gets a little tougher to understand and remember everything. I had fun imagining the storyboarding for this novel -- like Link talking to her writer friends, trying to puzzle out a story problem, and them going, ""Well, you could say the key is also a coin or a cup, and maybe Mo's grandmother's romance novel characters can come to life...or you know, whatever."" Every time Link seemingly solves a story problem, though, the solution has ripple effects for the rest of rules of the novel, and so thing just get increasingly complex. Another thing that's really interesting about this novel is its pacing, how Link navigates time. The whole story takes place over just four days. The first 100 pages, in fact, are just a few hours. This takes some skill to do effectively, and Link does. Any time a writer writes a 630-page book, especially one previously known for short stories, complaints about the book being too long are inevitable. While I really enjoyed this, my main criticism isn't that it's too long in principle, it's that it got too long because the rules of the world became so detailed and confusing. There are pages and pages of characters just sitting around talking about how this world works. Simplifying would've, reduced the page count.But simplifying may also have detracted from imaginativeness of the story. It's a fine line, which Link toes throughout. Even though I was confused a lot, it was truly fun to ""watch"" Link puzzle out story problems she'd set for herself with such a detailed world. Also, I loved the characters -- Daniel is kind of just a bone-headed bro, Mo's a sassy queer fellow who doesn't suffer fools, and Laura is the super cool, disaffected teen belonging more in the 1990s than in Gen Z. And then Susannah. Susannah, to me, really becomes the star of the show, even though she isn't one of the three characters who died. She's easily the most interesting character, and changes the most over the course of the novel. She has layers. She contains multitudes.So yeah, 630 pages of Kelly Link is a vastly different reading experience than a 20-page Kelly Link short story. Because of course it is. Is it worth the effort? One hundred percent. It's as imaginative and inventive a novel as you'll find, and it's just a lot of fun to read. ...more",Notes are private!,1,5,1,"Feb 20, 2024","Mar 05, 2024","Sep 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/157981682-the-book-of-love

Two of the three are sympathetic, root-able-for characters, and the third, like his father, is a tool. But they're all interesting, and do lots of interesting things. Then of course, as per the title, there's a new sibling. The Latecomer. And that's when things start to get REALLY dramatic. This is a novel that starts slowly and builds over time (this novel's a SHINING EXAMPLE of why you don't DNF after 50 pages ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 29, 2023","Nov 07, 2023","Aug 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693566-the-latecomer

Does the ""biographical stain"" prevent you a) from continuing to enjoy the art, b) from consuming the art at all? Be careful: These are not moral questions, nor should your answers to them reflect on your own morals or ethics.

I'll write an actual  when this novel's out in September, so for now, here are just a few wayward thoughts.-- Fans of Lauren Groff's FATES AND FURIES (my favorite novel by her) will LOVE this book. Franzen fans will also very much enjoy this. Hill has nearly out-Franzen'ed Franzen, here. -- The novel is about marriage, yes. But it's also about truth vs. certainty. The latter prevents us from seeking the former. This is true for health fads, religion, internet conspiracy theories, and so many other aspects of modern life. WELLNESS is a novel about all ways it's easy to be distracted from searching for things that are true and for settling on things that aren't true because that's easier than doing the difficult intellectual work of truth-seeking. Just wanting things, especially the truth, isn't good enough. You have to try harder than that.-- It's a novel about art and inspiration and meaning. -- It's a novel about family secrets.-- It's a novel about storytelling and legend and myth (all in the most modern sense possible)-- It's a novel about authenticity and genuineness. -- It's a novel about how we make decisions (consciously and unconsciously)-- Yeah, there's a lot going on here. Good thing it's 600+ pages. But it doesn't feel like a long novel.-- This novel is populated with TREMENDOUS characters -- the principles, Elizabeth and Jack, are of course great. But there are heroes and villains of all stripes here. -- This quote: ""And the only thing she was certain of was this: that between ourselves and the world are a million stories, and if we don't know which among them are true, we might as well try out those that are most humane, most generous, most beautiful, most loving.""

Emotional abuse from Imagine finishing third at the vaunted Boston Marathon, and your coach meets you at the finish line and tells you that you suck. Emotional abuse from her trusted coach was just the tip of the iceberg of what Kara Goucher endured as a charter (and first female) member of the Nike Oregon Project. Even if you don't follow running, you've probably heard of Alberto Salazar, the Nike-propped-up and now-disgraced coach. This book is Kara's account of her time with Salazar, and his junk science, odd methods, emotional and mental abuse, sexual harassment and abuse, and, of course, the doping. It was the doping scandal that made headlines and ultimately got Salazar (rightly!) banned, but when you see the whole picture -- including Nike's complicity -- it's just mind-boggling how this ""project"" was allowed to continue for so long. And how there haven't been further consequences. Kara's story makes you so mad that this could happen. Of course it does. But her bravery and courage are inspiring. And not for nothing this is also just an entertaining and motivating read. A good running memoir is one that makes you want to go out and pound out some miles.

What makes this novel truly great, though, is how Halperin addresses different forms of addiction. Substance addiction, sure. But also emotional addiction, addiction to a certain feeling or a certain person that makes you feel that way. This feeling, this person can be just as toxic, just as dangerous as any drug. This book absolutely destroyed me. But I loved it an indecent amount -- it's so good. Soooo good.Leah is a mid-20s woman working on her MFA at the prestigious creative writing graduate program at the University of Wisconsin. On the first page of the novel, she meets Charlie -- a handsome, mysterious, affable fellow. She's smitten, he's smitten. They're smitten.Charlie to his credit reveals very early in the relationship he's a recovering heroin addict. This of course gives Leah -- and her friends in her MFA cohort and her family, including her overprotective older brothers -- great pause. But she loves how he makes her feel -- like the most important, most beautiful, most loved person in the world. Ever since Leah's mother left when she was 13, Leah's developed some deep-seated psychological issues about being loved. So when Charlie DOES love her, she's addicted to how he makes her feel. Despite the red flags, of which they are an increasing number, despite the signs of relapse, and despite even breaking up with him a few times, their connection continues. But at what cost to each of them?I absolutely loved this. I loved it for its fresh take and humanization of addiction -- this isn't Trainspotting, though, we're not watching needles go in arms -- and Charlie isn't your typical junkie. I also loved it for its ""day-in-the-life"" story of an MFA student.Sure, there's a definite Sally Rooney vibe about this book, but if you're a Rooney skeptic, don't let that you stop you. Halperin, dare I say, is a more direct, easier-to-read writer than Rooney is. I actually read this 300-page novel in basically three sittings.

I have the tshirt to prove it (it's a picture of a metal fan and says, yes, I'm a huge metal fan). But for real, I love metal, all metal, always have. And I loved this novel! So this novel about a group of three misfit metalhead teens in late 1980s Florida, then early 1990s California, then Norway (!!!), is the wheel-housiest of wheel house novels.Good thing it's REALLY good. Have you seen the Netflix movie Metal Lords? (If not, stop what you're doing and go watch it.) This is a more extreme version of that movie. And in this novel, things get very, very extreme. You don't need to know much about metal to enjoy this novel -- there's plenty about disaffected youth and friendship and love to keep you interested. And great writing, too. But there are plenty of Easter Eggs for metal fans. If you know about the Norwegian Black Metal band Mayhem, or agree that Ride the Lightning is one of the top 5 albums of all time, or have been dropped on your head more than once in the same mosh pit, this novel is especially for you....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 02, 2023","May 11, 2023","Jan 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62039317-gone-to-the-wolves

She's a little like Nell Zink, but maybe not quite that off-the-wall. This novel is about a woman named Penny who has seemingly hit rock bottom -- she's unemployed, her marriage is over, and she has to help her aging, perhaps senile grandmother, get her affairs in order. This starts with tricking her to leave so that she can remove a gun from her house. She meets her grandmother's accountant Burt, a goofy but affable dude who lives in his office, drives a terrible van he calls The Dog of the North, and is dog-father to a Pomeranian name Kweecoats (a hilarious mispronunciation of Quixote). Many years ago, Penny's parents mysteriously disappeared in Australia, and that hangs over her throughout the novel -- most especially when she travels to Australia with her grandfather to either try to find them, or at least make peace with the fact that they're gone.Though forces beyond her control keep trying to sink Penny, she's somehow able to keep her chin up and keep on keepin' on.

Our neighborhood, Roscoe Village, on the north side of Chicago, is made up mostly of million-dollar homes inhabited by wealthy families. When we bought our modest condo here, our real estate agent called our neighborhood ""the suburbs."" The tagline on bridges and in the newsletter for our neighborhood is ""the village within the city."" That's all to say, it's a pretty pleasant place. Over drinks, our friend absolutely dished the dirt on ""the real housewives of Roscoe Village."" ""You wouldn't believe the things I know,"" he told us, smirking. He named no names, but told tales of adultery, scandal, and much worse. Ensconced in our apparently naive and sheltered bubble, we were shocked at first. The next day, we couldn't help looking at the parents watching their kids in the park with a little more suspicion. But then as we thought more about it, none of this was that surprising, honestly. People with more money than good sense and who have experienced few consequences in their lives get up to a lot of ""adventures."" (I know that sounds judgmental.) It just hit differently that this wasn't some Netflix special or a romance novel. It was our neighbors! Anyhow, all this was in the back of my mind as I devoured Lindsay Hunter's spicy new novel, Hot Springs Drive, about an affair between two neighbors in a leafy suburb. The affair leads to a murder, but not of either of the two parties involved in the affair! (not a spoiler, we know about the murder in the first few pages)So we spend the first half of the novel getting to know these characters -- two completely normal suburban families. The two mothers become fast friends as they join a weight-loss club, complain about their ineffectual husbands, and prop each other up. But that doesn't stop one of the women from sleeping with the other's husband. Which is what leads to the murder. Then in the second half, after the murderer is revealed, Hunter explores the effect of this trauma on the two families involved. How does each person process this trauma, and move on (or not)? How does it affect them long-term in future relationships?Both of the men turn tail and run, and all but disappear from the story, which is fine. They're both standard-issue boring husband characters anyway (one is even a used car salesmen, almost putting too fine a point on it). The kids in both families scatter as well. While most of the characters are content to let the past stay the past, two of the characters, the daughter of the murdered woman and one of the sons next door, are as haunted by their deep first love as they are by the murder. Will a romance be rekindled?If you've read Hunter before, you'll likely agree that this novel feels like a huge step forward for her -- a writer coming into her own. But if you haven't read Hunter before, this is a terrific introduction. It's a deceptively complex novel with a ton going on beneath the surface of the plot. There are hints of Oedipus, comments on our obsession with true crime, staunch feminism (it's Hunter published on Roxane Gay's new imprint, so this makes sense), motherhood, and the various ways we deal with trauma, both healthy and not. Hunter's writing here is sharp and sultry.

And a racist doctor who marches openly with the Ku Klux Klan. And some a shady gangster from Philly. And so much more.

Here's a quick syllogism to summarize The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida, the 2022 Booker Prize winner: War is hell. Humans create war. Therefore, humans are hell. Maali Almeida, a Sri Lankan photographer who takes pictures of atrocities committed during the Sri Lankan civil war, wakes up dead. He doesn't know how or why he died, but he comes to understand he's stuck in the In Between, has seven moons to get his affairs back on Earth in order, and move to The Light. His affairs include some spicy photographs that expose some corruption on all sides of the horrific war. He's hidden the negatives and has to find a way to communicate to his former boyfriend DD and best friend Jaki so that they can publish the photos and expose the bad actors who are basically using the horrors of war for personal benefit. (I think -- frankly, this book was a little hard to follow at times, but that's the gist.)But that short description belies the originality of this novel. Would you believe this novel's also hilarious? Maali is a goofy, irreverent knockabout, even in the afterlife. He spent most of his time alive fooling around with as many dudes as he could, drinking and gambling his meager earnings away, and generally not caring about much except his own self. Now that he's arrived in the afterlife, will he learn a lesson? Can he still do some good? This novel is an amazing feat of art -- the funniest war novel I've ever read since Catch-22. But it's also furious and profound about the absurdity of war and how terrible humans can be. ""Do animals get an afterlife?"" Karunatilaka writes. ""Or is their punishment to be reborn as humans?"" Near the end of the novel, title character Maali has a conversation with a leopard who wants to be human. The leopard says: ""I can't understand why humans destroy when they can create.

""But such dry and inconvenient facts were of no consequence here, in this ocean of feeling.""Leave it to a writer of Zadie's caliber to write a novel about authenticity and truth titled The Fraud. Her meticulously researched fiction is based on real events and real people. A commoner tries to claim he's a rich guy who died in a shipwreck, and assume his fortune. This happened in 1873, and so a major theme of the novel is how history repeats itself and is reflected horrifyingly similarly in our present day in the form of the former president who is the biggest fraud of them all. In Zadie's novel the Claimant is able to marshal public opinion with half-truths, flat-out lies, and appeal to absurdity. And the more ridiculous the case gets, and the more lies he tells, and the more his story is antithetical to truth, logic, and basic common sense, the more support he gets from people who don't care about facts or truth or logic or basic common sense, they just want to stick it to the ""elites."" One example: The dead rich guy whose identity the Claimant is trying to steal was highly educated and knew several foreign languages. The Claimant doesn't really know much of anything, and the prosecutor embarrasses him with a cross-examination asking him basic question he can't answer. (Reminded me of the time someone asked Trump his favorite Bible verse, and dude hilariously whiffed.) But his supporters explain the inconvenient truth of the Claimant's ignorance away by explaining that of course he wouldn't flaunt his education, because then it would be too obvious he was trying too hard. Like, how do you combat that? Haha. The story is actually told from the perspective of one Eliza Touchet, a middle-aged woman, who is the cousin by marriage, housekeeper, and former lover of a novelist named William Ainsworth. So along the way we have plenty of commentary (and appearances by Charles Dickens, William Thackeray, and others) about creation and art and fiction -- novelists lie in order to bring forth true, Zadie tells us. I loved these parts too: The art of fiction juxtaposed with the art of purposeful and harmful lies.This is a long novel. There are more than a few digressions and what seem like threads of story just blowing in the wind. And the story is told in really short 1-3 page chapters, which sort of belies the intricateness of the story. When we're on a strand of story that is less interesting, it's easy to put the book down and get distracted at a chapter break. And we're constantly jumping back and forth in time. In fact for about the first 100 pages, you're a little disoriented about who is who and their relationships in the past and now.This Fraud is best when it's discussing the trials of the claimant and drawing parallels to our current moment. Normally, I'd read Zadie for as many pages as she cares to publish, but I felt like this one carried some stuff that might have been better served on the cutting room floor. Still, again, it's Zadie. I laughed. I was wowed by her cleverness and wit. And I was frequently awed. If you're a fan of hers, you'll probably dig this too. If you're not, you may find it a little bit of a chore....more",Notes are private!,2,4,1,"Aug 07, 2023","Aug 18, 2023","Jan 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/66086834-the-fraud

It makes everything okay. Some writers, for whatever reason (probably because they're very, very good) you just connect with. Patchett is one of those writers for me.So when Ann Patchett, a consummate storyteller, tells a story about story being told, you know it's going to be good. And it is. Very good.Lara, ensconced on her and her husband Joe's cherry farm in Michigan during the summer of 2020, tells the story to her three 20s-something daughters about the summer she dated a famous movie star (before he was famous). As she and her daughters pick cherries (no help this summer because of the pandemic, and Lara is secretly delighted to have this time with her daughters, despite the circumstances), she tells the story about Tom Lake, a theater company where she and Peter Duke starred in Our Town....and also had a torrid summer affair. I loved how tightly spun both threads of this story are -- the real-time action of Lara telling the story to her daughters, dealing with pandemic trauma, and running a farm by themselves, and then also her version of events with some careful selective editing. Frankly, this will probably go down as one of Patchett's second-tier novels when all is said and done, but at the risk of using a cliche, a second-tier Patchett novel is better than a first-tier novel from many other writers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 14, 2023","Jul 17, 2023","Dec 29, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63241104-tom-lake

But his memory casts quite a shadow over the people who remain -- police chief Raymer, Sully's trusty companion Rub Squeers, Sully's son Peter, and even local has-been Carl Roebuck. Do you have to have read Nobody's Fool and Everybody's Fool to read Somebody's Fool? Yep. Yep you do. Russo takes great pains (almost too great) in the first 150 pages or so to remind us what these characters have been up to, but if you haven't even been introduced to Sully, you'll be lost.In addition to catching up with all our favorite characters (Sully notably excepted), Russo also revisits his favorite themes: Progress vs tradition and fate vs free will. In this novel, North Bath is about to cease to exist, having been absorbed by its wealthier, more cosmopolitan neighbor Schuyler Springs, and the characters wonder if anything they've ever done in their lives will matter. Will they be remembered (like they all remember Sully)? Should they just give up and leave? But Russo also introduces a new theme here: It's never too late to start over. Make your choices. Find your happiness!If you are a Russo fan, you'll love this too. He's a bit more introspective than usual in this novel, but you know me, I'd read Russo's grocery list. If this is the last North Bath novel, it's a fitting end -- some threads are tied up, other questions are left open. Just like life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 30, 2023","Aug 13, 2023","Nov 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62952125-somebody-s-fool

Yes, while The Deluge is anxiety-inducing, it's one of the best reading experiences I've had in a long time. It's nothing short of a masterpiece -- and I don't just mean that because it IS 900 pages. I would've gladly read 900 more. If I had infinite time, a plethora of patience, was a 98-fold better writer, and could trust myself not to descend into a pit of despair and rage, this is the novel I'd love to write.The Deluge starts at present times and spends its considerable bulk moving 20 years into the future to examine the social, political, and cultural effects of the greatest threat humanity has even known: climate change.Markley tells this story through the shifting perspectives of several different characters, though none is more fascinating than activist Kate Morris -- who is sort of a mix of Greta Thunberg and Megan Fox. Kate starts an organization called A Fierce Blue Fire, which I only mention that because I LOVE that name. But also, there's an enraged and un-PC scientist who is furious with everyone for not recognizing the severity of the threat, an eco-terrorist, an ad executive, a genius coder, an opioid addict living in rural Ohio, scores of politicians, rock stars, activists, and regular folks. The thrall of this novel is how real this invented future feels. From wacky religious politicians who somehow string a huge swath of followers along to industry interests continuing to maintain outsized influence on legislation to so many people just putting their heads in the sand and deciding climate change isn't even real, Markley is really adept at framing the problem. The problem itself is manmade, but the barriers to fixing the problem are self-inflicted as well.And then there are the storms. Wild fires, hurricanes, earthquakes become more prevalent and destructive as the climate crisis worsens. Again, all this feels so real, I felt myself needing to google ""Los Angeles fire of 2031"" or ""Hurricane Kate destruction,"" etc.It's only February but I can confidently say this will be on my best of 2023 list.

It's dumb, I know. But I amuse myself thinking how annoyed this rich person must be to have to wait an extra four seconds for a plebian to walk in front of them. (About half the time, they don't even notice because they're staring at their phone.)Anyway, all that is to say I have tough time empathizing with rich people. But that's the task Jenny Jackson has set for her readers in her debut novel, Pineapple Street. She presents us with the Stockton family, an old-money group of Brooklynites who are facing down the modern world in which being a millionaire maybe isn't as cool as it used to be. The story's told from the alternating perspectives of members of the family. Darley is the oldest daughter, and married to Malcolm. Darley has disavowed her trust because her husband refused to sign a prenup. So she's married for love but still lives a comfortable life due to her husband's hard work and success. Youngest daughter Georgiana is 26 and works for a non-profit that helps bring healthcare to developing countries. Between tennis with her mother and partying in Red Hook, she doesn't have too many problems -- except for the ones she begins to create for herself. And only son Cord (their names! lol) is married to Sasha, a woman from a middle-class family in Rhode Island who has never really warmed to the Stockton's blue-bloodedness (and that feeling is reciprocal!). Cord and Sasha have moved into the family's mansion on Pineapple Street at the behest of their parents, and this is just the beginning of some of the family strife. This is a sugary afternoon snack of a novel, not at all dissimilar from paging through US Weekly. Yes, rich people: They're just like us. Or so Jenny Jackson would like to have you believe. Whether or not you get along with this novel will depend on if you're convinced enough that this clan of rich people are truly different. Do they learn lessons that make you believe they'll truly do right? Does this crop of literary wealthy people who did nothing to earn their wealth, earn your literary sympathy? Do they do enough to try to be good people? I wasn't so sure. But I still enjoyed reading.

It's a novel about family and striving and choices, and whether or not anyone is able to escape their fate, their history, their family's past. Mitt Romney famously said that if someone really wants to go to college, all he has to do is ""borrow money from his parents."" For Aleks Fa, who wasn't born on third base thinking he hit a triple, that's not an option. Aleks, a 20-year-old southsider navigating life in a Polish neighborhood with an absent father and a sick mother, is the only thing keeping the rest of his family together - getting his three-year-old niece Jazzy to preschool, looking after his 13-year-old brother Daniel who is having some trouble, and taking his older sister, Isobel, a former music prodigy and math genius, to chemo. It's a lot. It's 2008 and the Great Recession is just starting. But to this family that barely scrapes by -- and only then by all helping each other -- the financial collapse barely registers. That's just how the world works, to them. People are poor. They struggle. Money is barely a real thing. So for a family like this, and an extremely likable and root-for-able character like Aleks, is there even a path out of poverty? What if hard work simply is never enough?Meno gets this just right -- it's a story that feels real and immediate. And there are moments of pure levity -- especially in the relationships between Aleks and Isobel -- two siblings who spend as much time at each others throats as they do genuinely caring for each other.I really loved this book. I love Meno's insightful writing and how he portrays Chicago. It really has that Chicago gritty feel.

This thrilling literary mystery centers on our disturbing obsession with crime (especially against women) as entertainment. Why are we so fascinated with violence? Does our fascination with violence interfere with real justice when a crime becomes part of the public consciousness?Heady questions, for sure, and Makkai isn't done there. This novel also looks at the power (for both good and bad) of social media, how we remember the our individual histories, and what we can really do to right past wrongs. Yes, there's a lot going on here. But at 450 pages, there's plenty of room here to handle it all. The novel is about Bodie Kane, an early 40s podcaster and film professor who returns to her elite New England boarding school to teach a class. She becomes obsessed all over again with the murder -- a supposedly solved murder -- of one of her classmates when she was still in school back in the mid 1990s.Even though the murderer was quickly apprehended, tried, and convicted, it's a case that has never really died. Internet sleuths have poured and re-poured over all evidence (real and imagined) and unleashed multiple theories ranging from crackpot conspiracy to ""hmm, that may actually make some sense."" As she returns to the haunts of her youth, Bodie begins to believe something may not quite be right about that supposedly open-and-shut case, as well. Was justice miscarried for reasons of convenience? Is there more to this story?Though it's almost too easy, comparisons to Donna Tartt's The Secret History are inevitable -- but that's a good thing, because this novel proudly stands on its shoulders as a terrific entry in the ""slow-burn boarding school murder mystery"" genre. Like good fiction should be, this novel is terrifically entertaining, but also may leave you with some uncomfortable questions for yourself....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 11, 2022","Nov 19, 2022","Aug 24, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61053833-i-have-some-questions-for-you

It's a mostly enjoyable, really quick read, but it's got some issues. First, and I knew this going in and picked it up anyway, but it's just hard to get past the fact that you have to suspend disbelief to accept the central premise of the novel. A former champion tennis player retires due to injury, doesn't play for five years through her mid-30s, trains for two months, and then can compete at a world-class level again at age 37? Call me cynical, but that's...just not possible. And also...the dialogue. It's so bad, it's distracting. Eye-rollingly bad. Cringe-worthy. That was actually harder to look past. Still...there's a lot to like about this book. I'm a huge tennis fan (and former avid player), and this read like a Matt Christopher novel (maybe a dated reference) for adults. Kudos to Reid for getting a lot about the tennis right. She clearly did her research.And Carrie is a signature TJR protagonist, a fierce tough woman with zero f%^&ks to give. The novel has a lot of smart things to say about how we view professional athletes, especially women, and the higher and massively unfair standards professional women athletes are held to.So I don't know, it's a mixed bag. I wonder how many general-interest-non-tennis-fan readers will like this. It's unashamedly inside-baseball on the tennis, talking slices and groundstrokes, kick serves and eastern grips, and Reid spends a lot of time narrating points, matches, tournaments. I loved these parts, but you may not. And you can't help but love Carrie, and watching her evolve.

You're a very good writer. You KNOW you're a very First appeared at https://www.thenewdorkofbooks.c...I have some questions for you, Mr. Levin. You're a very good writer. You KNOW you're a very good writer. You're also a very self-aware writer. So when you're as good a writer as you are, and you fully understand what you're doing and its effect on your reader as well as you do, why do you insist on aggravating your reader just to the point where he wants to throw your novel across the goddamn room? Why? Why why why why why? Is it because it helps the other 90 percent of the novel, which is truly a marvel, stand out in even more stark relief? Is it because you're just a prankster? Do you just like keeping your readers on their toes, making sure they're paying attention? Or is it because you truly like to inflict a small measure of pain on people?It doesn't matter. I'll still read every damn word you ever write if the remaining words you write in your career are even one-third as f#%king incredible as the good 90 percent of Mount Chicago. To my readers, most of whom I've probably already lost: Mount Chicago is one of the funniest novels I've ever read. That's the first time I've ever bolded a sentence in a . Because that's really the one thing you need to know about this book. And when you consider it's sort of kind of tangentially about a massive tragedy that kills thousands of people, that's a pretty neat trick. And that's not the only trick. There's no line between author and novel here. As the kids say, so meta. Except maybe there is a line? Who knows? I'm not smart enough to try to figure that out. And I don't think Adam Levin wants you try. To describe it further, and I fully realize this is an absolutely ridiculous analogy, and I have no doubt Adam Levin would hate this, but this is my small measure of payback for making me read pages and pages about behavioral psychology and parrots and that really, really long duck (yes, duck) joke: Mount Chicago is what would happen if Kurt Vonnegut on speed, a baked and giggly Philip Roth (can you imagine?!), and David Foster Wallace on...well, no, just normal DFW...had a book baby. I can't find the passage or the interview now, and maybe I'm imagining this but, I think DFW said something really smart once about reader aggravation: That a good novel must have parts that aggravate the reader, but a good novelist knows just the right amount to antagonize his reader before he can pull back just in time, and entertain again. And so if you think about it, this novel's 575 pages, so 90 percent (again, my approximation for the non-purposefully-aggravating parts) of 575 is 517.5 INCREDIBLE pages. I like those odds. You probably skim over - whether on purpose or because you drift - 10 percent of every novel you read anyway, right?!All right, so anyway: I loved this book. Absolutely loved it. You don't need to know what it's about, you can read that anywhere. But whatever you read that it's about, it's actually about Entourage (the HBO show) and metafiction and Chicago politics and psychology and cryptocurrency and other get-rich-quick-scams and the author's face and stand-up comedy and writing and depression and tragedy and love and coming-of-age and parrots.

But Cassie's got some secrets in her past as well, and as she connects with Lore, their two stories twine and diverge, as their trust of each other waxes and wanes.

That's to say, Nell Zink is a bit of an acquired taste, tbh. But if you love her, you unabashedly love her. Her books are quirky, odd, irreverent, funny, and really really smart.This novel's about a teenaged girl named Bran who escapes a cult-like farm situation after both her parents abandon her, and gets mixed up with a pretentious over-read UCLA student named Peter. The story is about searching for utopia, or using art to search for utopia, or art defining what utopia is (or what utopia is not), or to define fascism, or to define fascistic art...or maybe it's just good ole fashion teenage sex comedy. I don't really know, but I enjoyed the hell out of this - it's basically a one-day read, and it's often very, very funny.Here's Nell Zink describing Bran's friend Jay, who is a training to be a dancer, but is really awful at dancing (he's being trained by a blind instructor, so it's not all his fault): ""Imagine a pedophile who is a serial killer of puppies on the side but wiling to spare a few in exchange for sex with Jay. Jay hears the offer while directing traffic. The threat casts him backwards like a gust of wind, face twitching with emotion, heels pounding the rhythm of a temper tantrum as he bargains with fate. Circling seductively, he conveys vulnerability, weakness, and the unmistakable message 'Let me evacuate my bowels first.'"" So.

What's most terrifying -- and what makes this such an engaging read -- is that it's not at all hard to imagine this dystopian version of America becoming reality very soon. Ng's dystopian America, she tells us at the end, is based on real events -- violence against Asian Americans, freedoms curtailed in the name of ""patriotism,"" even children being ripped away from their families. But there is cause for hope here: In this novel, librarians are heroes of the resistance. Stories and poetry and art still matter. And even as dire as things are, a small and dedicated group is still invested in fighting fascism, racism, and injustice. The story is about a 12-year-old boy named Bird. Bird's mother, a poet, has disappeared and Bird and his father, who works at a university library, have no clue what's happened to her. What we do know is that Bird's mother had published a poem that became, though it was not intended this way, a symbol of the resistance against a law known as PACT -- or Preserving American Cultures and Traditions. PACT was enacted after a years-long event known as the Crisis, which galvanized and basically codified burgeoning fascist, authoritarian, and horribly racist tendencies in America. Sound familiar? Bird begins finding some clues about his mother's whereabouts, and endeavors to find out what happened to her. And that's the meet of the novel: Will he find her? And will he discover why she disappeared?I love Celeste Ng, and this is another terrific novel from her -- her first foray into what could be considered ""speculative fiction."" It's so beautifully written. And Ng truly understand compassion, family dynamics, loyalty, and heartbreak. She is absolutely a joy to read, even when this novel itself isn't exactly cheerful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Oct 04, 2022","Oct 12, 2022","Apr 19, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60149573-our-missing-hearts

As much as history has repeated itself in the last several years, it's often hard to believe that people are really good at heart. And that question is the central through-line for this astonishingly good read.The first half of this novel is about a group of high school kids in the early 1980s in Evanston putting on a play about Anne Frank. And then we switch to 34 years later, it's 2016, the Mango Mussolini has just been elected, and we catch up with all these characters again to see how so much of what they experienced in high school informed their adult lives. This ingenious structure lets Langer explore the idea of history repeating itself, both for all these characters (how did the trauma some of them experience so long ago inform their modern lives? And why are these still important?) and also for the world at large. Langer draws parallels between Anne Frank in 1942 and immigrants in America in 2017 being hunted down and deported. Think just being aware of history means it can't repeat itself? Think again.But so are people basically good? This novel doesn't give easy answers.

Her neFirst appeared at https://www.thenewdorkofbooks.c...Intricate, but accessible: That is how I think about Emily St. John Mandel's stories. Her new novel, Sea of Tranquility, is that and then some. In fact, it's freaking brilliant.Sea of Tranquility is the third novel in the Station Eleven-The Glass House universe. I hesitate to say ""trilogy,"" because god-willing, there'll be more. And besides, the stories themselves are only tangentially connected. That's to say, you don't need to have read the other two to enjoy Sea of Tranquility (though of course having done so will provide some important context and enrich your reading experience. This fantastic New Yorker piece profiling St. John Mandel tells you all you need to know about how the three novels are related).Of the three, Sea of Tranquility is the most straight-up speculative fiction: The thrust of the plot of the novel is a character traveling back in time to try to figure whether there's a ""glitch in the matrix."" So the main question the novel asks is this: Are we living in a simulation? And if so, what would cause several different characters over the course of several centuries to experience the same anomalous event? Structure-wise, Mandel is up to her usual tricks — she jumps all over the place in time and geography to follow the stories of several fascinating characters: A British fellow traveling to Canada, an author (who very much resembles the author of this book) of a pandemic novel on a book tour, a NYC woman who had been friends with Vincent (from The Glass Hotel), and a down-on-his-luck time traveler who lives on the moon. But as always, despite the leaps, it's not hard to follow. This won't be the only time you'll hear this comparison, but there's definitely a Cloud Atlas vibe to this novel.Mandel uses all these literary fireworks as her vehicle to ask a very simple question with a very difficult answer: What is real? If we're living in simulation, do we need the so-called red pill to awaken to what's real, or, does it matter — as a character comments, ""a life lived in a simulation is still a life.""I loved this book. Emily St. John Mandel's superpower is packing an enormous amount of plot and theme into a paucity of pages. Though this has all the elements of the best science fiction, you won't confuse this with Neal Stephenson or Philip K. Dick. St. John Mandel is a much more nimble, much less verbose writer. And her novels are the better for it. This is easily a favorite of the year so far. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Mar 27, 2022","Mar 31, 2022","Mar 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility

The Cubs won their first World Series in 108 years...and then six days later, there was an election, and I don't remember the rest, but I think it was really bad.These are the backdrop events for Jennifer Close's fantastic new novel, Marrying the Ketchups. Sullivan family patriarch Bud has dropped dead of a heart attack. In his wake, he's left an institution Oak Park restaurant and a devastated family. A life-long Cubs fan, poor Bud checked out just before that rainy November night in Cleveland when the Cubs lifted a century-old curse, and that fact alone is all the more devastating to his family.The restaurant Bud started in the early 1970s is still the cornerstone of all the Sullivans' lives, even as their lives have diverged away from the friendly confines and outdated decor of Sullivan's. After Bud's death, the novel tells the story of the Sullivan family from the perspective of three characters. Gretchen is mid-30s, living in New York City and fronting a popular 90s cover band. When her boyfriend, also the band's guitarist, cheats on her, she dissolves the band and moves back to Chicago to live above the restaurant. Her older sister Jane lives a bougie Lake Forest life with her rich husband (who she suspects is cheating on her) and her two kids. And then Gretchen and Jane's cousin Teddy, the restaurant's floor manager, gets dumped by his boyfriend, only to begin an affair with him after he's engaged to another guy. So yeah, all their lives a little bit of a mess. But they take comfort in each other, in between shouting matches and disagreements. Just your normal family...The meat of the novel is each of these characters evaluating their romantic relationships, their relationships to each other, and crucially, their relationship to the restaurant, the symbol of the ties that bind their family together. If you were a fan of Claire Lombardo's The Most Fun We Ever Had, you'll love this book. I absolutely did — a definite favorite of the year so far. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Apr 03, 2022","Apr 09, 2022","Mar 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58537243-marrying-the-ketchups

Yes, his time in Nirvana and his relationship with Kurt Cobain is in there, but it's not the focus. Rather, the focus is just how much Dave Grohl loves music. My favorite parts of the book are when he is assuring us how gobstopped he is to meet his musical idols, from Iggy Pop to Little Richard to AC/DC, even after he himself has achieved no small measure of fame. It's immensely relatable! Here's the thing about this book: If you didn’t know much at all about Dave Grohl, you’d probably read his book as, at best corny and at worst just god-awfully sappy. But instead, because it is Dave Grohl, and because we know music is quite literally his life and that he just seems like an affable, genuine dude, it's pretty easy to love this book. After all, it’s extremely difficult to be cynical about the writer of a book who himself seems to be the antithesis of cynical.And the man sure can a tell a story! Grohl tells us he definitely wrote this book himself (no ghostwriter!). He explains that when everything shut down in March 2020, he nearly lost his mind because he missed the connections with people. And so he needed something to occupy his time while he couldn't play music. And I believe it! Some of the writing here is just so goofy and earnest, it couldn't have been written by anyone else but Grohl. Here, let me show you:""I walk through this crazy life of a musician like a little boy in a museum surrounded by the exhibits I've spent a lifetime studying. And when I finally come face-to-face with someone who has inspired me along the way, I am thankful. I am grateful. And take none of it for granted. I am a firm believer in the shared humanity of music...I believe that people are inspired by people. That is why I feel the need to connect with my fans when they approach me. I'm a fan too.""I’ve seen Foo Fighters live twice, and both times they absolutely rocked the joint (the joint, in both cases, was the venerable Wrigley Field). One of those times was during the now-infamous “throne” tour in 2015 — Grohl was confined to a ridiculous throne he designed himself while on pain meds after he broke his leg falling off a stage in Sweden. Still rocked. He talks about this Wrigley show in the Conclusion of this book, and discusses how playing a show at a stadium across the street from where he saw his first ever show (Naked Raygun at Cubbie Bear in 1982) had brought his illustrious career full circle. I like Foo Fighters' music well enough, but I would never try to make an argument that they're in the top-tier of rock bands. Still, they're just a really good time. And that's the draw to see them live — or, as my friends are probably tired of hearing me say, I wish I loved anything as much as Dave Grohl loves playing music.I greatly, greatly enjoyed this book. I mean, there's no way I wouldn't. And it's not just me: Literally every reader I've talked to who's read this has loved it too. You will not be disappointed! Remember: It's times like these we learn to live again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 21, 2022","Mar 03, 2022","Feb 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57648017-the-storyteller

But Kim Stanley Robinson's novel The Ministry for the Future actually is. Which is ironic given that the novel begins with a heat wave in India that kills 20 million people in one fell swoop. (If you're unfamiliar, ""cli-fi"" is shorthand for climate fiction, a new-ish genre whose popularity is growing in direct proportion to the worsening climate crisis.)Imagine if death on that scale happened in the real world. How would we react? Would we finally change? That's where we start in this novel about what it'll take to stop climate change and, essentially, continue living on this planet. Our main character, as much as there is one, is a woman named Mary who has been tapped to lead the newly developed Ministry for the Future, headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. It's 20-30 years in the future (from our present day) and this organization has been created by the signees of the Paris Climate Agreement to literally save the world. One of the very few people who survived the Indian heat wave, an American named Frank who had been there working for a relief organization, then seeks out Mary and to tell her his story and advocate for fast and far-reaching change. The two form an unlikely bond. But this plot is almost secondary to Robinson taking us through a litany of vignettes all over the world describing how people are experiencing the climate crisis (climate refugees, animal extinction, a flood in Los Angeles, and so many more). These set pieces show us the magnitude of the problem and how difficult the Ministry for the Future's task is. But through a combination of changes to the global banking system, some creative geoengineering, reforestation and re-wilding natural habitats, and even some rather nefarious tactics it'd be easy to label as eco-terrorism, change begins to happen. Robinson spares no detail in the explanations of these solutions, and it's mostly pretty interesting. But there are times it's a little dry, frankly — Robinson takes us deep into the weeds of global finance and economic theory. Also, there are (to me) pretty interminable descriptions of hiking expeditions in the Alps. And some of the little sections, like two told from the points of view of a photon and History, just feel a little off. But overall, it's a sobering, but illuminating and hopeful, view of what will need to happen to ensure we actually do have a future. In the real world, will we have the resolve to make these changes before it's too late?...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 09, 2022","Feb 27, 2022","Feb 09, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55643271-the-ministry-for-the-future

But honestly, I put it off for a long time, and approached reading The Night Watchman like homework — something I felt like I should do, rather than something I really wanted to do. Erdrich quickly changed my mind. I was surprised how drawn I became to this book after only a few pages. Poetic and powerful, this is a fictional account of Erdrich's grandfather who fought to prevent the ""termination"" of North Dakota's Turtle Mountain Chippewas in 1952-53. A bill in Congress by a racist Mormon Senator sought to relocate them from their reservation and ""reintegrate"" or ""assimilate"" them into American society. ""This new bill is about the worst thing for Indians to come down the pike,"" Erdrich's grandfather wrote in a letter, reproduced in the novel.The novel is also the story of Patrice, a young woman who works at a factory on the reservation. Her story is about colliding with a changing world, looking for better opportunities, but still being comfortable with her heritage. Early in the story, Patrice has to travel to the Twin Cities to search for her sister Vera, who has disappeared. It's the first time Patrice has ever travelled, and been in a city, and it's eye-opening to her, but not necessarily in a good way.For historical fiction, this is a surprisingly fluid, fast read. And I learned much. Very glad I read it.Impressive side note: Erdrich is one of a handful of writers (I think just Philip Roth and John Updike are the other two, but I can't find a good source to confirm this) to win the hat-trick of major literary awards: Pulitzer (for this novel), the National Book Critics Circle Award (for LaRose), and the National Book Award (for The Round House).

That's because Lee Cole's debut novel Groundskeeping is an absolute wheelhouse book for me, so there's almost no chance I wasn't going to love it. And love it, I did! It's a campus novel. It's a love story. It's an examination of class and politics. It's a look at how writers are inspired to write what they write. And it's all narrated by a guy from a small conservative rural town trying to punch his way up in the world. Yeah, there's a lot going on here, but it works. Cole is a deeply astute writer and all these ingredients of story combine to create a richly satisfying dish. The story is this: Owen is 28 and drifting. He lives in this rural Kentucky town with his grandfather and Uncle Cort and works as a groundskeeper at the local small college. Still with aspirations of being a writer after crashing and drifting a bit, the job allows him to take an English class, a first step to getting his life back on track. Then, he meets Alma, 26, an already medium-successful poet and novelist who is a writer-in-residence for the year at the college. Sparks fly! But Alma's background -- her parents emigrated from Bosnia to escape the war when she young, she's a Muslim though non-practicing, and she attended Princeton -- is very different from Owen's. Owen's parents, though he's mildly estranged from both (hence why he's living with his grandfather) are both divorced and remarried, both evangelical Christians, and very conservative. Alma's parents, immigrants, doctors, well-educated, are...not those things. They're two families, both alike in dignity, but both skeptical of their children's choice of partner.The story is set in 2016 and all around Owen's and Alma's rural Kentucky town, Trump is ascendent. Though Owen and Alma are both appalled by this development, their different backgrounds create its own tension. Owen has a mild inferiority complex, always wondering if Alma looks down on him, and bristles when she ask him about things like his past drug use, etc. Even in (or especially in?) this day and age, can two people from such different origins make it work? As I read, I felt about this book about how I feel about all books I'm connecting with. I didn't want it to end. In fact. let's let Cole himself explain what this is like (in the context of Owen meeting Alma for the first time): “I felt the competing desires, as I often did when meeting someone new, to know everything at once and to save it all for later. It was like the feeling one has reading a good book, the sensation of being propelled toward the end and at the same time wishing to linger.”That's not a particularly original sentiment, I realize. But just the way Cole writes these sentences illustrates that point so clearly and deftly. It's a good representation of his style, his perceptiveness, and why I loved reading this. This novel first arrived on my radar when I noticed blurbs from both Ann Patchett and Richard Russo, two of my all-time favorite writers. So naturally I was going to check it out. If you are one of the many people, like me, who was disappointed by the latest Sally Rooney novel, try this one instead. The feel is similar, but this is so much better. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 09, 2022","Mar 19, 2022","Jan 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58395053-groundskeeping

This book is just full of surprises, which is somewhat ironic given that it's about a wedding planner for the rich in NYC, to whom surprises are anathema. It's a novel that starts out like a frothy story about trying to fit in with NYC's upper crust. But as we learn more about Olga, her Congressman older brother Prieto, and their mother, the novels shifts in tone and takes on a much more political, and frankly, flat-out furious, tone. It becomes a novel about gentrification, class and race, the injustices wrought upon Puerto Rico (Olga and her brother are second-generation Puerto Ricans), neo-colonialism, corruption, and the failures of leadership. That's a pretty heavy shift from a light-hearted rom-com. But it truly works. And it's amazingly well done. Think about it in terms of napkins. The novel begins with Olga planning a wedding and explaining how every mother-of-the-bride has one detail Olga knows will be the bane of her existence during the wedding planning process. For this particular wedding, it's the napkins. But as you continue to progress through the book (and progress quickly, you will!), when you think about the napkins anecdote, it's a perfect symbol of the absurdity of what matters to the wealthy that doesn't really matter and at all, and it's a perfect juxtaposition to everything else in the novel that's so much more important. Here's a little on the plot: It's the summer of 2017, and we're all starting to figure out that the new ""president"" is going to be even worse than we could've possible imagined. But this is all in the background for the time being as Olga, born and raised in the Latinx-majority Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, hob-nobs with the rich and famous, sleeps with rich married men, appears on television shows to talk about weddings, and builds her wedding-planning brand. Her older brother Prieto is the Congressman for their district, and though the two siblings are close, we soon learn Prieto harbors some serious secrets. And there's one more twist before things really start to heat up: Their mother, a political radical and advocate for Puerto Rican independence, had left the family when they were kids. Not long after, their father falls apart, becomes addicted to drugs, and dies of AIDS. Their mother has been in contact with them throughout their lives through a series of letters. Somehow, she always knows what's going on in their lives: And she's very disappointed in Olga's career choice. So late in that summer of 2017, Hurricane Irma hits in the Caribbean, knocking out power to most of Puerto Rico. But if you remember, this was just the dress rehearsal for Hurricane Maria, which hit two weeks later, and absolutely devastated the island. The island got almost no help from the federal government to prepare or in the immediate aftermath. It was in many ways worse than Hurricane Katrina. (You may remember that video of the ""president"" chucking rolls of paper tolls into a crowd of people, people who had no food or clean water.)Hurricane Maria becomes the fulcrum point for the novel. It's also a major turning point for both Prieto and Olga. Everything changes for them. For the better? Worse? What lessons do these characters learn? What happens with their mother?I read this novel — it's just shy of 400 pages — in three days. I could not put it down. It's absolutely riveting, incredibly well-written, smart, and at times really funny. It's one of those novels that comes along only a couple times a year that really reminds me how much I love reading. I can't recommend it more highly....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 16, 2022","Jan 18, 2022","Jan 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693171-olga-dies-dreaming

It's her superpower, and she brings it to bear clearly in her new essay collection, These Precious Days. Patchett explains in the introduction why she wrote essays during the pandemic, instead of fiction: Fear of death. She says while writing any novel, she considers what would happen to her fictional universe and all her beloved characters if she dies before it's finished. They would be wiped out too, and you get the sense she considers this the greater tragedy. And so she couldn't focus on writing fiction during the pandemic because ""What was the point of starting if I wasn't going to be around to finish?"" She mentions she wasn't more afraid of dying during the pandemic than any other time, but that during the writing all her novels, thoughts of death were nearly constant. But essays? ""Death has no interest in essays,"" she says. And so we're all the luckier for it that she wrote these wonderful pieces during the pandemic. Each one is smart and funny and sincere and just generally a joy to read. There's not a dud in the bunch, a nearly impossible trick to pull off in an essay collection. Most essay collections are just that: a collection of disconnected pieces that appeared elsewhere and are published together to make a buck. But these feel intentional and thematically connected. Which, to use a tired cliche, means we get a book that is greater than the sum of its parts.My favorite in the collection is an essay titled ""There Are No Children Here."" It's a series of 20-some vignettes all about Patchett's decision not to have children. I loved this piece for its gentle (and sometimes not-so-gentle) chiding of people who are always up in her business, asking her why, or suggesting she's missing something, or are in disbelief someone would consciously make that choice. She explains why she thinks people interpret her choice as a value judgment on theirs, as if both choices aren't equally valid. When someone knows you've purposely chosen not to have children, they sometimes see that as looking down your nose at their own decisions, because something that's not important to you is to them. Of course that's not the case (well, usually). Patchett writes that she thinks about this the same way as her choice not to eat meat or drink. When someone asks her if she minds if they order a cheeseburger, she says ""Not unless you're going to make me eat it."" Live and let live, basically.The title essay These Precious Days is another highlight. It's about how she picked up Tom Hanks' story collection in the middle of the night, and through a series of very fortunate events, wound up with Hanks' personal assistant Sooki as her long-term houseguest during the pandemic. But Sooki became way more than just a houseguest, she became a dear friend. And they spent much of the early days of the pandemic together, as Sooki was undergoing cancer treatments in Nashville, and they are both just trying to figure out how to live in a new reality. Without exaggeration, I can faithfully say that this is one of the best essay collections I've ever read. Honestly. I loved this book a wholly indecent amount. Many of these essays are less than 10 pages, and I'd read one or two per day, always looking forward to taking a break from what I was doing and giving myself an Ann Patchett Essay Treat throughout the day. I can't recommend this more highly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 05, 2022","Jan 30, 2022","Jan 05, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56922687-these-precious-days

But if he did, he nailed it! Paul is a middle-aged, divorced dad, Brooklyn writer living with his mother who is constantly upset with the state of the world and beyond befuddled that the world doesn't appreciate his brilliance. But here's the surprise: Paul is a little bit all of us. Paul is sure social media is destroying society. Paul has trouble understanding why his passion projects -- in his case, long-form articles about really obscure subjects published in academic journals -- aren't more widely read and respected. But mostly, Paul can't understand how so many people in this supposedly enlightened country can go along with the machinations of the orange fiend in the White House. (Yes, it's 2018 or so, and the Cheeto-faced Shitgibbon is at the height of his manipulative powers.)And now, Paul discovers his own mother -- he had to move in with her after he was denied tenure and then got demoted from his university teaching job -- is a fan of Colin Mackey, the blustery anchor on a nightly news show bearing no accidental resemblance to Sean Hannity and Fox News.But Paul has a plan to solve all these problems. He's currently working on a book titled The Luddite's Manifesto that will set the set the world straight and vault him to cultural prominence and wealth beyond his wildest dreams. It's pretty laughable of course, but let's let Paul/Ignatius have his dream because despite all this, we somehow manage to feel for Paul, a little bit. He is losing touch with his 11-year-old daughter who he only gets to see on weekend (part of the reason for this is that he constantly explains the world to her in the most condescending terms, and she recognizes his life as sad). But he really does love her and really strives to be a good parent.Eventually, as is inevitable, Paul hits rock bottom and has a moment of clarity. What is he really doing to help the declining state of society? What can he do? Can he do more?There are few ""plot twists"" in this novel that make you go ""huh?"" But on the whole, this is a really fun read. Paul is exasperating for sure! But do you root for him? Sometimes it's hard to tell if you should. Paul, in addition to standing in as a modern-day Ignatius Reilly, is also the guy in the classic Onion article, ""Area Man Accepts Burden Of Being Only Person On Earth Who Understands How World Actually Works."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 19, 2022","Sep 25, 2022","Jan 05, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58725061-the-great-man-theory

Charles wrote: ""Whatever must be said to get you to heft this daunting debut novel by Honorée Fanonne Jeffers, I’ll say, because The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois is the kind of book that comes around only once a decade. Yes, at roughly 800 pages, it is, indeed, a mountain to climb, but the journey is engrossing, and the view from the summit will transform your understanding of America.""So heft, I did, not without some trepidation, frankly. But now, I owe Mr. Charles a beer. Because it was just as engrossing and transformative as he said. I actually included it on my top 10 of 2021 before I'd even finished it. The story itself is two-fold. It's a coming of age story of Ailey, a young Black girl growing up in ""the City"" (presumably NYC?), and visiting relatives during summers in rural Georgia. It's also the story of Ailey's ancestors, enslaved people on a Georgia plantation. So yes, it's a multi-generational family saga, but told as two separate narratives. Both stories are fascinating, and there are a TON of characters. You're warned of this with the extensive family tree Jeffers includes at the beginning. As good as this is, it's not an easy read from a content standpoint. Serious trigger warnings here for sexual abuse, pedophilia, and drug addiction. But it really is as engrossing as Charles says — it's an epic story of America, injustice, racism, the power of knowing and understanding unvarnished history, and the strength of family. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 21, 2021","Dec 26, 2021","Sep 29, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51183428-the-love-songs-of-w-e-b-du-bois

One that was really eye-opening to me is that ""rich"" people don't know exactly how much money they have at any given time. Jakob Guanzon's devastating novel, Abundance, really hammers that point home, as he each chapter in this novel is literally titled with the precise amount of money our protagonist Henry has.But as jolting as that idea is to explain the difference between the haves and have-nots, Guanzon provides one that's even more profound. As Henry is working a difficult job at a rich person's house, Henry's coworker disdainfully says: ""Imagine having enough money to trust people."" That line, too, just blew my mind. Imagine. So this is a novel about the failing American dream, poverty and lost dignity, about drug addiction, and about compounding bad circumstances with even worse decisions.The story here is about a young man named Henry, whose parents have died, left him with a mountain of debt, and he has no real opportunities to make his life better. He's spent time in a drug rehab facility as a teenager, where he meets Michelle, the eventual mother of his child, Junior. Henry and Michelle reconnect after rehab and fall in love. But struggle. And Henry gets mixed up in a drug scheme with a shady guy named Al, which eventually results in jail time. When he gets out, nothing is the same. His son doesn't recognize him and his wife hates him. This is all told in flashback chapters. In real-time, Michelle has left, and Henry and Junior are living in his truck. But today, it's Junior's birthday and Henry has a few bucks in his pocket which he's going to use to splurge on a hotel room for the night. And he has a scheduled job interview the next day. Things might be looking up. But will Henry finally be able to pull it together? Will he be able to regain his dignity and the respect of his son? Henry is certainly not the heart-of-gold, pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps protagonist you want him to be (he's certainly not Chris in The Pursuit of Happyness). But you still root for him, if for no other reason than how badly you feel for his young son. None of this is Junior's fault, and yet he's expected to maintain his stiff upper lip, live in a truck, go to school, and hope everything will eventually be okay. I loved this novel, even with an ending that didn't quite land right. Still, the writing here is true and clever and authentic. What a book. I'm glad the NBA longlist rescued this book from relative obscurity. Every American should read this novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 22, 2021",Dec 2021,"Sep 29, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53317416-abundance

But unfortunately, the novel itself isn't nearly as good as his intentions. The Every is a sequel to Eggers' 2013 novel, The Circle —it actually feels like the second in a trilogy and has some serious Empire Strikes Back vibes. Here, the bad guys in the form of the evil tech company are winning. It's a few years in the future from the events of The Circle, and Eggers' Circle protagonist, Mae Holland, is now the CEO of the Every, which is a combination of the Circle and the newly acquired jungle. Our protagonist is a young woman from Idaho named Delaney, who together with her friend Wes, get jobs at The Every. But ever since Delaney recovered from a nasty screen addiction as a little girl, and ""the jungle"" destroyed her parents' grocery store, she's been hellbent on revenge against the evil tech company. Her plan is to destroy The Every from the inside out by introducing ridiculous idea after ridiculous idea until the public finally pushes back against the all-powerful tech company. Never mind that this premise, even for a satire, is patently silly, but my real beef is that the novel sort of just devolves into descriptions of these apps, and what happens when they're released into the wild. It just reads like a litany of bad ideas. For instance, Friendy is an app that allow you to gauge how good your friends really are by judging if they're being truthful to you in conversations, how much interaction you have with them, how emotionally fulfilling that interaction is, etc. Or OwnSelf, that tells you exactly when and for how long you should exercise, drink water, call you children, laugh, send out The Every's version of social media likes, and many more — basically controlling your entire life. And there are many, many more examples like this. Though it is a bit clumsy in its execution, and therefore doesn't quite work as satire, The Every is still an effective cautionary tale. Eggers hits on many of the same issues as in The Circle about the dangers of screen addiction, voluntarily relinquishing privacy, and choice. Of course, we all know that ""slippery slope"" is a logical fallacy. But slippery slope is also fertile ground for good satire. And though this isn't exactly good satire, the points are still well made. One of the main dangers introduced here is what happens when humans get lazy enough that they actually don't want choice. They want to be told want to do, have their lives planned out. The Every jumps on this notion and tries to pick the winners and losers. ""Limitless choice is killing the world,"" one characters tells another.The Every is also a novel about the dangers of group-think. Remember during 2016 how we just kept thinking the next horrific thing that presidential candidate said or did would be the one that finally caused his cult-like supporters to wise up and turn on him...but it never happened? That's what this novel is about too: Nothing is a bridge too far when it comes to group-think. On the plus side, I'll say this: Eggers is still very cool. There are several set pieces in this novel that had me howling — as on example, Delaney has to plan a ""field trip"" as a sort of welcome exercise. People keep asking the same questions over and over again, and are worried about the most ridiculous things. And then they all try to one-up each other in their outrage. It kind of reminded me of a neighborhood message board.But these moments are too few, and The Every never really gains its footing like The Circle did, which felt clever and urgent. Often, The Every feels just ridiculous and too over-the-top. And it's also waaay too long. Eggers even makes a joke about how all novels should be fewer than 500 pages, and the absolutely limit of a reader's attention is 577, which is the exact folio count of The Every. But I'd humbly suggest The Every probably 177 pages too long. So even though I didn't think this was as successful as its predecessor, I'm hopeful for a satisfying Return-of-the-Jedi-esque conclusion to this trilogy. Eggers is still one of my favorites and I'll still read anything he writes. His heart is usually in the right place. And he usually and consistently makes me laugh, even if sometimes it's because it's ridiculous....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 27, 2022","Feb 03, 2022","Aug 31, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57792078-the-every

But then Kurt Vonnegut showed up halfway through and goes, ""But my dudes, we have to make it entertaining as well."" And so they did.I think I understood about two-thirds of what A.J. Moxon is up to here in his long, post-modern, super-meta novel, The Revisionaries. And I consider that a win. It's certainly a novel you need to read more than once, which is a tough ask at 600 pages. But also, in the moment, you're so dazzled by Moxon's language and sentences, you almost don't notice, that a) you're aggravated, because b) you only have a passing sense of what is happening and why. That's especially true in the last 100 pages or so as it's supposed to all becoming together, but it's told in a fractured, multi-perspective way that frankly drove me nuts.So what's going on here? This is a novel about God, but it's sure not religious. It's a novel about the role of fiction, the author's authority, the reader's power, and where all those might intersect...but sometimes don't? That's my best guess anyway. The plot, which is important, but so zany it's almost beside the point here, is about a bearded acrobat woman, a preacher who performs a miracle in a place called Loony Island (so named because of it being home to an insane asylum) and builds a new church, a kid who flickers in and out of existence, a cult of weirdos dressed up as cardinals, and a guy who discovers a magical fountain and uses it to erase people's memories and recreate them as he sees fit.Are you with me? IT'S SO WEIRD! But in a strangely good way. Again, I can't claim to fully understand this, but part of the point is how the author is God, but the reader still has veto power, even over God, because of how s/he interprets, understands, derives meaning from, feels about, etc., the text. And this is because each reader brings to bear a unique experience, education, philosophy on life, philosophy on reading books, politics, mood, etc. on every book s/he reads. I think?Would I recommend that you read this? Yes, but with a bunch of caveats. If you like to be challenged, if you are okay with not completely understanding why or how or even what is going on all the time, and if you like something that's truly creative, inventive, and probably unlike anything else you've really ever read before, pick this novel up. Moxon is smart enough (you should absolutely follow him on Twitter, by the way — that is one of main reasons I bought this novel and read it), that someday soon, he's going to publish a novel that absolutely dazzles us.

This is the story of poor, humorless William Stoner, a product of his time and place, who grows up on a farm, discovers a love of books, marries poorly, gets stuck in the weeds of academia, has an affair, dies.

If you're like me, you'll likely have two main reactions to Richard Powers' new novel. (Well three if you count ""HOLY SHIT THAT WAS GOOD.)1. Sadness: The natural world is receding, and we don't seem to care. 2. Rage: The natural world is receding, and not only do we not seem to care, many on one side of the political spectrum are actively working to ensure it's a trend that continues. Science is the enemy. Individualism trumps the common good. That is such as a sad, lazy, selfish way to live, and worse, to lead -- and Powers captures the real consequences here perfectly.But this isn't a political novel, even though ""the President"" (the previous one) butts in occasionally. Instead, at its root, this is a novel about empathy. Empathy leads to a respect for the natural world (as well as fellow humans, of course). As many of us are losing our empathy, so too are we losing the power and ability to undo the damage we've already done. Bewilderment is the story of a father, Theo, and his son, Robin. After the death of Theo's wife in a car accident, Robin begins exhibiting behavioral issues, and the always-recommended solution is to put him on drugs. This is anathema to Theo, who knows there is nothing *wrong* with his son -- he's just experienced trauma. And that combined with his own unusual but beautiful brain is what's causing him to act out. They come upon an experimental treatment called Decoded Neurofeedback that allows Robin to learn from the emotions and brain activity of others -- basically learning empathy. And it works!But then all goes awry. ""People, Robin. They're a questionable species,"" Theo tells his son. This novel, in addition to just wrecking me emotionally, is fascinating in how it treats ideas of science and empathy, science for science's sake, and the wonder of discovery. Theo is an astrobiologist, searching for life on other planets. His wife had been an animal rights activist, a calling which Robin adopts whole-heartedly. It's an interesting juxtaposition: Why do we continue to look up and out, when there's more than enough life to save here? Because we must. We must do both.A new Richard Powers novel is always an absolute must-read for me. The way he combines science and story...no one does that better than him. And he does it again here. I'm not sure this is in quite the same pantheon as his last novel The Overstory -- one of my favorite novels of at least the last 10 years -- but it's not too far off. Bewilderment is awe-inspiring....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 14, 2021","Sep 17, 2021","Aug 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56404444-bewilderment

As I was reading this tale of 12th century nuns, I was trying to imagine the conversation she must've had with her publisher. LG: ""So, it's about a nun...""P: ""Cool, cool. A superhero nun?""LG: ""Well, no. Her superpower is being a strong woman.""P: ""Oh...that works.""LG: ""Also, she lived in the 12th century.""P: ""Oh, well, we'll let marketing handle that.""I kid, I kid.

Like the protagonist of this story, Groff herself is a wunderkind.So Matrix is the story of Marie de France, a poet and abbess of a 12th century abbey. We know very little about Marie's real life, except what little of her poetry survives. And so here Groff has imagined her life. In Groff's telling, Marie is a fierce, powerful, inspired woman who turns her dire circumstances of being remanded to the abbey by the queen into becoming one of the most powerful women in England.

Hey, there are a lot w4.5So I don't mind admitting I'm superficial enough that I read this novel based almost solely on its incredibly awesome title. Hey, there are a lot worse reasons to pick up a novel. Here's how it started: Me, after about 10 pages: Ah, man is this gonna be just another one of these self-indulgent, self-important pieces of autofiction? Here's how it's going: Also me, halfway through, and riveted: Okay, yeah, it is, but it's also really good!If you do some googling, you'll learn that the real-person writer Claire Vaye Watkins' father really was one of Charles Manson's right-hand men, and this novel gives a long story about her/the narrator's parents, how they met, etc., right at the beginning. So right off the bad the autofiction/memoir line is a little blurred. In these autofiction novels that seem to be so trendy these days, you always wonder where the line between reality and fiction is, which I realize is not productive to your reading experience. But I can't help it. It sort of feels like you're being tricked a little, but not in a nefarious way. (Of course, to most writers, readers trying to figure out what's real and not is beside the point — and in fact, is probably supremely irritating to them.) Anyway, that line is further blurred because the rest of the novel is about a character named Claire Vaye Watkins (also a writer). The character Claire and her husband have just had a baby, and now has had enough — she feels trapped, confined, and felled by postpartum depression. When she travels to her hometown of Reno for an author event, she hangs out with some of her old friends, does mushrooms, and slowly realizes she can't go back to her former life. So now what? That's what the rest of the novel is — her just trying (or not really trying, just drifting) to figure out her life. All the while, she contemplates a series of letters her mother, who has since died of a opioid overdose, wrote to her mother's cousin (reproduced between chapters) when her mother was a teenager in Las Vegas in the 1970s. And we see the apple maybe hasn't fallen far from the tree.Yes, so once you get past trying to figure out what's fiction and not, you'll find a really sharply written story about returning to your roots. When you start slowly deviating from who you think you are, how do you get back to who you want yourself to be? I enjoyed this -- a lot more than I thought I might after the first few pages. It's an acutely observed, quickly paced, clever, often funny, often raunchy, and really entertaining read. PS. My favorite quote from the novel: ""Love is a fucking hassle.""PSS. My second favorite quote from the novel: ""I am not choosing darkness but darkness is choosing me.""...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Sep 24, 2021","Sep 27, 2021","Aug 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57155092-i-love-you-but-i-ve-chosen-darkness
