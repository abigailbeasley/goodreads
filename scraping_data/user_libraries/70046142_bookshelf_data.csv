Despite only writing like 1 1/2 s this year, I actually have read a fairSince this is The Book of the Moment™, I’ll keep this relatively short. Despite only writing like 1 1/2 s this year, I actually have read a fair amount of fantasy and think I can help people figure out if they’re Fourth Wing’s ideal reader. The frequency of both death and sex give off a high-stakes feeling without ever actually being high-stakes. You’re not genuinely concerned for the main characters’ survival. It’s not all some big allegory for a real world conflict. The story’s tone grants an intensity that the plot’s predictability spares you from bearing the full weight of. The way that romance novels guarantee a Happily Ever After, Fourth Wing promises an Everything Will Work Out In The End, creating a relatively stress-free reading experience. It’s for adults who wanted their favorite angsty YA fantasies to have more spice. It’s for people who may feel intimidated by The Poppy War or Priory of the Orange Tree but dig those vibes. It’s for romantasy readers who need more than a vague gesturing towards magic to meet their fantasy quota. This is for Armentrout fans. For Lightlark fans. For Maas fans. It’s The CW’s take on high fantasy, and that’s not a bad thing! I enjoyed it overall and found the last 150 pages to be especially breakneck. But I don’t think this is one-size-fits-all, and going in with accurate expectations will vastly improve your reading experience. If you enjoy sifting through intricate world-building or appreciate lyrical writing or like to feel surprised by a story…this may not work for you. It’s just important to keep in mind that some overlap in genre conventions and tropes doesn’t automatically make a book YA—and frankly says more about the adultification of Young Adult than it does the maturity of books like Fourth Wing. The fact that this book seems to be everywhere is an indicator that this formerly-niche market has gone mainstream, not a testament to universal popularity. So if it doesn’t sound your speed, it’s okay to take a pass on this one.[image](im kidding! probably)**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,97,1,"May 21, 2023","May 23, 2023","May 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61431922-fourth-wing

And I know everyone loves pretending to be the insufferable Simon Cowell of this site, I’m begging some of you to try meeting a book where it’s at, especially if you’re going to spend a dozen paragraphs tearing it down. Even more so when using the same stale, boilerplate (and honestly, kind of sexist) critiques of young, female protagonists. I don’t turn on the Real Housewives and get mad when it’s not Succession. So if you’re looking for more mature characters or writing styles, then move to a different section of the library or book store. Sophisticated writing isn’t limited to one age group or genre, but if your standard for what’s “good” or not depends on abandoning certain genre conventions or not being on BookTok, then I wouldn’t really trust your recommendations in the first place. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with no longer connecting to YA, but what continues to irritate me are the grown-ass adults who read YA, complain about how much they hate it, then continue to read it. I can’t relate to the desire to seek out something I know I won’t like just to shit on it, but it’s telling how often this is directed at the interests of teenage girls, specifically. It’s also funny how often those ‘critiques’ end up using some of the same tropes that they’re criticizing—we get it, you’re Not Like Other [teenage] Girls™. I keep coming back to this quote by Bonnie Burstow, but the inverse of it: “Often father and daughter look down on mother (woman) together…They agree that she is not bright as they are, cannot reason as they do. This collusion does not save the daughter from the mother’s fate.”This mockery does not change that most adult women were once those teen girls, and they too had their interests, thoughts and enthusiasm dismissed. Some teenagers won’t like it, sure, but a lot will, and I’m failing to see benefit of making sweeping statements on behalf of an entire demographic because you personally didn’t connect to the story. The adaptation has cast Millie Bobby Brown in the lead, and—surprise—she is also a teenager. Given her star-status and relationship with Netflix, it’s safe to say that if she wasn’t really excited about the story, she wouldn’t have taken on the project. [image]So please work through this thought experiment with me—what seems the more likely scenario, that the market for fantastical coming-of-age stories where a young woman rejects societal expectations and learns to fight her own battles has suddenly dried up….or that you grew out of the target demo and no longer identify with the heroine. It also doesn’t seem a coincidence that those who decry how YA has “gone downhill” recently seem to believe that tipping point occurred right as the genre began to diversify, but I digress. As for the book itself, I found Elodie to be a refreshing divergence from the ‘damsel in distress’ trope, saving not only herself and her sister, Floria, but those would not lift a finger in her defense. And though Elodie’s agency is what dooms her initially, it’s also the thing that’s forged her into the person who can survive harsh conditions and solve impossible problems. This book knows the tropes it’s playing into, and I think some early readers are missing that self-awareness. It subverts other popular fairy tale standbys like the ‘wicked stepmother’, ‘prince charming’ and ‘slaying the dragon’. But the real love story in Damsel is the one between Elodie and Floria, their bond as sisters propelling them through even the most impossible circumstances. The antidote to their world’s coldness is the recurring strength of familial love, which is echoed in several other relationships within the story. Even in countries like Aurea and Inophe where there is some level of gender equality, society still treats young women and girls as both disposable and interchangeable, and a character like Elodie is a direct challenge to that belief system. (I’m suddenly realizing why some ers don’t like her)[image]The story’s least interesting aspect is the dragon language and its cataloguing, which did not need to be as in depth as it was. Elodie’s action sequences and quiet moments of contemplation would have been a better use of that space, though it’s clear the author is very proud of the work she put in to the language’s mechanics. And while the ending on the whole was triumphant, it was a little rushed and could have used some clarification and elaboration. Though not explicitly defined, the few known rules in Aurea’s magic system are repeated enough to where they can be accepted by readers without too much explanation. Some authors use magic as a means to tell a story, as opposed to being the story. So while those details may make the world richer, as a character-driven adventure fantasy, Damsel builds its foundations on its characters’ arcs and relationships.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,5,262,2,"Aug 23, 2022Jul 05, 2022","Aug 25, 2022Jul 07, 2022","Nov 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61984840-damsel

And yet in the lead up to publication, you could feel the palpable excitement surrounding it. Those who hadn’t heard of McCurdy before this were understandably confused; who is this Nikelodeon girl that’s caused a run on bookstores, selling out everywhere in less than a day? So that ended up being part of the appeal, the surge of excitement and hype that feels like it came out of nowhere. [image]But that’s not all that was at play with I’m Glad My Mom died, as evident by that jarringly brilliant title. Coupled with the cover design, photography (A PINK URN) and style choices, McCurdy’s print debut would have turned heads regardless of the content. Though the contents themselves, adapted from her one-woman show that was unable to tour last year due to the pandemic, are told with a raw candor that’s completely captured readers and made it a roaring success. Jennette McCurdy has in a sense created the perfect storm—name recognition among younger millennials and older zoomers, a story centered around an abusive parent and the predatory entertainment industry, and coming out soon enough after to feel fresh while also allowing dust to settle.Even a few years ago, I don’t think the public would have been nearly as receptive to her testimony. And there are still a number of people who are going to take offense to not just the phrasing of the title, but the entire premise behind it, which is that many times it’s those the closest to you who cause the most harm. In my experience, people with healthy, or what they believe to be healthy, relationships with their immediate family members have a hard time conceptualizing how anyone could want or need to cut relatives off completely. It’s much more comforting to stick to the belief that familial love is inherent, and so they push back against the idea that sometimes it needs to be earned. This is even more true when the cycle of abuse is generational, as in Jennette’s case, and that standard has become foundational for the rest of your relationships. For that reason, I interpreted “I’m Glad My Mom Died” not as Jennette wishing death on her mother, but as an expression of relief. Based on the trajectory her mother set, there’s little doubt that Jennette’s story would have ended in tragedy, if not her own death. And prior to her mom’s decline, there wasn’t much to suggest that Jennette would have been able to wriggle out from under her thumb on her own. So much of Jennette’s life has been lived in the spotlight, and anyone who’s looking to pick up this book for a kind of True Hollywood Story will get pieces of that as well. There’s all the moments leading up to Jennette’s ‘big break’ on iCarly, some of her time on Nickelodeon, unsettling interactions with disgraced producer Dan Schneider, but McCurdy’s real reckoning is much more internal. Her struggle to reconstruct her identity after she no longer had her mother or a TV network dictating who she needed to be is long and arduous. There’s backslides and missteps and a lot of pain that’s still trying to scab over. But though Jennette’s journey is far from complete, her book ends with hope, and its commercial success leaves her in an advantageous position. I’m not sure what her next career move is going to be, but at least going forward there’s no question of who will be in the driver’s seat. And to those complaining that it wasn’t funny enough: sorry that abuse doesn’t always come with a punchline. I’m sure she’ll keep that in mind for the sequel. *Thanks to Simon & Schuster for getting me this book the week it came out!

There are so many mentions of the comedic beats of the story, which are definitely present and exceptional, but comparatively little about the its emotional impact, which I found a be substantial by the end.The book is split into several perspectives but two major storylines, the first in Hell following an agent from its Deals Department named Peyote Trip, who’s tasked with finding humans on earth that are willing to sign deals in exchange for their immortal souls. The second is a family he’s been tracking for generations, the Harrisons, who are spending the summer at their New Hampshire vacation home. While they have their own interpersonal conflicts to sort through, the Hell scenes are very separate from that story until they’re suddenly not. The early depictions of Hell reminded me a lot of another popular piece of media about the afterlife: The Good Place. The initial parallels are pretty evident—both feature a similar mundane misery in the day-to-day, in addition to the tedious corporate structure. The descriptions of ‘Downstairs’ and ‘The Bad Place’ are also comparable, though Sign Here’s characters seem to take its horrors more seriously, likely because they experienced that torture at one point in a prior millennia. Then there’s the Harrisons’ family dynamic and arrival at the property, which is reminiscent of the Harmons in American Horror Story: Murder House. In some ways Lily takes on Ben Harmon’s role, though Silas slowly builds the case for himself as we learn more about his history and haunted family secrets. And Ruth’s influence over Mickey isn’t unlike Tate Langdon’s over Violet, though to be clear the paranormal aspects of the story are strictly limited to Hell and its agents when they visit Earth. Though Peyote is arguably the main character, both the Hell and the Earth storylines center around the protection of young girls, with every major conflict rooted in the betrayal of a girl by a man in her life. The exploitations and manipulations echo one another across time and space, as Sign Here is nonlinear (if I haven’t mentioned that yet), and later forces those men to face the wreckage left in their wake, one way or another. Even with some bleak outcomes for a few characters, these confrontations strike an emotional and deeply satisfying chord. But despite the majority, if not all, of those betrayals being committed by men, the story’s women levy smaller, yet still vicious blows against one another; but they’re not given a clear narrative redemptive track to follow along. It could almost be harder to forgive those transgressions as a result, and if I had one critique for the author, it would be not giving some of her ‘imperfect girls’ that same chance. I would have loved for them to be granted space to correct their own failures, ideally by directly addressing the ways in which they were failed up until that point.And I will not spoil either the book or shows in this , but I have to mention how differently Sign Here and The Good Place differ in tone; instead of reckoning with larger moral questions and the idea of divine justice, the characters must make peace with decisions made within an inherently unjust system. It’s an ending that’s more befitting of a western than a traditional hero’s journey, focusing on the path to an individual’s redemption, often at the cost of their own happiness and/or ‘fixing’ the unfairness of the situation. There’s even an interruption of a scene that feels plucked straight from True Grit, instilled with themes of self-sacrifice for the sake of another but also as a way to balance the scales narratively. The familiar, hokey elements present in this iteration of Hell could cause readers to expect characters like TGP’s Michael and Janet, or even someone like Crowley from Good Omens. But the story’s sincerity, mystery and emotional depth would be a departure from that format. It manages to be serious without becoming self-serious, accepting Hell as an inevitability instead of something to be vanquished. Any preliminary similarities noted between Sign Here and those works are eroded after its first sharp tonal switch; the flip between the lighter moments and its capacity for ruthless inhumanity. Basically it’s a lot, but in a good way. I’m not sure which of its moods you’ll finish with by the end, but there’s a good chance you’ll like it.Thanks to Berkley and Netgalley for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Oct 16, 2022","Oct 17, 2022","Aug 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59358268-sign-here

It’s basically a Big Brother vampire boarding house for adults, dodging the questionable ‘should a teenager be dating a 158 year old man who died during the American Civil War but still looks 20’ stuff that plagues the genre. [image]Ten years ago, vampires revealed themselves for the first time to the human world, subsequently replacing Hollywood actors and pop stars as the biggest celebrities in the world. They have blogs and fandoms devoted to each vampire and House, which is just as insane as it sounds. They’re called ‘Vladdicts’, which is, objectively, amazing. The plot is initially driven by the mystery surrounding what happened to Renie Mayfield’s sister, June, who disappeared into the same House months before and dropped all contact. Later, it evolves into an exploration of the world’s vampire lore and biology, accompanied by some vamp politicking. The final act is pure chaos, mostly in a good way, and positions the story for an intriguing sequel. The romance, though predictable, is still earned throughout their time together. (If you’re wondering whether the love interest does that suddenly-appearing-next-to-human-girl-without-warning thing……yes he does)My biggest issue ended up being something discussed pretty early on, but I’ll still put it under spoiler tags:(view spoiler)[Humans that come to Belle Morte have to sign a contract stipulating they’ll make themselves available for feeding daily to the vampire residents. This isn’t a surprise; everyone who signs up knows it’s part of the deal and a lot of them are really excited to be bitten. But the issue lies in the irrevocability of that consent. The only one who can release a human from their contract is the Lady of the House, meaning if for any reason the humans don’t want to give their blood that day or any other, they can be forced to. Some visiting vampires take advantage of this, veering into sexual harassment, and the humans have no recourse.There’s no real way to separate the vampire bites from sex in this book, based on the number of times the vampire bites are directly or indirectly compared to sex. (“Relax, or it’ll hurt”) The vampires dictate when they feed, who they feed on and do not allow humans to refuse or leave without permission. But the threat of replacement by any of the thousands of other applicants, as well as the allure and implicit physical threat of vampires themselves, would have been enough to generate compliance without the exploitive contract. It would be one thing if the vampires involved were clear antagonists, but every single vampire we meet, ‘good’ or ‘bad’, is complicit in this system.  (hide spoiler)]Belle Morte isn’t going to blow anyone’s mind, but I’ve read a lot worse recently. Is the writing great? Not particularly. Is it original? Other than the online communities and reality show influences, not so much. Are half the characters in inexplicably French in this British vampire House because the author wanted to give it a cool-sounding French title? Most definitely. But I don’t think it deserves quite so many lower ratings, so I’m gonna give it four stars and probably read the second one.

A kind of long-winded account about butterflKind of a random pick for me, but my reading has been haphazard at best lately—so this is what y’all get! A kind of long-winded account about butterflies that’s actually about climate change. There’s a common thread between Flight Behavior and the ‘family farm’, ‘nature’s destructive power’ and ‘mundanity of corporate greed’ themes represented in some mid-80s media. Think Country and Places in the Heart, but now set in the middle of the Obama years. What’s happened since then is an intentional polarization and misinformation campaign aimed at middle America which pushes a corporate agenda at the expense of their voting base, among others. But this isn’t news to anyone; we’ve all seen the consequences play out over the past several decades.Looking through the s from when it first came out, it’s interesting how many people felt “beaten over the head” with the urgency Kingsolver approached the issue of climate change. This would be more understandable if we had made any tangible progress towards addressing it in the decade since this book was published, but obviously that is not the case. So many of the specific things mentioned—coastland flooding, Australia burning, etc. could have been direct references from the past couple of years, though they appear to be recurring themes. Maybe my skepticism of s from 2012 is unfair, but perhaps if the target audience of this book had been more receptive to these ideas at that time, they wouldn’t need these supposed “lectures” in the first place. Then again, if there was even a fraction of the interest necessary to push forward effective policy to fight climate change, she may not have felt the need to write this book at all. As for the book itself, I wouldn’t say this was the most riveting thing I’ve read this year. Flight Behavior was long for a novel but short for a long book, if that makes sense. It definitely felt lengthy to me, and there were portions that dragged. Kingsolver has a sophisticated writing style that’s not going to appeal to anyone who need things to be ~happening~ in a book in order to enjoy it. But I listened to it on audio (from Hoopla!), and it was fine for passive listening. The ending was a very powerful send-off and managed to execute the hopeful-but-dire tone which a lot of recent Cli-Fi has fumbled in the final moments.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Apr 16, 2022","Apr 19, 2022","Apr 15, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13438524-flight-behavior

Jia is a tenacious girl living in a small village in the Kunlun Mountains with her grandI actually really loved the premise of this MG graphic novel. Jia is a tenacious girl living in a small village in the Kunlun Mountains with her grandmother. Years before, her mother was taken by the fearsome Nian Monster, her father then setting out to retrieve her. Jia and her grandmother never heard from either of them again. Now Jia and her best friend Deshi have decided to embark on a mission to slay the beast themselves, in the hopes of preventing it from returning once again to claim a new victim.I just want to clarify this is a  of the narrative and writing, not of the artwork, which I loved. Megan Huang conjured up beautiful, magical and transporting images that really helped sell a pretty weak story. Unfortunately, the author, Mike Richardson, gave us a storyline that actually started off fairly strong but drastically slipped in quality by the end. This is probably the closest approximation of how it felt reading Jia and the Nian Monster?: [image]again, not a commentary on the actual artworkThe prologue is literally 1/5 of the entire book, and while it’s necessary information for the most part, as it progressed the narrative became less and less detailed. The second half felt squeezed to fit a smaller time frame, and much of the plot progression only worked by making big jumps in time and space. Some logical fallacies, such as two small children climbing down a mountain faster than a house-sized beast, ‘teleporting’ between locations, etc., also do not hold up under mild scrutiny. It also got pretty repetitive, with the majority of Jia and Deshi’s adventure consisting going up and down the same mountain multiple times in a row. So overall, as much as I appreciate the Lunar New Year legend that this story is depicting, I’m left wondering if perhaps one written by an East or Southeast Asian author would have worked better.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 22, 2022","Feb 22, 2022","Feb 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51139555-jia-and-the-nian-monster

But it had so many of the ingredients I love in a fantasy novel—a compelling and determined protagonist, unique magic system, expansive world building, dragons—so I’m happy to admit my mistake here. Additionally, I’m not totally sure if it’s necessary to read Seraphina and its sequel before Tess of the Road, but I guess I will be thorough![image]The dragons themselves are one of the more inventive takes on the popular fantasy staple I’ve seen. They have an almost Vulcan-like approach to empathy and humanity, as well as being excellent foils to the human characters even when they aren’t antagonists. The Saars (the predominant dragon breed) have the ability to shift into human form and live amongst the common people, as long as they’re able to keep a low profile. The animosity between those two populations, and the smaller, lower-status dragons called quigutls, effectively reflect real-world xenophobia as well as can be expected for a story where the oppressed population(s) are dragons.I think some of the things that keep me from enthusiastically recommending this book have more to do with the era it came out in than anything inherently wrong with the storytelling. The choice to use a dragon race as surrogates for marginalized communities might in and of itself be fine, but paired with things like the use of the term “Daanite” to refer to gay characters but never directly saying they are gay, feels like the author is trying to talk about serious subjects without really addressing them. And I’m putting the specifics of this next part of the plot under spoiler tags because it’s a huge reveal, but I really can’t get around mentioning it. There’s a trope near the end of the book that could be interpreted as transphobic, though I will say on behalf of Rachel Hartman that she apologized for it several years ago and was not aware of the trope at the time. (view spoiler)[ The final unmasking of the villain ends up being a male dragon in human form who had been posing as a female governess for a 15 year-old girl since she was a baby. Clearly Hartman was going for a more sinister Mrs. Doubtfire situation than a kind of JK Rowling transphobic fear-mongering, though it could still be harmful to those not expecting it. (hide spoiler)]My read is that it’s a result of naïveté rather than prejudice, and her later books do feature more LGBTQ+ characters. This market and genre have evolved a good amount in the decade since Seraphina’s publication, and some things that would have been unremarkable then would rightfully be viewed through a more critical lens if they came out today. I can understand people wanting to avoid the book for that reason, but I’m not going to hold it against the author.Also worth mentioning is that this story lacks some of those punchy, exciting action sequences that help propel forward a lot of Young Adult fantasies. There’s a good amount of walking around the castle….and walking around the town…..then back to waiting in the castle, etc. We follow Seraphina on a journey of self-discovery more than a fantasy adventure, but for readers that expect the plot to involve a lot of, well, plot, this may not be the story for you. [image]I am very excited to see where the new book takes Seraphina and co., though. I double checked the synopsis before posting, and unfortunately there’s not many specifics I can say about this book or the next one that wouldn’t be considered spoilers for people who haven’t read either. But the world-building of Seraphina has already provided a sequel, Shadow Scale, plus a second spin-off series that stars a minor character from the first series, Tess of the Road, so I think it’s safe to say there’s a lot more left to explore.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Feb 04, 2022","Feb 05, 2022","Feb 04, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39307188-seraphina

And also I forgot[image]realizing I now have a  a 1000 page bookAnother immense and expansive world by Brandon Sanderson. Generations ago the protectors of Roshar, The Knights Radiant, abandoned their posts. They left behind fragmented peoples, as well as their powerful weapons and armor known as Shardblades and Shardplate. Now kingdoms battle one another for this magical, enhanced weaponry, for there is no stronger indicator of who possesses more power than the number of Shards they have access to. In present day, Brightlord Dalinar Kholin and his son, Adolin, serve under Dalinar’s nephew, King Elhokar, as they war against the Parshendi in the Shattered Plains. Originally intended as a campaign against the killers of Elhokar’s father and Dalinar’s brother, King Gavilar, the Parshendi and the Alethi now fight for valuable gemhearts located inside the monsters of the Plains. Dalinar takes a kind of Ned Stark role, trying to protect his inexperienced nephew while maintaining the ‘old ways’ of knights. At the very bottom of the Alethi army hierarchy are the Bridgemen, who transport bridges for the soldiers to quickly get to wherever a monster has been spotted. Among them is Kaladin, a member of the lower caste who seems to be extraordinarily lucky when it counts, despite is poor circumstances.Meanwhile in Jah Keved, Shallan Davar is attempting to become Jasnah Kholin’s (Elhokar’s sister) ward. Shallan is the third major point of view in the book and the two have a dynamic not dissimilar to the one between Tissaia and Yennefer of The Witcher. Together they begin to uncover lost histories and magic that will immeasurably impact the future of their world. So just like my , was this book a little exposition-heavy right off the bat? Yeah, probably. It’s not something I’d recommend to beginners or anyone who hasn’t read fantasy which requires this much upfront commitment to the world-building. But it’s also not intentionally alienating. I was deathly afraid of checking the Wiki pages because ones for books that have been around this long are usually full of spoilers. Instead I ended up taking notes on a Google Doc of all the lore, characters & locations for easy reference. I can’t tell if I didn’t need them *because* I remembered most of the information from writing it down or if it was genuinely unnecessary, but I liked knowing it was there in case I lost the plot along the way.Sanderson likes to take big swings at big topics, and The Way of Kings is no exception. Dalinar is positioned as the arbiter of morality, but he still struggles with his own doubts on the Heirocracy. Through Dalinar we’re meant to question what makes a good leader, is it the unwavering charge towards a goal or is it questioning your every action? There’s a tease of what’s to come in Dalinar’s visions, something prophetic left unfulfilled. The political maneuvering of the warcamp is the immediate conflict, but the author hints that it's all a spectacle, a distraction from the real enemy on the horizon.Kaladin on the other hand is a compelling underdog character, beaten down by those in power to the point that he finally breaks and tries to upend the system. He’s easy to root for and may just rise up and become a major player in the upcoming fight. The crew he leads, Bridge Four, are a colorful and endearing group of other underdogs, who each have their own distinct motivations and personalities. They’re a grounding force in an immense narrative, delivering some of the most impactful scenes as well as providing much needed levity.One big thing I noticed between this book and the first Mistborn trilogy was the appearance of women?! Like, multiple?!??!? AT ONCE. Huge development for Sanderson. So proud. Legitimately, though, this was one of my more substantial criticisms of his other books, and I’m really happy I don’t have to pretend not to notice something like that here. My only issue with Jasnah and Shallan was that we didn’t get enough of them. I’m sure a lot of that is a proximity issue, that they’re holed up in a fancy library away from the majority of the action, but I’m hoping that’s rectified in the next book. The Stormlight Archive currently has four out of the planned five novels for the first era released, with an expected second era of five additional books coming once Sanderson finishes his other trilogy. Overall, I really liked The Way of Kings. Of course the size itself is plenty intimidating, but once you dive into each storyline it’s exciting to try and piece together. Each main character has their own full arc, but the overarching story is about the rise and fall of empires and the question of what the powerful owe to the vulnerable. And it’s a story I’m looking forward to continuing with.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,90,1,"Jan 04, 2022","Jan 10, 2022","Jan 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56081987-the-way-of-kings

It’s the second of three impossible tasks she’s been given by the dust-wife, a kind of sorceress that inhabits cemeteries and communicates with the dead. But Marra will complete them all, because it’s the only way she will get the dust-wife to help her complete an even more impossible task: killing a prince.Because before Marra was a woman seeking vengeance, before she was a novice currently AWOL from her convent—she was a the youngest of three princesses of a small kingdom. Now with one sister gone and another at the mercy of an evil prince, Marra will do whatever she must to seize the chance to kill him.

Following a tip from the GPA, the Gene Protection Agency, they went into the building equipped body armor, hazmat suits and a full SWAT team. He was a scientist, not a soldier. He was going to call his wife in the morning; he was supposed to go home. But a flash, an explosion—and then Logan Ramsay was changed forever. And with him, so was the rest of the world.The planet has evolved so quickly. What once felt like slow march towards the inevitable has accelerated into a sprint. Logan joined the GPA as a way to make amends for his mother’s role in the gene editing scheme that snowballed into an ecological disaster. The old Logan would have never considered taking part in something like that, and he wouldn’t have had the capacity to. But after the botched raid, Logan is different now, and there’s no telling what he’s willing and capable of doing.Upgrade is exactly the sort of book that I’ve come to expect from Blake Crouch. A dynamic, fast-paced thriller nestled comfortably between grounded sci-fi and speculative fiction. There’s the ‘regular guy’ protagonist that gets thrust into the center of rapidly unfolding, almost supernaturally daunting events that have to power to shape the world as we know it. And through that vehicle Crouch offers a commentary on what he believes is one of the most pressing issues of our time. In this case, that’s climate change, but a little more broadly it’s human indifference to the effects of climate change and other impending disasters. For the most part, it’s spectacularly done. Crouch has a way of making the implications of a far-off technological advancement feel like it’s just around the corner. You just can’t help but rip through the pages, desperate to reach the end. Upgrade is the kind of book tailor-made for a big budget movie adaptation, staring whatever 30-40 year-old white leading man is currently in demand. This was an easy 5 star book for me. Sure, it’s a very American worldview. It’s a white guy on a Save The World™ mission, humanity’s last hope and all that. There’s nothing wrong with being a popcorn thriller with a strong message, despite what some lit snobs might believe. So why, then, does this  have four stars? Well, I literally cannot tell you. Not without massive spoilers. So please, PLEASE do not expand this spoiler text below unless you have read it already. Or are a masochist—but at that point you can’t yell at me for ruining it!!(view spoiler)[I was all in on this, even in the epilogue, up until that final letter that Logan wrote to his wife and daughter. What a fumble on the 1 yard line (is that right?? idk I don’t do sport metaphors). Explain to me how you can write an entire novel about the dangers of messing with humanity. About how one tiny change can have devastating, unforeseeable consequences—but you decide to solve the question of humans by once again having an entitled, know-it-all character play god on people against their will. Crouch has completely undermined his entire thesis in just a couple of pages of half-assed grandstanding. The fact that Logan could witness and face the consequences of his mother’s actions as well as literally murdering his sister to prevent her from acting, and then take it upon himself to do the same goddamned thing is a total collapse of his character arc. There’s no coming back from that; he’s now irredeemable.I don’t even totally disagree with his point that it’s a lack of compassion that has (and will) lead human societies towards our own downfall, but I do vehemently challenge the notion that we all bear the same level of responsibility. It’s not all humans who need to be “upgraded”; it’s the powerful decision makers. There’s ample evidence that when people have been at their lowest and most vulnerable, that the communities who step up and help are the ones who have the least. And those that don’t help aren’t doing so out of apathy, but because they are simply struggling to survive themselves.So the idea that humanity as a whole needs to be ‘fixed’, by possibly the worst candidate for White Savior since Hollywood decided to sing Imagine for us, is just incorrect. If Crouch was dead-set on this “compassion upgrade”, which I think is in moral opposition to the rest of his novel but whatever it’s his book, he could have aimed it to target a small number of influential people in high-income countries. But making it a contagion, spreading it to people without their knowledge, altering their chemical makeup without their consent, all based off of a technology that only a couple of years before had a 13% mortality rate—are we supposed to clap?? I swear if some mad scientist dude-bro reads this and decides to use it as a blueprint in the future, Blake better be long gone because I will be KNOCKING on his door! (hide spoiler)]Even with that complaint, though, Upgrade is monstrously entertaining. My reading speed essentially doubled whenever I picked it up, so for that reason I still feel compelled to recommend it. But it’s not going to top the list for me this year, and I can’t help but express disappointment at Crouch’s final word on the subject. I do hope other people read it when they get the opportunity to as I’m very eager to discuss it more....more",Notes are private!,0,120,1,"Feb 02, 2022","Feb 09, 2022","Dec 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59838811-upgrade

I’m familiar with Elizabeth Acevedo mostly through her novels in verse, but I was excited to see her try her hand at contemporary YA fiction in the form of a traditional novel! Emoni Santiago is a compelling protagonist. She’s been through a lot in her seventeen years, including losing her mother, her father leaving, getting pregnant in her freshman year of high school—but she still has so much passion for what she loves. Emoni wants to be professional chef, but has mostly given up on that dream because of her current obligations. But then Emoni has the opportunity to take her first culinary class her senior year, and it feels as though doors that she thought had been closed to her are finally cracking open. A potential career path, a blossoming new relationship and more lay before Emoni, if only she can find the fortitude to do something just for herself again.I see what Acevedo was going for with having this story set after Emoni’s pregnancy. That there’s more to her life than just that one pivotal moment of it. And for teenage mothers who may be reading to have someone in a book to root for, to get to watch her succeed. That’s important representation, and I applaud the author for that choice. However, I don’t think the main conflict of the book really ever came close to some of the struggles Emoni experienced prior to it. She has worked hard her entire life, mostly because she had no choice, and works consistently hard throughout With the Fire on High, but that’s part of the problem. What changed to make things suddenly start going well for her? I didn’t see an evolution or growth, just Acevedo’s wish for her main character to have a happy ending. And don’t get me wrong, she deserves that ending, but it didn’t feel like we got to sit in on the most engaging parts of Emoni’s journey.Acevedo is a poet, so it’s no surprise so much of the language is, well, ~poetic~. I love seeing writing like that in YA, because for some reason it never comes off quite as stuffy as it has a tendency to in adult literary fiction sometimes. There are some turns of phrase that I feel like she fell back on a few too many times. One in particular that Tatiana mentioned in her , “released the breath that she didn’t know she was holding”, was probably the worst offender. Still, that’s not uncommon in YA, and it wasn’t too distracting for me overall. But while I did enjoy With the Fire on High, I’ll probably stick to Acevedo’s verse novels going forward.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,80,1,"Dec 12, 2021","Dec 14, 2021","Dec 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41154268-with-the-fire-on-high

I absolutely recommend going this route as nobody will have a better handle on the content and know where to place inflections more than the person who crafted it. I was also surprised to learn Gorman had a speech impediment growing up, because she spoke clearly, confidently and beautifully while reciting her poems.*insert usual disclaimer of knowing nothing about poetry*But really, this is the wrong  to read if you want smart technical analysis. All I can offer is some of the topics covered and highly recommend it to anyone who asks. That’s probably for the best regardless of who is writing about Call Us What We Carry, though, as I think Gorman’s words are best left standing on their own.The first half is a lot of reflecting on the past nearly two years during the pandemic, especially as a young woman living in America. You can hear generational markers in her words and tone, and some of the relentless idealism Gen Z is known for. The second half then moves toward what happened during the George Floyd protests last summer, but also more broadly covering race, the Trump presidency (though never by name), and a call to action for issues like climate change. Her delivery is sharp and smart, breathing new life into discourse that’s well broken-in at this point. “Grief is the grenade that always goes off.”The book ends on a hopeful note, with the famous inaugural poem The Hill We Climb. Still, even before then Gorman does her best to pick us up off of the floor, deeply longing but still believing in a possibility for a better world. I can’t say I always share Gorman’s optimism. While we are losing the fight to keep yet another generation from plunging into insurmountable student loan/medical debt and debating whether senior citizens deserve to have teeth. While natural disasters and infectious diseases that could have been mitigated are free to rip through vulnerable communities. While our politicians (yes, including democrats) remain bought and paid for ideologues to corporate interests.“And so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us.”Sure, but ‘what stands before us’ might be too much at this point for just ‘who stands beside us’ to handle on our own. Here’s hoping that people who helped create these problems actually step up to solve them instead of pinning all their hopes on a number of courageous 23-year-olds....more",Notes are private!,0,70,1,"Dec 11, 2021","Dec 13, 2021","Dec 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56805404-call-us-what-we-carry

That said, fans of Nnedi Okorafor’s other works won’t be disappointed by this Africanfuturist novella.All of the classic Okorafor themes are there—a girl, Sankofa, that’s been ostracized by her community and is surviving on her own. Society’s fear of the unknown about her being the major point of conflict, with that ‘unknown’ ability also being her source of empowerment. And the underlying evil of it all being less the other-worldly elements, but instead the greed and inhumanity of corporate capitalist entities which seek to control and harness anything that may be useful. (view spoiler)[Although this plot line seems to be dropped by the end (hide spoiler)]It’s not super long, but Okorafor has never needed a huge page count to tell a compelling story. It is a good deal sadder than the other books of hers I read, because of the level of tragedy befalling a girl so young. Remote Control features that ‘not-so-distant-future’ setting that’s been more popular in science fiction lately, and which I find a lot more approachable than the stereotypical space opera associated with the genre.(On a side note I saw maybe the dumbest  on this website which was just some lady with a cat avatar complaining that this book wasn’t “science fictiony” enough because it wasn’t set in space. Lol…….k.)I’d recommend Remote Control to fans of the author or anyone trying to fit in a couple interesting reads before the end of the year!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Dec 03, 2021","Dec 05, 2021","Nov 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53205922-remote-control

I don’t think I’ve reacted to onWell this somewhat pains me to write, but this is not going to be my favorite novel that Karin Slaughter has put out. I don’t think I’ve reacted to one of her books like this since Pieces of Her which….makes sense, considering this is its sequel.Look, a ton of people will have this book on their radar because of the Netflix show, so I will write this as if you’ve either read the first in this new series and/or watched the first season. So all of you  skimmers, this is your first an only warning: there will be spoilers for Pieces of Her below! Continue at your own risk.[image]Things to keep in mind if you only watched the show:• Jasper has not met Andrea in book one and meets her for the first time briefly in book 2• Nick is not a fugitive in the books, but has been imprisoned since Laura turned him in after Oslo• Laura has not signed out of Witness Protection in the books; she is still enrolled and Michael Vargas is her agentIt’s been two years since Andy’s life changed forever. Ever since a gunman walked into that diner, and after feeling helpless at every turn while following the disjointed roadmap of her mother’s past, Andrea Oliver has decided she will not fall into that position again. She’s joined the Marshal program, much to the disapproval of her parents Laura and Gordon, and has cultivated the skills and instincts she was previously lacking. The annoying, stunted Andy is no more—replaced by a capable and independent Andrea. For the most part this is a good thing. It’s so much easier to become invested in her investigation(s) now that she isn’t a wide-eyed baby lamb just trying not to get accidentally murdered. But in practice there’s an obvious drawback; Laura Oliver’s role has been massively reduced in this sequel. She’s honestly not around for more than some glorified cameos at the very beginning and end. And despite Andrea’s newfound freedom, it’s hard to imagine the Laura Oliver from book one being fine with sitting back and letting her only, precious daughter try her hand at a dangerous profession while there’s still people out there that want her dead. No, old Laura would give her a half hour head start and then Kool-Aid man back into Andrea’s life whether or not she needs (or wants) her mother there.[image]But its not just the Oliver women standing beneath the spotlight this time. A large portion of the plot is revealed through flashbacks to an early 1980s murder case that Andrea is looking into. And I have to say, these flashbacks are not a fun, nostalgia-filled romp, but instead almost exclusively contain cruelty and violence. It’s not exactly the kind of violence you may be expecting from the author of Pretty Girls or The Good Daughter, but more akin to Slaughter’s other historical crime novel, Cop Town. I mean, it was the Reagan era. It’s not like everyone was having A Great Time. But I’ll throw in a few content warnings from both timelines here, out of context, so you can decide if it’ll work for you: (view spoiler)[sexism, homophobia, ‘life-prolonging care’, abortion, anorexia, sexual violence, drug use, cults, domestic violence, pregnant medical malpractice, gun violence (hide spoiler)]I’m a little on the fence with whether I want the author to continue with this series. On one hand, I love the Will Trent books and don’t want her to stop writing them, but I also understand why after ten in a series she would want to branch out to something new. The deciding factor is likely going to come down to whether or not Andrea Oliver is a strong enough character to carry a series on her own. I think the jury is still out on that, and I would like to see more of a role for Laura, Gordon and Mike going forward, along with some newly introduced characters like “Catfish” Bible. You know who I am tired of hearing about, though? Fucking Nick. I do not care about this man, no matter how ~important~ he may be to Laura and Andy’s character arcs. He always dregs up these unnecessary political tangents but doesn’t fill a role outside of a vaguely menacing Big Bad they’re always watching out for. If the way this book ends is any indication, he is not done with the Olivers yet. So blah, fine. Whatever.[image]All that to say…….yeah, you should probably read this if you liked the first book. I will be buying it, if only to be a completionist. Because even though it’s not her best, a so-so Karin Slaughter novel still stands several heads above the standard thriller sitting next to it on the shelves.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,93,1,"Mar 28, 2022","Mar 29, 2022","Nov 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59445976-girl-forgotten

So now after attempting three of Astrid Scholte’s At this point I have nobody to blame but myself, but I saw “Six of Crows” and just couldn’t resist. So now after attempting three of Astrid Scholte’s YA Fantasy novels, I have to acknowledge that they just don’t work for me. Each of her book ideas have showed such promise, with a unique and intriguing premise that sets itself apart from others currently on the market. And I get sucked in by that allure. But what I’ve realized over time is that these ideas don’t ever reach the expectations I have for them, and I end up disappointed.League of Liars starts as a courtroom drama that eventually becomes heist-adjacent, but with neither really being believable nor compelling. The “criminal justice system” that we’re painstakingly walked through has rules that don’t behave like actual rules, with an air of making-it-up-as-we-go-along. It’s just so goofy. Every step feels like a prank. There’s no way to take any of the proceedings seriously despite the consequences intending to be dire. The heist is also probably one of the most anti-climactic things I’ve ever read. I wish I could balance out this  with some things I enjoyed, but I can’t come up with anything. The characters were poorly developed, the dialogue was so cringey. And almost every main and supporting character is a moron. I could not tell if Scholte was going for a broader social commentary, but nothing like that landed for me. None of the larger world was elaborated on, the magic system was breezed over and completely unexplained—we were given nothing to think about, let alone get invested in.The intention behind Scholte’s books, that initial idea, is always so much more than what the story ends up being. And whether it’s due to limitations she feels within the audience/genre, the page constraints in a single novel or just her own capacity as a writer, the concept is delivered half-baked. I wouldn’t be surprised if the actual writing process for her was a lot less fulfilling or interesting than brainstorming and plotting sessions. Her lack of interest, or of finesse, shows in her work, and it leaves the reader with a similarly lackluster and dull experience.For anyone wondering, this is clearly a setup for some kind of series, I believe the first one the author has attempted. I can’t imagine someone wanting to read more of this world, but to each their own. I guess if you’re looking for a magic system constructed around shadows, try Book of Night by Holly Black. If you want a band of misfits planning and executing a prison break, definitely pick up Six of Crows. But between both the borrowed and unformed concepts, I can’t think of anyone I would recommend League of Liars to.*Thanks to Penguin Teen for an advance  copy!

We will all just collectively ignore how long it took me to read in the first place.[image]The premise of Nothing More to Tell immediately felt like something more conceivable as a vehicle to tell a murder mystery involving teenagers. There’s still the standard McManus (and to be honest, probably a genre standard at this point) rotating perspectives, but this time only split between two characters. And if you are keeping track of her trademark Too Trendy Names, this time around we are working with Brynn and Tripp so…..yeah. McManus strikes again! I could have sworn at the outset that she’d actually done Brynn already, but no, I was just thinking of Bronwyn (lol) from One of Us Is Lying.There’s a few flashes to scenes from the past around the time their teacher at Saint Ambrose, Mr. Larkin, was found dead in the woods behind the school by Tripp and two other kids in middle school. But for the most part we get the exposition either as narration or through Brynn’s investigation of the cold case murder as an intern for a true crime show, Motive. Structuring the plot this way was a smart move, as my biggest complaint with McManus’s last book was how much of my disbelief had to be suspended for even a fraction of the situations those kids found themselves in to be plausible. Here, Brynn had access to police files and investigative tools, not to mention an excuse to pursue the case with gusto, that didn’t rely on happenstance to uncover major twists.As for my enjoyment of the book, I think I appreciated the mechanics of it more than I really loved reading it. Like, I wasn’t frantically flipping through the pages, but I did keep picking it back up. I also think this could be the potential launching pad for McManus’s next series or spin-offs on One of Us Is Back rounds off that trilogy next year. If that’s not the case, I’ll probably bump my rating down a level because many of the threads she left dangling would have been done unintentionally. Though as of now it just feels like a dozen red herrings were stuffed into a story and then promptly abandoned once they no longer served it. [image]Speaking of, I cannot get over how abrupt the final climax was. I thought You'll Be the Death of Me was rushed, but this??? I can’t go beyond that it started out of nowhere and ended minutes later with all the fanfare of a speed bump without getting into spoilers, but just know I had to put my kindle down to laugh alone in my room for several more minutes before I could start again. But this didn’t impact the plot as much as you’d expect; there’s an epilogue twist that is the main reason I suspect a follow-up to this one that I actually think could be really interesting if done well. So I guess we’ll see.But truthfully I do not keep coming back to these books because I am expecting ingenious plot devices and mind-blowing twists. I am here exclusively for the consistent readability and the scratchy-face covers. And despite not reaching the level of a couple of her earlier novels, McManus delivers on both of those things here as well. *Thank you to Delacorte Press, Get Underlined and Netgalley for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,112,1,"Mar 13, 2022","Apr 23, 2022","Nov 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51559209-nothing-more-to-tell

After her mother died of the same poison that’s slowly killing her sister, she’s running out of options—and also time. Her hopes to save Shu’s life are now tethered to a competition in their kingdom’s capital. The princess has sent an invitation to all who study magical tea-making to compete for a chance to be the next royal shennong-shi. The odds are slim, but along with the title and prestige the winner will be able to ask the emperor for one favor. And what Ning needs more than anything is access to the best medical treatment in the kingdom for her dying sister.The competition is brutal, though, populated by underhanded tactics and ruthless contenders. And with a number of power plays and political maneuvers being enacted behind the scenes, Ning will have to be careful not to step into the line of fire. Judy I. Lin writes with a softer touch, even though the stakes are just as dire as other YA fantasies. But there’s something almost soothing about the description of her tea magic, no matter what is actually being depicted in the text. The blend of a cultural staple, like tea, with with traditional medicine and magic, is such an incredible way to incorporate real-world customs into fantasy, and I hope we see more of it. I’d love for tea magic to become its own its own sub-genre the way ‘wizard schools’ have.[image]This wasn’t as fast-paced as some others I’ve read recently, but it’s just as engaging as the best of them, especially by the end. The political components were fun to try to unravel. You think you understand who the major players are and where their loyalty lies, only for everything to be eventually flipped on its head.

I think I was expecting something a little more dynamic in a book revolving around a murder mystery, but it wasn’t bad.At a Chinese This was alright. I think I was expecting something a little more dynamic in a book revolving around a murder mystery, but it wasn’t bad.At a Chinese restaurant in Haven, Wisconsin, James is returning home from college to see his family for the holidays. His mother, Winnie, has recently left his domineering father, Leo Chao, and joined a convent. Also in town are James’ older brothers Dagou and Ming, one of whom never left Haven while the other got as far away from his roots as possible. They get together for a lavish meal prepared by the oldest brother, Dagou, and it devolves into a major conflict between Leo and the majority of his family.The next day the Chao patriarch is found dead, with suspicion immediately falling upon his three sons. One of the brothers is arrested and the other two look for exonerating information all while living under the community’s scrutiny. Though The Family Chao is centered around a mysterious death, at the heart is a tale of complex family dynamics and the inheritance of generational scars, especially amongst immigrant families.I’m actually little surprised at how late in the story Leo Chao dies, since the synopsis is so upfront about it. It was a little difficult for me to get a handle on the dynamics amongst the three sons, since so much of the build-up in the first act is about each of their relationships with their father. The most effective parts of the book for me ended up being when the Chao kids reflected on their experiences living in Haven as the children of immigrants. It was really interesting to see how the same circumstances manifested differently in each of them.I feel like there was a disconnect between everything leading up to the dinner and the eventual trial after the fact. A lot was lost in the time jump, and I never really regained my footing within the narrative. However, that second act ended up containing some of the more incisive criticism of white American racism, both institutional and individual. The take down of so-called “animal lovers” who value a hypothetical pet over the actual lives of humans (and animals killed for food and consumer goods, while we’re at it) was especially well done. As was the commentary on the overlap of online conspiracies, hate campaigns and racism. Overall I enjoyed the book!

I wantNow a Goodreads Choice nominee in Young Adult Fantasy & Science Fiction!I don’t think Lost in the Never Woods got all the way there for me. I wanted to like it so much more than I did, and I’m disappointed that Aiden Thomas’ sophomore novel couldn’t fill that role.Many of the elements from a traditional Peter Pan story are present here. There’s the Darling family: Wendy, Michael and John. There’s Peter himself listening at their window. There’s the Lost Children and a misbehaving shadow. But in this modern day version, Wendy has just turned 18 and volunteers at the hospital where her mother works. The sole one of her siblings to reappear after the three Darling children vanished five years ago, Wendy and her parents have barely been able to move on from that traumatic event. They haven’t really processed the implications of her brothers’ disappearances and only seem to be going through the motions of living.But then the boy from her stories, Peter Pan, crashes into Wendy’s reality and asks for her help locating his missing shadow. And almost simultaneously kids in the area have started to disappear again. So as Wendy sets off to help Peter once more, she hopes that she’ll be able to find answers on what happened to her and her brothers all those years ago.The biggest sin this book commits is that so much of the plot is just…..absent. It’s 80% waiting around for things to happen and 15% reacting to things. I have no explanation for why it stalled so much other than Thomas had to put off the actual storyline until later in the book or it wouldn’t be full novel-length. Sure, there’s circumstances where it makes sense to delay action-y sequences for later, but it didn’t match the tone of the story. Children are missing, there’s some sort of monster running around and neither Peter nor Wendy appear to have the motivation to investigate more than an hour each day. There was a particular scene where instead of looking for her brothers, the two of them go and get ice cream, that was so jarring to read. Or one where Wendy flirted with a stranger in a parking lot moments after watching a boy be snatched. I genuinely believed there was something more nefarious going on with Peter, possibly influencing her to just forget that all these kids *she knows* are vanishing, but nope. They both just couldn’t be bothered most of the time. There was no sense of urgency in their actions or in the writing.I didn’t like the ending either. I won’t spoil it, but I think the author was going for a realist/gut-punch finale that didn’t end up carrying the emotional weight it was trying to. By that point the book had meandered so much that I was mostly relieved it was coming to an end. Lost in the Never Woods wasn’t bad or the worst thing I’ve read recently, but I just wish I had prioritized something else.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Nov 13, 2021","Nov 19, 2021","Nov 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39897752-lost-in-the-never-woods

Did you have to suspend a lot of your disbelief and just kinda let it do its thing? Yeah, and once I did I was having so much fun. I’ve seen a bunch of comps thrown around for it: Pretty Little Liars, The Descendants, Once Upon a Time, Riverdale, and to all of those I say yes! Correct! Spot on! It’s just as insane yet strangely compelling as all of those. [image]Four has now become three, as friends Ella, Yuki and Rory attempt to cope with the sudden death of their friend and classmate Ariane. The students of the elite Grimrose Académie are accustomed to a certain level of access and freedom moving about their prestigious campus, and most seem ready to accept that what happened to Ariane was nothing more than an unfortunate accident. But Ella and Rory have a hard time accepting that, and between Arianes’s death and the arrival of Grimrose’s newest student, Nani Eszes, there seem to be a lot more questions lurking around these old halls than answers. Their search for clues turns up an old book, a bloody legacy and an increasing amount of danger. And in order to survive these Grimrose girls will have to work together to save themselves and their peers from a curse looking to swallow their school whole.I think the best part of The Grimrose Girls for me was reading it with someone else. Being able to swap theories and cross-reference our own fairytale knowledge was not just great for guessing what may happen, but an incredibly fun way to engage with the story. If you’re a fan of looking for Easter eggs in media or like thinking through potential references across interconnecting stories, then you’ll have a ball with The Grimrose Girls. Seriously—Marvel fans, Swifties, millennials addicted to Buzzfeed quizzes that says what kind of Disney Princess you are based on your three favorite breakfast foods—this is the book for you![image]I’ve seen a number of lower ratings peppered throughout this page, and sorry to all you nerds but you are joyless! C'est la vie, nerds!!!!!! I’m mostly kidding, but I do think you’ve gotta go into The Grimrose Girls with the right mindset in order to get the most out of it. Like every teen drama on tv, they’re not going to be doing homework. Sometimes the rules exist and sometimes they don’t. There’s magic! The perspectives jump around a lot and the entire plot moves quickly. Also not everything is explained in detail in this book because it’s ~part of a series~. But none of these make something inherently bad, and all of it just worked for me as it was.I’m absolutely desperate for the sequel. I can’t wait to solve the cursed-princess-castle-murder-mystery-party and feel more vindication for correctly guessing the corresponding fairytales being referenced. Just a straight shot of endorphins. Love it, Pohl has found a new fan in me.*Thanks to Madison (@momandmadread), Paige (@paigethroughbooks) and Sourcebooks Fire for my giveaway copy!!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Nov 09, 2021","Nov 12, 2021","Nov 02, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50638223-the-grimrose-girls

Stephen King books are hard to ,Yet another book  I’ve been sitting on for weeks, but I feel like I kind of have a good reason this time! Stephen King books are hard to , both because there’s so much to say but also nothing that hasn’t been said already. And especially since I’ve really only read the most mainstream of his books, including this one, it’s difficult not to be influenced by a cultural impact that’s been around before I was even born.But having nothing new to say has never stopped me before, so why start now! I haven’t seen The Shining movie outside of the few famous scenes that have been meme-d to death prior to the internet’s existence. You all know the premise—husband, wife and son move into a big empty hotel, husband goes crazy, wife is screaming, evil ghost twins, elevator of blood, etc. [image]Some of those most iconic moments from the film didn’t actually appear in the novel, and like all adaptations a number of significant book scenes didn’t make the cut. I can’t do a direct comparison because, again, I have not seen the movie, but I also feel as though the complexities of Jack’s relationship with his family were smoothed over during that process too. Because while, yes, The Shining is a story about a haunted hotel, its emotional narrative went a lot deeper than that. This is a book about a man so caught up in his own self-aggrandized myth that he would rather burn everything and everybody around him to the ground than have to face his own inadequacies.It was nearly impossible for me to feel anything than complete contempt for Jack Torrance, both before and after he moves into the Overlook Hotel. Was he supposed to be a flawed but still sympathetic character? I’m not sure, but I didn’t have any pity for his situation, only that of Wendy and Danny. In a place filled with actual ghosts and murderous shrubbery, you would think that some of the paranormal aspects would be the scariest parts. But the real horror of The Shining lies in the utter familiarity of the type of man Jack Torrance is. How this kind of person believes the ultimate sin in this world that everyone doesn’t stand and applaud his obvious brilliance. And that the world’s indifference or scorn is an unforgivable act that must be punished, violently if necessary, by his own hand.[image]At this point I assume all writers in Stephen King novels are self-inserts on some level, and I see that being the case here. Not necessarily for the (view spoiler)[domestic violence (hide spoiler)], but the parallels between King’s own addiction demons at the time he wrote this. Jack feels like he’s failing his family and failing to live up to his own expectations for himself. It’s hard for him to get back to his work, you know, writing, and also be the kind of husband and father he always imagined himself as. It would be a lot more relatable, I think, if Jack wasn’t also a piece of shit, but still King seems to give him a pass overall.This book is a product of its time as much as it is a product of its author. Not that (view spoiler)[hurting your wife and child (hide spoiler)] was ever acceptable, but it didn’t seem to be a total dealbreaker in redeem-ability in the 70s when this was written. Still, (view spoiler)[you don’t see the hotel turning mothers and children into hammer-wielding murderers (hide spoiler)], and that’s for a reason. In the US 88% of homicides are committed by men and 76% of reported domestic violence is committed against women. Wendy and Danny’s terrifying ordeal isn’t necessarily that much of a departure from reality.[image]Other King mainstays, like terrifying kids, a bloated page count, liberal use of the n-word, etc. are all present too. I know the majority of this  has been dissecting Jack and what King was trying to accomplish with his character, but I was still able to sit back and enjoy this book for the most part. It’s scary and unnerving, like feeling someone following you and turning around to find nobody there. If you’re a fan of King’s other books you’ll likely enjoy The Shining.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,"Oct 27, 2021","Oct 30, 2021","Oct 31, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18741226-the-shining

It’s presented as something a little more[image]Now a Goodreads Choice finalist in Fiction!!Notes on and Execution came to me highly recommended. It’s presented as something a little more contemplative than the rest of the mystery/thriller genre, and I’d have to agree with that. This story could have easily been packaged as your standard thriller, a cold case with a plucky detective following a trail that’s personally close to her. But that’s not the route Danya Kukafka chooses to go; instead she takes the wind out of those sails immediately. We know how it ends, we know who is responsible and we know he is going to die. Told through a series of flashbacks and roving perspectives, Notes on an Execution performs a type of contact tracing (pardon the use of a pandemic phrase) through Ansel Packer’s life. Ansel has been sentenced to die for a slew of murders he confessed to, with the present day chapters beginning in the 12 hours leading up to that event. The chapters set in the past utilize the POV of three different women, all connected to Ansel in some way: Lavender, Hazel and Saffy. These are not the women who’s paths he altered the most, but ones that feel a degree removed from his immediate orbit. Because what this novel is first and foremost is a measure of impact, not origin. Ansel is the meteor that crashes into the planet’s surface, shifting the plates even in places he didn’t hit directly. The idea of causation, what drives someone like Ansel to hurt others, is discussed quite a bit, but with no firm position taken. There’s evidence provided for either, or both, though that’s as far as Kukafka chooses to go.But as I was reading this I kept myself what the collective fascination with men that do these things is? Why do we care? Should we? I’m not particularly interested in empathizing or sympathizing with men who hurt women because they can, even in a fictional space. There’s an anthropologic argument for a figurative post-mortem examination of these men after the fact, but the societal fixation on them goes way beyond that. I don’t fully buy the excuse that they’re important to study in order to learn how to prevent the same cycle from repeating again. I think we really just want to see how much of our own selves is reflected back at us from them.Because whatever we wish to learn about someone like Ansel, there is little evidence that they will learn anything in return, besides ways to better manipulate those around them. All the women in the novel who were affected show remorse or regret for what they believe is their own complicity in the violence. Everyone except Ansel seems to have the capacity and, importantly, willingness to confront their own actions. Ansel still blames every woman around him, and to an extent some vague idea of the ‘universe’, for what he alone did. All of this is acknowledged by Kukafka to some extent. She may also be trying to draw attention to the same issues with media consumption of stories like this by writing it in this way. But by also writing a story about a psychopath serial killer, isn’t she just feeding into that obsession as well? I’m not convinced the portions that explore that idea are anything more than clever lampshding.By the end of this book I was tired. I imagine the people raving about Notes on an Execution felt similarly, too. It’s not a light book, designed to challenge the reader, not necessarily to entertain. But for me, it was really a chore to get through the Ansel chapters at the end. He mourns for nobody but himself, with his ridiculous “theory” well-depicted by Kukafka as another method to deflect blame and elevate himself above the inelegance of murder. But its constant repetition, especially of the refrain that ‘one small choice would have changed everything’, makes me wonder if we were supposed to take some of that to heart as well. That line of thinking sounds like a soft exoneration to me, and I don’t like it.There’s a sort of epilogue at the end, and it didn’t work for me. It was full of hypotheticals of what the women would be doing if they were still alive, which is nice in theory but reading it felt like an afterthought. Without that section, though, Ansel would be given the last word. Maybe I would have appreciated it more if the women left living got to send off the book instead, but who knows. Overall a lot to think about, but not the home run I was expecting.*Thanks to William Morrow & Netgalley for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,"Dec 19, 2021","Jan 05, 2022","Oct 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57773248-notes-on-an-execution

The set up for A History of Wild Places was intriguing enough, even if it was a little long-winded in getting to its eventual destination. Travis Wren is a private investigator of sorts, but a reluctant one. His ability to ‘read’ objects and see what their previous owners were doing in the past is as unusual as it is useful in his line of work. And he’s going to need every bit of those skills to locate missing author Maggie St. James, who disappeared five years ago. We follow Travis as he retraces Maggie’s steps to her last known location, and then beyond that. It’s on this journey following strange markings in the woods that we get cut off from Travis’ point of view. We do not hear from him again, and instead switch to the perspectives of three people living in a kind of haunted version of those very same woods. Husband and wife Theo and Calla live with Calla’s blind sister, Bee, in a community known as the Pastoral. They’ve lived there their entire lives and have never ventured outside of its close borders. Lately a sickness has been spreading through the trees, known as the Rot, that makes travel outside of the Pastoral too dangerous for anyone to embark on. But Theo and Calla start uncovering things, pieces of someone else’s history, and they begin to question what they’ve been told. It’s kind of a perfect storm for a creepy and unsettling atmosphere. An unknown disease, the makings of a cult, total isolation from society—plus a slew of disappearances associated with the area. So why didn’t this book deliver? I think it might be too much of a slow-burn for what we eventually got. I guessed the big ‘secret’ pretty early on, and was disappointed that I ended up being right, because it wasn’t a super thrilling answer. Instead of fully leaning into the eeriness and mysticism, Shea Earnshaw seemed to pump the breaks at the end, for what reason I’m not sure. I might not have been so disappointed if it wasn’t such a trek to get there in the end. Really, the entire plot was hanging on this ~mystery~ being dangled in front of the audience, and to me it just wasn’t worth the effort. I can appreciate the writing and the world-building around such a cool and fascinating location, but why put all that effort in for the equivalent of (view spoiler)[iT wAs AlL a DrEaM (hide spoiler)]? A History of Wild Places was not so much ‘genre-bending’ as it was not sure what it was trying to be.I think the author has plenty of talent and clearly some great ideas, but didn’t stick the landing for me here. I’d like to try reading more from her granted she’s fully committed to that premise and sees it through til the end.*Thanks to Atria Books for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,1,111,1,"Oct 25, 2021","Nov 13, 2021","Oct 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56898223-a-history-of-wild-places

Edgewood has so Let me preface this by saying that I think this book will have a very enthusiastic audience who loves absolutely everything about it. Edgewood has so many popular YA fantasy components that I almost don’t get why it didn’t work for me. But it didn’t, and though I wish I enjoyed my time with Edgewood more, unfortunately it was a slow, resigned march for me towards the end.I should have known Emeline would be at least somewhat insufferable the moment she was revealed to be a musician. But alas, I was thinking about Taylor Swift and missed all the signs. Emeline is trying to make it as an up-and-coming folk artist and things seem to be finally turning in her favor. She’s abandoned her own songs and vision, and as a result might be on the edge of her big break. But everything in her new life has to be put on hold when her old one comes knocking. Her grandfather who raised her has disappeared from the assisted living facility where he was staying, and Emeline must return to her hometown of Edgewood to find him.But Edgewood isn’t only a little backwater town, the residents are highly superstitious and believe that Emeline’s grandfather hasn’t just wandered away—he’s been tithed. Every year the town’s citizens leave offerings to the Wood King in the hopes that they are spared from tragedy, but Emeline has never believed this. Regardless, she goes searching for him in the woods beyond the town, only to stumble head-first into a world she could barely imagine. And now if Emeline wants to save her grandfather and herself she will have to use her talents and intuition to escape the wrath of the creatures that reside beyond the border.I don’t think there are any specific fantasy tropes that I’m turned off of, but sometimes there are just so many piled on top of one another that it’s hard to see an actual plot underneath it all. And that’s what I feel like happened here. There’s no real rules to the magic of the forest and everything seems made up as they go along. None of the character interactions feel genuine. She goes on almost the same ‘quest’ a half a dozen times, like the author just hit copy/paste in the middle so she could get to the later bits. Most of the conflict isn’t super well thought out, the entire story written with a destination in mind but only a half-baked plan on how to get there.The ‘real world’ parts weren’t any better for me, unfortunately, and didn’t feel as urgent as the portions in the forest. Any time people gushed about Emeline’s singing or songs, I found it cringey. Not sure if the author has her own experience with the music industry, but it’s hard to effectively capture music in writing. So much of the story is centered around Emeline’s ~amazing talent~ as a singer, and there’s nothing for the reader to base that belief on besides being told she is repeatedly and a smattering of so-so lyrics.And sorry, I’m so sick of these awful love interests. Hawthorne never misses an opportunity to talk to down to Emeline, dismiss her autonomy and ~physically lift her~ whenever he feels like it. I don’t have a problem with characters who do bad things, but when they’re one of the ‘good guys’ and everything they do is being romanticized, I can’t let it go unacknowledged. Also, he’s pretentious in like a forest nymph-Jake Gyllenhaal way, except not at all worth writing an album about. (view spoiler)[And Hawthorne is so gross for stealing Emeline’s memories away, against her will, then participating in ANY kind of relationship with her while she doesn’t remember. And those naked drawings of her as a teenager??? Oh my god, move over Edward-Cullen-watching-you-sleep, we have the new creepiest YA male protagonist. Pretty sure he’s holding onto child porn of his ex girlfriend but I guess we are fine with that or something!!!!!! (hide spoiler)]I see some of what the author was going for, though, especially with the themes of forgetting and remembering. The note at the end was a sweet tribute to someone in her life, and makes me wish that it all came together for me. The cover art is beautiful, and I could have seen myself falling for Edgewood if there was even half as much character development for literally anyone that’s not Hawthorne or Emeline. But oh well, maybe next time.*Thanks to Wednesday Books for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Nov 24, 2021","Dec 07, 2021","Oct 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693515-edgewood

The cover is to die for and the synopsis quickly sunk its claws into me, which is why it’s one of the first few 2022 books I’ve started to dig into. And yet, I just don’t think Portrait of a Thief ended up reaching its full potential. It’s a case of trying to do so much that you end up failing at covering the basics.The story hit the ground running—one of our five protagonists, Will Chen, is working at the Sackler Museum when a crew clad in all black breaks in and robs them of their Chinese art. Through this chance encounter Will gets drawn into a power play bigger than he could ever imagine, and decides to bring his friends along for the ride. In haphazard attempt to imitate the kind of teams seen in the movies, Will recruits his sister Irene ‘the conman’, her roommate Lily Wu ‘the getaway driver’, his old friend Daniel Liang ‘the thief’ and his former flame Alex Huang ‘the hacker’. They decide to take an impossible job for an impossible goal: to return to China what the West has pillaged in the name of imperialism.And this is where it started to go wrong for me, because none of these allegedly smart 20-somethings have a goddamn idea what they’re doing. They coordinate via text message and WhatsApp. The big planning session, you know where they figure out how they’re going to commit international crimes, takes place on a—wait for it—Google Doc. The largest issue with their scheming is the amount of inconsistencies. Sometimes there’s encrypted calls, they all have flawless fake IDs, but then they also just carry stolen art in their luggage at commercial airports. It’s so insane it’s almost incredible.And I understand that’s probably intentional to a point, but my problem is that nobody would hire these random college kids to do anything like this. It’s a heist, so there’s always going to be some level of suspension of disbelief in order to buy into what’s happening. But this isn’t a popcorn thriller or a action-y blockbuster movie-as-a-book either. It’s a critique of Western colonialism and imperialism dressed up as a fun ensemble heist. And while I would love to read some ridiculous Ocean’s Eleven-style romp as well as a novel that challenges the Eurocentric global power structure, I don’t quite think they fit together here.Because don’t get me wrong, the best part of Portrait of a Thief was the reflections of each of the characters on their own experiences as members of the Chinese American diaspora. They’re such a complex, nuanced meditation that I can only assume Grace D. Li is pulling from her own feelings on the subject in some capacity here. But its delivery works against those very points the author is trying to make. Some of the musings on art, history and the West’s imperial legacy, while astute and true, felt very shoehorned into conversations where they didn’t belong. There’s entire lengths of dialogue that doesn’t lend itself into a natural back and forth, and yet these 21 year-olds are conversing like they’re grad students defending their dissertations. Great points, less successful execution.The characters I think with the most to offer end up being the three outside of the main two siblings, Will and Irene. I would have loved a story of just Alex, Daniel and Lily without the toxic influences of the Chen’s. Will and Irene are entitled, arrogant and spoiled in different but complimentary ways and seem to have the weakest motivations to get involved in the first place, yet are pushing forward the most. That said, even though I did not like either of them, per say, I do appreciate the additional perspectives on being first generation children of immigrants in the US.Despite my criticisms, I didn’t dislike this book. There’s too much good material present to set it aside, but I am a bit disappointed after hyping it up in my head as something it didn’t end up being. Maybe this would work better as a show or movie, which is something we can all weigh in on down the road as it’s been optioned by Netflix already. But if Portrait of a Thief does end up making it through that pipeline, I hope for a better balance between the art theft and character development.

Every time I feNow a Goodreads Choice nominee in Fantasy!Recently someone told me they’re “tired of retellings”, which I cannot at all relate to. Every time I feel myself approaching that thought I see another fairytale retelling advertised somewhere and I’m like “Ooooh?!?!!???”, immediately falling down a new rabbit hole.But if you feel this way, even though you are wrong, I can understand where that feeling comes from. Sometimes you see your millionth YA Fantasy Beauty and the Beast retelling and it’s like OH MY GOD, ENOUGH. But what I think separates the good ones, like A Spindle Splintered from the ones that make me want to walk into the ocean, like the Camila Cabello adaptation of Cinderella, are one of two things. Either the fairytale is a less prominent one, like Little Thieves’ take on The Goose Girl, or it significantly challenges the source material while also honoring the important pieces of it.And while you could definitely argue that though Sleeping Beauty is a famous princess, she’s not usually the most enticing one for authors to emulate, I think Alix Harrow’s novella A Spindle Splintered falls more in the second category than the first. Zinnia Gray, a girl with a degenerative illness, is Harrow’s take on the titular character from the original fable. After pricking her finger on a spinning wheel, Zinnia falls through a sort of fantastical princess multi-verse and ends up crashing into someone else’s story. Desperate to escape her own looming ending, Zinnia tries to save another Beauty as a last ditch effort to also save herself.This is a novella, and around one third the size of a full-length fantasy novel. For me, this was perfect for the story being told here. Anything more could have easily turned into a big bloated mess, unnecessarily adding filler in order to reach some arbitrary page quota. Instead, what we got was a funny, emotional and sharp examination of a classic fairytale that has traditionally symbolized the lack of agency for female characters in their own stories. Instead of allowing the pieces on the board to move around her, Zinnia seizes her fate and bends it to her own will, and I loved every minute of it.I’m sure there’s some people who think anything that diverges from the ‘traditional’ telling they’re used to is a kind of bastardization of the story. This is ridiculous for a number of reasons, not least of all because there is no true original versions. Humans have twisted our stories to accommodate the times we live in since we first started telling them, and your own personal, rose-colored nostalgic interpretation is not inherently correct. The idea of an innumerable amount of renderings of Sleeping Beauty and other princess stories is brought up in Spindle, with the opening to introduce even more into this literary universe. And I am so excited to see what tale Alix Harrow spins for us next....more",Notes are private!,0,103,1,"Oct 06, 2021","Oct 07, 2021","Oct 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56179356-a-spindle-splintered

Even though I ended up DNFing Elizabeth Lim’s debut Spin the Dawn, the cover alone was enough to make excited to pick up this first book in a new series.Kiata has long been free of magic, both cast out from its borders and hidden under a mountain. Unless you are Shiori, the youngest child and only daughter of the Emperor, of course. The young princess possesses some of this forbidden magic, but so does her step-mother, Raikama, who upon finding out curses Shiori and her six brothers. They are expelled from the palace, and while the boys are transformed into cranes, Shiori loses access to her magic. In an extra twist of cruelty, Raikama’s curse makes Shiori unrecognizable as the princess and forbids her from speaking. For every word she utters will bring about the deaths of one of her brothers. After their banishment, Shiori and her feathered brethren must work to break their step-mother’s curse and protect their kingdom from a dark and looming threat.[image]It took a bit of time for me to get into this, and I’ve been trying to figure out why that is. I was afraid for the first third to half of the book it was going to be another DNF, but luckily either I or the story found its bearings. I usually don’t have a problem with fast-moving plots, especially in YA fantasy, but for some reason the pacing here was a little off. Things would stall for a bit only to then rapidly move through pivotal plot turns and action sequences as if they didn’t hold consequence to the story. My impression is that Lim isn’t as comfortable writing those kinds of scenes, so she tries to get through them as quickly as possible. Perhaps I’m just used to more detailed descriptions of action or fighting sequences, but they felt rushed overall for me.The other issue I had was that even thought there was less time spent on action, there still wasn’t enough focus on characters either. There were no character deep dives into their motivation outside of some superficial descriptors, and as a result I felt held at arms-length from everything they were going through. And because I didn’t know the characters that well, it was difficult to know whether something they were doing was in-character or not. Is this normal for Shiori? Her brothers? Raikama? I don’t know, and I think some of the important revelations later on would have been more impactful if I understood these people better.I will say that Lim writes sensory aspects really well. There’s such great descriptions of the landscape, their clothing and the food—basically everything that brings a place and time to life. I never had any doubt as to where we were and how we were supposed to feel while there. And the second half of the book salvaged the plot for me, though I wish it didn’t take so long to get there. While I was still reading I wasn’t sure I’d be interested in picking up the sequel, but now that I’ve finished I assume that I probably will.[image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,92,1,"Sep 27, 2021","Oct 08, 2021","Sep 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55725741-six-crimson-cranes

And for theMy first impression after reading blurbs and the synopsis was that Hotel Magnifique was essentially The Night Circus, but make it ✨hotel✨. And for the first third or so it was pretty much exactly that. Two sisters, Jani and Zosa, are trying to escape their difficult lives in the town of Durc, and finally get the opportunity to when the famous, magical Hotel Magnifique makes an appearance. They each take jobs in the hotel, which is as bizarre as it is enchanting, and can hardly believe they could be so lucky. I’d read The Night Circus years ago and while I enjoyed it I wasn’t super interested in reading a re-hash of it. As a result the beginning of this story was kind of boring for me. Eventually, though, the book took a darker turn, with everything that glittered before starting to look a little more nefarious under a different light. For the next two-thirds of the novel the author relished prying off the story’s shiny paneling to reveal the rot hiding beneath. And at first I really loved this too, but after a while even that started to take on a repetitive quality.I don’t want to get too into the specifics of what went on, but for the most part we followed Jani and her attempts to uncover secrets of the hotel and its employees. I liked a lot of pieces of the story, but some of how it was fitted together didn’t quite make a complete whole for me. The magic veered into vague and there wasn’t much in the way of explanations on how it all worked—it felt like a lot of hand-waving ~magic~ instead of a tangible system. The story just wasn’t as dazzling or dreamy as I think it wishes it was.I kind of wish I had more to say on my experience with Hotel Magnifique. The ending wrapped up a little quickly, given how long it took us to get to the interesting parts in the beginning. But other than that, I’ve got nothing else! It didn’t leave as much of an impression as I was hoping it would, especially since there was plenty of good material to work with. But for a fantasy that’s a bit off the beaten path, it does its job.*Thanks to Penguin Teen for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,200,1,"Oct 14, 2021","Oct 17, 2021","Sep 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55812605-hotel-magnifique

For one, she’s a nun-in-training, who are usually not found gallivanting about on magical adventures (unfortunately). Instead she helps tend to dead bodies and their spirits after they’ve passed on. Taken in by the convent as a child, Artemisia is not looking for anything other than the simple, predictable life of a Gray Sister. But the Lady appears to have made other plans for her.After a sequence of jarring events, Artemisia finds herself in possession of a reliquary, but also possessed by the corresponding revenant. Possession isn’t at all like she expected it to be, though, and once Artemisia and her revenant stop attempting to kill one another, they actually develop a delightfully snarky dynamic. Between the two of them, an easily-ruffled former roommate of Artemisia’s, Marguerite, and a wonderfully affable horse, you could almost forget the maniacal priest or vengeful spirits chasing them down.If you do decide to pick up this book, I cannot recommend the audiobook enough. The narrator, Caitlin Davies, flies between extremes in character and temperament. One moment shes half-growling as the revenant, the next squeaking terrified replies as Marguerite. She brings so much comedic timing to what could easily turn into a drab chronicle of monochromatic nuns. I deeply enjoyed the color she injected into these characters and would love to listen to more from her.I do think the magic needed more explaining. It was a lot of the author simply telling us the way something was as opposed to explaining how it works. What are the rules? Where does the power originate? What are the limits? It appeared to expand and contract at times based on how it was needed to forward the plot in that moment, and left me partially unfulfilled. An itch not entirely scratched.I wasn’t exactly sure how I was going to rate this. I’ve been teetering between 4 and 5 stars, but I think that’s probably going to hold it back for me. Maybe as a stand-alone it actually would have worked better—what’s the point of getting deep into the mechanics if the magic is just a vehicle for a fun, character-driven fantasy? But with the announcement of a series, I’m going to be expecting a stronger foundation on which to build. But the upside is there’s now an opportunity for Margaret Rogerson to fill in those gaps if she wishes to, so I’ll be looking forward to that! **For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Dec 28, 2021","Jan 08, 2022","Sep 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56980403-vespertine

It’s not my typical read, despite there being ✨magic✨ present, but it grew on me as the story went on. Did Dennis trick me into reading a period romance disguised as a fantasy? Yes, but at least he didn’t lie about how engaging it was. I alternated between the audio and the physical copy, and will fully admit the first 15% or so I had no idea what was going on. I definitely could have focused a little harder and kept from occasionally zoning out during the audio, but in my defense the beginning was kind of dull. The two main characters, Edwin and Robin, were meant to be foils to one another in many ways, but I could not keep them straight (lol) for the longest time. I eventually just started ignoring the names and figured out who was who based on whichever one was acting the grumpiest (Edwin). Without getting too much into it, Robin accidentally takes a job at magical office, despite knowing nothing of magic and having none of the ability himself. He crosses paths with Edwin who is looking for his predecessor, and the two of them end up also being pursued by an unknown party looking for the man Robin replaced. They bop around to different aristocratic, posh magical estates looking for clues, and eventually a begrudging partnership grows into something more substantial.I was warned or informed, depending on your preference, that as prim and proper as A Marvellous Light may appear, there’s a heavy ‘steam’ factor (am I saying that right) in the novel as well. But please do not expect this to happen in the first half of the book, they can barely look at each other until you’ve gotten through at least 150 pages. But once the gloves are off, everything comes off so to speak. Oh god, I’m speaking in entendres—send help.But yes, there is some light use of magic, though its existence is central to the plot. There are a number of magical orgasms too, and the romance is decidedly not closed door. It’s got a Downton Abbey feel, but more fantastical and gay! I liked it a lot overall, and I’d be interested to see where this supposed trilogy ends up going.*Thanks to @scaredstraightreads & Tordotcom for my giveaway win!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Nov 22, 2021","Nov 30, 2021","Sep 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56179340-a-marvellous-light

She finished in a day and I took like three weeks What was originally supposed to be a buddy read with Chelsea went about as well as ours usually go. She finished in a day and I took like three weeks to read more than a couple of chapters. But finally, FINALLY, I have finished this book and I have some ~thoughts~.When she was 12 years old, Paloma was adopted by the Evans’ after they visited her orphanage in Sri Lanka. In the 18 years since then she’s lived a privileged life as the only daughter of wealthy philanthropists. Now that she’s financially cut off from them, living with a roommate in a small apartment, the least Paloma can hope for is some kind of stability. When she comes home one night and walks in on her dead roommate she blacks out, only to wake up and find his body and all his belongings gone as if he never existed in the first place. Haunted by both ghosts from her present and past, Paloma must try to unravel the secrets of both versions of her life if she wants to discover what’s real and what isn’t.My Sweet Girl is told from two perspectives, one being Paloma as a child leading up to her adoption by an American couple, and the other in present day immediately after the death of her roommate, Arun. I do want to preface this  by saying I guessed the big plot twist early on. I don’t think it’s a particularly tough one to piece together if you read even a moderate amount of books in this genre, fair warning. The problem isn’t necessarily that I figured out the twist, which has happened before with other thrillers. But that so much of the story is wrapped around that singular twist that it’s hard to really enjoy anything else if you do in fact know what’s going to happen. Instead of feeling a sense of uncanniness, the majority of the time I spent reading felt tedious and like a waiting game. I kept thinking, ‘yeah yeah, can she just get on with it already’, which isn’t how I want to experience a book.It also was just too long and drawn out, and the tension turned irritating in a way I didn’t like. There’s an unreliable narrator, sure, but she was so unreliable that it was hard to empathize with her at all. Every person around her was incompetent or obnoxious, sometimes both. I don’t know, I just didn’t really take to the modern day portions at all. The parts set in the Sri Lankan orphanage were much more compelling, and now I want to read a book about a haunted orphanage instead.I also think some of the big interpersonal conflict wasn’t executed that well, at least for the adults in present day. I’m not sure exactly what it was, but they felt off. (view spoiler)[Is it bad I was rooting for the real Paloma to kill Lihini and her parents the entire time? This wasn’t a sad twist at the end at all. I hope she gets everything she wants. Not sure if the villain monologue Paloma gave was supposed to turn us against her, but the more sinister aspects felt really forced. I hate when authors use shocking murder confessions to try and influence the reader against siding with one character. (hide spoiler)]I think this genre might need a bit of a shakeup. There doesn’t seem to be much a divergence from the typical formula of these types of thrillers lately, and they’re all feeling kind of stale. Maybe it’s just me, but I think I’d prefer better developed characters over the same types of predictable twists. They’re the literary equivalent of jump scares to me at this point.

I hope you’re happy now, Chloe!!!!![image]I’m not going to include any spoilers for either this book or These Violent Delights, so nobody needs to worry about having this duology ruined for them accidentally. But that probably means that it will be a little shorter, a little more vague than my usual s. So bear with me here as I try to unpack all the ~feelings~ I’ve been floating around in for the past few days since I’ve finished Our Violent Ends.The biggest difference I noticed between the first book and the sequel has been the focus of the plot. There’s a lot more attention on the politics of Shanghai in this time period, eventually leading up to the Shanghai Purge of April 12, 1927 (you can google if you wish). While These Violent Delights had a supernatural monster terrorizing the city, the monsters of Our Violent Ends are the men pulling the strings. They’re the ones starting conflicts they won’t have to join the frontlines for, and who will do anything to grasp on to power for as long as possible. In that way, they’re even scarier to consider because they aren’t simply a figure of the author’s imagination, but fictionalized versions of real kinds of people.The pacing of this book also felt a lot more even, possibly because there wasn’t as much background that had to be introduced in a follow-up. More time is spent with the supporting characters and we get to understand their motivations outside of ‘how do we support Roma and Juliette in whatever schemes they’ve cooked up?’ And in my limited Shakespeare experience, the influence of Romeo and Juliet was much more pronounced in this novel than the previous. I noticed more parallels and direct references than I did with book one, though I still think both are fully their own stories. If you’ve been following Chloe Gong on social media (highly recommend fwiw), you may have seen references to her next book Foul Lady Fortune and how the main character of it is someone we already know.[image]Happy to report that when you finish Our Violent Ends you will know who this character is (probably). I’m hesitant to say much more about the ending other than it’s bittersweet, explosive and mostly definitive. After reading both of these books almost back-to-back, you can see how Chloe Gong has progressed as a writer, and I can’t wait to pick up with this imaginative world and character(s) in the future. That said, I’m fully satisfied with how this duology has progressed and am actually dying to talk about it with someone.*Thanks Margaret K.

The Keeper of the Night follows ReThis has to have been one of the coolest and most unique-sounding premises for a fantasy novel I’ve read this year. The Keeper of the Night follows Ren, a half Japanese Shinigami and half British Reaper, who lives with her brother Neven in London. After a dangerous run-in with fellow Reapers who have been maliciously targeting Ren for her mixed heritage, the siblings decide to flee the country instead of facing the wrath of their superiors. After a tumultuous journey they end up in Japan, where Ren is seeking out both the mother who abandoned her and the Japanese Goddess of Death.Her assigned tasks are both simple and immense: in order to join the Shinigami, Ren must destroy three Yōkai demons that are threatening the peace. Armed with only her clock, her brother and a new companion, Ren sets off to do the impossible and try to claim her place in Yomi, the Japanese underworld.[image]The absolute best part of the book was the lore around Reapers, Shinigami and all the Japanese mythological subjects. Some legends, like the nine-tailed fox, I was already somewhere familiar with, but others were completely new and occasionally terrifying. The Keeper of the Night is not a story about magical people exploring an enchanting new world, it’s about *literal* harbingers of death going from violently removing the souls of the soon-to-be deceased to violently killing other lethal supernatural beings. Nearly every character we meet has a brutal streak and is unafraid to act on it.While characterizations like this would normally a home run for me, on Ren it feels a little different. She’s not human and rarely acts like one, so everything she does has a layer of coldness covering it. Her brother, the only one who shows real humanity, is written off as weak whenever he shows this part of himself. Their relationship was both tenuous and devoted, but never quite reaching loving, so I had trouble seeing exactly how Ren felt about Neven. Yes she cares for him, but to what extent? This is a major theme in the book but I don’t feel as though we ever get a consistent answer to it.I ended up listening to this book only because I was approved for an ALC and not for an ARC, but if I had the option to do it again I might have just waited. It was a little hard, in a story with Japanese words and plenty of mythology from both Japan and England, to recognize and remember all of the new words the narrator was saying. I wasn’t confused necessarily, but at the very least I might have liked a reference list of unfamiliar terms. The narrator did a good job overall, but I think there might have less of a disconnect if I could have followed along on a digital or physical copy.Overall I liked it, just not as much as I thought I would. I feel like the ending came out of nowhere and eventually left me hanging, and I don’t know if my questions were intentionally left unanswered or not. I’m not sure if the next in the series will offer any clarity, but if I do end up picking it up, I’ll be sure to have a written copy handy.*Thanks to Dreamscape Media, Inkyard Press & Netgalley for an advance listening copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,84,1,"Sep 16, 2021","Sep 22, 2021","Sep 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56030267-the-keeper-of-night

And with something unknown and monstrous threatening people they love, the heirs to the White Flowers and the Scarlet Gang have little choice to put bad blood behind them for now in order to save their city. There was so much going on in this book. Luckily I am an agent of chaos so that worked perfectly fine for me. It may be a bit of a slow burn for people at first, but the tension is strong and the eventual climax is definitely worth it. I appreciated all of the ways we as readers were misled, but offered all the pieces needed to put together this supernatural mystery ourselves. It’s plotting with trapdoors and secret passageways—easy to get sucked into but hard to navigate.I don’t feel as though you need to remember much Romeo and Juliet from your English class to enjoy this retelling. The references are definitely there for anyone who’s looking for them, but These Violent Delights is very much a story standing on its own two feet. Personally, I saw much more West Side Story in the actual plot than anything else, but that makes sense when you consider both the source material and the setting. The way Chloe Gong is able into incorporate not just that story, but the historical and geopolitical context of that era is a balancing act of epic proportions. I remain beyond impressed that this was a debut novel that she wrote while in college.I’ve got the sequel, Our Violent Ends, sitting on my kindle right now and THANK GOD. Because, ahem, Ms. Gong???

And that was exactly the right word: epic. Like a classic narrative epic poem, Sue Lynn Tan recounts the story of Xingyin, daughter of banished immortal Chang'e, and her quest to free her mother and herself from their eternal confinement.From the moment Xingyin escapes the moon on a cloud (yes, really), there’s feeling of immensity to her story. And as we follow her down the path of self-discovery, I couldn’t help but match up each stage of her tale with the traditional Hero’s Journey—a la Joseph Campbell. From the three “acts”: Departure, Initiation (& Descent), and Return; to specific elements like ‘supernatural aid’ and ‘apotheosis’ (raising a mortal to a god-like level), Xingyin more than rivals classic Homeric heroes such as Odysseus and Achilles. She endeavors to staggering heights and perilous depths, and is at her strongest when she’s acting on the behalf of those she loves.[image]But in Xingyin’s quiet moments, we get to feel a number of dueling loyalties play out. Will she stay behind with the first boy in the Celestial Kingdom to show her true kindness, or will she follow the one who can help her achieve what she’s always wanted to be? Is Xingyin willing to sacrifice her own chance at happiness for a way to free her mother? Exactly how far is she willing to go in order to accomplish some of these goals? It would be reductive to say any of these questions fall into the expected fan-service style tropes. These motivations come so naturally to the character, and by extension the audience. Every bit of longing feels real and every betrayal fully stings. To read Daughter of the Moon Goddess is to become Xingyin, her strengths, flaws and internal discord all included.Every word of this over five hundred page novel is thoughtfully chosen, crafted with the utmost care. It’s poetic without being overly flowery, and never light on plot or action. While there’s many stages of the journey Xingyin goes on, it all feels like a natural extension—one story bleeding into the next. I’ve seen a few s mention how full this book is, that it could almost be split into two, but I think that would have been a mistake. Daughter of the Moon Goddess ends exactly where it should, with Xingyin completing this arc and preparing for whatever unknown is to come. And I can’t wait to embark with her on that one as well.[image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,265,1,"Dec 06, 2021","Dec 15, 2021","Sep 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57789637-daughter-of-the-moon-goddess

So when Madison suggested Defy the Night for our Fantasy Frenemies book club I wasn’t sure I would be into it, but I’m so happy to have been proven wrong![image]A deadly illness has been ravaging the kingdom of Kandala for years, the single cure being rare Moonflower petals that grow in only a handful of locations. After their parents death, King Harristan and Prince Corrick have been doing their best to deal with the contagion, though the cracks in their hold seem to be showing. Nobody knows how it’s spread, only the rich and powerful have access to treatment and the leaders of the two sectors that supply the flower are constantly at odds with the rest of the realm. And on top of the political and logistical tensions, there has been an uptick in smuggling of the precious petals….and whispers of rebellion amongst the common folks.There’s also people like Tessa and her partner Wes, who steal and redistribute the life-saving elixirs to people with the least means who need it the most. They may not be smugglers, but the ruthless crown under the iron grip of Prince Corrick, the King’s Justice, makes no distinction between stealing for profit or survival. But desperate people make desperate choices, and after Tessa suddenly finds herself on her own there’s even fewer options for this apothecary turned Robin Hood if she wants to keep providing relief for her people. [image]I did go back and read my A Curse So Dark and Lonely  to try pick out some of the differences between my experiences with the two. And wow, I forgot how mad I was after reading that book. My biggest issue seemed to be the two main characters, namely that the male love interest was terrible and irredeemable and the female lead was a typical ‘nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLs’ protagonist. I’m also going to throw out there that I hate Beauty and the Beast retellings so that may not be entirely on the author. I think, though, if you’re someone who had issues similar to me then you’re probably going to like Defy the Night much better. One of the most interesting things about Tessa Cade is just how common she is. There’s nothing ‘special’ about her in a fantastical chosen-one sense, she just deeply cares about other people. She sort of fell into the life she’s living through circumstance and having limited options, but does absolutely everything in her power to help her community that’s struggling. In this way she’s so much more relatable than some vague description of intangible superiority I’ve seen attached to other young, female main characters. *See: Harper (ACSDAL), Bella (Twilight), Feyre (ACOTAR), etc*And as far as love interests go, I’m not going to spoil anything here, but I will say that while there’s some moral greyness the character is not irredeemable. I think Kemmerer does a good job generally at writing each character in a way that is easy to, if not sympathize with, then at least understand where they’re coming from. Personally I found a few of the issues described that the king, prince and nobility were having to be a little, ehm, whiney in comparison to what the rest of the populace was dealing with. Harristan in particular seemed like a pretty lame king if he wasn’t allowed to *seize* things during an epidemic in his country. (even the US army could, like, march into Nebraska and take all their corn if it cured COVID so???? idk)[image]I enjoyed the romance in this book much more than Harper and Rhen in Cursebreakers, not like that was a super high bar to clear, but still. I bought into the struggle Tessa was having reconciling her past with her present and thought the relationship she has in this book was well-developed. And okay, I’ve got one petty complaint I’ll put under spoiler tags (view spoiler)[Yeah it might be difficult to start thinking of Wes as Corrick after years of knowing of them as two different people but OMG, the moment she starts saying his real name CAN SHE NOT FUCKING STOP???? You are in front of an angry mob that *hate* him!!!! She literally got his ass kicked, almost killed them both because she couldn’t stop going ”Oh, Corrick!” for five fucking seconds!!! TESSA. SHUT UP!!!!! Shut up before I shut you up you dummy (hide spoiler)]Overall, I loved this. It’s not a perfect book, and I’ve liked other ones more this year, but it was still a great read. I am so excited for the next in the series and clearly any misgivings I had about Kemmerer’s last book are more about that specific story and not her as an author.

Myra has the ability to alter people’s appearances and bodies by composing portraits of them, though it does come at a physical cost to her. Her parents and other ‘prodigies’ have disappeared, so she’s solely responsible for caring for her chronically-ill sister, Lucy, who’s health has been in decline for some time. When a wealthy client presents offers the chance to finally earn enough to pay for medical care for Lucy, Myra decides to attempt something she once had never thought possible—bring someone back to life.[image]What A Forgery of Roses then becomes is a kind of fantastical murder mystery, with Myra and her client’s son working together to find the dead man’s killer. The magic system is interesting, and out of all of the aspects of the story it’s probably the part that Jessica Olson spends the most time explaining the mechanics of. It’s a stand-alone that’s the length of a normal novel, not the massive doorstops we have been seeing more of in the YA fantasy space. So I wasn’t expecting Olson to delve too deeply into anything outside of the main storyline, but Myra’s world still felt very limited. I have no understanding of the town they live in, the government outside of the one governor, what life is like for the typical townsperson, etc. With all of the emphasis put onto the painting process each of the dozens of times Myra starts a portrait, some of the character development and other plot fell to the wayside.Myra is an okay protagonist, but her most compelling characteristic is her devotion to her sister, rarely having any thoughts outside of Lucy or her eventual love interest. Lucy is significantly more engaging, but unfortunately she spends a majority of the time unconscious or seriously sick and plays only a minor role. I never really came around to (view spoiler)[August (hide spoiler)], though I liked both the mental and chronic illness rep from him and Lucy. So while I appreciated the plights of each protagonist, it just seemed like they were missing that hook which would have endeared me to them. In the middle I think the book ended up dragging, and some of the storyline verged on goofy instead of spellbinding. But there isn’t much I can point to and offer specific solutions for; the issues I had aren’t that tangible. The best I can describe it is that A Forgery of Roses was a pleasant but passive reading experience for me. No major complaints, but it’s also a good thing I’m writing this right after finishing or I’d probably forget something significant.[image]*Thanks to Inkyard Press for a complimentary copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Apr 15, 2022",May 2022,"Aug 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51941042-a-forgery-of-roses

(completed on Dec 29th,  written….some days after)Mina did not plan on become the Sea God’s latest bride, only wishing to save her brother Joon from the storm’s wrath. But Joon followed the beautiful Shim Cheong out to sea when it was decided she would be sacrificed, and so Mina went after him. Then it all happens in a moment—Cheong hesitates, Joon steps out in front of her and Mina makes the decision to throw herself into the sea instead. But instead of being swallowed up and drowned by the thrashing waters, Mina is whisked away to the Spirit Realm, where the Sea God resides.She follows the Red String of Fate, a tie between Mina and her newly betrothed, through the empty town until she reaches the palace gates. Upon entry Mina finds the Sea God is not the all-powerful being she was expecting, and can’t imagine a life as his bride. Then with the flash of a blade, Mina’s fate is altered once more. And if she wants to save the human world, Mina will have to work together with a mysterious god named Shin, some rogue spirits who seem to know her already and an assortment of other inhabitants of the Spirit Realm.I’m going to start with what I’m sure is the burning question of anyone thinking of reading this book: ‘Is it actually just like Spirited Away?!??’ Yes and no, but I can definitely see where the comparison comes from. Obviously there’s the journey of a mortal girl into the Spirit Realm, as well as (view spoiler)[Chihiro trying to change her parents back from being pigs, while Mina is trying to turn her soul back from a magpie (hide spoiler)]. And I think both stories carry a certain level of high-stakes whimsy where everything around the protagonist is magical and interesting, but also potentially deadly and often fairly menacing. But apart from obvious plot differences, I think the tone of the two don’t entirely match up. The first half of The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea resembles it more because Mina is in a unfamiliar place, exploring and unsure of what the rules of her new environment are. She’s meeting strange people and you’re not quite sure whether they’re harmless or malevolent. The second half is more a traditional folklore, where the heroine must solve a problem in order to save the people she cares about. What I appreciated about The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea was the blending of myth from The Tale of Shim Ch'ŏng with original characters and storylines. It’s a retelling that realigns the focus onto characters that would normally exist in the periphery, but still feels exciting for readers who are not familiar with the source material. The book starts quickly, moves at an exciting, even pace and eventually comes to a fulfilling end that pays homage to the referenced mythology. Though not exactly Spirited Away, I could see this making a compelling anime in its own right. *Thanks to Fierce Reads for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,-1,140,1,"Dec 18, 2021","Dec 29, 2021","Aug 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56978100-the-girl-who-fell-beneath-the-sea

I have been thinking a lot about Only a Monster for the past week, not least of all because of how explosive the ending was. The journey from what I expected this book to be, to how I felt during the beginning, through to what I thought at the end was quite a ride.This was one of the more imaginative fantasy novels I’ve read recently, even in a year where more of my reading has been magic-adjacent than not. In my opinion, the Goodreads synopsis does not do it justice, so I’ll try to lay it out in a way that doesn’t use the phrase “super cute boy” multiple times. Joan is a teenager living in London with her mom’s side of the family, the Hunts, an quirky group that consists of her grandmother, cousins, aunts and uncles. She spends most of her free time at Holland House, a historical site, and after months of pining after one another her co-worker Nick finally asks her out. But right before meeting up with Nick Joan makes a devastating discovery about her family—that the Hunts are self-identified monsters and potentially dangerous to others. And because the description mentions it I will too: Nick is a much-prophesied monster slayer. Not much of a meet cute!So at this point in the book I was just kind of floating along, expecting the same kind of YA star-crossed-lovers-but-supernatural. Think Scott and Allison from Teen Wolf or Nina and Matthias from Six of Crows, one doomed to hunt the other despite misgivings. And I’m not saying that’s not what happens here, just that it’s not *all* that happens. I was convinced it was going to be dramatic, maybe a little soap-y, and kind of, well, basic.But man, I would never have guessed the thing that made the monsters so……monstrous. I’m gonna put this part in spoiler tags in case people haven’t seen anything about this plot detail yet. (view spoiler)[The time travel and method for doing so was so beyond what I thought this book was going to do. I’m not really a big time travel person, but it was so cleverly incorporated and the other family ‘power’ so minor in comparison. Maybe it’s that we’re so desensitized to time travel as a plot device at this point that I hadn’t considered the ramifications fully of ‘stealing time’ until Vanessa Len laid it all out so clearly.You know, I’m not sure the multiverse/time travel elements completely hold up logistically and scientifically, but that’s not necessarily something I’d ever try to go too deep into. In the end, these monsters operate in a way that’s not too different from previous ones, and that is with a complete disregard for human life. (hide spoiler)]I think I saw someone in an IG story say that Only a Monster reminds them of YA fantasy books they used to read as a teenager, and I absolutely love that idea. You could sit down, inhale this book in one sitting and be immediately desperate for more. The terminology used by Len is simplified, the kind of thing where you don’t need an entire world-specific thesaurus at the end for reference. The magic system itself is straight forward as well, and even though you can tell there’s more intricacies lying underneath that first layer, Len holds back from info-dumping all over the reader. You find out things as you need to, and are allowed to theorize in a way that doesn’t distract from what’s going on in that moment.What was holding me back from immediately stomping onto this site and throwing an easy five stars up is that it’s not a perfect novel. I think it ping-pongs around a little too much and could use some sharper dialogue. But as a debut, as a start of a series and as something new and exciting enough to be appealing to both veterans of the genre and newbies, I’m going to give it the fifth star. Mostly because I want you all to read it too and tell me what you think.*Thanks to Vanessa Len and her editor for the eARC!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks![image]also I’m obsessed with my Bernie/Only a Monster crossover meme, and I would still like a physical copy so I am not deleting the pic even though I read it lol...more",Notes are private!,0,130,1,"Nov 17, 2021","Nov 22, 2021","Aug 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58210340-only-a-monster

Especially with An inventive fantasy of hidden secrets, betrayals and, of course, ✨magic✨, I was thrilled to get my hands on a copy of The Ivory Key. Especially with a cover like that?!? I’m going to kindly request more abstract, colorful designs on fantasy covers going forward please.Vira is the maharani, queen of Ashoka, and her brother Ronak has refused to take up his place as her mayaka. With a sister, Riya, who’s run away from their family and another brother, Kaleb, currently imprisoned, there’s a lot that these four are going to have to work through if they want to restore magic to their people. But after the murder of Vira’s betrothed and the discovery of something that could lead the siblings to a long lost power source, it’s up to them whether or not they can put aside their competing agendas and save their home.⁣I liked the dynamic between the four siblings in this book the best. They had distinct personalities and motivations, with often conflicting points of view. Akshaya Raman did a good job shifting between their four perspectives and providing context for most of their choices. I’m not sure if writing four equally weighted voices created the strongest or most cohesive narrative, but I understand why she made that choice. Focusing on one over the others could bias the reader towards that perspective, and that’s not the story she was trying to tell. I think I was expecting more of an overall adventure vibe, like a magical treasure hunt through unknown lands. That does happen ~eventually~, but you have to get almost two-thirds of the way into it before they leave the palace grounds. (And even then, it wasn’t so much Indiana Jones as it was a drawn-out game of Cluefinders.) Up until then it’s a lot of sneaking around the palace, stealing things from one another, not trusting each other, and the like. Yet even after all that time spent alluding to the fact there was political discord, we hardly got to see any. Instead, Vira would go into the Council room and the story would immediately cut away like a closed door romance scene.The magic of The Ivory Key was interesting, but kind of confusing. It keeps their country running, so it’s a power source. It’s also mined by hand, making it a natural resource. The premise of the book is that it’s a nonrenewable resource as well, which is why the siblings are out looking for more. The “raw magic” pulled from the mines is a dust you can hold in your hands, but it’s sometimes also intangible? You put it in gadgets to make them work, it can power lanterns, it can pass secret messages, it can stop currency from being forged, walls can be built entirely from it. Essentially it can do and be anything the author dreams up, and that’s a little too broad for me to conceptualize. So in a way, The Ivory Key is both too short and too long. It’s filled with unnecessary repetitive sequences—royal court rumors, solving the one thousandth puzzle in a row, etc—but I also think Akshaya Raman may have held too much back for her second novel in the duology. What are the Council’s motivations? What are the Lyrian plans for the magic? What is the Kamala Society? How did the siblings’ mother die? And for the love of god how does this extremely valuable and vague magic work????? The world (me) may never know.I think there’s a good chance the second book will answer these questions, but I should feel like I have a strong foundational understanding of the first in the series, and truthfully I’m a little shaky. I’m also afraid it will be difficult to get back into after waiting for the follow-up. But I’ll wait and see how it plays out before issuing a final judgement for the series, though as of now I will hold on to my reservations.*Thanks to Clarion Books for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,91,1,"Dec 26, 2021","Jan 20, 2022","Aug 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55959475-the-ivory-key

Wednesday never really disappoints in this regard but I always appreciate the thoughtfulness put into their designs.[image]But back to the book itself—I haven’t read anything by Dana Schwartz before, well besides her tweets, but I was really excited to dig into this one.Hazel has always been fascinated by the human body. It’s a strange preoccupation for a young woman in 1817 Edinburg, but left to her own devices that’s all she would be doing. Studying anatomy and, hopefully, using what she’s learned to help people. Jack on the other hand deals in the dead. He digs up bodies and sells them to local medical schools as practice cadavers, a gruesome but ultimately necessary practice. There’s no reason for Hazel and Jack to ever cross paths, with her inevitable engagement to her cousin (ew) a future Viscount and his struggle to make ends meet. But when a sickness comes to town, a secret plan goes awry and something even darker lurks nearby, the two form an unlikely team to help protect the living from that which wishes to do them harm.I think the gothic elements of this book are a little more understated than some other novels I’ve read recently. That’s not a knock against its credentials in the genre, just those staples and tropes may not be as evident at first. What I think this was more than anything was historical fiction, but a much more approachable version. There’s a dusting of magic near the end and at the very beginning, though for the most part the story is focused on Hazel’s life as a future Viscountess and an aspiring surgeon during this era. Also, despite the subtitle and the shelving of this book on Goodreads, I didn’t think Anatomy was much of a romance. All of Hazel’s feelings fall second to her passion for anatomy, which honestly I think I prefer anyways. And though there’s eventually the kindling of something starting to happen, it’s well into the book to where it feels more like an afterthought than the main focus. The romantic storyline does play a crucial role in the final act, so credit where it’s due for that plot point.[image]There’s some interesting reflections on class and patriarchy, how someone’s gender and the socioeconomic circumstances they’re born into dictate the majority of how their lives turn out, especially in 19th century Scotland. Reading this in the midst of a pandemic underlines further the gaps between the rich and the poor when it comes to access to essential medical services. Who’s expendable and who’s connivence is worth more than someone’s life? The parallels between this time period and present day are probably too grim for many people to want to consider.The ending was a little hurried compared with the level of detail present through the rest of the book. We’re left with a sort of resolution, but not an Ending. in all it’s finality. But granted that sometimes I feel like Historical Fiction can drag, I didn’t have any problem fully engaging with Anatomy. It’s just as readable as it is interesting, and I think it’ll be a popular choice when it comes out in 2022!*Thanks to Wednesday Books for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,123,1,"Aug 20, 2021","Sep 06, 2021","Aug 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57917042-anatomy

After a certain amount of formulaic twists that amount to little more than jump scares, the same stale domestic suspense running throughout, it can be hard to really get excited about upcoming titles in the genre the way I used to. But the synopsis of A Flicker in the Dark sparked my interest, the cover was an understated pretty, and I’ve been burning through nothing but fantasy lately, so it was time to mix it up!The setup for Flicker is a newish perspective on a well-worn figure. Chloe Davis is the now-adult daughter of Dick Davis, a notorious convicted serial killer from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. Now 20 years later Chloe has done her best to rebuild the life from the shattered pieces she was left with. She’s moved to Baton Rouge, is in a committed relationship and is experiencing professional success as a psychologist. Then right before the upcoming anniversary of the first murdered girl, Lena Rhodes’s disappearance, history begins to repeat itself. Teenage girls are being taken and killed in a way that feels familiar to Chloe, and she’s having trouble coping with the difficult truths that she’s tried to bury for so long. But if Dick Davis is locked up behind bars, who’s responsible for this recent slew of killings? Is Chloe following the clues or is she creating a pattern where there is none? It’s hard to know who to trust when you’ve been betrayed so deeply before. What I think Stacy Willingham does well here is really immerse the reader in the psychology of all that’s unfolding. You’re paranoid when you’re meant to be, unnerved along with the main character. There’s a gentle hand guiding you through the tumultuous emotions Chloe is experiencing. I do think it probably falls back on some of the more common tropes: a woman cracking under pressure, substance abuse, an unreliable narrator that’s not sure if they’re just ‘imagining it’, but Willingham still somehow makes them engaging for a reader well versed in the genre.As for twists, yes there are several. I ended up suspecting the majority of them, but definitely not all! I think there’s enough doubt seeded through that even if you have an inkling of how something will play out, you’re never entirely sure. But this book is less about the what than the how and why of it all. Knowing a big chunk of the mystery isn’t going to ruin the book for you as it sometimes does with other thrillers. And you’re reading along for those answers just as much as you are to watch the unraveling of the woman at their center.Unless we’re talking my standby favorites like Karin Slaughter, Tana French, Megan Abbott, etc. Or even newer voices like S.A. Cosby and Taylor Adams, who always break away from the typical model, I haven’t *loved* many of the thrillers I’ve read over the past year or two. Still, A Flicker in the Dark is a book that feels firmly worth your time, whether you end up falling head over heels for it or not. I’m excited to see what Emma Stone (!) and co end up doing with the project. *Thanks to Minotaur Books & Netgalley for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,107,1,"Dec 08, 2021","Dec 16, 2021","Aug 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693172-a-flicker-in-the-dark

(look, a sports reference) That opening scene was killer, and even the story set-up afterwards was intriguing. I was enthusiastically exchanging theories with my reading buddy up until around a third of the way through, but either the pacing shifted or finally caught up with me, because I had to all but drag myself through the back half of this book. The absolute biggest miss for me were the scenes where Signa was learning about and trying to navigate “society”. God were they boring; I could not bring myself to care about a single moment devoted to that weak-ass plot line. I’m not sure if it’s the Bridgerton effect, but there’s absolutely no need to shoehorn a young woman’s ~societal debut~ into a story about vengeful ghosts and murder conspiracies. How did Adalyn Grace expect anyone to give two shits about the implications of refusing an invitation to tea when we *just found out* that (view spoiler)[someone was intentionally poisoning Blythe (hide spoiler)]. Belladonna has a focus problem—where the things that felt the most pressing, like issues of life and death, had to take a backseat to the frivolous and tedious aspects of aristocratic posturing. I also couldn’t fully conceptualize ‘Death’ based on the description provided by Grace. Is he a ghost? How are they (view spoiler)[kissing or having sex (hide spoiler)] if his face is literally obscured the entire time? Logistically, I have many questions, but his character never felt fully real to me either. There was a bit of Luc from Addie LaRue in his demeanor and presentation, though that character had motivations, his powers and reach were clearly defined, etc. But with Death, I still don’t understand what ‘he’…..is. The actual ghosts were the best part and more interesting than most of the characters, despite rarely getting to speak, and I wish we didn’t keep getting dragged from them back to the boring humans. There’s certain tropes that I would expect in a gothic novel, and foreshadowing in general is frequently utilized, but there was not one twist that you couldn’t spot a mile away, which erased all of the uncertainty, all of the tension. I kept hoping my assumptions were wrong because of how unremarkable they’d make the story, but I was, sadly, correct. What a bummer.And do not get me started on that attempt at a cliffhanger/twist in the epilogue. I am not falling for that again!!!! I have already seen Signa try to solve a murder mystery once and was NOT impressed.[image]I usually do more of a set-up for what a book is about, but I was too annoyed by how this one played out to attempt it here. Basically all you need to know is that this book was heavy on vibes, missing plot in the middle and probably best enjoyed not thinking too hard about anything presented. *Thanks so much to Little, Brown For Young Readers for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,7,284,1,"Jul 17, 2022","Aug 17, 2022","Aug 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59227936-belladonna

The Last House on Needless Street certainly gives off spooky-season vibes, and I went from really excited to start, to unmotivated and bored, to appreciative of the turns that Catriona Ward took along the way. All that to say, this is not the book I was expecting at all.Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing! But when the ingredients of a story are a missing girl, a creepy old house, a sketchy guy living in it and, inexplicably, a cat with a knife, you feel like you have an idea of where the story is going. I think what separates Needless from others in the genre isn’t just the lack of big ‘twists’ along the way, but the eventual commentary reached by the end. It’s not a scary, supernatural kind of horror, but instead horrific acts by human beings and the way that some move through the world undetected, while others draw attention.I really don’t want to say much more because I think this is one of those books where the less you know going into it the better. However, because it was such a rocky start for me I’m going to encourage anyone reading to at least get halfway through before giving up, if you so choose. There’s so much under the surface that’s just waiting to be peeled back, but The Last House on Needless Street is definitely an exercise in patience. I wasn’t even sure I liked it when I finished, but the more I’ve thought about it since, the more I have come around to the cleverness of the story’s structure and recognized Ward’s larger points. Anyways, sorry for this incredibly vague , but I would hate to deprive someone the chance of unearthing these secrets for themselves. We’re reading this with PM Reads’ book club on Instagram, and I’m excited to discuss it with the group. There’s a lot of really great material to sink our teeth into.

We meet AO, who goes by the initials of her given name as well as the moniker she’s adopted for herself, Artifical Organism, as she’s shopping in a Nigerian market. After a bloody run-in turns her into a target then a fugitive, AO flees her home for the desert in hopes of avoiding capture. There she meets a lone herdsman and his two cows, before deciding to embark into the Red Eye together.Though the first half didn’t have as clear of a direction as the second, I think I still liked it better. The abrupt violence of AO’s and DNA’s altercations with suspicious and aggressive people was such a stark introduction, especially considering they were supposedly in spaces they believed to be safe for themselves to exist. Somewhere in the middle of the book I wasn’t exactly sure where the story was going at all, but eventually I found my footing and overall enjoyed the journey.As much as Noor is a criticism of overreaching government, it’s even more so a denunciation of corporate, capitalist interests. By far the most invasive and powerful forces in the world of Noor are the mega-corporations that seem to have control of every aspect of the lives of citizens around the world. They’re able to not just act with impunity, but write the narrative of their own actions, erasing any dissenting opinions from existence. And as our own society continues to celebrate the private accomplishments of the supremely wealthy, things like launching a rocket into ‘space’ which we have done as a country collectively decades ago, it’s hard not to see the parallels Okorafor outlines here.There’s a portion of the book that is a kind of story-in-a-story, where the origin of a lot of the technological advancements in this society are explained. Not to give too much of that away, but it features a girl decades and decades before the events of the novel, and the lines between our world and theirs intersect at multiple points. I would have preferred this tangent story to tie in more to the events of the book, or at least to have gotten more time with its major players, though it might have distracted from the rest of the text. Still, it’s one of my favorite parts of the book so I’m a little greedy for more of it.I think inside of the commentary on privacy, environmentalism and corporate power structures, there’s also a compelling story about two people trying to survive in a world that seeks to destroy them. I’m also interested to see how people with prosthetic limbs feel about AO’s body alterations and disabilities. The ending felt a little rushed and abrupt, but I’m assuming the author didn’t see a need to drag out the resolution for the sake of it. Noor is a short piece of speculative science-fiction that packs a punch and should not be missed.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jul 25, 2021","Jul 28, 2021","Jul 24, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57632292-noor

But Briar, a queendom known for its magic and beauty, doesn’t have much kindness to spare for anyone who seems different or steps out of line.Half-Vila and scorned for it, Alyce’s powers and appearance are remarkably different from her ‘sister’ Graces at Lavender House. While they have brightly colored hair with golden eyes and the ability to grant virtues to their clients such as beauty, wit and knowledge, the upper class of Briar goes to Alyce only for curses. Of course she doesn’t provide anything deadly, and all Grace elixirs eventually fade, but through her lineage, looks and occupation, Alyce has earned herself a daunting reputation. [image]But all that changes in one night, at one ball and involving the last Briar princess, cursed to die on her 21st birthday if she is not kissed by her true love. Alyce finds herself in an impossible situation, working for people she despises, wanting to escape, but also drawn to the princess of Briar, who needs her help to break the curse her Vila ancestors placed on her bloodline. Is there any way Alyce’s powers can be used for good, or have her detractors always been right—that all she can do is create darkness, suffering and evil?Sleeping Beauty was my favorite Disney princess movie growing up, but even then Aurora felt like a spectator in her story. Yes it was about her, but she barely spoke. Instead people acted on her behalf, her father sent her away, the fairies protected her, Maleficent hunted her and Phillip tried to save her. Even for princess movies of the time, she had remarkably little agency. So I was really happy with the characterization of Aurora in this book. She’s pragmatic and clever, always searching for a way to break her curse herself. And once the clock has run down she doesn’t wallow, she makes decisions for what’s best for the realm and eventually herself. Watching her older sisters die of the same cause that will eventually kill her has turned into motivation to, if not live longer, then at least live better.As for Alyce, I’m sure at this point we’ve all seen or read a Sleeping Beauty retelling that is a little less harsh on the villain of the story. What I appreciated in Heather Walter’s interpretation is that yes, Alyce is more sympathetic, but she doesn’t do that by sanitizing her powers or personality. Instead we’re exposed to the very human cruelty of the people around her, the uncertainty of her purpose in her community and the malevolence she feels against people who have hurt her and those she loves. The ending especially was a masterclass in constructing a compelling villain, to the point where you are rooting for her as she unleashes her rage onto an unsuspecting populace. Like much of Briar’s history, the record of events will be modified, unflattering details erased entirely, and the Dark Grace’s fury will be whispered about in hushed breath for centuries to come.[image]The first book of the Malice duology was already a roaring success for me. There’s intricate world-building not just in Briar but beyond it. The magic system and magical species have a great foundation laid for the next book. I’m very excited to pick up where it was left off immediately after the final climax of the story, and can’t believe I have to wait until April (!!!!) 2022. I’m ready for more vengeance.

Within TheI finished this weeks ago, but my brain has been allergic to the concept of writing s recently, so I’m only now getting around to it! Within These Wicked Walls was such a great, creeping haunted house story that delivers spooky vibes without crossing over into genuinely scary territory. Andromeda, sometimes ‘Andi’, is a debtera struggling to get by, who would normally earn her way by cleansing houses of dark possessions held under the Evil Eye. The only issue is Andromeda is not licensed, therefore unable to find work. But one day she receives a call about a job in a large estate, owned by a Magnus Rochester. It doesn’t take long to figure out why Mr. Rochester is having trouble filling this position—they have had a dozen other debteras try and fail to cleanse the house already. Staff is being picked off at an alarming rate, but without any other options Andi’s going to have to take the job no matter the risks.This book was pitched as an “Ethiopian-inspired debut fantasy retelling of Jane Eyre”, and while I haven’t read Jane Eyre I think this will be the third retelling I’ve read of it. Some of the story feels familiar for that reason—rich guy, old creepy house, young woman moving in, etc. But what Lauren Blackwood brings in a new setting, she also delivers in location-specific mysticism and lore. The Evil Eye is an existing belief, popular in the Mediterranean and Western Asia, in a curse that can be sent by a malevolent glare. As in the novel, it works in conjunction with Christianity, not in opposition, and many believers will cary amulets like Andromeda does.Like many male literary potential love interests, I didn’t like Magnus and would not be mad if he had just died right away. That’s my usual solution to this problem, and rarely does the author decide to go down that route (regrettably). (view spoiler)[The interesting thing about that suggestion this time around, though, is that it’s actually the best way to solve most of the conflict in the books. Kill this one random, annoying rich guy? You’ll save the lives of all of the remaining staff members plus Andromeda’s mentor. I expect selfishness on the part of the wealthy douchebag in question, but Andi deciding the life of her new boyfriend that she’s known for like a week and stole from another woman is worth more than all the working class people around her is not very good class solidarity in my opinion!!! Oh, also, he’s the one possessed and killing people in the first place so you’d definitely be justified in this case. (hide spoiler)]Annoying men aside, I thought this book was a really cool take on an enduring classic. It’s not heavily reliant on the source material, so Blackwood has plenty of room to flex her creative muscles. Within These Wicked Walls was mine and Madison’s (@momandmadread) Octoberish book club pick and I feel like it’s going to be a great book for discussions. Also pretty sure Reese Witherspoon copied us, but that’s fine. ...more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Oct 04, 2021","Oct 19, 2021","Jul 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52858788-within-these-wicked-walls

So I’m happy to report that it’s a well-rounded selection, beautifully consistent with the rest of the books. ⁣⁣The author begins by giving some background on her journey writing this series, as well as why she ended up returning to Daevabad after finishing the initial trilogy. She describes trying to fit what she believed to be the ‘requirements’ of ‘epic fantasy’, before readjusting to focus on the journey of Nahri, Ali and Dara. I also appreciated Chakraborty’s candor in acknowledging her writing struggles during the start of the pandemic. This eventually led to her writing this book, so obviously I’m not mad at the result, but I’m sure it was frustrating wanting to begin a new project but only being able to return to your previous work.There are 15 stories in this collection, including an alternate epilogue. Even breaking down the character who’s perspective we follow for each chapter could be spoiler-adjacent, so instead I’ll simply assure you that every person you want to hear from is represented. There’s five chapters set before the events of the trilogy, eight during those books, the alternate epilogue and one final scene that takes place after the events of the trilogy. Of course, we get more from the points of view for Nahri, Ali and Dara, but also scenes from Zaynab, Jamshid, Muntadhir and a handful of parents. Additionally, there’s a couple of characters we get to hear from for the first time.I’m so pumped that they’re releasing The River of Silver a physical format as well—especially for us shelf-completionists! The US hardcover is currently scheduled to be released on October 11th of this year. But if in the mean time you’re unsure whether to try the audio, I can definitely recommend it! This book has the same narrator as the last three, Soneela Nankani, and she does an impeccable job.  The River of Silver was a comforting final goodbye to beloved characters we couldn’t quite let go of during the early aughts of an uncertain period of time. And now that it’s out in the world, fans of S.A. Chakraborty’s have something new to look forward to: The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi.[image]*Thanks to Harper Audio for the advanced listening copy and Harper Voyager for the advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,102,1,"Feb 13, 2022","Feb 18, 2022","Jul 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60133986-the-river-of-silver

I had so many conflicting emotions while reading this to where I’m not even sure what the most disappointing aspect was. Sometimes books start off slowly or things don’t make sense at first, but eventually they all come together in a beautiful, cohesive way. This was definitely not that, though. I’m don’t know what Small Favors was going for, just that it did not get there at all.First and foremost it was boring. The beginning maybe two-thirds or so were nothing but boring and moderately stressful. Everything about Ellerie Downing’s life is miserable and only getting miserable-r. None of these characters have redeeming qualities and honestly outside of her nuclear family and a couple of exceptions the entire cast of secondary characters just blurred into the background. Oh? There’s someone in town named Winthrop? If you say so.The back third is when things actually start happening beyond the mundane tragedies of a family struggling to survive. I was literally 350 pages into this book before I remembered—hey, isn’t this supposed to be a Rumpelstiltskin retelling?? Otherwise it was essentially the most depressing Little House on the Prairie episode since Mary went blind. Despite the long trek to this point in the book, I was expecting for there to be an epic climax of some kind. It didn’t necessarily have to make the first 300 pages worth it, but at least give me some feeling of satisfaction. There was none. I have no idea what happened here. Everything I thought would be important to the story was not. The bees? Didn’t matter. Ellerie’s family? Irrelevant. Some rando(s) she met along the way? Medium important, but mostly an afterthought. There was no moral, no redemption, no real character arcs—this book used almost 500 pages to say nothing. The plot was just a series of bad things happening to which I guess we’re just supposed to sigh despondently and say, “well that’s……terrible.” I’ve seen a couple of negative-to-middling s of this book and I just don’t think anyone has come out and said what needs to be said after reading it: this is not worth your time. I was a big fan of House of Salt and Sorrows, so this is such a bummer to write, but I just did not enjoy reading Small Favors at all. Despite all of that, though, I’m not completely turned off of picking up Erin Craig’s future books. I know she’s a good writer and the concept of this book sounded great!

Little Thieves takes a lesser known fable, The Goose Girl, and picks it apart at the seams, onlyThis is exactly what a fairytale retelling should be. Little Thieves takes a lesser known fable, The Goose Girl, and picks it apart at the seams, only to refashion it into something far grander than you may have thought you could get from the original material. All the initial elements are present, the same characters follow familiar beats at first, only to eventually diverge. The story’s themes are turned on their heads, and the end result is just as much a reaffirmation of the source material as it is a challenge to it.[image]“Once upon a time, there was a horrible girl…” I mean, come on, who wouldn’t want to read a book with that introduction? This retelling, like many popular ones now, focuses on the antagonist of the original story. Vanja is the disloyal maid who abandons her princess and steals her life for her own. In the year since that faithful day on the road, Vanja has more than settled into her life as ‘Prinzessin Gisele’, now not only living a luxurious life but boldly robbing the nobility she’s met through her newly acquired status. It’s after one of these robberies where things begin to go wrong for her, though, as she finds herself cursed by a Low God offended by her thievery. Vanja will have to break the curse by ‘making amends’ or slowly succumb to her greed by becoming the very stones she’s stolen.Or…….she could just ask her godmothers for help. After being forfeited by her birth mother, Vanja was taken in by Death and Fortune, who have made her an offer: their assistance for her servitude. But after years as a servant for the lost princess and her family, Vanja would rather fall to the curse than fall in debt to her overbearing godmothers, which is not as unreasonable as it sounds to those of us with mother figures like this in our lives. Despite Vanja’s general demeanor and attitude, she actually manages to make some friends that will try to help her break this curse. The characters in Little Thieves will delight anyone who loves a good ensemble cast. And while probably not technically a heist, there’s definitely a heist-type feel to a lot of the scheming Vanja and her gang partake in. [image]I know this probably sounds like a lot so far, and that’s because it is. There’s also a ton more than I’m not going to get into so readers can experience it for themselves, but it’s really impressive the way Owens is able to juggle so many different plot lines at once, especially in a standalone fantasy like this. And it’s not all action and plot, there’s some really immense personal struggles that the characters experience along the way. Within the 500+ pages of this novel are seven ‘Tales’ recounting important backstory to the current timeline. Several are intense gut-punches and give so much context as to why the characters make the choices they do. I think what I liked best, though, is how well-structured this book was. It would have been so easy for something like this to go off the rails, but Owens felt fully in control of the narrative at every twist and turn. The way she confronts traditional lessons in morality, what we as an audience equate with goodness and evil, is so smart. I don’t think it’s possible to rave too much about Little Thieves, but in the interest of not overhyping too much I will stop here. Still, please don’t sleep on this gorgeous, germanic fantasy retelling. ✨**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks![image]I’m going to include a summary of The Goose Girl below in spoiler tags. Not because I believe it spoils anything for the book—far from it as I think reading it right before going in helped me appreciate the changes Margaret Owens made all the more. But some people like to go in totally blind, so I’ll let readers decide for themselves. Again, though, this isn’t a spoiler for the book any more than the publisher-provided synopsis is: (view spoiler)[A queen sends her daughter to a faraway land to marry. Accompanying the princess are her magical horse Falada, who can speak, and a waiting maid. The queen gives the princess a special charm that will protect her as long as she wears it.On their journey the princess grows thirsty. She asks the maid to go fetch her some water, but the maid refuses. The maid then takes advantage of the princess's vulnerability and orders the princess to change clothes with her. She threatens to kill the princess if she doesn't swear never to say a word about this reversal of roles to any living being. The maid servant then rides off on Falada, while the princess has to mount the maid's nag. At the palace, the maid poses as princess and the ""princess servant"" is ordered to guard the geese with a little boy called Conrad. The false bride orders Falada to be killed, as she fears he might talk. The real princess hears of this and begs the slaughterer to nail Falada's head above the doorway where she passes with her geese every morning.On the goose meadow, Conrad watches the princess comb her hair and wants a couple of locks. But the goose girl sees this and tells the wind takes his hat away.Conrad angrily goes to the king and declares he will not herd geese with this girl any longer because of the strange things that happen. That evening, the king asks the princess to tell him her story. But she refuses to say anything because of her oath. Instead she climbs into the stove and tells her story while the king listens from outside.As the king is convinced she has told the truth, he then tricks the false princess into ""choosing her own punishment"" and she tells the king that a false servant should be dragged through town naked in a barrel with internal spikes. As a result, she is punished that way until she dies.After that, the prince and the true princess are married and live happily ever after.*paraphrased from Wikipedia (hide spoiler)]...more",Notes are private!,0,152,1,"Aug 30, 2021","Sep 04, 2021","Jul 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54017820-little-thieves

She’s an excellent student, accepted to University of North Carolina’s Early College program at 16. She’s close with her parents and her best friend Alice, who is joining her at school. But what Bree could never have prepared for was her mother’s sudden death right before she left for Chapel Hill. Lost in her grief and uncertain where her path at UNC will take her, Bree finds herself pulled into a secret society with members who call themselves “Legendborn”. The mysteries of this group appear to have some connection with her mother’s death, so Bree dives head-first into an organization that makes very clear it was not made for her.I don’t typically gravitate towards contemporary fantasies, even though I’ve enjoyed a number of them. But I truly believe that anyone, from someone that’s fantasy-hesitant to those fully entrenched in otherworldly magic and lore, will be able to enjoy their time with Legendborn. Without getting too much into the trenches, the Legendborn draw on the numerous tales of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Taking the role of righteous wielders of their ancestors’ magic, Legendborn aim to protect the public from dark forces that wish to do their world harm. It’s a really compelling blend of mythology, fantasy, academia and hero’s journey that had me completely invested from the get-go.Bree is an absolute force, imperfect in her coping but full of strength and grit. The way her character reckons with not just a erratic power burning within her, but the open and veiled hostility of some of the members of this almost entirely white society is a masterful act in balancing by Tracy Deonn. Bree has been brought into an institution within an institution, ones that exploited her ancestors to build their own legacies. And many of their descendants seem more than happy to keep those inherited hierarchies as-is.So much of the focus of this story is on power. The literal powers that members possess, the institutional power that is passed down and the power inherent in every human being. I loved learning about the legends of these long-dead knights just as much as the hidden histories of the men, women and children who built UNC. One of the most impressive things about Deonn’s writing here is that she has so many balls going up in the air at one time, but nothing is ever rushed or dragging. The pacing is near perfect, and I flew through this 500 page full-sized chonker pretty quickly.Obviously there’s a lot more to this book than magic power and evil demons, but don’t let that lead you to believe that this is anything less than an incredible fantasy novel. There’s action, adventure, some romance and a constant testing of loyalties culminating in an epic clash between two opposing forces. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, completely caught off guard at several points, even if I felt like I knew the direction the author was taking. I know it’s only August, but I think I can say this is the best fantasy book I’ve read so far this year. An easy recommendation to anyone who asks, and even some who don’t. And now I have to wait until 2022 for the sequel????

Beasts of Prey has been on my radar for a while and I’m very happy to report that it’s exactly as magical and entertaining as I was hoping it would be! Pulling straight from pan-African myth and full of adventure and a lot of heart, I loved every minute spent with this book. [image]Koffi and her mother are indentured workers at the Night Zoo, which houses and displays all kinds of magical creatures from across Eshōza. It’s situated in the city of Lkossa, right on the edge of the Greater Jungle. The jungle is home to many beasts and animals too fearsome for even the Zoo, and none more terrifying than the Shetani. After almost a hundred years of reported deaths at the hands of the Shetani, a recently disgraced candidate for the elite fighting force the Sons of the Six, Ekon, must team up with Koffi. Together they plan to hunt down the Shetani and hopefully free themselves from the difficulties of their current circumstances.Despite my first impressions, this wasn’t really ‘magic zoo’ focused at all. Instead Beasts of Prey is an adventure story where the heart of the action takes place during a long trek in a strange and dangerous jungle. Though if you’re looking for magical beasts of mythological proportions, then never fear, because this book delivers.Though Koffi and Ekon have the same eventual goal, to find the Shetani, their motivations are completely different, and their plans on what to do with it afterwards are at odds. Koffi needs the creature to offer to the owner of the zoo in order to buy freedom for herself and the only remaining family she has left. After making a dire choice on the night of his final test to join the Six, the only way Ekon has a chance to join his brother amongst its ranks is by killing the monster believed to be tormenting Lkossa for the last century. It makes them unlikely allies, but also provides incentives to betray the only other person who they can rely on while exploring a dangerous and unknown environment.[image]Loyalties are tested and each character has to reckon with their own convictions. Beliefs they held all their lives as unshakable truths look suddenly different in new light. Who is deserving of our trust, and what institutions need more scrutiny? As much as this is an epic fantasy full of fun magic and animals, there’s also an exploration of morality and the search for the truth.I’m super excited to see where the story goes from here, as there’s a moderately sized cliffhanger ending in Beasts of Prey. While the immediate danger is gone, there’s still so much left to unpack. I’m very impressed with this debut by Ayana Gray, and look forward to more of her work!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,105,1,"Sep 06, 2021","Sep 13, 2021","Jul 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56552953-beasts-of-prey

It takes place in 1911 New York City, which is either very cool or very not cool depending on what demographics you belonged to at the time. Frances Hallowell is a seventeen year-old young woman working as a seamstress, when a shocking act of unexplainable violence catches the attention of law enforcement. But instead of being arrested Frances is whisked away to a sanatorium in Queens that is more than it appears.As it turns out, the sanitarium is a cover for a different kind of institution—a witch school for girls known as Haxahaven. Frances and her new peers are housed, schooled in their craft and most crucially, shielded from an outside world that wishes to do them harm. The more time Frances spends confined to her new home, though, the more she feels unfulfilled. A yearning to expand her powers and explore beyond Haxahaven’s walls and locked gates leaves Frances with no choice but to start making her own rules. After all, what’s the point in possessing power if you’re not going to exercise it?Historical fantasy is an interesting genre to me because there’s so many different directions you can take the story. The only thing that’s predetermined is that at some point the historical precedent will diverge into the fantastical, but it’s up to the author to decide exactly when. What pieces of history are you going to use to build this new world, and which will be strategically left behind? The Witch Haven makes some early choices to view this time period through a more modern gaze. Discriminatory and bigoted opinions are challenged by the author and characters, no matter how common they may have been at the time. This kind of history-lite will be a less grating reading experience for fantasy fans who appreciate a historical atmosphere, but don’t necessarily want to deal with all the baggage that typically accompany it.[image]What this book really centers is the female characters, with the era being more of a backdrop. It’s a compelling story of a young woman trying to find her place in the world while searching to uncover the person(s) responsible for her brother’s death. There’s a focus on the power of women, both soft and hard, and how women have chosen to wield that power to protect themselves and the people they love. Sasha Peyton Smith also includes criticisms of the women’s movement of the time, not limited to: class, ethnicity, race, education, etc. Though still making the argument that women are stronger together, these plot details do add a much needed context to stories like this.Overall I enjoyed The Witch Haven. As a standalone historical novel it’s not going to have the expansive world-building that you may find in other fantasies, but it is still a fun ride! Some of the plot twists were pretty easy to spot from a distance, but I like the final twist of the knife (view spoiler)[lol get it??? (hide spoiler)] in the last chapter & epilogue. There’s also potential for a follow-up, but I think I like the open-endedness as is.*Thanks to Simon & Schuster Young Readers & Netgalley for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,102,1,"Aug 16, 2021","Aug 25, 2021","Jul 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56980357-the-witch-haven

Most that I pick up I genuinely like, if not love. So I was fully expecting to enjoy my first Samantha Downing novel as I’ve seen so many positive things said about her books.From the very beginning there didn’t seem to be a clear focus of the story. Though being mostly contained to Belmont Academy, there wasn’t ever a distinct narrator or point of view. Within each chapter the narrative would bounce from one of the students to one of the teachers to a parent to a different teacher, etc., all without actually committing to this perspective. One of the characters is disclosed right away as the villain, but lacking any sort of introspection. Any commentary that could have been included is kept out just by the nature of Downing’s writing style.And beyond that, there’s nothing that’s held back. Every piece of information is handed over to the reader in a nice, orderly fashion, leaving the plot without much tension. You know who the bad guys are. You know how they are committing their crimes. You know what their goals are. You know everything, therefore it’s difficult to build any kind of anticipation. I kept waiting for a twist—literally just one twist—and was left wanting. And everyone in this town, the parents, the teachers, the police are useless. Belmont is a place where critical thinking goes to die, which is ironic because it’s supposed to be an exclusive, high-achieving private school. There’s just no way anything that happens in this book would have actually played out in this way. For me this was nothing more than an exercise in wishful thinking. (view spoiler)[Courtney’s arrest, in particular, was absurd. I was wondering if there was a smoking gun somewhere that would implicate her further than ‘she gets annoyed by her overbearing mom’, but there was literally nothing. (hide spoiler)]I just couldn’t get over the incompetency of the characters to enjoy it by the end. I will say that the first half or even two-thirds were at least interesting enough to keep me reading, but it got to a point where I realized that this book wasn’t going to surprise me in any way. There was no playing with my expectations or lulling the reader into a false sense of security—it is what it is.

I was more willing to give him a pass in the last book when Vin was going to balls while disproportionally obsessed with dresses. But now, after all of that turmoil, all of the pain and struggle, to have her revert to a variation of that previous girl was a major step back. And using one of the few new female characters as an excuse to take a break from murderous warlords and assassination attempts to like totally go dress shopping was ridiculous. Brandon, my dude, nobody talks about dresses this much. Stop talking about fucking dresses.I think this goes back to some of my original complaints from the first book, in that there were very few female characters and outside of the main character they simply did not matter to the plot. At least in The Well of Ascension there was the introduction of Tindwyl who was another complex female character. I actually really like her as a foil to Sazed, but of course (view spoiler)[Brandon decided to kill her by the end too (hide spoiler)], so we’re once again left with Vin, the only woman who’s allowed to stick around.I really didn’t want to bring up Sanderson’s religion at all, but when it starts influencing the work I don’t feel like I have a choice. For a story set in a magical dystopian future, it’s still laughably patriarchal. Nobody curses or has premarital sex (unless it’s rape, I guess??). And speaking of marriage…….oof. The only thing the author felt more fixated on with Vin besides dresses and ‘protecting her man’ was making her a blushing bride. B-Sand, my dude, Vin is a metal-drinking murder monster who has childhood trauma and is fighting like 20 wars at once, why on Earth would you think marriage would be even a blip on her radar?? Just say you can’t write a sexually active young woman who is unmarried and call it a day.I did enjoy the character arcs for most of the rest of the crew, though. Sazed had to have one of the most interesting storylines and I’m glad we got so much from him. Elend on the other hand got pretty dry after a while. The middle of the book lagged for me, and I can’t blame that on anything besides all the political slog he was working through. (view spoiler)[I also just didn’t think he should be king/emperor. Seriously why, because he’s born rich? Because his girlfriend has superpowers? Can we just take a break from monarchy for a minute or forever (hide spoiler)] Though I understand that it’s probably necessary in order to pick up the pieces left in the wake of The Final Empire, I think Sanderson could have been more concise.(view spoiler)[I can’t be the only one who thought Breeze was queer-coded. Not even necessarily gay, but potentionally ace/aro, so it was disappointing to see Sanderson default to straight male again. And I can’t help but feel like the addition of Allriane, who served no real point and always seemed shoehorned into whatever scene she was in, was added specifically to make sure Breeze was not interpreted as gay by readers. Maybe this is another casualty of Mormon influence, I don’t know. I’m just continuing to pretend she does not exist. (hide spoiler)]But that ending, wow, I was racing through it, heart pounding, until the very last page. I was not expecting it to wrap up that way at all, and I can fully say that I’m now hyped for the next book again. All except for one thing….(view spoiler)[You couldn’t let Vin have this one thing?! You had to make Elend not just an allomancer, but a mistborn??? Why not have him be a Thug and call it a day? I swear if this all pays off to Elend being the actual ‘chosen one’ I’ll be pissed. Just let him die lol (hide spoiler)] That wasn’t working against expectations at all, and after such an amazing ending I can’t lie and say this development didn’t bug me.But I like how the story has shifted through the first two books so far and am really looking forward to the third. The way the author plays with prophecy and reader assumptions is done exquisitely well. You’re left feeling how some of the characters do at the end of the book, with a knife in your gut but still living to fight another day....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Jul 12, 2021","Jul 23, 2021","Jul 08, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6547260-the-well-of-ascension

Sudden deaths, southern estates and something supernatural lurking nearby sounded like the perfect combination for a book to me.This was a different kind of ghost story, where it’s not a place that’s haunted but people. After his best friend Eddie’s death, Andrew shows up at the school they were supposed to attend together, in the house they were supposed to live in, hoping for answers. Though he thought he knew Eddie better than anyone, there’s a lot about him that Andrew has not been aware of until after his death. And the very trauma from their shared childhood that Andrew has done his best to avoid completely seems to be what Eddie had been fixated on leading up to his death. Now Andrew’s going to have to decide what he wants more: to understand his best friend or to potentially be consumed by the same demons that took Eddie away.Summer Sons was the definition of a slow-burn for me. There’s a lot of creeping and unsettling circumstances that build on each other gradually, until you feel like you’re almost suffocated by them. I think, like with most horror books, the most terrifying things are the unknown. Lee Mandelo does a good job slowly dribbling out information to the reader, so even when it feels like there isn’t much happening you’re still compelled to keep going. Peel back another layer and see what’s festering underneath.I will say this is a book you have to read actively, not a mindless romp that’s mostly ~vibes~. Maybe I’m outing myself as a dumdum, but I definitely had to Google some words along the way, as well as reread passages I may have not fully absorbed the first time through. So if you’re looking for something that you can inhale in a couple of hours, maybe wait to pick up this one until you have the time and attention span to truly appreciate how great the writing is. Because underneath the meticulous pacing and the haunted ambiance is a kind of re-coming of age story. The characters are all grad students or older, and this is definitely a book for adults, but there’s a level of discovery and rediscovery present that feel similar to that kind of genre. The explorations of sexuality and identity are particularly well done and I appreciated how candid the storytelling was in this respect.And like all good gothic books, there’s a larger commentary on life and death, but wrapped up in the idea of legacy. The legacy of a place, of people and families, and also of our own individual legacies. It’s the struggle between what we leave behind and being left behind. I don’t know, it’s been over a week and I’m still mulling it over myself. Still, I can’t wait to see more from Mandelo in the future, even if they insist on forcing me to use more of my brain cells than I’m used to. *Thanks to Tordotcom for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,97,1,"Aug 04, 2021","Sep 02, 2021","Jul 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53290204-summer-sons

Kuang’s newest work to people interested in reading it. So I hope you’ll forgive me for letting myself off the hook in a way—I’m not going to be covering the entirety of Babel in this single Goodreads . As more people read their advance copies, I’m sure there’ll be a surplus of opinions to take into consideration before beginning this book, but I’m not going to attempt to take Rebecca’s place in telling this story. [image]me being very chill about this book The first thing that I think potential readers should keep in mind is that this isn’t the kind of book you’d typically build a fandom around. It’s not a fantasy of dragons and swords, fairies and secret doors, but a tale of the monsters who built the world we all currently inhabit. It is a fantasy so deeply rooted in history and imperialism that it almost feels like it could have actually happened this way. So as much as we’ve all enjoyed the character art and mockups of beautiful special editions being passed around online, I just want to make sure everyone’s expectations are where they should be. If you’re here for ships and tropes that will go viral on TikTok and Instagram, you may end up disappointed. If it wasn’t obvious from full title, Babel, or The Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators' Revolution, you’re going to get a healthy helping of both the ‘Dark’ and ‘Academia’ portions of the genre. I’d also like to emphasize that Kuang goes well beyond an academic aesthetic setting, fully entrenching every aspect of the story deep within the bowels of academia. We get to see students rigorously study their specialized fields, but also the unsavory sides of this culture typically hidden from public view. The magic system is no exception to this rule, relying fundamentally on language, and specifically the act of translation. Lovers of literature, historians and linguists, both professionals and enthusiasts, will adore this aspect. It’s not a flashy kind of magic and deceptively simple in concept, which is why it lends so easily into an alternate history novel. The way it’s incorporated feels plausible, and the who and why this power is being sought, all too probable.[image]Through our core four characters—Robin, Victoire, Ramiz, and Letitia—we bear witness to the day-to-day lives of institutional outsiders as they try to navigate a system inherently hostile to their presence but desperately in need of their skills and labor. There’s some obvious similarities between the author and the main character, Robin, but all four of them carry pieces of that misfit quality that will ring true for so many. What she ends up doing with each character separately and as a group is very clever, probing their blind spots and privileges in ways that will challenge the readers’ own complicities. Their interactions are at times encouraging, sometimes devastating, but always ring true. Fair warning, though, there will be moments that feel so honest that they’re likely to sting.I think the underlying emotion guiding the text is a steadily building rage. The number of quiet cruelties that the marginalized characters must absorb then set aside would be enough to drive most from pursuing this kind of educational tract, which is by design. In fact, if you’re reading Babel and you’re not angry, you’re doing it wrong. On the domestic political side, there’s a thoughtful examination of the labor movement of that era, interlaced with not-so-subtle remarks on the exploitive nature of capitalism. You can draw a number of parallels between the UK of this time period and the US currently, a comparison probably not lost on a Chinese American writer studying in England. What’s clear is that Rebecca’s time at Cambridge, Oxford, and later Yale greatly informed both her writing and perspective on the state of the world, particularly how it came to be this way. The result is a scathing indictment of British and European colonialism, including the rippling effects across continents; and it’s entirely deserved. Magic in this world is just another resource to be extracted from the poor by the powerful, and when those wells run dry they do what their real life counterparts did—embark to find and exploit other lands and people. But no amount of blood spent will ever be enough to satisfy their incessant thirst for more.[image]If you’ve read Kuang’s previous Poppy War trilogy, you know what tone to expect. You cannot build a sustainable legacy on the broken backs of your fellow man. There’s no great twist of fate to save the day, just the relentless resistance of those who reach that breaking point. This is not a feel-good story, despite being an exceptional one. It’s a classic R.F. Kuang slow-march of inevitability—and absolutely perfect. Prepare yourself for brilliance. Prepare yourself for heartbreak. Prepare yourself for the triumph of Babel.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,445,1,"Dec 31, 2021","Jan 02, 2022","Jul 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57945316-babel

She lives with her sister Posey and her boyfriend Vince, and really just wants to bide her time in relative obscurity. But once a thief, always a thief, and Charlie can’t seem to resist the urge to investigate when things start to go awry. Because there’s been a change in Charlie’s world over the past several decades. Gloamists, once designated to the shadows that they control, have reached a popular consciousness. It turns out people’s shadows have power, and gloamists aren’t the only ones looking to capitalize on this new dominion.As Charlie and those around her get sucked into schemes larger than they could imagine, she’s got to find a way to protect the people she cares about from the dark forces at work. Both new villains and ghosts from their past are looking to utilize Charlie for their own means, and she’s going to have to dig every skeleton out of every closet in order to unravel why.[image]I’m staring at the two comps in the synopsis and am just kind of perplexed why they would pick those. Listen, I enjoyed The Night Circus, but I don’t see many similarities at all there. Black doesn’t write the same kind of descriptive, flowery prose as Morgenstern and there’s definitely not anything resembling a magical traveling circus in Book of Night?? I can see where maybe the Ninth House comparisons come from, but even though I also liked that book it was bloated in a way that this one is not. Book of Night feels like such a departure from what I’ve read of Holly Black before and yet still so distinctly her own. I’m going to cautiously say it reminds me of Sarah J. Maas’ pivot from fae-centered fantasy worlds into a grittier, urban fantasy environment in House of Earth and Blood. I mean this purely in subject matter and focus, not writing, as I think Maas and Black have covered similar sub-genres in the past and now seem to be walking a parallel path once again. But I’m not trying to scare off people who didn’t enjoy Crescent City but loved The Cruel Prince, this is still 100% a Holly Black book.[image]That said, it’s going to be pretty different from The Folk of the Air trilogy, and not just because it’s about magical shadows that eat blood. Fans of the Cardan/Jude relationship probably won’t be satisfied by the romance in this book, although there is definitely potential for that type of adversarial dynamic if Black decides to do a sequel. I’m also still a little fuzzy on the distinctions between the four types of gloamists and what exactly the power hierarchy is, but that didn’t impede my enjoyment of the story overall. My best guess is that this is the start of a series. Either that or Black is a bit sadistic. While the story’s arc finishes resolutely by the end of Book of Night, she dangles an enticing set-up for a follow-up right as the dust is starting to settle. I can imagine some people grumbling about the way Black’s decided to leave her characters here, but that kind of seductively unsatisfying ending is my favorite way to leave a book, especially if you’re considering revisiting the story again in the future. Either way, I’m all in on Book of Night and any possible upcoming offshoots.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,182,1,"Oct 28, 2021","Nov 05, 2021","Jul 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58293924-book-of-night

Think evil magic Hunger Games—smaller in scale but twice as Vicious.[image]Every generation there is a tournament. Marked by the Blood Moon over the secluded town of Ilvernath, seven families come together and offer a champion from their bloodlines to compete for a chance at immense power. High magick has long since left the world, used up recklessly thousands of years ago….or so it was thought. The only remaining source of this long-lost resource resides in Ilvernath, tied to the seven families and their generational curse. Only one family line may claim the magick, and only after defeating the other six competitors by winning the tournament in a fight to the death. And in order to protect this bloody legacy, all involved have kept the event a secret. Up until now. Word has gotten out about this brutal practice and the world has descended on Ilvernath, ready to observe and judge the participants. With unprecedented scrutiny, will centuries of tradition finally snap under the pressure? Will champions from underestimated houses have better odds with this new wrench thrown into the chaos? “Our families kept this secret for centuries. Seems to me that means, on some level, we all know what we’ve been doing is wrong.”Thorburn. Payne. Grieve. Blair. Macaslan. Darrow. Lowe.Let the games begin.[image]This book was all-consuming. I could not pick up another thing while I was still reading it. There’s something completely mesmerizing and addictive about the characters in All of Us Villains. They all commit some truly heinous acts, and for a wide range of reasons, but still you’re rooting for them to succeed. Part of that is probably based in their struggle for survival. Like The Hunger Games, each competitor’s own success is dependent on the misfortune of those around them. But the comparison would probably be more apt if instead of Katniss and Peeta the champions exclusively had the personalities of tributes from Districts 1 & 2. Some are proud to be there, others are resigned to it, but they all are more than willing and capable of killing one another.While there are seven champions, there’s only four perspectives in the book. You’ll probably be more invested in them than the other three, but that doesn’t mean you won’t be involved in everyone’s stories. Or that you’ll end up liking those four any better. In fact, getting inside their heads might be more of a turn off than observing them from a distance. I was so impressed with the way Amanda Foody and Christine Herman wrote these characters. They can be despicable one moment and endearing underdogs the next—you’re never quite sure which version you’re going to get. Expect your own loyalties to shift just as often as the characters’ do.[image]At this point I do have to issue a warning to potential readers: this book ends on a massive cliffhanger. Honestly it’s such a big cliffhanger that it almost feels like they just chopped the last 25% of it off and sent it out that way. I guess I won’t be able to judge whether or not the sequel is a natural continuation of the story or not until it’s out (it’s not close to coming out), but I was totally caught off guard with how this ended. Okay, even more than that, I was M A D. Like, big mad. Honestly I’m still a little mad I can’t read the rest right this second.I know that’s probably a testament to the writing and how compelling this story was, but I’m sorry Tor Teen—you’ve created a monster.

For one, I was not a fan of Chuck Wendig’s previous book, Wanderers, and wrote a lengthy  detailing exactly why. But I did decide to pick up The Book of Accidents, not just because I was feeling major amounts of FOMO after several of my friends loved it, but because this was a genre departure from Wanderers. Also I’m usually one for second chances.The book follows the Graves family, Nate, Maddie and their son Oliver, as they move into a rundown home Nate’s father used to own and left to him shortly before his death. As with most books featuring creepy old houses, unsettling things start happening to the Graves family that challenge how they perceive the world. But even before moving to rural Pennsylvania, there were things that were different about the Graves’. Oliver can feel the pain of those around him, wriggling and gnashing inside their bodies. Maddie and Nate have their secrets too, and the whole family is looking for a fresh start.By and large I really enjoyed this book. I thought the plot was clever and hard to predict, which kept me frantically turning the pages. And for me, it was also pretty scary, though for some reason I kept reading it late at night. (do not recommend!) There’s also a good deal of supernatural elements which were handled well, along with the rest of the ‘grounded’ plot. Though a lot of the creepy, crawly magic stuff seems like it clambered solely from the mind of Mr. Wendig, the themes of family, cyclical abuse and being able to choose a kinder world were much more universal human ideas that gave the story even more depth.There’s something about Wendig’s style of writing here that is really approachable, but also started to annoy me after a while. The characters spoke beyond conversationally, like in trying to seem exceedingly casual it just came off even more contrived. The pendulum swinging the other way, so to speak. And every time there was a non-dialogue sound—something slamming, buzzing, etc.—the author would describe the sound as you typically would find in a book, but then he’d also write it out phonetically. There was an overflow of onomatopoeia to where it became distracting. I mean, “the doorbell was ringing, ding-dong, ding-dong”, was this really necessary, Chuck??But I think the thing that earned the biggest eye-roll from me was the complete shoehorning in of whatever hot-button political issue the author could come up with into nearly every conversation. In some instances closer to the end there’s more of an excuse for naming all the ‘bad things’ of the world in this way, but he did this from the very beginning too. If the story has nothing to do with climate change or immigration or whatever topic, and doesn’t offer any meaningful commentary, then I would just skip it. Leave it out, otherwise it feels like you’re just trying to tick boxes. If this book was being published next year instead of this month, I guarantee he would have worked in Britney’s conservatorship somehow.Those things, though grating, didn’t impact my time with the story as a whole, but probably prevented it from being five stars. The thing I disliked most about Wanderers, how poorly constructed the ending was compared to the first half, was not an issue at all here. I actually loved the ending in The Book of Accidents. It wasn’t too neat or too open-ended, and offered real resolution where it could still be forged. I think Wendig will probably be a hit-or-miss author for me going forward. And it’s going to be dependent or not whether he can keep himself from trying to cover everything at once. Keep the story more localized, don’t try to encompass every social and political struggle of the moment, and I think the final product will be better for it.*Thanks Del Rey Books & Netgalley for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,83,1,"Jul 07, 2021","Jul 25, 2021","Jul 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55782435-the-book-of-accidents

Yes, that’s exactly what this was.[image]Zetian has a plan. It’s not a particularly well thought-out plan, but it’s the one she’s sticking to. It’s all really pretty simple; she will volunteer as a concubine-pilot, get paired with the same pilot as her sister….and then murder him. Kill him as savagely and unflinchingly as he did to her older sister months before. The world Zetian and her sister have grown up into is not a kind place to be a woman or girl, and this final act by Zetian will be one small return on investment for a societal practice rooted in cruelty.Though if everything went according to her plan, this would have been a much shorter story, wouldn’t it? Instead of getting the chance to intentionally slay her sister’s killer, Zetian inadvertently does while hooked up to his consciousness in the Crysalis, aka the device used to control the giant, fighting robots. The result is seemingly unprecedented, and as a punishment for her lack of subservience she is paired with the only Crysalis pilot not beloved by the citizens of Huaxia, convicted criminal Li Shimin. A transparent attempt to cow her or kill her all together, Zetian will have to gather all of her inner power to overcome a deck so monstrously stacked against her. I think the biggest concern I had beginning this book is that it would be too sci-fi for me to follow. Though it definitely qualifies as science fiction, fantasy readers don’t have reason to be afraid! It reads like a fantasy novel, albeit set in the future and with pseudo-technology instead of enchantments and curses. There is a good amount of magic present in the story as well, with pilots and concubines’ spirit pressure, aka the measurement of each person’s qi, being what powers the Chrysalises and lends each individual their abilities.It was so fascinating to see the blending of new and old, technology and mythology, especially within a specific cultural setting. Huaxia is a society set centuries in the future, with pieces of historical and modern China pulled together into a hybrid dystopia. Things like the retired practice of foot-binding was present, and like most current and previous human societies, a deeply misogynistic, patriarchal structure dominated nearly every aspect of their lives. It’s been probably over a decade and a half since I’ve read Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, but I can’t say reading about foot binding has gotten any easier since then. Still, it’s important to keep in mind that every society on this planet has done terrible things to its people, especially to the vulnerable members of it.[image]Reading this was such a trip, and I was constantly having to slow myself down so I didn’t completely tear through it. Especially since some of the action scenes moved pretty quickly and I would get a little lost. Between that and having a only middling understanding of the different kinds of qi and how they work, I think this book could have benefitted from a little more explanatory portions along the way. Still, I wouldn’t say any of that took away from my overall reading experience since I still was raving to people about it after I finished.Iron Widow is an incredibly inventive fever dream of fantasy, science, history and polyamorous bisexuals, and a challenge to a genre that at times feels overrun by the exact same kind of story over end over again. I haven’t quite read anything like Xiran Jay Zhao’s debut before, and I’m extremely excited to read more set in this universe after that insane twist at the very end.

There’s always another secret.”When Jordy first suggested this book to me he told me that it was ‘a heist but the characters eat metal to activate their magic powers’. Clearly there’s a reason his job is not professionally writing book blurbs, but now that I’ve finished I can’t say he was factually incorrect. The first book in a series is always the make or break one for me. If I can’t get invested in the first round, especially for a fantasy series, I’m not going to pick up the sequel. This can be a lot of pressure for a story that, by definition, is not going to be 100% completed at the end of the book. That said, I think there’s room for some leeway when beginning a huge, epic tale like Mistborn, and giving Brandon Sanderson the benefit of the doubt on a few issues, I can already see myself becoming a huge fan of this series (or at the very least the initial trilogy).Let’s start with the good, I absolutely loved the dynamic between Kelsier, Vin and the rest of the team. There’s the devilish leader, his untrained but powerful apprentice, a snooty commentator, the loveable muscle, the voice of reason and even an old curmudgeon, among others. The variance in personalities and how those compliment and also contrast their respective abilities and roles was exceedingly well done. I also really appreciate what Sanderson did with some of the tropes of the genre, somehow both playing into them but also subverting them in a way the Game of Thrones show-runners wish they could have done.My biggest problem with Mistborn thus far seems like a pretty obvious one, but just in case some series fans haven’t considered it: there are basically no female characters. Sure, Vin is a teenage girl and one of the main characters, but I had to get 40% into the book to meet another named female character. And what was she like? Well, she was a jealous mean girl that was mad at Vin for trying to steal her man. Cue the eye-roll. (view spoiler)[And then Vin ends up killing her.

First impression is that I see why his novels are so popular. Survive the Night is a compelling and addicting trip through some remote areas of the Northeastern US and very much held my attention throughout. Was it a life-changing experience? Have I found my new favorite thriller author? No, but I definitely believe Sager is a reliable source of thrills and chills going forward.The story follows Charlie, a human trauma factory and college student who has just suffered another devastating loss when her best friend Maddy is murdered by a figure known only as the Campus Killer. Charlie, planning to drop out, takes a ride from a stranger back to her home in Ohio, but not long after embarking on their ride does Charlie start to feel that this guy, Josh, may not be exactly who he says he is. [image]Not helping matters, Charlie has a strange condition. Besides being a mildly insufferable film snob she also disassociates from reality when stressed or upset—and she sees movies in her mind. This plays into the formatting of the novel, which is structured like a script.....kind of. I actually thought this bit was fairly clever. I generally love a good gimmick, and the way that Charlie viewed everything seemingly through a cinematic lens gave the book a feeling of unreality. You’re never 100% sure that what’s happening is actually happening, and the unreliable narrator in Charlie made for an interesting narrative, if a little too convenient.I think that this book was....missing something for me to rate it higher. Possibly more pages as it was pretty short. I liked the premise and the set-up, but since this was such a limited location and a small number of characters, I didn’t think it was too difficult to guess what happened. I was expecting a few more twists worked into the book, some revelations to give breaks to the tension. And the ending/epilogue was......a choice. Can’t get too specific because of spoilers, but it felt like Sager making an attempt to acknowledge how unrealistic the plot was. Though instead of addressing that point he just lampshaded it and really beat the audience over the head with the ~theme~ of the story.This book is currently on its knees, begging for someone to adapt it. Would it make a good movie? Possibly, but as one for a streaming service, I think. Based off of how it all wrapped up I don’t see myself spending $12 or whatever the current rate is to go watch this in a theater, but who knows. It would definitely be a fun concept to play with for a director, depending on how much they want to lean into Charlie’s internal “movies”. It could also come off as a little too campy, so that would be a delicate balance.It was good enough, but not great for me. I’d recommend it to someone looking for a quick, fun thriller but not something you have to think about at all. Also I’m not sure how I feel about how many authors are writing pre-technology thrillers to avoid dealing with things like the internet or cellphones. It’s like we’re being buried in nostalgic references to distract from the fact that they’re cutting some corners while drafting. I don’t know, I’ll think about that some more. Not this book, though, or else I might start to like it less.[image]*Thanks Carrie & Dutton Books for my copy!

After leaving Dalloway ScThere’s something sinister residing in Godwin House.[image]Or someone.Felicity Morrow has returned to her old haunt as well. After leaving Dalloway School abruptly a year before, her reentry is much more subdued than grand now that Alex is no longer by her side. Nevertheless she’s back, still grieving this enormous loss and racked with guilt. But Felicity isn’t the biggest news on campus. Not with the author prodigy Ellis Haley enrolling at Dalloway and moving into Godwin House alongside her. The girls have barely begun to settle in and Ellis is already making waves in their social circles, while Felicity is simply trying not to create any ripples. But Ellis’s new book promises to be on the infamous Dalloway Five, young women accused of being witches centuries ago only to each die under mysterious circumstances. And after learning Felicity’s senior thesis is also about these women, what else can Felicity say when Ellis asks for her help researching their school’s veiled history?This book was a wicked delight. I can’t remember when I’ve last been this contentedly fraught while reading. The characters are as equally compelling as they are vicious, their motives always murky. As current relationships are constructed and past ones dissected, it’s hard to know what information you can trust. Are we being gaslit? Is this response protectiveness or possessiveness? Are these characters in a toxic relationship or have they finally found the person who understands them more than anyone? The lack of immediate answers to these questions kept me reading by keeping me paranoid.[image]I saw someone recently ask on Twitter what makes something “gothic” and a lot of authors and lit majors weighed in to confirm what I’ve long suspected. It’s mostly about “the vibes”. There’s broader themes like a commentary on life and death and recurring tropes such as things in decay, old creepy houses, hauntings, etc. But it’s a lot of moodiness and trying to capture certain emotions instead of any specific plot or character requirements. I think that’s why so much of the genre is set in the past, because it’s hard to effectively pull off a haunted midcentury modern condo decorated with a chevron rug and ‘inspirational’ wall art. Which makes Victoria Lee’s ability to pull off a contemporary gothic novel all the more impressive. The location plays a big role in this, and setting it at an elite girl’s boarding school north of New York City was a clever way to achieve the desired aesthetic without going back in time. This school is probably the most ‘fantasy’ part of the book, just because of how unabashedly ambitious and intellectual the curriculum is. If I’m being honest, the students resemble grad students more than high schoolers, but that’s part of the ~vibe~. If you can’t get onboard with a smattering of academic snobbery, then you’re not going to enjoy the full experience. And in this vein, I think this book has been mis-shelved by the users of this site. I would call A Lesson in Vengeance a lot of other things before I would categorize it as a fantasy. It’s dark and twisting, full of suspense and gothic aesthetics. There’s plenty of hints at the supernatural, though without ever really committing to it. Yes, the characters spend a good amount of time talking about witches and magic and ghosts, but I wouldn’t go into it expecting a full-blown YA fantasy world unfurling around you, because that’s not what this is.[image]So what is A Lesson in Vengeance, then? It’s a dark academia that holds you in a vice-grip until you reach the end. It’s beautifully written and a deep-dive into the occult. There’s candid and at times uncomfortable depictions of mental illness, but still honest to the experiences of the author. Lee writes a nuance in the portrayal of trauma that I don’t typically see offered to female characters in the same way it’s granted to their male counterparts. The exploration of these grayer shades of morality provides depth beyond the more conspicuous aspects of the story.Menacing and haunting, with a suffocating amount of tension, A Lesson in Vengeance delivers twist after twist like a knife in the gut. And yet you still come crawling back for more.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,122,1,"Jul 30, 2021","Aug 05, 2021","Jun 24, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50999821-a-lesson-in-vengeance

A ringing endorsement from a beloved author or the shared excitement of a friend is usuaAdmittedly, it does not take much to hype me up about a book. A ringing endorsement from a beloved author or the shared excitement of a friend is usually enough to have me bouncing around in anticipation. So yes, my elation as I went into The Dead and the Dark probably didn’t match the overall tone of the novel, but it didn’t take long to adjust to the truly creepy, unsettling town that was Snakebite, Oregon.Somewhere between a ghost story and a murder mystery, Courtney Gould’s debut novel follows two young women—Logan, who just moved into town with her dads, and Ashley, who’s family is a staple of Snakebite and owns most of the local property. Though starting out on adversarial terms, the two eventually forge a sort of alliance once their peers begin disappearing, which blossoms into a something-more-than-friendship later on. Ashley is still mourning the loss of her boyfriend, Tristan, who disappeared only a week after one of Logan’s fathers, Brandon, showed up in Snakebite. Fighting town prejudices as well as an unnamed force that casts a sinister shadow over the entire community, Ashley and Logan are racing against the clock to find the culprit and finally grant their friends and family peace.What I liked most about this story was probably also one of the things holding it back. There’s a supernatural element to this book, with vaguely defined ‘Dark’ powers that are genuinely scary to follow along with. Unfortunately I think that with all that build-up, the ending felt a little flimsy, like the author didn’t know how to get down from the height she climbed up to. It wrapped up in a way even less defined, which I think left the ending more open-ended than she intended. It seems like a lot of the problems that Logan and her family faced could have been resolved earlier on if her fathers literally told her, well, anything. This isn’t my favorite way that authors withhold information, by having the characters be allergic to communication, but though annoying it wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. Some of the twists completely caught me off guard, while others were more predictable, but throughout my time reading I have to say I was totally rapt.At the end of the day, this is a solid scary, paranormal mystery that would make a great binge. Some of the character interactions were a little convenient to the story, but this was always going to be a book where one has to suspend disbelief for the extent of it. Ashley and Logan are interesting characters, though their romance was a little half-baked for me, but I did like them individually. Will The Dead and the Dark hold up under sharp analysis? Probably not, but as far as entertainment goes, I can recommend this one.*Thank you Chelsea for sharing your ARC with me! ...more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Jun 25, 2021","Jun 28, 2021","Jun 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53141419-the-dead-and-the-dark

A place and its copy. Hidden rooms and hidden secrets. A shard of bone. And death itself.[image]Be honest, how many Victoria Schwab books do those last few lines remind you of? A lot of great authors have a distinct style, something that makes their books identifiable without having to name them, and clearly she falls into that category. Schwab has been a favorite of mine over the past year and after relentless begging I got a chance to read a friend’s advance copy. If there’s one thing I can expect from one of her books, it’s to be swept away to a world just as magical as it is vicious.I really liked the premise. After being invited out of the blue by a mystery relative, Olivia moves from her dressed-up orphanage to a sprawling manor miles and miles away. The house has only three residents, two of them staff, and nobody seems willing to answer any of her burning questions. But it’s not just the house that’s sparsely populated; there doesn’t seem to be anyone living in the vicinity. The only thing that seems to be alive, breathing is an immense wall behind the back garden. Shadows don’t stick to it, and tangling grey vines attempt to poke their way through the structure, but still it calls to Olivia in a way she’s never felt before. There’s a lot to like in Olivia Prior. She doesn’t speak, she’s never been able to, but there’s plenty to glean from her character besides dialogue. Schwab does an excellent job finding ways for her to express herself without uttering a single word. With bottomless curiosity and a ferocious streak when provoked, Olivia is the quintessential Schwab heroine. Unlikeable and an outsider to the society she lives in, but easy for the reader to root for. There are glimmers of some of these qualities in other characters in the book, but none that feel as fully developed as she is.[image]And that does seem to be my issue with this book. It’s just not a complete circle. Some things are delved into so deeply that I feel them coming to life around me, and others feel rushed through. The ending is also fairly abrupt for this level of magical build-up, to the point at the end I was wondering, ‘what was this all for?’Do you know how how frustrating it is to read 90% of a great story? Victoria Schwab’s writing is just so damn engrossing—she gets her hooks into you all she needs is to give a slight yank and I’ll come running. When she gets a story right it’s absolutely right. The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue and Vicious immediately come to mind. The writing and the characters are always consistently good from her, and the plot of those two is perfectly constructed. It’s just some of her books are missing something to make that perfect whole. All the ingredients are there, but it still doesn’t feel one hundred percent fully formed. I can’t even say what that extra 10% is or where is should go, just that it’s MIA.Would I say read Gallant? Absolutely if you’re a Schwab fan, but I probably won’t have to tell my fellow Schwablins that. If you like old gothic mansions, ghosts & the paranormal and a quieter, creeping kind of magic, then you may enjoy this as well. But I’m still on the hunt for that incredible fantasy novel of 2022, and though I had hoped this would be that book—I’m going to have to keep looking.[image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,1,194,1,"Jul 28, 2021","Aug 09, 2021","Jun 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58064046-gallant

Cosby has perfected the formula for the intense, timely action-thriller that’ll hit you right in the feels. I really loved Blacktop Wasteland, and am so glad I was able to squeeze this one in before the end of the year!Ike Randolphs’s son is dead. Murdered, along with his husband, Derek, with so much still left unsaid between Ike and Isiah. The police are either unable or unwilling to bring the assailants to justice, so it seems as though this violent crime is going to remain unsolved. Until Derek’s father, Buddy Lee, approaches Ike with a proposition—that the two of them, ex-cons with more tools at their disposal than the police, start investigating their murders instead. Though reluctant at first, it doesn’t take long for Ike to slip back into his old persona, ‘Riot’, and with that Razorblade Tears picks up with Cosby’s now trademark action and unrestrained violence. Each father is motivated by the same things, a desire for revenge against the killers paired with the insurmountable loss of their sons. It all comes to a explosive and high-stakes climax, perhaps with just one too many final twists, but hits its target by the end nonetheless.What Cosby does really well is plunge the reader not just into the midst of the fighting, but also the softer moments where Ike and Buddy are left consumed by their grief. Neither had fully accepted Isiah nor Derek while they were alive, and now they’ve decided to channel those regrets into hunting down those responsible. There’s also an examination of race and how it affects each character’s worldview. Buddy is confronted with his own white privilege despite not feeling particularly well-off. Both men start to deal with the homophobia ingrained in their communities. Razorblade Tears has more than just an intense plot; it also has a strong message that only rarely diverges into sermon.This is a great book, not because it’s going to be universally beloved, but because it’s robustly honest. I’ve seen some s complaining about the violence, of which there is admittedly plenty. Or the social commentary and themes being to overt—a note to anyone reading s: don’t take seriously any that use “woke” as a pejorative. It demonstrates a lack of understanding for the origin of the term and a lack of respect for those that are on the receiving end of such dismissals. With that, Razorblade Tears not going to be for everyone, and that’s fine. But if during the summer of 2020 you were most upset by the Target in Minneapolis being burned down, it’s probably best that you just keep scrolling. *Thanks Jordy for the birthday book!!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,77,1,"Nov 30, 2021","Dec 09, 2021","Jun 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54860585-razorblade-tears

The last thing she sees is a bright light coming towards her then....nothing. First Shelby went missing. Then Meredith vanished. And with her, her daughter Delilah. But more than a decade later Delilah is found, and she returns home. Will she be the final missing piece of the puzzle to reveal what happened to Shelby and her mother? Or will she uncover even more secrets buried deep in a community where nothing bad is supposed to happen?I had a really good time with this one. We’re slowly introduced to the Dickey family in present day after Delilah returns to her father, Josh, and brother, Leo. The two kids, now teenagers, Leo & Delilah make up half of the POVs in the book. The other two are flashbacks to eleven years ago around the time of the disappearances. They feature Kate, the Dickey’s neighbor and Meredith before she vanished. As information trickles in, you start to get an idea of where the story might end up, only to have Kubica rip the rug from under your feet. I genuinely thought I had it figured out! It was the most obvious answer, but still!!! I was convinced. But the reality of what happened eleven years ago was so out of left field that I doubt anyone would be able to accurately predict it. And the ending was even more of a shock! Was this story pushing the realm of believability? I mean, duh. But it was still a fun ride if you don’t take things like ~plausibility~ into consideration.

Until this past week I had hardly heard a single bad word about it. “HeartI can’t think of a book that has been more recommended to me than this one. Until this past week I had hardly heard a single bad word about it. “Heartwarming”, “emotional” and “wholesome” were the ones I’ve seen the most, which is....not usually the type of book I would gravitate towards. But Natalie sent me a copy in a ploy to finally get me to read it, and it worked! Unfortunately right after starting it, a bit of a controversy surfaced surrounding a piece of history Mr. Klune came across while writing and researching Cerulean Sea. I’m not going to re-hash it all here, but there are several s with one star that go into further detail. I know it’s probably the last thing this situation needs, another white lady with an ~opinion~ about residential schools, but it felt disingenuous for me to sidestep the issue all together. I think a lot of indigenous people are mourning and hurting right now, and TJ Klune is not currently in the best headspace (via a statement on Twitter), so it’s probably not the time for a super productive conversation. But I do hope eventually there can be further discussion about how much “inspiration” an author should take from real events, and the implications how the work may or may not diverge from them.That said, I am going to  the book here, separate from what’s come out recently. After reading The House in the Cerulean Sea, I don’t believe this was an attempt to co-opt the history of Indigenous residential schools. I wish there was more room for nuance when we talk about things like this, and I think that we’ll reach that point eventually, but for now we’re just going to have to try to navigate difficult conversations as best as we can.————————————————————So on to the book! I liked this one. Not sure exactly what I was expecting, just that basically everyone who’s read it thought it was touching and perfect. Like I mentioned before, I don’t usually read a ton of ‘feel-good’ stories because they don’t really hold my attention. But I still tried to go into this with an open mind and expected a moving experience.For me, this book was missing some grit. It’s an easy story in that there’s a clear villain and you’re guided with a heavy hand by the author in how you’re supposed to feel. Cerulean Sea is about supposed monsters and supernatural creatures who are closely monitored and controlled by the government, in this case children who are placed in homes to protect the ‘safety’ of human society. It’s clear who these characters are supposed to represent—whether they be Black or Indigenous, LGBTQ+ or another marginalized community. The children under the care of the benevolent Mr. Parnassus are judged for what they are, things out of their control, instead of who they are as people.The kids are fun. I enjoyed any scene with them, and liked how Klune wrote them against whatever ‘type’ you’d expect from their powers or abilities. Zoe is an interesting challenge to the notion that all adult magical creatures need to be registered with the government, and I liked how her presence anchored the story. Unfortunately almost any scene with them concluded with Arthur Parnassus appearing to beat the reader over the head with one of a handful of repetitive life lessons, but in all they were a big net positive.I think I was least impacted by Linus, the case worker from the Department in Charge of Magical Youth. He’s supposed to be the audience surrogate as he’s introduced to the children, but I found him less endearing than I think he was meant to be. I don’t know....I feel like after all of the realizations of the harm his agency caused there would have been more of a reckoning with his complacency and active participation in that process. It felt a lot like one of those white savior-y movies that the Academy loves to hand out awards to. His evolution from cog in the xenophobic machine to newly ‘woke’ to the effects of systemic oppression had a predictable trajectory, with his inevitable forgiveness implied. So, it was an entertaining story. I didn’t feel as impacted as I expected because it didn’t really go too deep. Sweet, but surface. This is a YA novel, so I would have no qualms about recommending it to teenagers. And don’t get me wrong, I can see why people liked it! But the undying adoration that it’s received has me wondering if that’s because it allows the reader to enjoy complicated issues without sacrificing their comfort level.*Thanks Natalie for forcing sending me a copy! ...more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Jun 02, 2021","Jun 11, 2021","Jun 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046567-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea

A thoughtful critique this will not be, so keep scrolling if that’s what you’re looking for.Olympus, Texas came with some glowing recommendations by friends I usually agree with. ‘Family drama’ as a genre is a little too sweeping of a category for me and usually feels kind of reductive, but that’s basically all there was to this. This family had drama. It was mostly preventable and all the participants were annoying, but it was dramatic. Unfortunately I did not care about what happened to them because they’re a family of the world’s most boring sociopaths. Yawn, eye-roll, etc....This book was mostly forgettable, probably not worth the time I spent reading/listening to it. If you need an equivalent to a background tv show in book form, then I guess I could recommend this.

There’s a missing student, a If you’ve read any YA thrillers that have come out over the past few years, How We Fall Apart will likely seem familiar. There’s a missing student, a group of friends with hidden secrets, the clueless adults surrounding them and a faceless villain using technology to expose and cyberbully their intended targets.It’s a formula that wasn’t ‘invented’ by One of Us Is Lying, but sure appears to have been popularized by it. And why not? The biggest gaps between previous generations and Gen Z circle back to technology and social media, and even the distance between Zoomers and Millennials seems to be widening in this sense. So, yeah, even though a lot of these synopses are starting to sound the same, I can’t say it isn’t relevant to a modern teenage audience. (I only have one note for authors—repeat after me: NO MORE PLOTS THAT REVOLVE AROUND EVERY STUDENT IN SCHOOL GETTING MASS TEXTS. It is silly and not how texting works. Also it seems more like a 20 or 30-somethings idea of how teenagers communicate. Just like……find a new thing.)But back to the story, I think the more interesting aspects of this book lie in the specific struggles of each of the central characters, including their family wealth, ethnicity, mental health, etc. The plot, while engaging, doesn’t really offer anything groundbreaking within the genre. I wish the characters had been more fleshed-out for this reason, and the text overall felt starved in some places. I’m not sure what the final page count on this is, but my ARC clocked in at about 300 pages, so I know there was definitely space for some more development.The dialogue, to me, seemed on the younger side of YA, a little more juvenile. Which isn’t a swipe at the book or author! I imagine a 15 year-old would enjoy How We Fall Apart more than, say, a 17 or 18 year-old, but it is going to be different for each person. Katie Zhao has previously written middle grade novels so I could see how this would be a natural extension for her now that she’s moving into a slightly older audience. YA books are not going to be written for me, nor should they be as I’m an adult woman. But those couple of years between ages during these formative years really do make a difference at that point in your life.I wasn’t a huge fan of the final ‘reveal’ twist if I am being completely honest, but I am intrigued with the cliffhanger ending. As there’s already a planned sequel, I’m excited to see where the next book picks up after leaving us all metaphorically hanging. There’s still a few pretty big secrets up in the air and I’m expecting that the eventual unfurling of them will finally grant the level of satisfaction that was missing for me in this first installment.*Thanks to Bloomsbury & Netgalley for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Aug 03, 2021","Aug 10, 2021","May 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52778487-how-we-fall-apart

Then aNow a Goodreads Choice nominee in Young Adult Fantasy & Science Fiction!When I first saw this cover I thought it was going to be a fantasy. Then after reading then synopsis I thought it was going to be a thriller. It’s really not either of those things though, so admittedly it took me a while to find my footing in The Ones We’re Meant to Find.There was so much going on in this book, even with somewhat of a slow start. Celia and Kasey are sisters, separated by an unknown amount of space and time. The opening chapters feature Cee alone on a deserted island and Kay living as a kind of recluse in a densely populated eco-city. Kasey has been grieving the loss of her sister for three months, who was last seen embarking out into the dangerous waters surrounding their city. Cee, on the other hand, has been trying to escape ever since she first woke up on the island, dreaming of the only person in the world who’s important to her now: her sister.We don’t learn a lot about the world the girls live in in Cee’s chapters, but while Kay is attempting to retrace Celia’s last moments before her disappearance we’re introduced to more and more of its harsh realities. After refusing to take action to protect the environment, humans have found that it’s turned on them. While some regions have adjusted, massively reducing their carbon footprints, spending a third of their lives in stasis pods among other things, many have flatly refused and continue to cause damage. And I have to say, after over a year of collective foot-dragging and tantrum-throwing when it comes to basic things like wearing a mask or getting vaccinated during a worldwide pandemic by some, this is probably the least surprising thing about the world depicted here by Ms. He.The society Kay is a part of is one of the more interesting aspects of the story. There’s some typical Black Mirror stuff—holographs, memory storing and erasing, a social standing score, etc.—but I think the more unique bits are when the technology isn’t the focus and instead the morality around it is. Where does autonomy overlap with selfishness? Is it more important to protect individual interests or collective ones? Can causing intentional harm be excusable if it serves a greater societal good? The Ones We’re Meant to Find is about climate change, technology, humanity, ecoterrorism, capitalism, family and so much more.But I think, at its core, this book asks what we owe one another. Some of that is broader, what do we owe other people living on this earth, but it also extends to a more personal level. The bond between these two sisters is the driving force of the novel, propelling them to re-examine their own very different world views in an attempt to understand one another. Cee is different from the person she used to be. Kay has always felt like a less complete version of her sister. In order to fully *get* this book, you have to get Cee and Kay. Which is probably why you’re going to see a smattering of low ratings mixed in with the high ones. This book is not going to be able to sink its claws into everybody, and that’s fine. It’s probably too slow at the beginning, maybe also a little confusing at first, but once it clicks, it clicks. And I think as time has passed (I finished it about a week ago), I’ve come to appreciate what Joan He did here even more. The Ones We’re Meant to Find is a daunting, transfixing journey into a world that’s both too close to and too divergent from our own to ever feel completely comfortable in. I’d recommend readers to take their time getting into it, try and revel in that discomfort and to let yourself be swept away.And as a side note:I really enjoyed Descendant of the Crane, and I’m excited to read more from Joan! And after all that nonsense her last publisher put her through, I’m hopeful that she’s found a team that fully supports AND compensates her for her work.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,93,1,"Jul 07, 2021","Jul 24, 2021","May 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54017953-the-ones-we-re-meant-to-find

I actually really enjoyed this romp through spaceCongrats to the 2021 Goodreads Choice ✨WINNER✨ in Science Fiction!Well this was a nice surprise. I actually really enjoyed this romp through space, especially considering this was my first experience with Andy Weir’s books. Project Hail Mary was far more personable than I expected from a science fiction space adventure, and was really accessible for someone (me) who is normally hesitant when approaching the genre. Ryland Grace (his actual name, unfortunately) has woken up alone in space. That obviously wasn’t the original plan, at least he thinks it wasn’t, since his two supposed crewmates are lying dead beside him. With a foggy memory and sharp instincts, Ryland starts to slowly piece together a hazy timeline of events that led him to his current predicament, which turns out to be saving the humanity from a series of extinction-level events. No pressure.One of the biggest pluses of the book also ended up being the most grating over time. My god, is there really a need to make every single sentence that Ryland Grace utters quirky? Most of his conversations, even musings on his own, felt like a wink to the audience. There were times when it felt like he did actually break the fourth wall, The Office style. For every Ryland-ism that got a laugh, another got an exasperated eye roll. I understand Weir is probably trying to maintain the attention of people who are science-adverse (again, me), but I think he over did it here. [image]I think based on my book club discussions it’s kind of spilt on whether people preferred the Earth flashbacks or the current timeline aboard the Hail Mary. Personally, I preferred the space portions, not in any small part because of how cringey some of the Earth scenes were. (view spoiler)[Whew, I can see why Weir mostly had the main character converse with a singing space spider and not actual people, because I could not handle 450 pages of Ryland Grace tried to talk like a human. Even characters like Stratt got on my nerves, especially when she went on that weird anti-feminist rant? Which felt like the author trying to showcase how ‘woke’ he and his writer-insert character (Ryland, obviously) are while taking the Lady Boss® down a peg or two in the audience’s eyes. All the supporting characters were like caricatures at times: stoic-Chinese-man, hard-drinking-Russian-woman and two American scientists that spoke like characters from The Big Bang Theory. In all, these people made up very little of the story, but I still had to whine in the spoiler section because I cannot help myself.The ending also felt like a bit of a cop-out to me. It’s a lot easier for an author to make up the rules of an invented alien species then consider the actual ramifications of decades of devastating climate change on Earth, so even if I hadn’t accidentally spoiled the ending for myself (oops), I would have guessed it wrapped up similarly to this. But just because I expected it, doesn’t mean I was any less disappointed that this was how a ‘save the Earth!!!’ book decided to address the events on Earth.  (hide spoiler)]I can’t pass judgement on whether the science in the book is legitimate. I’d assume it’s a mixture of both real and fabricated, but it all seemed good to me! I really liked how Weir explained a lot of the science, actually. There would be a long explanation that tried its best to elaborate in layman’s terms, and then underneath that he’d basically do an ‘explain like I’m five’ that would be a sentence or two. So you can read it and watch him show his work in detail or just skim it and jump to the dum-dum explainer, which I did a few times. [image]Either way, I think I’d recommend this book to most people. There’s a huuuuuge piece of this story I’m not addressing at all because I would hate to spoil it for someone, but just know that this part is very fun and cool, if a little unrealistic. Whatever, though, just sit back and enjoy the ride.“The hardest part about working with aliens and saving humanity from extinction is constantly having to come up with names for stuff.”Please do not let Ryland Grace or Andy Weir name any science or space things in real life ever. He/they are very bad at it.*Thanks Kristen & Janine of Not Yo Mama’s Book Club for my copy and letting me join the discussion last month!!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,91,1,"May 18, 2021","May 29, 2021","May 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary

Even with the tempered expectations I went into Animal with, I still felt like I was deprived of what could have been a much better book. I’ve seen a lot of positive s here for this one, and that’s fine, we all have different opinions. But after giving it some thought there’s no way I can give a book that I have actively warned so many of my friends from reading a higher rating than this. To kick things off, let’s start with this quote:“I am depraved. I hope you like me.”These are the 8 words I’ve seen splashed all over the marketing. I love this quote. There’s so much revealed about a character who says this, and I was so intrigued by what more I would learn about her. The main character, Joan, is also the narrator and addresses the reader directly as she tells her story. It’s hard to discern who she’s speaking to in the beginning, but it’s later revealed shes talking to (view spoiler)[her daughter (hide spoiler)]. This is the first of many problems I had with the book. I felt like the first half had a markedly different tone in who Joan was addressing. During that portion she was purely showing off for the ‘audience’, not speaking to anyone in particular, and I wish the author had been more consistent with her voice.Throughout most of the book you’re not really supposed to like Joan. I believe by the end, though, the author’s intent was to have you sympathize with or at least understand her better. I’m typically a fan of unlikeable female characters, although I know they’re not usually super popular (duh). But what could have been an interesting character examination of the cycle of abuse and trauma instead became a shock-fest full of gratuitous depictions of sexual assault, child abuse, miscarriage and violence enacted with minimal tangible purpose. To repurpose the now-famous Adam Serwer quote: offense is the point. You’re supposed to read portions of this book and be completely horrified. Many scenes are graphic and disturbing, with little left to the imagination. The characters are inconsiderate, so they speak offensively. You could go back and forth on specific lines of dialogue or debate the necessity of including certain descriptions or even entire scenes. For example, I don’t think there’s a reason for this author, or any white author in general, to use the n-word* in their works. My thesaurus is failing me—what’s the exact opposite of crucial? That’s what this word was to the plot of Animal.But I get it. Some writers just like to include things because they can. They believe in an unencumbered right to say whatever they want, whenever they want, and anything less is censorship. I’m not really interesting in engaging in that debate. What I wanted from Animal was a smart commentary on female rage and aggression. I wanted something that would make me feel like I did after reading Gone Girl or watching Promising Young Woman. Instead I got 70% of ‘this is boring’ paired with 30% of ‘what the actual fuck?’It just feels like such a waste. There were glimmers of greatness present in the text. Several quotes and ideas that hit where I think the author wanted them to, but just not enough to make it a worthwhile experience for me, unfortunately. After sitting with it for a minute, I can’t say much more than this was a typical edge-lord transgressive novel, but this time make it ✨woman✨.I also didn’t like the attempt at a redemptive ending for the main character. It’s just not in line with the rest of the book and felt like a cop-out. If she is as “depraved” as she presents herself to be, then fucking own it. The very end itself was left somewhat open-ended, but by that point I didn’t care much what happened to any of the characters. They’re all held at arms length from the reader, which I guess probably fits with her as a narrator, but in effect left me feeling an echo of the same coldness that Joan maintained throughout the novel. And by that point I was very ready to be done with Animal. I didn’t read Three Women; it’s not my type of book. I can’t compare the two, and all I know about it is a slew of s I read about a year ago. I think fans of Taddeo’s last work will be a little shell shocked coming out of this one. Still, I appreciate an author branching out from her previous genres and trying something new, so I will give her credit for that. But for me, this was a pretty big miss. I’d consider trying more from Taddeo down the road, but it would have to be a fairly big departure from whatever sub-genre this was.*should be noted this was removed from the final run, but the ARC I read definitely had it less than a month out from the pub, which is still a red flag for me**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,293,1,"May 09, 2021","May 26, 2021","May 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711559-animal

But despite my lack of first-hand experience, the stories by Mr. Hendrix have reputations that precede them. From a haunted IKEA (Horrorstör) to a vampire-hunting book club (The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires) to demon-possessed teenagers (My Best Friend's Exorcism), going into The Final Girl Support Group I was expecting a level of, well, batshit-edness to accompany the story. And in that sense I can’t say I was wrong at all.You don’t get more unreliable of a narrator than Lynette Tarkington, and that’s for good reason. Every character in this group of women, the titular Final Girl Support Group, is dealing with immense trauma even decades after their lives were last in danger. Lynette watched her family and boyfriend die violent deaths as a teenager and has coped by trying to control every detail of her life to prevent herself from ever feeling that helpless and vulnerable again. She barely leaves her house, and when she does follows a neurotic routine meant to throw would-be assassins off her trail. After years and years, all the women in the group are into the middle of their lives, but Lynette is the one who most openly wears her inability to move beyond her past on her sleeve.But just like that…..things start to go wrong. The Final Girls are being picked off. From arrests to deaths and other means of incapacitation, what Lynette believes more than anything is someone is trying to take them out. As she goes on the run, she’ll have to track down both old friends and enemies, revisit suppressed pain and hopefully be able to save the people she cares about this time around.[image]I think my biggest complaint with this book is that I got lost a few too many times while reading it. I would have to go back and either re-read or rewind the audiobook in order to make sure I didn’t miss something big. Especially in the beginning, a lot of the exposition felt jumpy, and I’m still not convinced I caught everything I was supposed to. I guess this may have been a creative decision to reflect Lynette’s scattered state of mind, but for me it just felt too disorganized to be an effective means of storytelling.Between chapters there was usually some kind of medical report or advertisement for any of the movie franchises the Final Girls took part in in the aftermath of their assaults. I thought this was a really clever way to relay information to the reader, giving us useful background not just on the events that led each of the women to this point, but the culture of the time they lived in. Like a lot of the media we consume, both fictional and real, there’s a societal fascination with deranged murderers and their unsuspecting female victims. The author offers us not commentary on this phenomena, but reflects our own fixations back at us, leaving the audience to decide their own complicity for themselves.[image]Obviously I can’t compare this to his other works, but what’s clear in this absolutely insane story is that Hendrix is an old hand at horror and slasher films. He knows the tropes well enough to play into them or against them on whim, and for the most part I think he’s successful in executing some of the biggest twists of the book. A few of the characters later on (view spoiler)[Garrett, Chrissy & her pet monster Keith (hide spoiler)] felt like curveballs that weren’t properly explored. But overall I thought this was a really brilliant concept that could have used some more fine-tuning in the execution.Thanks to Kristen & Janine for picking this book for their Not Yo Mama’s Book Club in July!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,126,1,"Jul 25, 2021","Jul 29, 2021","May 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55829194-the-final-girl-support-group

I don’t really seeI’m probably going to be echoing a lot of other s here when I say I was noooooot expecting the direction this went in at all. I don’t really see how I can even broach on the themes of The Other Black Girl without giving something away. I guess the best I can say is that this is a novel that doesn’t cleanly fall into a genre, and you’re never quite sure what a character’s true motivations are. Nella is an editorial assistant at Wagner Books, an almost entirely white publishing house in New York City. After toiling away at her job for over a year, Nella is beyond excited when Wagner finally hires another Black woman, Hazel-May McCall. What begins with near immediate moments of bonding through commiseration eventually cools into an almost adversarial relationship, and Nella has a hard time pinpointing exactly why. Is Hazel just another ambitious coworker, or is there something else more sinister at play here?The biggest drawback with this book for me wasn’t really any of the content but the pacing. There was about 200 pages of preamble before I understood any of what was going on. Most of the office exchanges between Nella, Hazel and their coworkers were pretty straight-forward. It’s an work culture that’s full of underpaid assistants and a lot of inflated egos at the higher levels. And on top of that Nella experiences a range of racist micro-aggressions up through straight out aggression-aggressions while trying to fulfill the duties of her job. These scenes were probably the most effective by Zakiya Dalila Harris in the book, and I think a lot of that has to do with her own experiences in publishing as a Black woman. (Notably NOT at the place she eventually published this book lol)But while reading I was the most aimless during the series of flashbacks and alternating viewpoints peppered in between some of Nella’s chapters. Obviously it all comes together by the end, but it was a lot of waiting for everything to click into place up until that point. I thought there was a decent amount of tension and unsettling feelings throughout the first two-thirds or so that kept my attention, but I don’t think there was much of a reason to keep the audience in the dark for so long. The ending felt like it flew by in comparison, and I wish we got to sit with it a little longer instead. And listen, I know a lot of people will not like this ending, but I genuinely love and appreciate unsatisfying endings. They just feel more real to me, and not every story has to end on an uplifting note. When it comes to The Other Black Girl, I will say that this sort of twisting-of-the-knife feels a little forced, but I understand the symbolism Harris was playing with here. I definitely didn’t mind it, but I also may just not be directly impacted by the implications of a story wrapping up in this way.Would looooove to say more, but like I said earlier there’s just no way to talk more in-depth without major spoilers. For all the mixed s, I do appreciate authors that take big risks, especially in a debut. And a bit of a sidebar but still related—I think some of the Jordan Peele comparisons are not helpful to every Black author experimenting with fear & racism in their books. Yes every book needs comp titles, but there are other works to compare new fiction to that won’t put so much pressure on books that are notable in their own right. I just don’t see how marketing teams or readers immediately making that link does anyone any favors. I’d love to see more of Zakiya Dalila Harris‘s writing, without the shadow of Get Out looming over it.*Thanks to Jordan, Carrie, Nicole & Atria Books for my  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Jun 22, 2021","Jul 04, 2021","May 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711688-the-other-black-girl

I’ve felt slumpy for a while and I wanted something to jumpstart my reading again, so what better than a captivating thriller that will get your heart racing? I just completely tore through Hairpin Bridge, and I expect a lot of people will be doing the same.Taylor Adams’ sure does seem to love an isolated location. Outside of Missoula, Montana stands a bridge seemingly disconnected from most of civilization. And even before Lena’s sister Cambry’s body was discovered just over the edge, it had already developed a reputation for mysterious suicides. Lena has been preparing for months, channeling her grief into her own investigation of her twin sister’s death, and is finally ready to confront the man she thinks is responsible.I loved this book. It was so, I’m not sure the way to describe it—I guess contained? Most of it takes place on or near this bridge, driving or nearby their cars, on the the same stretch of highway. There’s remarkably few characters, even compared to the author’s last book No Exit, which had five people snowed in at a convenience store. Speaking of that one, I did not like it nearly as much as Hairpin Bridge. The first half was brilliant but a lot of the plot and character arcs fell apart in the second half for me, so I was a little bit nervous the same thing would happen this time around too.Luckily I think my worrying was mostly unnecessary. The pacing was break-neck, as in, it never seemed to really let up. Literally every moment felt like a stand-off (and yes some parts were literally stand-offs, but still!). After reading both books, what I think Adams does best in his writing is that he lets the reader think they’ve figured it out relatively early on. But his books are structured in such a way that even if you’re able to catch one of the balls he’s tossed up, there’s still a dozen more in the air at any given time. The remoteness of the location and cast probably should have been limiting, but it often left me doubting my own assumptions about the characters and their motivations.I think one of the most interesting parts of this book is the way it’s structured. The story is almost entirely narrated by the protagonist, Lena, but through three different mediums. One is the typical third person narrative where we’re following Lena in real time. Another is a blog post she’s writing just a day before embarking on her journey to Montana to try to find and confront Cambry’s killer. And then the third is a book that Lena is writing about Cambry, and even at times directly to her departed sister. I won’t get too into it, but seeing the ways some of these narrations either matchup or clash with one another really helped shade in the relationship between the Nguyen sisters for me.There was one kind of weird recurring thing I noticed while reading and I’m wondering if anyone else who’s read the book picked up on it—(view spoiler)[For a story about a murderous, corrupt cop, there sure is a good amount of copaganda. Literally every single time one of the characters has the opportunity to lament about the utter bravery and heroism that is apparently innate in every police officer except for, you know, the cold-blooded killer cop, they do. It was kind of jarring at first but mostly just got old after a while (hide spoiler)]This is my favorite thriller so far this year. It had everything I wanted and more. Hairpin Bridge is a cool blend of intense action and twisting psychology that I think a lot of people will be into. Consider me a Taylor Adams convert, even he’s inexplicably being blurbed by AJ Finn. (William Morrow?? Explain pls??????)

Full of friendship, family legacies and dark secrets, Elatsoe was an intriguing blend of fantasy and murder mystery and an all-around fun ride?Elatsoe (nickname Ellie) is a teenager living in a version of the United States, not completely unlike our own. The most obvious difference is that there are fantasy and supernatural elements intertwined with a modern day setting, and Ellie’s heritage as Lipan Apache has given her special abilities. After the death of a family member, she finds herself in the town of Willowbee running down leads and chasing ghosts. But not everything in Willowbee is what it seems, and it quickly becomes clear that Elatsoe has gotten into a much more complicated and dangerous situation than anyone could have predicted.The setting is one of the most interesting parts of the book. I thought it was cool how in this America people weren’t hiding the fact that there was magic built into the country. So often in fantasy set in a modern world, a lot of the conflict comes from trying to hide abilities and effects of creatures on the loose or spells gone wrong, and it was nice to just skip over that and right into the plot of the story. Similarly, both of Elatsoe’s parents are not only alive (thank god the author skipped the dead parents trope) but present throughout her entire journey. They are communicating with her and trust her judgement in a way that was so normal that it actually caught me off guard in a YA novel. I’ve seen several s point this out, but I just wanted to mention it as well.I would say this probably falls on the younger side of YA, even though the characters are in their late teens. Just based off the way they speak and carry themselves, I would have guessed Ellie and Jay were a few years younger than they ended up being. That said, there’s some supernatural violence and a lot of discussion of death and grief, so I wouldn’t say the book sanitized for a younger audience.In all, I liked it. I would definitely pick up more from Darcie Little Badger and am excited to see what she comes out with next.

The Guncle is teeming with joy, struggle, love and plenty of snark—and in my opinion is the perfect summer read!Patrick lives in a self-imposed exile in Palm Springs, California, with nobody to keep him company besides his housekeeper and the man who delivers his almost daily online purchases. When his brother’s family suffers an unspeakable loss, somehow Patrick is the one who ends up taking care of his kids all summer. Maisie and Grant haven’t seen much of their GUP, or Gay Uncle Patrick, but they mostly seem onboard with the new housing arrangement once they find out he has a pool. What starts as a haphazard arrangement where the go-to coping strategy is distraction, eventually evolves into a summer full of laughs, tears and a reckoning with how to move forward. What I appreciated most about this story and Rowley’s writing is the balance between the lighthearted and whimsical with the heavier topics like grief. There’s so much grieving present in this book, and each character’s journey through that pain seems both honest and on the road to some sort of reconciliation with it. They just deal with their hurt in really healthy ways that The Guncle could be almost prescriptive to someone going through something similar. For everyone else, there’s still plenty of lessons to be learned from Patrick and the kids on being who you are and finding the courage to put yourself back out there.I feel like I already said to much, so I’ll stop here. This was an excellent book and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

Ace of Spades was no exception. Although it started out similarly to a lot of other books in the genre, by the halfway point it diverged into a completely unique and sinisterly clever story all its own.Chiamaka Adebayo is Niveus Private Academy’s reigning ‘It Girl’, so it comes as no surprise when she’s named Head Prefect for the fourth year in a row. What does come as a surprise is that Devon Richards, a music student who keeps largely to himself, is awarded one of the Senior Prefect slots alongside her. Despite being on scholarship, Devon has a lot going for him as a student, and as Chiamaka dreams of Yale, he has his sights set on Juliard. Their new student leadership positions only strengthen their chances of success, and it seems like the world is at their fingertips.But because this is a thriller, it obviously does not all go according to plan. Immediately after receiving their titles, an anonymous source that goes by ‘Aces’ starts spreading rumors and gossip about the pair. Some of it is more harmful than others, but it appears Aces is doing their best to ruin the bright futures that were all but guaranteed to them. It also doesn’t escape notice that the only two students being targeted, Devon and Chiamaka, are the only two Black kids in their school.I’ve seen this kind of a set-up before, where an anonymous cyber bully gleefully reveals characters’ deepest and darkest secrets to a captive student body, usually via text message. The first half largely sticks to this formula, and I found myself a little underwhelmed initially if I am being honest. But the second half really takes off running, and I could not turn the page fast enough. If you’re worried about this being the same sort of book you’ve read a dozen times, there’s no need. Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé revives a familiar plot line with new twists and perspectives that kept me guessing until the very end.I’d say the greatest strength of Ace of Spades was how I never felt like I had a solid footing when it came to the characters apart from Chiamaka and Devon. You never know who you can really trust, and I think Àbíké-Íyímídé does an excellent job and exposing the more diabolical aspects of a dark academia setting. Are your friends your friends and your enemies your enemies? Take no chances; trust nobody. I did think the ending was a little rushed, especially compared to how detailed the 150 pages or so were. I think we needed a little more development as far as the big finale was concerned too. I did like the epilogue, but I still had a lot more questions than we were given answers to. Though, I’d still recommend this wickedly fun thriller to anyone in the market for something fast-paced and entertaining that also contains smart social commentary.*Thanks BookishFirst and Feiwel & Friends (Macmillan) for my finished copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,"May 27, 2021","Jun 04, 2021","May 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55518780-ace-of-spades

Obviously they are not the first to market unsafe pharmaceuticals to a vulnerable population, or the only players in this massive industry. The politicians in the pocket of big pharma, the medical providers and doctors who facilitate these massive drug schemes, the regulators who look the other way—there’s a lot of culpable parties. But I feel like Keefe draws a clear line between not just the Sacklers and Purdue taking advantage of these systems, but actively making them worse for the public. They laid the groundwork for future companies to follow, all with seemingly no consequences. Between this and COVID, I don’t know how anyone can look at our healthcare system and not be repulsed. The amazing thing to me about the ultra-wealthy is that it does not take an unattainable amount of brilliance to stay rich, just a moderate level of competence. There was one, maybe two true visionaries in this family, despite that vision being morally bankrupt, and after the companies were built there wasn’t much left to do. The rest of the family members were little more than warm bodies who coasted by on accumulated wealth, too wrapped up in their own self-importance to even attempt to care about the devastation left in their wake. What the Sacklers did have in spades was an unmatched level of egotism and callous win-at-all-costs mentality, both of which eventually contributed to the downfall of Purdue after years of being the things propping it up.A perhaps an unexpected result, but there’s nothing that gives this more credibility to me than the first few sentences of A Note on Sources at the end of the book. “The Sackler family did not cooperate with my efforts to research this book. None of the Sacklers who feature prominently agreed to grant interviews.” I would be immediately skeptical of any work that they willingly involved themselves with. I’m sure this was frustrating for a writer, but still probably anticipated by Keefe. Everything in his reporting would suggest this is a family that does not engage in anything unless they are in full control of the narrative. Lately I’ve been thinking about objectivity in journalism, as well as reading reporters share their own feelings on the subject. Much of the complaints by the Sackler clan against those who have reported on their family’s misdeeds have led with an accusation of the journalist in question being “biased” or motivated by some other self-serving desire. This premise is both ridiculous in the context of the case, but also broadly speaking. And this kind of demand for absolute neutrality from those reporting the news is unrealistic, but also sanitizes the crimes of the powerful. It’s the way we get phrases like “officer involved shooting” that exist entirely in a passive voice. And with over 800,000 Americans dead and millions left reeling in the fallout of the Sacklers’ greed, the last thing that I want in any analysis is passivity.And now I’m going to do something I rarely do, which is give credit to a publisher. I’ve criticized publishing houses for not supporting their authors, giving book deals to known liars with dubious fact-checking or possibly the worst offense: printing book club ‘stickers’ directly onto covers. But putting out a nonfiction work like this, especially one that so directly shines a light towards organizations that have used their over-powered legal forces to silence and punish critics, does take a certain level of nerve and belief in their authors’ work. Keefe directly named Bill Thomas, Daniel Novack, Kimon de Greef and Julie Tate among a dozen others for their efforts, so credit to them and the rest of the team involved.One of the refrains that David Sackler repeatedly echoed was his desire to “humanize” his family. With this book, I believe that Patrick Radden Keefe accomplished that goal for him. The author, with the help of previous efforts by journalists like Barry Meier, prosecutors like Maura Healey and activists like Nan Goldin, has fully removed the veil obscuring the Sackler name from their deadly legacy. It’s my belief that even after everything, they’re going to get away with it. But it will come at a cost, possibly the only thing they value near as much as money: their reputation. And now embossed in gold lettering, a New York Times Best Seller, their name in the subtitle The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty will forever follow the phrase Empire of Pain.

I’m not sure exactly how The Wolf and the Woodsman came up on my radar, but once I read the description I just knew I had to have it. I mean, just look at those comp titles— The Bear and the Nightingale, Spinning Silver?? As a debut??? I literally had no choice.[image]Évike is everything you could want in a heroine. She’s an outsider in her pagan village, as the only girl who has grown up to have no powers. So when the feared Holy Order of the Woodsmen make an appearance, demanding the same familiar sacrifice of one “wolf-girl” from her community, it’s not a huge surprise that they don’t hesitate to offer Évike up to be taken. She’s bound and taken away to be presented to the king of Régország, who follows the Patrifaith, and eventually face a likely death.But nothing involving Évike ever seems to go as smoothly as it’s supposed to. The majority of their long journey back to the palace is through heavily wooded areas where all kinds of sinister creatures are known to roam. Further complicating matters, Évike meets Gáspár, who challenges what she believes she knows about the domineering religion in Régország. To survive, Évike will have to make sacrifices of her own, some more extreme than she could ever imagine, and face difficult truths about who she is and where she comes from.As present as magic is in this novel, religion plays just as significant a role. Though the names and customs are changed, you can feel the echos of real history’s power dynamics playing out in this fictional world. The Yehuli are representative of Jewish populations in Central/Eastern Europe, and the Patrifaith is the influence Christianity was exercising at the time. Pagan villages like Évike‘s also existed, much to the disdain of the expanding Christian empires. Though with her mixed Yehuli and pagan heritage, it’s up to her which parts of her identity she will hold on to and which she will discard completely. I have a bit of a soft spot for authors who have been told that their stories don’t belong. More often than not those stories in question feature characters that have been made to feel the same way. And I think a lot of us have held those feelings too, at one time or another. Évike is many things, but she starts as an outsider in her own community, and no matter where this story ends up taking her, that will always be a part of her identity. And the beautiful thing about Reid’s writing and fantasy in general is that you don’t have to be have the same cultural background as a character like Évike in order to identity with her.⁣ This is not a ‘clean’ fantasy where everything follows an easy formula. Expect a conflicted reading experience.I loved my time with this book. It’s equal parts mesmerizing and vicious, equipped with the full sting of an unforgiving world. There’s some dark and brutal elements, including body horror, violence and general gore, but Reid also creates a starkly beautiful setting, full of warmth and intricate world-building. My only regret is that it’s a standalone, the ending felt somewhat abrupt. But that may just be me wanting to see more of this world. Inspired by Jewish folklore and Hungarian history, by an author of the same heritage, The Wolf and the Woodsman is interwoven with magic, blood and betrayal. You’re not going to want to miss the chance to pick it up and read it for yourself.[image]*Thanks to Harper Voyager for my finished copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,77,1,"Jun 08, 2021","Jun 24, 2021","Apr 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54870179-the-wolf-and-the-woodsman

This is my fifth book from the author and it’s been interesting to see the range she has when it comes to setting, tone, plot and characters. [image]The biggest divergence from her other other works I’ve read is that Certain Dark Things is set in modern day, with the rest taking place during different eras in Mexican history. The story primarily follows Atl, a Tlāhuihpochtli vampire on the run in Mexico City, and Domingo, a human who’s just trying to get by on his own. The moment they meet Domingo knows that Atl is something special, and the two of them form a bond despite their differences. But what Domingo doesn’t yet know is that Atl is being hunted—by another vampire clan known as Necros, as well as the local authorities. She’s going to need to trust him with not just her secrets, but with her life, if they both are going to get out of Mexico City alive.I feel as though at this point we have been exposed to a fair amount of vampire content. We’ve seen sparkly ones, horny teenage vamps, ones that live in abandoned castles, but for the most part they’ve all been based on the European standard for vampires. As Moreno-Garcia elaborates on in the afterword and glossary at the back of the book, the vampire mythos is truly a global one, with cultures and societies all over the world having their own takes on the same predatory blood-sucker. In Certain Dark Things, the author grants them all equal space, with each version being a separate vampire subspecies native to different areas. This was by far my favorite element of the book, and though not feasible based on the story she was trying to tell, I kept hoping we would see appearances from even more variants.[image]As for everything else, I thought the story was engaging and interesting. There’s enough action to where you don’t have to drag yourself through it, even if the plot is a little formulaic. Atl’s and Domingo’s backstories were trickled out to the reader, although I wish she had gone a little deeper into the characterizations. I think the ending made sense for the direction the rest of the book went in, but I could see some people finding it unsatisfying. Overall I’d say this is a middle of the pack book of Moreno-Garcia’s, where I’d love the see more of this world, if not necessarily with the same characters.*Thanks to Tor Nightfire for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,70,1,"Oct 07, 2021","Oct 15, 2021","Apr 16, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54785481-certain-dark-things

I feel bad because the author seems like a really nice person, but I can’t pretend I deeply enjoyed my time reading this one. Even though the end had an amount of vindication, it just didn’t make up for the tedious 17th century courtroom drama that dominated the rest of the text.Despite what the title may suggest, The Hour of the Witch is firmly historical fiction, with the ‘witch’ aspect being contained to a couple of trials where it’s suggested a young woman may be in contact with the devil. It’s 1662 Boston and Mary Deerfield has been married several years to a man almost twice her age. She herself is not only at the mercy of an abusive husband, but also at the mercy of the court as she tries to untangle herself from his cruel grip. I’ve read books like this before, and in my opinion if you’ve read one you’ve basically read them all. There’s a puritanical village terrified of anything different, usually scapegoating woman and POC. There’s suspicious townspeople who are constantly accusing the vulnerable with little to no evidence. And of course there’s the malignant patriarchy that abuses and excuses in all the old familiar ways. It’s predictable and it’s depressing, often with very little new insight on the matter besides this bad thing happened, isn’t that so terrible??? Personally, I’ve stopped seeking out books about suffering for suffering’s sake. I know that this type of historical fiction is popular, but it really just exhausts me. This isn’t a poorly written book and you can tell the author put a lot of research into crafting it, but it’s just not for me. If you’re really in the mood for something with this vibe, I thought The Mercies was a little better done. And if you want something a little witchier, with a dash of actual, ahem, magic, then I’d recommend The Once and Future Witches.Not trying to fully discourage anyone from picking this book up, but I just want to make sure you know what you’ll be getting into.

Grief stays in the present.”Daunis Fontaine wants to heal people. That’s the plan, at least, now that she’s graduated high school. She’s spent her life up until now close to home, as an unenrolled member of the Ojibwe tribe, and has decided to study nearby as well. But when a shocking act of violence occurs in her community, everything seems to change over night. Now Daunis is shaken, but determined to get to the bottom of a mystery that has a dark hold on the people around her, and willing to take huge risks to protect her friends and family.I enjoyed parts of this book. It’s a slow-burn mystery full of twists that makes some huge moves by the end. The initial exposition was kind of clunky, but the author eventually found her groove. On the positive side, I was really impressed with Daunis as a character and how much love and care the author put into crafting a strong Ojibwe community around her main character. Angeline Boulley’s ability to create flawed, realistic and well-rounded characters extends to both protagonists *and* antagonists, which made the story that much more engaging.One of the issues I had was that it was pretty easy to figure out who the ‘bad guy’ was early on. Basically anyone who gave off a negative vibe was at least a partial villain, without exception. And because of that predictability, the book ended up kind of dragging in the middle for me. In my opinion, especially for a YA novel, it was just way too long. At least a hundred or so of the 500 pages needed to be chopped off, possibly more. I’m not sure if this will count as a spoiler or not so I’ll put it under the tags: (view spoiler)[What caught me off guard was the pivot from a mystery/thriller to a “fake dating” YA novel then back to a thriller. That’s probably why I enjoyed the middle act the least, as it didn’t fit in with the rest of the story. If I’m being honest there were a lot of cliche inserts in this book that detracted from the more compelling portions. Not every character has to be a secret genius or have a perfect sarcastic comeback for an easy set-up line. These were things that didn’t make it unreadable, but there was enough present where I felt like I was watching a cancelled Freeform drama. (hide spoiler)]The ending really saved the book for me—I couldn’t put it down. Sure, basically none of the plot was realistic, but once you set that aside it’s easier to enjoy the ride. I probably ended up liking the idea of Firekeeper’s Daughter more than the execution, but I’m still really glad it’s getting a lot of attention and hope that other people will pick it up too! *Thanks to Jordy & Kristen for my giveaway copy and for selecting it as their Big Whatever Book Club pick.

In the way that being punched in the gut is breathtaking. I couldn’t stop listening. This was a moving and powerful piece of writing that is going to linger and stay with me for a long time.Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body is exactly that. It’s a confessional of every thought—the good, bad and ugly—that the author has felt about her body in her lifetime. And just about every woman I know would be able to tell you that many of those thoughts we have about ourselves are profoundly unkind ones. Roxane in this essay collection is no exception.This book was both devastating in its familiarity and in ways I could never fully understand. I’ve never been told a store didn’t carry my size. I’ve never had medical professionals dismiss my symptoms because of my weight. I don’t move through a world that sneers at even the idea of accommodation for my body. Most of the specific instances in this memoir are ones I can’t directly relate to. But I don’t think that relatability is something that’s necessary to feel empathy for the author or identify with her words. Despite not having much of anything in common with Gay on the surface, I did identify with the feelings and thoughts she had about herself, and I don’t think I was alone in that. According to ANAD, 42% of 1st-3rd grade girls want to be thinner. 91% of women in a survey of college students admitted to controlling their weight through dieting. Diet culture and the way our society messages girls and women from a young age has warped the way we view our bodies in relation to our value as human beings. We’re taught to police our own bodies, to feel shame after eating too much or not exercising enough. We’re constantly vigilant of the space we occupy and are continuously searching for ways to make it even smaller. The societal fixation on regulating bodies, especially in women, is rooted in the same ideas of regulating women’s reproductive rights. Or gender identity and expression. It comes from the need some feel to control and subjugate people who live differently or don’t conform. And when it’s dressed up as ‘concern’ it becomes even more nefarious. Fatness is an easy target because it’s viewed as a moral failing, and so there is more of an allowance for harassment than there may be for other things.This book is, among other things, a heavy read. Gay once again details her sexual assault and expands on how that snowballed into the body she has today. She discusses her eating disorder(s) and every cruel and negative thought she’s had about herself. If those things are too triggering for you in your own recovery, it’s okay to skip this book and others like it for now. And if you get to a better place down the road, it will still be available to you.That said, Roxane Gay is also an incredibly funny woman, and there’s moments of frank reflection that are hilarious. Please enjoy this amazing quote that forced me to pause the audiobook I was listening to in order to finish laughing:“This is a popular notion, the idea that the fat among us are carrying a thin woman inside. Every time I see this particular commercial I think, ‘I ate that thin woman and she was delicious but unsatisfying.’”Probably a great time to mention how much I loved the audiobook version. It’s narrated by the author, and her delivery of lines like this are perfect. And for a memoir like this, nothing really compares to hearing the author’s words in her own voice.I don’t know how Roxane Gay found the words—I have hardly been able to in this . But I’m grateful that she did. Writing in such a raw and candid way is a gift to people who get to read it, one I truly appreciate. It’s also gratifying to see that she has succeeded professionally and personally so much in the time since this book was published. I don’t know how Ms. Gay feels about her story being inspirational to people who have gone through similar circumstances, but I’d imagine she has been, and that they’re grateful too.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Apr 03, 2021","Apr 07, 2021","Apr 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26074156-hunger

And for that reason I’m glad to be a slow study of Victoria Schwab and have her entire glorious backlist to make my way through. I can’t imagine picking up this book and having to wait even a week to pick up the next, let alone the years that her early fans did. Couldn’t be me!!!!So here it is, the burning question: Is Vengeful as good or better than Vicious? To oversimplify it—no, it’s not. But that doesn’t mean this book doesn’t have the same atmospheric writing or its own things going for it, just that I think its predecessor had a better structured arc.I’m never one to turn down a compelling sequel. If there’s the barest hint of a potential future story, then I’m all in baby! Luckily there was more than enough for her to work with here after the ingenious cliffhanger at the end of Vicious. But beyond that there were still so many unknowns that I loved considering, but also wanted answers to. We learned all about the creation of ExtraOrdinaries before, but I really appreciated the further exploration of their powers after that. And I’m happy to report that just about all of the questions I had about the limitations of their abilities were answered in the follow-up.It’s such an interesting thought experiment to consider superpowers in this way. Stripped of capes and spandex, what’s left but a collection of damaged individuals who don’t have a firm grip on their abilities or their mindsets? There’s several new characters introduced in Vengeful and I think they provide important counterbalances to the world views and though processes of characters like Victor or Eli, not to mention their powers. As always with Schwab, we’re left with conflicting feelings about the ideas of good and evil, with a lot to think about but not much in the way of firm directives. This is the exact kind of moral ambiguity that I love reading about.While the time hops in Vicious either added to the narrative or were a net neutral for it, I thought at times the jumping back and forth detracted from the story in Vengeful. I did get confused on the time period for a lot of events in the first half, and it was hard to differentiate the from what I would assume were some intentional choices to hold back information by the author. Still, this is one of those books where you’re either gonna sit tight and enjoy the ride or not. And I was very much ready and willing to be led where ever Schwab wanted to take me. At the end, I think this is a solid follow-up! It’s hard, because Vicious was such a brilliant, self-contained story that it would always be difficult to match that level of craftsmanship. But it was compelling and well-written, plus I have been feeling stingy with my ratings lately, so sure—5 stars it is!*Thanks so much do Janelle at  @shereadswithcatsfor gifting me this book!

Tilla and her sister Mia are going to see their father again for the first time in over a year. He’s had a pattern of leaving them and their mother in Canada and returning to Jamaica whenever he feels the urge, often abruptly and without consideration for his family. Even so, Tilla is determined to make the best of the trip, despite her own conflicting feelings about her father, not just for the sake of her sister but for herself too.[image]Hurricane Summer is a lot like what I would imagine the island is, visceral and painful at times, but also beautiful. There’s a quiet resilience running through the characters, one that seems to be constantly stress tested by their environment. The stream of tension in the story is tied to not just the literal storm looming ahead, but the figurative one that you can tell will strike land at any moment. I think the hardest thing about reading this book was just seeing the way Tilla is treated again and again by the people around her. She puts up with a lot, and has often let her feelings go unsaid to her father and the rest of her extended family. They’re condescension is rooted in not just the resentment they have towards Tilla and her sister for being better off than them, but also in a rigid patriarchal structure that thrusts all blame on the women and girls, while letting the boys and men off the hook. It’s a familiar kind of cruelty for any girl reading this book, but that doesn’t make it any easier to witness. Another topic that Bromfield explores is the effect that colonialism and racism has had on the mostly Black population of Jamaica. Colorism in particular is still an obstacle that darker-skinned characters have to overcome, and skin tone can effectively dictate the way their lives turn out. That, on top of poverty and classism, doesn’t provide even the opportunity for some characters to even imagine an alternative life for themselves, which is so immensely heartbreaking.Especially as a debut, I was really impressed with Asha Bromfield’s storytelling here. The setting and scenes she writes are evocative and feel so vividly real, that you’re instantly transported to Jamaica while reading. I loved seeing Tilla learn about where she comes from while also learning about herself and using what she learns to finally find her voice. This novel was a pleasant surprise for me, and I’m excited to see what the author comes out with in the future!*Thanks to Wednesday Books & St. Martin’s Press for an advance copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Apr 16, 2021","May 03, 2021","Apr 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54860490-hurricane-summer

Also, I’m a little annoyed I read all 400+ pages of this and still got such a dumb ending.So here we go....the main characters all suck. Not in an ‘intentionally unlikable character’ kind of way, but in a ‘there’s no way these are supposed to be actual human people’ way. Claire and Jack are getting married. Claire is artsy and *not like other girls*, while Jack is a mysterious former playboy that’s, of course, totally loaded. They decide to get married on this remote Italian island where a lot of questionable deaths have occurred because, yeah, sure why not. And then throughout the book a slew of other questionable deaths take place and in response the two of them repeatedly balk at the idea of cancelling or even delaying this wedding.The number of murders that happen, guys, is just insane. Like every 12 hours someone dies. Most of them are ‘the help’ so Claire, Jack and the rest of the 1% just shrug their shoulders like ‘wow yeah that’s a total bummer.....who’s gonna do my hair now???...more",Notes are private!,1,135,1,"Mar 29, 2021",Apr 2021,"Mar 28, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49374479-her-dark-lies

And dark family secrets locked away for decades. The Lost Village by Camilla Sten had all the ingredients for making a truly unsettling work of horror fiction.Alice is revisiting the past, her grandmother’s past that is. When she was a young woman, her grandmother’s entire family and hometown vanished without a trace. Beds still made, dishes on the table, food in the cupboard—but not a soul to be found. Nobody was left, except for a single woman, found stoned to death in the village square and a crying infant in the local school. And Alice has named the return to this town The Lost Village, a documentary she’s decided to make with her fried Tone, benefactor Max and two additional crew members Emmy and Robert. But from the moment the five of them arrive in Silvertjärn, Sweden, they can sense that something there is deeply wrong.I did enjoy this book for the most part. The setting was utterly captivating and full of a distinctly Nordic sense of grim unease. The biggest issue for me here was pacing. The first third to half is pretty slow. There’s definitely a tension buzzing through at times, but very little actually happens. By comparison, the ending is a bum rush towards a somewhat predictable, but still plenty unnerving finale.The story is told through flashbacks from the modern day film crew back to just before the disappearances in 1959. These flashbacks mostly follow Alice’s great-grandmother Elsa, and I wish we got to see more from her. Admittedly, her point of view could only exist to a point—as anything to revealing could spoil the mystery of present day, but I think it left her portions a little starved and Alice’s occasionally verging into tedious. This narrative device had mixed results for me.When authors write horror, they usually have to decide pretty quickly whether or not there’s going to be supernatural elements in the story, and if so to what degree. It’s not uncommon for there to be a so-called ‘rational’ explanation while also leaving the door open for a supernatural influence, but in this case I think the author should have really gone all-in on the hauntings and things that go bump in the night. That way the ‘believability’ of the story wouldn’t have even be a factor in the plotting. Instead, as readers we’re left trying to connect some pretty widely-spaced dots that don’t match up cleanly. I’m not really expecting probability here, just a baseline level of plausibility. So yeah, don’t go into this expecting a realistic depiction of....well anything I guess. Especially those sensitive to any negative mental illness or neurodivergency portrayal may want to steer clear as well. Some victims in the book may fit into those categories and it’s going to be disturbing on some level to most people. It is horror, though, and I believe the author handles these topics with a good amount of consideration. In all, I enjoyed my time with it, and with a few modifications near the end it could have been excellent. But as is, I still think it’s a pretty good book!*Thanks Minotaur for my  copy!

Let me show you what lurks in the empty spaces where nightmares dare not tread.”Wow, this was one of the coolest, most unique concepts I’ve read in a fantasy book. One thing you can say about N.K. Jemisin is that her work is always distinct and utterly imaginative. Coming at this from her last series, The Broken Earth trilogy, there’s a huge departure from what she’s done in the past. But as a huge fan of hers, I was beyond excited to begin The City We Became.Before I  the book, though, I want to give the biggest shoutout to the audio version of this book. It is the absolute best-produced audiobook I have ever listened to. The effects and editing are incredible and transporting, so congrats to who ever was in charge of that. PLUS my favorite audio narrator Robin Miles (who also did The Fifth Season and it’s two sequels) is back for Jemisin’s latest and she killed it here! I would take Robin on her own over a full cast reading any day.But back to the book—this story is set in New York. This story is New York. It’s a sprawling fantasy that takes place on a couple of tiny islands that hold New York City and its twenty-three million inhabitants. Because the city is not just a collection of buildings and streets, it’s a living, breathing thing and must be cared for accordingly. The five boroughs, Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens & Staten Island, separate but also connected, make up the city as a whole. They are stronger together and greater than the sum of their parts. And when New York is under attack, when an invasive new force tries to take the city for its own, they’ll have to band together to keep their city as they know it. Without giving too much away but still giving a little more than the incredibly vague synopsis, there are five main characters, each one representing a borough of New York. They’re the distinct embodiment of that borough, and depict what makes each sector of the city unique. An unknown entity has arrived in the city and it becomes the battleground for an epic showdown between huge living cities and that which seeks to destroy them.I loved reading about each of these characters and seeing what connected them to their communities. They didn’t just represent neighborhoods and counties, but the wide range of person that New York attracts and retains. Some were born in the city, some found it later in their lives, but they all set down roots and are as much a part of its ecosystem as anyone else. There’s probably a number of New York-specific jokes and references that I missed, based on the fact that I’ve only visited the city once. But I’m sure New Yorkers will enjoy these aspects of the book even more as there’s nothing that New Yorkers love talking about more than New York.As always, Jemisin tackles major topics in this book like she has done in the past, but also in a little bit different way than she’s done previously. The major difference here is that this is not a ‘high fantasy’ novel, aka it’s a fantasy that’s set in our world and not a completely new and invented one. Her last two trilogies have been high fantasy, so any social and political issues she’s discussed in those books weren’t directly applicable to the ‘real world’, so to speak. The City We Became addresses topics like racism, gentrification and bigotry head-on in a way I think many people might not be comfortable with acknowledging. Some negative s that suggest these things were too ham-fisted may want to reflect on why they prefer stories that don’t engage with social justice issues so explicitly.My only big drawback with this book was that the ending felt kind of rushed. I was hoping for a bigger final battle than what we got and a little more explanation or resolution for the characters and how they eventually came together. This is the first installment in the Greater Cities series so hopefully down the road we’ll get to see more of this incredible universe that exists in parallel to our own.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Mar 18, 2021","Apr 16, 2021","Mar 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43521693-the-city-we-became

Thanks to Natalie for making me pick these books back up, sometimes *forcefully*, after finishing the first one last year.Will try to do a non-spoilery section up here, with the rest hidden under tags below. But it’s probably no surprise that there was lots of death and war, a good amount of magic and plenty of ~ a n g s t ~. Still, it seemed at times that certain things were added for shock value over making narrative sense or character development, but that’s been consistent through most of the books, if I’m being honest. So much of this series has felt like the characters were on a loop. Elias struggling with his feelings for Laia and just kind of in general. Helene trying to do a plan only for Keris to be 2 steps ahead. Laia making a plan and then blowing it up because she’s actually just a terrible person to put in charge of anything. It became frustrating to read them all fail in the same way over and over again, seemingly never learning from these mistakes. But now that it’s the final book it was such a relief to go into this knowing one way or another it would end differently. Well.....mostly.(view spoiler)[Laia ended up as the weakest character for me, which is such a far cry from the first book, An Ember in the Ashes, where she was the main focal point. I could not become invested in her to the point where when her brother died I was like meh. That who final battle had knock-off Marvel/Harry Potter vibes, and the prophecy itself felt under-explained. The only thing that made less sense was Elias and Mauth’s deal with being the Soul Catcher. The magic and lore needed a LOT more development in my opinion. There was no rhyme or reason to who had what powers and when and how they could and couldn’t be used; it was just whatever the author wanted to happen right then just magically ✨happened✨.Helene was again the standout character, though killing the last person she cared about was so predictably dramatic I actually kind of got annoyed. Let’s call it what is is—Darin and Harper were fridged. Aka killed to advance Laia & Helene’s arc and give them something traumatic to deal with. I was not a fan of those choices, especially killing them both back-to-back without much fanfare. The foreshadowing for these deaths was so obvious too that I almost didn’t believe Tahir could mean to do something that bluntly. But alas, here we are.And all that build-up to Keris having some fantastic backstory and then....not much in the way of explanations. There was, what, a page talking about her trauma? She was blood-thirsty, vicious and downright evil for four books and her origin story is that she thought her mom was weak??? I mean, it’s not as big of a letdown as Marcus’s story but still, I was expecting much more. (hide spoiler)]I know I’ve been a little negative in these s, but I did enjoy my time with these books! It’s probably one of the most readable fantasy series I’ve experienced and has a good amount of world-building (outside of the magic). It can be hard to blend pacing with fantasy in YA because so much needs to be explained when creating a new world from scratch, so props to the author for that! I think people who don’t want a whole lot of in-depth explanations in the fantasy books they read will appreciate this series more, so this may work well for a more casual fantasy reader. I would also definitely be interested in reading more from this author in the future!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Mar 11, 2021","Mar 19, 2021","Mar 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52013133-a-sky-beyond-the-storm

The mother, unnamed except for the moniker she eventually claims for herself, “Nightbitch”, is an artist with a young son and a mostly absent husband. While he travels during the week for work, the mother is left alone with both her son and her own racing thoughts. Like many new mothers, she feels isolated and unappreciated, veering into unfulfilled, and has nobody in her life to share these feelings with.Then she starts to grow a tail. Her body is sprouting hair in places it never has before, and her teeth feel longer, sharper. She’s experiencing new urges and can’t determine if they’re all in her head or not. Is she a mother, wife, woman—or is she Nightbitch? Are they mutually exclusive? And why are women still expected to transform and sacrifice their former selves in order to inhabit the role of somebody’s mom?This was such an interesting take on modern motherhood, the conflicting feelings and guilt and pressure put on women to be everything they were and an entirely different person all at the same time. Set against one woman’s either evolution or complete collapse made the stakes feel all the higher, and her character’s anonymity offers readers more of an opportunity to imprint themselves onto Nightbitch. No matter what side you fall on, that her persona is a cry for help or a literal manifestation, it’s hard to ignore the implications of what would have driven a new mother to that point in the first place.As for the ending, I’m not sure how I feel about it. Without any spoilers, there is a level of self-actualization for the mother, which I’m sure will be cathartic for anyone reading who relates to the character. But as someone who prefers messier endings, I have to say it was probably not the direction I would have taken the story. But I understand why Rachel Yoder made these choices and can appreciate her point of view here.I’m still really impressed this was a debut. This book has a lot to say and does so in one of the most insane ways possible. I really like that the message, whether or not you enjoy the delivery in this novel, is one that’s affirming to any mother feeling gaslit in a personal and/or societal sense. That, no, you’re not crazy, but all the bullshit you have to deal with daily definitely is. I’m going to be looking out for more from Yoder in the future.(And just a bit of a warning to everyone—this book has no chapters. There’s a handful of ‘parts’ and good amount of line breaks to act as stopping points, but for anyone who appreciates dialogue in quotations or easily consumable chapters, this book will not have that.)**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,1,251,1,Jul 2021,"Jul 14, 2021","Mar 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55835474-nightbitch

Holy crap, I’m at a complete loss for words right now. March has been so blahhh for me book-wise, but I’m so glad I get to say We Begin at the End is my first 5 star read this month!Duchess Radley is an outlaw. She’s a 13-year-old girl living in coastal California with her mother, Star, and younger brother, Robin, but she’s also a firey, take-no-prisoners badass who will do whatever it takes to protect herself and her family. Though she’s young, Duchess is headstrong and brave well beyond her years, which can sometimes get her into trouble. Luckily the local cop, Walk, is a family friend and tries his best to steer the Radley’s out of the precarious situations they seem to constantly be finding themselves in.Though eventually, there comes a point where even Walk can’t buffer the blow of what’s to come. Vincent King is getting released from prison. Thirty years after killing Star Radley’s younger sister, Sissy, as a teenager, King is returning to his hometown of Cape Haven. A childhood friend of both Walk and Star and a ever looming figure in Duchess’s family history, Vincent’s arrival coincides with a chain of events that nobody could see coming, completely unraveling what Duchess knew to be true—and what little stability she had.This book was just as heartbreaking for me as it was triumphant. I wasn’t familiar with Chris Whitaker before, but I was really impressed at how the story unfolded and then came back together. We Begin at the End is broken into three major parts and a fourth that serves as a kind of epilogue. The first part lays a lot of groundwork in establishing the characters and their relationships with one another, making it more literary. The second part comes on the heels of a pivotal scene, and much of that time is spent picking up the pieces that had been scattered. Once again, though, the transition from part two into part three is climactic and shocking, but from that point the book moves at a noticibly faster pace towards the end.All this to say, it’s not a thriller. At least not one typical to the genre. There’s several mysteries swirling around at once, and the foundation of the story is built on a death (Sissy Radley), but if you’re looking for jump-scare pacing, I’d recommend looking elsewhere. This book is also much more emotional than any traditional suspense/thriller novel. Characters undergo hugely transformative ordeals and traumas, with Whitaker slowly the peeling back the layers and exposing the pain at the center. This story has a beating heart, and if you approach it with care, by the end you’ll be able to hold it in your hands.There’s been a lot of praise for this book already, and I’m anticipating even more to come. If you haven’t read it yet, try to go in open to anything but expecting nothing, if you can. I think that’s the best way to receive the full impact of this book in all its glory. Personally, I’m looking forward to more from this author and interested in possibly diving into his back list, if anyone has any recommendations!*Thanks Jordy and Kristen for including me in your unnecessarily named book club and for recommending it to me!

Co-written with her older sister Lacey Lamar, You’ll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey  is a trip through the incredible world of racism while being Black in the workplace, Black on dating apps, Black while shopping at JCPenny....you get the idea. Most of these stories are fairly short. They’re the kind of thing you’d tell at a cocktail party that’s the perfect combination of ridiculous and insane so everyone’s attention will be entirely held throughout. Individually they’re a crazy anecdote, but taken together they start to paint a picture of some of the absurd micro-aggressions (or just full aggression-aggressions) that Black people living in America have to put up with while simply living their lives. It’s funny, but it’s also stark in the way it reminds white readers that, hey—we’re all contributing to this too.But I don’t want the serious systemic and social issues being referenced dissuade anyone from picking up this book. It’s really, really funny! Lacey and Amber have a brilliant rapport not just as sisters but as two naturally funny women. This isn’t the book that’s meant to teach about the history and arguments of anti-racism, but it still has the ability to put some of those ideas into context. Blending laugh-out-loud comedy and serious topics is a skill Amber has flexed over the years while working in television, and it’s great to see how that’s translated into print here.Speaking of print, I actually didn’t read a physical copy of this book, instead I listened to the audio version. It’s narrated by Ruffin and Lamar, and it is wonderful. I had a couple of friends who said they read it but wish they had listened to it, so I feel like their narration is definitely worth the listen. The only thing I feel like I missed out on was the pictures and images that were sometimes referenced, although Amber gave a valiant effort in describing them to us. If you can, I would either have a physical copy of the book along with the audiobook or make sure that your audio version comes with supplemental materials.

I’ll admit what started off as a slower read for me totally pulled the rug out from under my feet, and I ended up really enjoying the crazy trip that was This Is not the Jess Show.[image]Jess Flynn is a typical teenager living in 1998–she loves Alanis, likes hanging out with her friends and is nursing a crush on a boy in school. Her sister Sara has been sick for a while and their parents can be a little over protective, but Jess can handle all that! Her hometown of Swickley is safe, if not totally boring, and Jess spends her free time daydreaming about breaking out of her restrictive small town.But it doesn’t take long for things to start to feel a little off. Jess hears voices nobody else seems to. Her best friends are acting weird and even Jess’s dog Fuller is behaving strangely, and nobody is willing to cop to what’s going on. There appears to be a line in the sand that Jess will have to decide whether to cross or not: keep asking questions and ruffling feathers, or go along with the way things have always been.I’ll admit I was completely caught off guard by This Is Not the Jess Show. There I was, cruising through the first third of the book, which read like a typical YA contemporary (even if it took place a little over 20 years ago), and then BAM! The author hits you with an insane twist out of nowhere. After that point the book transforms into another story completely, a trippy adventure/thriller with an ending you won’t see coming. I was really impressed at all of the social commentary Anna Carey was able to fit into this story. I think there’s an expectation in YA that those books don’t or can’t deal with complex topics because they’re typically faster paced, but clearly that is not the case. I can’t really list every single issue that Carey covers because some could be considered spoilers, but they include criticisms of celebrity culture, human commodification, capitalism, privacy and where the line is drawn for childhood abuse and trauma. All of that and more in a fast-paced YA thriller that comes in at about 300 pages. The flip side of that, of course, is that if you wanted more of a deep dive into some of these topics, you might be a little disappointed. That said, there is already a sequel in the works and the author has promised to expand much more on the world outside of Swickley. I’m sorry to be so vague about the plot in this , but trust that you would not want this spoiled for you!*Thanks to Chelsea & Dennis with the Scared Suspense Book Club and Quirk Books for my copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Feb 20, 2021","Feb 23, 2021","Feb 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45801360-this-is-not-the-jess-show

From the mind of Sarah Gailey, author of the brilliant MagicNow a Goodreads Choice finalist in Science Fiction!What a weird and cool little book. From the mind of Sarah Gailey, author of the brilliant Magic for Liars, comes another stunningly original work where humanity and the fantastical overlap. Evelyn Caldwell has achieved everything she set out to do in her life. She’s heading a lab, working on groundbreaking experiments, being recognized for her achievements in her field and was even able to find someone to live happily married with.....for a time. Her former husband, Nathan, has moved on. His new wife Martine is everything that Evelyn is not; she’s pliable and submissive. She wants all the same things as Nathan, including having a baby. But Nathan didn’t meet Martine—he made her. She’s a clone of Evelyn, taken from her own research, and tweaked to fit her ex’s specifications. And up until this point Evelyn has had no reason to get to know this copy of herself, until Martine calls her, frantic, asking for help.This was a premise that has everything I’m looking for in a science-fiction thriller. Gailey masterfully blends typical human motivations like jealousy, revenge, longing and betrayal with an exciting scientific advancement that feels close enough to appreciate, but also just out of reach. There’s enough of a basis in reality where you don’t feel like you’re too far away from plausible. All of the characters have distinct personalities and feel like people you could (and maybe even do) know in real life, but with just a subtle sinister twist. So small that you don’t notice it fully until you’re already in deep.In addition to the stellar characterizations, there’s a lot of reckoning with complex ethical questions around cloning and genetic engineering in humans. What makes a person a person? Is it wrong to manipulate biological and psychological factors in order to get a desired outcome? And based on some of those themes in the novel, it’s not hard to see how those questions extend outside of a clinical setting. In the author Acknowledgements, Gailey discloses pieces of her experience with abuse, and the reader is left to sift through the implications of what Nathan, and to an extent Evelyn, have done to Martine through that lens. It’s a deeply uncomfortable thing to sit with in the absolute best way.I’m so glad my second Sarah Gailey book was such a success. The Echo Wife is easily one of the best things I’ve read so far this year!

I have no idea what would be considered “good” and “bad” structure, rhythm, verse—any of it. So this is probably not going to be the best  to read if you’re looking for that kind of analysis.Instead I can offer what a layman may think about this type of writing. I can recognize that something sounds nice but maybe not be able to articulate why. Also since this is a novel in verse as opposed to a collection of poetry, there’s a flowing narrative throughout that I think most people would be able to follow along with. So I’m going to be ing that story and how it’s related to the reader, not so much the prose itself. Hopefully some people still find that helpful.The first part of the novel follows Nima, a teenage girl living in the United States with her mother, an immigrant from an unnamed Arabic-speaking country. (The author describes the country’s flag as red, green, white & black, and there are likely other markers which would clarify the specific country, but I wasn’t able to pick up on any of them. Safia Elhillo’s parents emigrated from Sudan, but it seems to be an intentional choice not to name their nation of origin, so I didn’t make that assumption with regards to Nima.)Nima has a lot of the same insecurities of other teenagers, like loneliness and feeling like an outsider, but she’s also struggling in ways many of her peers can’t relate to. Both her and her childhood friend, Haitham, are living in a post-9/11 America. Nima is called a terrorist, mocked for her religion, bullied, shunned and harassed by her classmates and strangers alike. She finds herself daydreaming of an alter-ego version of herself, who Nima thinks of as Yasmeen, and disconnects from her life in the US by imagining what could have been if her mother hadn’t left her homeland.Then around halfway through the story it changes into something else entirely. Nima enters a kind of dream-like state where she gets to watch her parents when they were young, before she was born, alongside her mirror self Yasmeen. This was a turn I wasn’t expecting this book to take, but I ended up really liking it. The differing perspective for the main character in imagining ‘what could have been’ was a great way to put her own actual life in perspective. Obviously I can’t get too much into the details without giving things away, but it was a welcome subversion of my expectations for this book.I might have preferred a slightly different ending, but based on the rest of the story where Nima and her family and friends ended up made thematic sense. I wasn’t sure how I would take to a verse novel, but this one has inspired me to pick up more soon. Maybe Clap When You Land next? Not sure, but I’m also excited to read more from this author in the future!*Thanks to Random House Children’s Make Me A World & Netgalley for an advance copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,"Feb 11, 2021","Feb 12, 2021","Feb 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54416144-home-is-not-a-country

I don’t think I have had my feelings for a book so drastically shift like that in a while. I was a little apprehensive because of the size of Wanderers (approaching 800 pages), but once it got going I was entirely onboard! It wasn’t until later on that I began to lose interest and was just slogging through to the end.It started off so cool too! I was reading it with a couple of other people and we kept messaging each other every time something insane happened like, “oh my god has X done X yet?? Wtf!!!” But by the second half of the book that had fallen away. We were dragging ourselves (and each other) across the finish line. There were probably a few things that contributed to that, but while I was tearing through the first half I was genuinely expecting this to be a five star read for me.I haven’t really read many post-apocalyptic books, like The Stand or Station Eleven, and in some ways that worked to my advantage. Whatever the tropes are, they’re unfamiliar to me, so I can’t complain about this book resembling another too much. And since this was written pre-COVID-19 but post-Trump, a lot of the responses in the story from the media, government, American citizens, etc. ended up being pretty spot on. It was like watching a slow-motion replay of a car crash you were in—probably a little too accurate & uncomfortable.But the things that were misses by Wendig were big ones for me. The pastor character, in particular, was ridiculous. His arc served no purpose except to shock the reader. His descent was wholly unbelievable and he seemed like a vessel to ham-fist a religious perspective into a story that did not need it. Additionally the rockstar made even less sense as a character. He felt like a former ‘cool guy’ stand-in for Gen X dads that want to feel relevant again. So I guess I see why Chuck Wendig decided to include him.And maybe I should put this in spoiler tags, but I also want to warn potential readers: there’s a graphic sexual assault scene that did nothing to further the plot and was only used to reinforce the ‘badness’ of a character. Unnecessary does not even begin to cover it.Besides the characters, I had a problem with the pacing in the back half. Some major plot details are revealed around the middle and unfortunately the story loses most of its tension. This book was probably at least 200 pages too long, which is probably why the negative s keep calling it a Stephen King knockoff. Like I said, I can’t comment on that comparison, but I’ve read a couple of ridiculously long King books and at least during those my attention was held the entire time.Now I’m going to move on to usually my least favorite part to discuss in this type of book: the science-y stuff. Initially I was impressed with the research and explanations that Wendig put into describing pandemics and diseases. The biological science was so well elaborated on that it made his lazy depictions of various pseudo-tech bullshit even more egregious. Anything related to computers or AI or even vaguely on the technological side (I don’t want to go too deep into this because I don’t want to spoil anything) was just glossed over like a ‘science is ✨magic✨‘ solution that left me wholly unimpressed. I’m not a person that’s ever been great at science—it’s not usually my thing. So I feel like if I’m eye-rolling at these half-assed handwaving explainers then it’s gotta be pretty terrible.I also know some people have said they don’t like the ending. For me, I don’t usually care what the author decides for the ending but how it is executed. So, plainly, I think he ended it badly. What started off as an interesting commentary about humanity and climate change and what it means to be part of a society was just thrown out the window for a dumb Black Mirror-style sendoff. It felt like the author ‘JJ Abrams-ed’ the ending, meaning that he asked all these inquisitive, interesting questions in the beginning but had absolutely zero answers prepared by the end. If you’ve seen the show Lost (by Abrams) you’ll know what I’m talking about.I’ve heard this is going to have a sequel. I will not be reading it. If this is adapted I might watch it just because then they have an opportunity to rewrite the back half. And I hope if that happens that they do decide to make some major changes, because as is this books is such a waste of what has some great potential.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Feb 07, 2021","Feb 14, 2021","Feb 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34019083-wanderers

I’m hesitant to call any book set in such an oppressive society “fun”, but I can’t say this one left me breathless in the same way The Gilded Ones did. It’s been over two years since I’ve read the first book in the series, but it’s been a consistent crowd-pleaser even amongst friends of mine who don’t read a ton in this genre. And unfortunately, I think the scarcity of both figurative and literal human elements in the book held it back from reaching the level of its predecessor. Deka, by nature of what her character has become, felt very disconnected from her peers the majority of the time. She alone was able to converse with the gods, so all of the important exposition and big reveals happened while she was alone, usually telepathically. A pattern began to emerge for me—(view spoiler)[from the private god talk to the reviving Jatu to Deka being shocked every time someone lied to her (hide spoiler)]—and blunted the stakes somewhat. Without getting too deeply into the plot, there’s a pretty significant pivot in how we’re meant to perceive the gods, with Deka slowly peeling back the layers of myth from truth in the stories surrounding the Gilded Ones. Forna’s use of fantasy to confront gendered violence was so well executed in the first novel that it’s really interesting to see how she’s decided to tackle the topic in the second installment. (view spoiler)[What I became a little hesitant of within this feminist interpretation is how quickly the narrative seemed to flip to something resembling “both sides-ism”. Instead of focusing on the gender of the gods and humans, the power dynamics took on a class structure. The ruling class (the gods) are using humans both as a food source and a weapon, forcing confrontation between the two groups based on irrelevant qualities. (hide spoiler)]I found the rest of the commentary on gender and identity smartly done—gender roles are an invention, its stereotypes are arbitrary, anyone can be an oppressor, one group’s survival should not depend on another’s oppression, etc. Though we don’t end up going very deep with anyone besides Deka, I know even the inclusion of characters from so many marginalized communities will mean a good deal to readers who relate to them. I did find the pairing off of literally every single named character with one another to be an unnecessary exercise. So much of the character development in The Gilded Ones occurred through the friendships forged between the alaki, and from the constant forced couplings and the number of scenes where Deka is lost in her own head, there wasn’t much room for those kinds of relationships to flourish. Come to think of it, the only supporting character that had a solid, emotional presence was Britta. Keita could have been replaced by a broom half the time and you’d never know. I think there’s two kinds of second books in trilogies, either they’re climaxes (The Wicked King, The Kingdom of Copper, Thunderhead) or they’re connectors (Siege and Storm, Children of Virtue and Vengeance, The Obelisk Gate). One is not better than the other, but I feel like I’ve read more connectors than climaxes, and The Merciless Ones is likely going to end up under the ‘connector’ umbrella. But some of the best series, like Broken Earth, are able to make the most of that position in the trilogy and set up an incredible finale. I retain my high hopes for the last leg of Deka’s story but hope she and her friends are able to recapture some of the magic from the first book. Also, they audiobook was very well done for anyone interested.*Thanks to Delacorte Books for the complimentary copy and PRH Audio for the ALC!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,122,1,"Jun 11, 2022","Jul 09, 2022","Feb 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40126014-the-merciless-ones

It’s a nice continuation of the series and appears to set up the events of A ​Sky Beyond the Storm pretty well.I think the biggest strength of this series has been the constantly churning plot. There’s always a new development, a new wrench thrown into the best laid plans, that the characters will have to find a solution to. This is the point in the story though that I’m beginning to feel a little fatigued. Not every book or even chapter needs to be a sprint. What I was missing were the quiet moments after huge events and inevitable devastations. I wanted to feel the humanity at the center of these massive losses that seem to be a common occurrence in the world Sabaa Tahir has carved out for us. Instead of a sequence of gut punches, I had more of a ‘doom-scrolling’ type feeling, where whatever happened was the latest sad thing in a pattern of sad things. It’s just been difficult to connect to the story.I will say, though, I’ve enjoyed that the three main characters are pretty much doing their own thing this time. They’re all a lot stronger characters as individuals as opposed to their previous codependency. Helene in particular has really found her own path, even though it’s come at an enormous cost. Actually now that I think about it, her campaign against any and all enemies of the Empire have almost entirely failed, which is painful to watch but still better than how she’d been uselessly pining over Elias in the past. And with the ending (view spoiler)[Marcus’s death (hide spoiler)], there’s so much potential with her character that I’m genuinely excited to see where she ends up.Along with that spoiler, I’ll just say quickly that I’m also happy to see a villain upgrade in the next book. The Commandant has even more motivation and backstory than we originally knew about, the evil-to-the-point-of-ridiculousness character has finally been removed from the picture AND there is a new Big Bad who has just become even more powerful. This has the potential to be epic, as long as we’re not too distracted by any side quests.Elias’s storyline in Reaper was interesting but probably where I zoned out the most, just because I wasn’t always following all of the mysticism-ghostie stuff. He’s obviously going to play a huge role in the finale, so I’ll try to pay super close attention whenever they are explaining his role and powers.....or whatever. He’s also so much better when he’s not caught up in that dumb YA love triangle, in my opinion.[image]On the other hand, Laia was the least interesting to me this time. She has been the main protagonist since the beginning but has moved somewhat to the background here. She had some of the biggest character revelations of the series, but still seems to be the only one not evolving with the story. Her powers are so ill-defined that it was almost like Tahir realized the invisibility was too strong of an ability so she added a bunch of ‘conditions’ to it after the fact.

They’re both highly-educated, have lucrative jobs and celebrating Barack Obama’s historic 2008 victory when a secret Ruth has been keeping for years comes crashing through the perfect life they’ve built together. In all their talk of having kids, Ruth has only now disclosed that she’d previously given birth at 17, before the child was put up for adoption. Now armed with questions of her own, Ruth heads back to her hometown of Ganton, Indiana to find her lost son and try to understand how she could have let him go in the first place.Ganton represents a lot of American towns in decline over the past few decades. As manufacturing and traditional blue-collar jobs have dried up, so has the soul of the town itself. Right when the Great Recession was hitting Americans the hardest, Barack Obama was elected, creating a lot of opportunity but also generating an excessive amount of pushback. The white residents of Ganton resented him taking office for a multitude of reasons, but the feeling that something was being ‘taken’ from them and given to someone like Obama seemed to be at the root of a lot of them.The son of one of these aggrieved, unemployed white men, Midnight (real name Patrick), forms a bond with Ruth after meeting her through their respective grandmothers. Midnight is struggling and Ruth can see it, and in him she sees refractions of the son she left behind. The relationship between Ruth and Midnight is the kind of tentative friendship that I think a lot of people will find comforting—where two people who have had vastly different experiences are able to see parts of themselves in one another.I was fascinated with how Ruth’s family justified keeping the details of her son’s adoption from her for all these years. Mama, the grandmother who raised her, genuinely believed that she was doing what was best both for her granddaughter and her great-grandson. Even Eli, Ruth’s brother, was keeping many of these secrets from his sister. While I don’t think Ruth made perhaps the smartest or most well thought-out decision in every situation, I really couldn’t blame her for any of the choices she made based on the circumstances she found herself in. The adults around her at the time are the ones that I put most of the blame on when things turned out poorly. They not only made the decisions for her, but lied to her out of “love” everyday after.What kept this from being a five star read for me was that it just didn’t feel like much...happened. The themes and characters are all there, I just needed more plot. I don’t want to say I was bored while reading the entire time, but I had trouble picking The Kindest Lie back up after putting it down. Other than that, it was an interesting exploration of the idea of the American dream, chosen families, race in America and how lies snake their way through all of them, distorting our perception of the truth.

I’m not usually one to shy away from heavy topics or books, and there’s not really anything in terms of content that would keep me from reading something. But Shuggie Bain was just a little too much for me, and I had a difficult time getting through it. Based on author Doulas Stuart’s own life growing up in working-class Glasgow in the 80s, we follow Shuggie, a young boy who lives with an alcoholic mother that can’t ever seem to make it work.Clearly this was going to be really depressing. The cruel mundanity of poverty is on full display, not a huge surprise as they are living the Thatcher-era, but it still is painful to observe. One of the toughest aspects to stomach is the just constant stream of sexual assault and domestic violence throughout the book. It’s so numerous and widely done across the board for so many characters that I came to expect it at some point in every chapter. What’s so bleak about this story is how there never seems to be any moments of reprieve. They never find joy or peace, they just keep trudging through their misery, which can make this a bit of a miserable experience to read. I’ve read other novels that were similarly harsh, like Betty or The Nickel Boys, but there were lighter parts mixed in with the devestation. And there seemed to be a point to the suffering within the story. To me, Shuggie Bain felt like suffering for suffering’s sake.The book is well-written and utterly transporting—I just happen to not enjoy the setting we’re transported to. Especially as a debut, I’m sure this was cathartic and healing for Stuart to write, but I don’t think I’d recommend this to the average reader. Not unless they’re really looking for something to grind themselves down with. *Thanks to Netgalley & Grove Press for a  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,Mar 2021,"Mar 17, 2021","Jan 31, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52741293-shuggie-bain

After the success of their debut DeThis was my first read by author and sister duo Maika Moulite & Maritza Moulite, and I’m sure it won’t be my last! After the success of their debut Dear Haiti, Love Alaine, I was excited to see what their sophomore novel would include.Written through the roving perspectives of four young women: Kezi, Happi, Shaqueria and Evelyn, we are told about America through the eyes of those who are most dismissed by it. The story picks up following the untimely death of Kezi Smith, who died suddenly after being arrested at a social justice rally. We are given flashbacks to Kezi’s days before that arrest as well as her sister Happi’s struggle to come to terms with it in present day. Happi and their sister Genny take off on a trip across the US using the Motorist Green Book as their guide—the exact trip Kezi was planning to take when she was alive. I read this one as well as listened to it, so I also want to take a moment to shout out the narrators: Bahni Turpin, Jordan Cobb and Carolyn Smith. They did an excellent job capturing the voices of these complex and distinct characters and brought so much of the story to life. I can’t recommend the audiobook enough, which is currently available on Hoopla for free with no wait time!I try to write my s sans spoilers, but I don’t think I can do this full one without including some this time. If you haven’t read the book skip what is under the tags here because it will ruin a major twist near the end. The short of it is that I did NOT like this twist.(view spoiler)[I did not like what was done with Shaqueria and Kezi’s characters. I just don’t understand how you write an entire novel about how society ignores the death of Black women who are not ‘perfect’ victims only to then make the decision to kill off one of the “bad ones” in order to save one of the “good ones”. Shaqueria is poor, she has no support system, she’s caught selling drugs, but she’s also about to land a huge part in a television show. What does this say to the Shaqueria’s of the world? Oh you may die and nobody will notice, but don’t worry this random girl with a YouTube show who you died instead of will be sure to talk about you a lot!!And the logistics of Kezi’s survival over Shaqueria was so unrealistic and convoluted, I can’t even understand it from a practical perspective. Some ex-cop smuggled her out of a police station after setting a fire and NOBODY noticed?? She’s been secretly alive the whole time, kept alive and also unhurt for no discernible reason, because this racist white guy had racist ancestors who killed your ancestors and he’s tracked you down to do.....what exactly??? Kezi being not dead and held hostage by this crazy person is more of a cheap thriller twist than I was expecting from these authors. I really don’t wanna say that it cheapened the rest of what was a really beautiful examination of grief and systemic injustice, but I can’t help but feel that way. (hide spoiler)]I was disappointed with the last third of this book. But I’m not going to mark it down too much because of that since I still really enjoyed their writing and the rest of the story. I just wish that the authors decided to go in another direction with this one, though based off of the other s I’m clearly in the minority. I’d still like to read more from them going forward, but maybe I’ll just stick to ones that don’t feature “mysterious deaths”.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Feb 08, 2021","Feb 16, 2021","Jan 16, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46189861-one-of-the-good-ones

Many ofIf there’s anything that’s obvious from the range of s she’s garnered on this site, it’s that Megan Abbott’s books are not for everyone. Many of her characters are ‘unlikeable’ women, and the plot feels like it’s moving slowly until it suddenly isn’t. The Turnout is no exception.[image]Marie and Dara are sisters in the only way that they know how to be. They hold each others’ secrets close even when keeping one another at arm’s-length. From their childhood growing up under the exacting eye of their mother to eventually taking over her place as the owners and instructors at Durant School of Dance, they have always moved through the world together. Even after Dara married their mother’s former student, Charlie, and Marie moved out of their childhood home into the space above their studio, there’s nothing that can sever the connection between the two women.Until they unwittingly let someone in. Eventually cracks begin to appear in the foundation of their relationship, or maybe they’ve only begun to notice what’s always been there. As the entire company moves forward with preparations for their annual Nutcracker performances, tensions run high and some are bound to buckle under the pressure of it all. One thing you can always count on from Megan Abbott is complicated relationships between women. And shifting power dynamics prevent you from ever feeling like you have a handle on the characters’ true motivations. Is Dara the one in control? Or is Marie secretly the one pulling the strings? How much influence do they really have over one another? Dara certainly seems like she has more of a handle on her life than Marie does. But a cutting remark here, a cruel jab there, is it any wonder by the time she’s reached adulthood Marie’s in possession of such a battered and bruised ego?Truthfully, this was a pretty stressful reading experience. The book only gets more and more ominous as time goes on, to the point where even in the last dozen or so pages Abbott was still peeling back the layers of pain in her characters. There’s a grittiness to her storytelling that makes every smell, sound and taste that much more visceral to experience as a reader. And like some of her previous books such as Dare Me and You Will Know Me, The Turnout explores adolescent athletes that have complex relationships with the adults around them. These years are some of the most formative in their lives, and there are adults who will attempt to take advantage of that vulnerability. (this is your trigger warning for potential abuse)That said, I can’t say I didn’t get completely sucked in by this book. I’m still mulling over some questions I had while reading. Do Dara and Marie have shared memories or is it repressed trauma? How much of our history are we forced to carry around for the rest of our lives? When I finish a book by Abbott, I know it’s going to linger on me for some time after.[image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Jun 02, 2021","Jun 25, 2021","Jan 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55573785-the-turnout

My profile description is only a sentence long, but by god, if I don’t live by it.[image]A number of Indian readers both on Goodreads and Bookstagram had cautioned me on making any assumptions about India based on this novel. I understand that concern; when there isn’t a ton of representation in the American and Euro-centric media, every depiction feels like it has that much more weight to it. A one-off characterization can become a recurring stereotype that far outlasts the original work and outshines more realistic examples. So anyone going into this book like I was, with relatively minimal exposure to characters and stories set in India, I’d suggest keeping this in mind. But if I can read a book by an American or a British author and not expect that book to inform my entire impression of that country, I should be expected to do the same for stories set in other places.The White Tiger follows Balram Halwai, a man from a small village, as he becomes a driver to a wealthy family in Delhi. Framed as a letter written to the Chinese Premier, Balram recounts the story of his life from childhood to the position he finds himself in today. Through his interactions with his master, Mr. Ashok, his wife and the rest of their household, Adiga paints a grim picture of life for the lower and serving classes in this part of India. “Do we loathe our masters behind a facade of love - or do we love them behind a facade of loathing?”Balram is not a traditional protagonist, or at least he isn’t by the end. I don’t want to get into too many spoilers, but this is a book in part about the ‘Darkness’ of society corrupting a man who is trying survive a deck stacked against him. He acts ruthlessly in his own interests after watching seemingly everyone around him do the same for years. For a man who feels discriminated against, he carries some very sexist, racist, homophobic & generally prejudiced attitudes. You could make the argument Balram is more of an anti-hero, but I think whether or not someone roots for him depends on the perspective of the individual reader. He’s not supposed to be a ‘good’ person, or even a typical one. But I don’t think that negates the position that Adiga is trying to relate to the reader through this character.Like I mentioned before, I haven’t read many books set in India, but I did recently read Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents by Isabel Wilkerson in which the Indian caste system is part of a larger commentary on the subject. In it Wilkerson relates the caste systems in the United States and India so that it’s easy to recognize the existing parallels, while still acknowledging the differences that keep both systems and countries distinct from one another. While reading I tried to approach the topic of class (and caste) in this book in the same way. There’s a lot of issues that Balram talks about which you could find in other countries, including the US, but there are also things that are unique to India. And as a resident of a country (the US) which has a long history of citizens being critical of American government and society, I don’t think it’s inherently unpatriotic to do so. Books like Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison (cited as an influence by the author) or The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald are American classics that skewer American culture.Personally, I love this kind of dark humor and harsh societal critique found in The White Tiger. I’ve read some older Goodreads s as well as a few by media outlets from when the book was published in 2008 and won the Booker Prize, and I was genuinely surprised at how many people were upset that Adiga didn’t represent ‘the good side of India too’. I just don’t think that’s a novelist’s job. To me, their job is to tell a compelling story with a strong point of view and impactful characters, which I think the author nails here. I obviously can’t speak to authenticity in location, people and politics, but the feelings and frustration that Balram experiences felt very real to me.I don’t know, I feel like it had more than enough merit to win the Booker, though obviously there are people who disagree. I didn’t think I’d read many previous Booker Prize winners, but I’ve actually read three: The Testaments (Margaret Atwood), Girl, Woman, Other (Bernardine Evaristo) and Wolf Hall (Hilary Mantel), of which I had mixed responses to. For me this book sits comfortably in their company.I’m also glad I read it before the movie came out. I’m excited to see how the adaptation is reimagined taking place in modern day instead of 2008. And the involvement of Priyanka Chopra suggests to me that Pinky is going to have a larger role in the film. This book will probably have a resurgence in popularity over the next couple of months, and I’m looking forward to the discussions that both the book and movie generates.[image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,-2,37,1,"Dec 31, 2020","Jan 05, 2021","Dec 31, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1768603.The_White_Tiger

A fulfilling job, a doting fiancé with a baby on the way and finally: a stable home and community for her young family to grow into, something she was deprived of in her own childhood. After a terrifying run-in while living in Minneapolis, Joan and her current partner, Deck, decide to move back to his hometown Lilydale. It’s promised to be a perfectly safe town, a place where nothing bad happens—until it does. Not long after moving in Joan begins to notice things seem a little....off in Lilydale. There’s a strange hierarchy among the residents she just can’t figure out, and she increasingly feels like she’s living inside of the world’s most claustrophobic fishbowl. As she tries to make an impression in her new job at the local newspaper, Joan begins looking into the disappearance of a young boy who vanished decades prior without a trace. Pulling at this thread starts to unravel generations of secrets and mysteries that have been hidden away. And now that Joan is in Lilydale, pregnant with Deck’s child, will she be able to untangle herself before it’s too late?I was excited to continue my search for the Great 2021 Thriller with Bloodline, which I received as a participant in January’s Mystery Book Club and Scared Suspense Book Club cross-over this month! And it isn’t just my first book by Jess Lourey, author of Unspeakable Things, which was a huge bestseller last year, but I’m also pretty sure this is the first one I’ve read from Amazon’s in-house publisher Thomas & Mercer. Despite how I feel about Amazon as a company, I appreciate that it can be a tool for authors to make their work more accessible to a wider audience, outside of the traditional ‘Big Five’ publishing houses.I really liked this book, though I don’t think it will top any of my lists this year. The writing is easy to get sucked into, and I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of people were able to finish it in one sitting. Lourey has worked so many twists into such a quick read that even if you guess a few of them, it would be difficult not to still be surprised. I’ll also say that this book had me yelling quite a bit, not unlike the way you’d yell at a character in a horror movie keeps GOING BACK INTO THE HOUSE DON’T DO THAT OMG YOU WILL BE MURDERED YOU *IDIOT*!!!!!! There’s a lot of psychological warfare, where you’re not sure who Joan can trust. Her decisions, while understandable, can be frustrating, but a lot of that is due to the constraints of being a woman in the time period she’s living through. Outside of the general sexism you may come to expect during the Mad Men era, there were numerous restrictions and legal hurdles in place to keep women from obtaining independence. They couldn’t open their own bank accounts or credit cards, they couldn’t make reproductive decisions without their husband’s permission, they were flat-out barred from pursuing educational and career opportunities, so the ‘wHy DiDn’T sHe JuSt LeAvE’ criticisms seem pretty inane to me.But if you’re in the market for a taught and twisting thriller, especially one that can pull you out of a reading slump, I’d still definitely recommend Bloodline.

Ones like Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, which was a great comprehensive introduction to the history of racism in America, and Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, which walked the reader through the disastrous criminal justice system our country has reckoned with over the past half a century, would be others I highly recommend to anyone looking to educate themselves on just a few of the issues surrounding race and racism in America.Caste is a work of nonfiction comparing the caste systems of three different countries both historically and in a modern setting. Isabel Wilkerson makes the strong case that not only is there a well-documented caste system in India and a famously brutal one in Nazi Germany, but that the United States has had castes since its founding, but classified under different terminology. American slavery, oppression and abuse of its Black population is a form of caste, depriving basic humanity for generations and granting privilege and power over them to its white citizens. Wilkerson goes on to point out that not only was this a clear type of caste in the country’s past, but that underlying caste structure that enabled these former atrocities is still in place, to the detriment of the entire country today.“It has become a part of who they are, because it is part of what they have been.”What’s incredibly clear after reading this book is that even if you are hesitant to assign these terms to the US (although I think they’re very accurate), that there’s still so much work left to do in this country. The problems in America are not completely novel ones, but the way they have come about and then retained their grasp over the entire population is unique. And the denial of any lingering issues by the dominate caste (those who identify as white), is particularly sinister in its implications for anyone classified in the lower caste. Simply put, white Americans’ refusal to acknowledge Black oppression both past and present only compounds upon that oppression.As a white American, reading comparisons to the Indian caste system and the Nazi Germany one was not something I instinctually wanted to consider. That feeling of American exceptionalism is difficult to break out of, and to be seen as similar to countries that Americans largely view themselves as superior to will be a tough sell to a sizable part of the population. That shouldn’t stop Wilkerson or any other authors from writing about them, though, if there is a strong argument to be made. Not long into the book I found myself convinced by the initial assertion, so it was easier to absorb the additional supporting information offered.”If people were given the choice between democracy and whiteness, how many would choose whiteness?”The writing was also incredibly well-reasoned and explained, and I wasn’t expected to be an expert on things like foreign caste systems I knew very little about. I appreciated the way the research and history the author presented was interwoven with the modern day implications of the respective policies and events discussed at length. And even how they showed up in Wilkerson’s own experiences while researching and writing this book. I think the individual stories backed up by the wider historical context made the human impact of a harsh and unforgiving caste system easier to understand and digest for the average reader.Now that I’ve finished this, I’m also planning to pick up The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander and How We Get Free: Black Feminism and the Combahee River Collective, which includes the Combahee River Collective statement along with essays and interviews by members of the organization, edited by Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor. Based on the day I’m posting this  (December 31, 2020 for anyone reading this in the future), these will have to be 2021 reads for me. I do urge those who maybe got caught in the flurry of buying anti-racist books over the summer this year to consider either reading ones they haven’t gotten to yet, or if you have done that then to keep updating your TBR with backlist and upcoming titles on this topic.

But now that I’ve read it, I really can’t find any fault with that assessment of Reverie. And I’m not sure that I could think up a better comparison myself!How do I even begin to explain what happens in this book? In the very beginning I had no idea what was happening, which makes sense because the main character, Kane Montgomery, has amnesia after being part of a strange accident involving a fire and a (possible) death. Knowing Kane doesn’t remember anything doesn’t make this portion any less frustrating, but it’s something you just have to work through in order for things to make sense later. Eventually through a combination of sleuthing and eerie recollections, Kane is able to piece together parts of his fractured memory. He knows three of his classmates, Ursula, Adeline and Elliot are involved, but he’s just not sure how. But as time goes on the world Kane thinks he knows begins to unravel, and he has to accept the help of others that he may not be able to fully trust.Reverie is a fun YA fantasy romp that’s quick-moving and utterly imaginative. I give major props to Ryan La Sala for coming up with this twisting, nightmarish dreamscape. Some aspects, like the triumph that is Posey and her enchanted teacup, are so vivid I felt like she was standing in the room with me while I read. Other parts, specifically some of the magic, felt a little under-developed. I think this book could have been longer in order to fully flesh-out the world-building around the reveries. I have to say though I followed the events of the story pretty well, there were some gaps in the magic system that felt glossed over by La Sala. There’s a reason that so many immense fantasies end up being either massive tomes or part of a series, and that’s because so much additional explanation needs to be established to the reader in order for them to be fully immersed. It’s a lot of upfront work that if done well has an amazing payoff. I feel like especially as a debut, this was a great start towards that. As for the negative s, I can understand some of the complaints. I listened to the audiobook, and I found it fully engaging and not confusing at all. So maybe the people who couldn’t get into the book would enjoy that more? The narrator was great, he really captured the cadence of Kane and brought out some of the dry humor I’ve come to appreciate from La Sala’s books. This obviously isn’t going to be a universal crowd-pleaser, but I think there’s enough ingenuity and pure creativity present to where I’d definitely be interested in revisiting this world should the author ever decide to write a sequel!I’m only reading this now, about a year after publication, because I just finished Be Dazzled by this author. Some of the same themes are present in both: a struggle with acceptance and belonging, an excess of embellishment & flair, an abundance of gayness—but the story itself is a departure for La Sala. Even if you weren’t a huge fan of or haven’t read Reverie, I’d give Be Dazzled a shot if a queer YA romance set in the world of competitive cosplay sounds like something you’d be interested in!

It’s just not ever been something I had a stellar understanding of, even if I do like it and enjoy reading it. So I’ll be largely skipping that portion of the , and I would suggest reading some other s on the book’s page if you want more insight on that.Clap When You Land tells the story of two teenage girls, Camino and Yahaira, after a deadly plane crash kills someone close to each of them. Camino lives in the Dominican Republic with her aunt, and has been anxiously awaiting the return of her father, who only visits her for a couple of months out of the year. Yahaira has grown up in New York City with her parents, though she’s recently discovered something about her dad that changes the way she views him. As each of the girls struggle to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives, they’re brought together in their grief in a way that neither could have seen coming. I have a physical copy of the book from my lovely friend Carrie (@bostonbookfanatic), but I also listened to the audio while reading and loved that as well. Elizabeth Acevedo narrates the perspective of one of the girls and Melania-Luisa Marte does the other, which added an extra layer to their distinct voices. I can’t recommend it enough, especially if you have a harder time reading poetry, because then you get to hear the syntax read with the rhythm the author intended. This book was an emotional journey, not just for the characters but for the reader as well. The way Acevedo confronts identity and privilege, family and community, loss and forgiveness—is masterful. I love her ability to recount something so tragic so beautifully. Racing towards the ending, I could not figure out how she’d wrap up the story, but I needn’t be worried. The entire work is just as stunning and moving as I had been promised by everyone who recommended it to me.

I’ve been known to completely skip over the genre all-together, so I’m not totally sure why I was so hyped to read Be Dazzled by Ryan La Sala. It might be because this book is YA contemporary, and if I’m going to do a romance, it’ll probably be that sub-genre. It also might be that I’m already a fan of Ryan (despite this being the only book of his I read whoops) after watching a couple of interviews he’s given & videos he’s posted. I went into this hopeful that some of the energy he brings to social media would carry over into his work.And I’m happy to say it did! Be Dazzled exists in the exciting world of competitive cosplay, set during the convention known as Controverse. Raphael ‘Raffy’ Odom is the son of a famous artist, Evie Odom, and has to deal with her exacting creative expectations, as well as the pressure he puts on himself. The story begins right before this final competition, but is interwoven with flashbacks where Raffy first meets his future boyfriend-turned-rival, Luca. Having the sweet and heartwarming moments the two of them shared broken up by their current estranged relationship is as saddening as it is captivating. I was speeding through this book trying to find out what could have happened to blow up what seemed to be a promising love story between Raffy and Luca.Raffy is such a strong and compelling main character. He’s funny and easy to root for, and in a story about a high-stakes cosplay competition, that’s an important attribute! I loved how La Sala walked us through his designing and planning process for each different project Raffy was working on. It really helped the reader be able to visualize not just the end product, but how each component went into creating the entire look. Raffy’s social media presence and live-streaming was also a realistic course for this type of character and setting. Another thing I liked in this book was that there never ended up being a ‘true villain’. Yes there are characters who make mistakes or act poorly, but there is not really a ‘bad guy’ at the end. Everyone is just responding to the hand they’re dealt, and sometimes natural conflicts arise as a result. (And for any romance readers wondering, yes, there is a HEA.)This was such a fun read, especially considering it’s not the usual thing I gravitate to. You don’t have to be an expert on cosplay or Comic-Con or art & design at all to appreciate the accomplishments of these characters and get invested in what they’re doing. I could totally see this being a Netflix movie or something, the perfect feel-good rom-com for younger millennials and zoomers.

I don’t care about the British monarchy. I don’t care about the clergy. I don’t care much about these mostly terrible people being terrible to each other. I did try to care about them, and I know it’s probably my mistake for thinking that historical fiction about a time, place and people that I don’t care for would some how magically hold my attention, but I wanted to at least say I read it. And now I have. Strangely, I really liked The Crown on Netflix, but if that show was stripped of it’s incredible cast, set, costumes and production value, would I still like it?? That’s kind of what reading this felt like. A beautiful show about aristocracy but stripped of all of its flair, style and personality.

From the author of The Hazel Wood and The Night Country comes the elusive treasury of stories which inspired the events in the series. These are not your mother’s fairy tales, and certainly not things you want to read before bed at night. Melissa Albert has delivered the dark feminist stories from your wildest dreams and most menacing nightmares.Fans of The Hazel Wood series have long asked for Tales From the Hinterland, the book that Althea Proserpine had written before her daughter Ella and granddaughter Alice fled from her. The consequences of writing such a book were heavy, so Althea shut herself away as copies of the book disappeared from the public over the years. Readers have received snippets and summaries of these stories, a couple of extended passages as they applied to the plot at hand, but most of the contents have felt just out of reach—until now.For that reason you may find some of these stories more familiar than others, especially if you’ve recently read the other two books. I haven’t read either in about a year, so there wasn’t any part that felt redundant for me. A few of the names and general tone I recognized, but I didn’t feel like I knew what was going to happen next based off of that. If I could start to guess how a story would end, it was probably because they all had similar themes. There’s usually a young girl or woman, she makes a choice and it has grim consequences. There are very few happy endings in Tales From the Hinterland, and even the ones that do usually have a sinister twist to them.You don’t have to have read either of the previous novels in order to enjoy this one. Some people might enjoy those books more by reading this first, if they’re readers who hate to have information withheld. I’d recommend at least reading the Hazel Wood before this, though, so that you don’t lose any of the suspense in that one. Still, if you are just looking for some dark and a little bit murderous stories in a bite-sized package, then I would recommend Tales From the Hinterland*Thanks to Flatiron Books & Netgalley for an advance copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,"Dec 28, 2020","Jan 09, 2021","Dec 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53138251-tales-from-the-hinterland

David Sedaris is a once in a generation talent and this collection of stories is no exception to that rule. Some of his die-hard fans might find this redundant, but as I’ve only ever read Calypso (and loved it), a greatest hits album is exactly what I want from this author!I won’t get too much into the specifics of the stories themselves, but it’s a good mix of work from him. Having only read Calypso, the majority of what I’ve seen has been stories about his life, particularly as it relates to his family. So I was pleasantly surprised at the number of works of fiction that Sedaris has authored as well! Glen’s Homophobia Newsletter was utterly fantastic. And the fact that it was written in 1994 but somehow completely holds up speaks to the lasting-power of his writing skills.Also present is Sedaris’ trademark dry humor interwoven with some darker subjects. From pieces about his mother and father to the death of his sister Tiffany and some really unexpectedly bleak stories staring talking animals, you never know quite what to expect when turning the page. Though, if you get the opportunity, I’d recommend listening to the audiobook—you simply cannot beat the experience of hearing this author recite his own work. David Sedaris does a lot of workshopping his stories, at readings, signings, etc., so his performance is almost reminiscent of a stand-up comedy act behind a podium.This book is the balm to a really raw and red year, but in the most atypical way. Like when Sedaris blandly hopes for the deaths of multiple children in his stories (largely fictional, calm down). It’s not the idea but the delivery that is so inherently funny. While listening to this you’ll just find yourself breaking down in obnoxious laughter at the most bizarre things, but unable to retell the joke without someone thinking you’re insane. I really can’t explain it any other way, but he succeeds so well at taking niche bits of darker humor and transforming them for consumption by a general audience, without losing any of the bite.At the very end of the audiobook there was a great interview that Sedaris does with Paul Constant where he talks about his writing process, what it’s like for him to work during quarantine, etc. I think hearing his back and forth with an actual person was an great way to end what amounts to a 12-hour monologue by the author. It reminded me that he’s not just a character in his stories, but an actual person who largely writes from his own life experiences. He also uses that time to talk about the impact of his writing career on his family, how they handle the inevitable characterization that comes from being the subjects of a famous sibling’s famous stories. All in all, great collection, FAN-TAS-TIC author. This would make an amazing Christmas gift for any Sedaris fans you know!

Now a Goodreads Choice winner in Memoir/Autobiography!I’ve done a lot of complaining while reading A Promised Land, mostly because of the length. Despite having written two previous books, Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope, the third by our former president is already very long, sitting at a rotund 751 pages. So I was genuinely surprised when I found out this was only volume one of his presidential memoirs, covering primarily his first four year term in office. I went into this thinking, how can someone possibly write that many pages about such a compact period of time. I’m 27, and if I wrote the amount Obama did for each year of my life I would have an over 5000-page memoir.I guess part of my expectations there stem from the fact that I don’t read political biographies & autobiographies for the most part. I think they are very boring and since most popular ones are accounts from the Civil War or World War II or other endlessly discussed periods of American history, I (probably wrongly, but whatever) feel like there really isn’t much of a new or fresh take that I absolutely *need* to read up on.The other reason is because I read Michelle Obama’s Becoming last year and it was one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Michelle comes off as genuine and brilliant and warm and hilarious, and I loved her perspective on her and her family’s time in the White House. She was also able to cover her entire life, from early childhood until current day, in a cool 426 pages, while her husband is likely to need at least 5 times that number. Barack mentions in the prologue that Michelle didn’t read his book before he finished, which might be why nobody made any significant cuts. [image]The hero we need, but don’t deserve.But if I had read a few more presidential autobiographies I may have found A Promised Land resembles those more than Michelle’s book for a very simple reason. This isn’t a book just about Barack Obama’s thoughts or feelings during his time as president, but is intended as a documentation of his official position as President of the United States. It’s now an account of American history, a record of his decisions and time in office. Though it is written by the man himself and likely holds a lot of personal significance, its importance stretches beyond him individually as a citizen and instead is now a component of a larger institution.So from that angle, I believe this book is enormously successful. I was a teenager when Obama took office in 2009 and though I do remember many of the events he described, I just wasn’t aware of a lot of the broader tones and the implications of what these things meant. The level of obstruction from House and Senate Republicans in particular went completely over my head, as I’m sure it did for a lot of the country, which is definitely intentional on their part. The ruthlessness of Mitch McConnell is nothing new over the past few years, and his crusades during this period are a major contributor towards many of the issues our country is facing today. So many things, by and large universally good things, did not happen during the Obama years simply because McConnell threw himself in front of progress out of a compulsive need to prevent giving the first Black President of the United States even the mere perception of a ‘win’.Similarly, it makes me empathize with Obama’s struggle to reconcile his ambitious, but still reasonable policy objectives with the realities of the political system he has to work within. I know personally I have fallen back on frustration with the Democratic establishment and how reluctant they seemed to be to ‘push harder’ during the first term, especially the first two years, of his presidency. I think people further left on the spectrum have a right to that frustration, but directing it solely at Obama, who was also being attacked by a racist portion of the Tea Party and right-wing media, seems misplaced now. I don’t agree or even approve of every action taken by his administration, but in a lot of cases it appears that, unfortunately, he did the best he could do with the hand he was dealt.What I’m hoping for in his next book, beyond more chronicling, is a push towards that more leftist contingent, instead of rooting himself in the center. It should have become obvious to most people in America by this point that the Republican party is really, on the whole, too far gone to try to appease any longer. It hasn’t gotten us where we hoped it might, and they have been resolutely unwilling to reciprocate in any meaningful way. He may have had to play peacemaker while holding the highest office in the country, but he no longer carries that burden. I want President Obama to not just champion his old centrist friends like President-Elect Joe Biden, but make allies with the progressive wing of his party, think Representitives Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, Pressley & C. Bush. The president has an opportunity to reach out those who feel uninspired and tired of being promised more then given the same. And like he did in 2008, I believe he still has the ability to speak to people on that level. The second volume is likely to end with a rallying cry, and the hope that I have is that he gives us more than platitudes and “snappy slogans”....more",Notes are private!,0,108,1,"Nov 30, 2020","Dec 08, 2020","Nov 30, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55359022-a-promised-land

But then when someone’s able to pull it off, especially someone who doesn’t have fame and celebrity to trade on, you feel like you’ve discovered a hidden treasury of words and stories.The first thing should be a given, and it’s honestly one of the most instantly noticeable things when picking up a piece of autobiographical nonfiction. The author needs to be a good writer. Obviously Saeed Jones is exceptional; his first published works were poetry collections, and he’s not new to writing outside of that. I don’t think you have to write with the same level of prose as Jones in order to succeed here, you just have to be able to tell your story in a distinct and compelling way. If you’re writing with a strong and identifiable voice, one that many people can connect to, then you can become a good writer. At least a writer good enough to speak on your own behalf.The next thing I think potential memoir authors need is something that’s more of an issue with that subset of celebrity-written books that inevitably flood the market. You need to have stories worth telling. I have read a lot of these types of books, and the flops are usually by people who have lived a charmed life where the most interesting that happened to them was becoming famous. I don’t think you need a tragic backstory to become an author, but if you’re writing a book because an agent somewhere told you that should be your next “step”, please kindly......don’t. We get it, your dad is famous. Your parents were skeptical, but [financially] supportive. You suddenly got discovered because you’re too handsome. Chances are we’ve heard these exact stories in a 5 minute segment on a late night show, so what’s the point of printing it in a book if not for a money-grab or for an extra bit of pedigree on the resume? Saeed Jones has so many stories to share. From his childhood into adolescence and adulthood, there’s no lack of cadence in his words. But the majority of what he talks about is not unique, even if it’s not exactly common, it’s still at least somewhat recognizable. The conversations left unspoken between a mother and a son. A struggle to balance between the person you currently are and the person you want to be. A plethora of both good and bad ‘firsts’—I know at the beginning of each chapter that this isn’t going to just be filler to get the story from A to B, but that it will have a point.And that brings me to the final thing that’s necessary to write a memoir: you need to have something to say. To a point that may be true for most, if not all, books. I do think there is more of a requirement with your own life story, though. What are you trying to impact on the reader? What do you want us to take away from what you’re writing? If you can’t answer those questions, then this probably isn’t the writing project for you, yet. I don’t want to speak on Saeed’s behalf, especially since there’s an entire 192 pages where he explains himself much better than I could summarize in a Goodreads , but Saeed Jones has plenty to say. Some of it is reflections on himself, some is an examination of societal norms or pressures, and some I think I’m only just starting to unpack. But not only was this a brilliant memoir from an extremely talented author, you can tell by the end that though How We Fight For Our Lives is a triumph, it’s really only a scratch on the surface. There’s so much more ahead for Jones’ writing career, should he want to continue, and I think we’d all be lucky to have the privilege to read whatever else he comes out with.“People don’t just happen. We sacrifice former versions of ourselves. We sacrifice the people who dared to raise us. The ‘I’ it seems doesn’t exist until we are able to say, ‘I am no longer yours.’”...more",Notes are private!,0,83,1,"Dec 14, 2020","Dec 25, 2020","Nov 30, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43682552-how-we-fight-for-our-lives

I wish I could say it was because of something that would make me sound more worldly and well-read, like yeah, I subscribe to substacks of many interesting writers. But to quote Mr. Brammer, I knew him from “...Twitter, the website where I live.” At some point last year I saw him tweet about an upcoming book of his and was like ‘book??????? I read those!!!!!!!’ It wasn’t until that point that I recognized the funny pink skeleton in a sombrero was probably a real person and, luckily, an experienced and gifted writer outside of the 280 character limit.¡Hola Papi! is a collection of essays formatted a little differently from others I’ve read. Brammer is a former (somewhat accidental) advice columnist, and the essays in his book are structured as responses to those who have written to him seeking guidance. I’m actually not sure if these are excerpts from his previous job or entirely new creations by the author, but it doesn’t really matter either way. Whether these specific pieces of advice were solicited or not, the insights and thoughtful reflection Brammer offers to the reader in his book will be entertaining to most and invaluable to others.Striking the balance between serious topics and humor can be difficult to pull off, but Brammer handles it with a deft hand. Plenty of the moments described are filled with pain, and since it’s a memoir those moments are plucked straight from the experiences of the author. What I found most informing was the comparisons between how he felt about something when it initially happened vs how he views that same event now. Trauma doesn’t always let you identify it as such. You need to reach a level of safety and understanding in yourself in order to process some memories from your past. Then, while you’re sitting with the heaviness of that, you’ll move on to the next chapter and find that its titled “How to Describe a Dick”. And strangely enough, this will be exactly the cut in the tension you need to keep going. Hola Papi isn’t the kind of book that’s leading the reader through painful experiences for the sake of it. There’s always a point to be made or a situation to find the funny side of. Brammer is as raw and honest as he is witty and quietly hilarious. Some of the stories may feel like they’re starting to wander or like they are ignoring the subject entirely, only to come around and answer the question with careful consideration and sensitivity.The very first and last chapters are devoted to the question of qualifications, namely should John Paul Brammer be able to give strangers advice. I feel similarly every time I post another book ; sometimes I get nervous writing them. This is a single website, usually for book nerds to fart out our thoughts about whatever we just read. But outside of social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok) and bookseller sites (Amazon, Barnes & Noble), this is the biggest place for these s. If you Google a title, Goodreads will be on the first page of results. So when I scroll through a book’s page and see that my previous , which at the time was a gif of a lady walking down a staircase declaring “I’M READY TO DRINK”, is currently the top one—yes, I start to feel anxious. Hopefully for those reading this, maybe with a hovering cursor over an online shopping cart, or perusing the shelves in a bookstore or library, you will give this one a shot. Especially if any of what I described sounds like something you can relate to, but even if you just want a book that will make you laugh as much as it will comfort your fears of inadequacy. It did that and more for me and left me with an even deeper appreciation for the sombrero-clad skeleton that lives inside Twitter with me. Probably not enough to subscribe to a substack, but enough to pick up anything else with his name printed on the cover. *Thanks to Simon & Schuster for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,"Jun 20, 2021","Jun 30, 2021","Nov 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711622-hola-papi

Every single book of hers just absolutely clocks you right away, sometimes in the prologue, but always by the end of the first chapter. This one had the one-two punch of monumental twists in both, which left me reeling. I genuinely don’t think I’ve been this floored by a plot twist like this since Triptych.False Witness is a standalone, so you’re not going to be getting any appearances from good ‘ol Sara Linton or Will Trent. But I think fans of Slaughter’s previous books will enjoy this one, and newbies to the Slaughterverse (I just made this up) can also comfortably jump in with this one and not feel like they’re missing context. Everything you come to expect from her—action, tension, biting wit, incredible twists and a grand finale made for premium cable—is present here. Though in all the ways this book is like its predecessors, it also fairly different from her typical novel structure.“The law was never what anyone thought it was or wanted it to be.”For one, this is not a police procedural. I think this was a smart move, taking a step back from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. I will go to bat for Will and Faith any day, but besides the obvious skepticism around policing in the US currently, I like that we’re seeing a different side of crime presented. Mainly, through one of the two main characters, Leigh, who is a defense attorney. Her sister, Callie, is living what feels like a flipped mirror image of Leigh’s life, struggling with addiction and living barely off the street. The two had an already tumultuous childhood before a violent event impacted them both irreparably. And though they’ve tried to move on, nothing can prepare them for how Leigh’s new case forces them to confront the monsters of their past.I love how Karin Slaughter writes sisters. Whether it’s Charlotte and Samantha in The Good Daughter or Sara and Tessa in the Grant County series, she just captures dueling personalities so well. Callie and Leigh are no exception here. Going through traumatic events links people together in a way that’s hard to explain to anyone on the outside and leaves them with complicated feelings towards one another. But like any good sisters, no matter how much they fight with each other, there’s no doubt they will also kill for one another.And look, Slaughter is no novice to writing violence and sexual violence. If you go into one of her books, you’ve got to prepare yourself for that inevitability. The violence in False Witness, though, did have a different feeling to it. Usually I would expect the very beginning to have an assault or murder, then the middle would be a sometimes graphic investigation of those crime(s), with the ending usually containing a violent confrontation of some kind. For its part, False Witness was less explicit than say, Pretty Girls, but there were a good number of assaults peppered throughout the middle as well. And this violence was a lot more brazen and unrepentant, if at times a little cathartic. I’m trying to make sure people don’t feel completely blindsided, but this was actually more of a feature for me than a drawback. The action is a lot more street-level, since the investigative angle is out of the picture, and there’s a grittier quality to the plot which I loved. This is not the neat and easy thriller you walk away from feeling satisfied. Trauma is messy. So is revenge.For me, False Witness is one of the few written-during-the-pandemic books that actually worked. COVID as a topic is neither a completely avoided nor all-consuming, just a reality of the characters living through it. In the afterword she discusses more of her reasoning behind those choices, so don’t skip that! And for someone who’s written over 20 novels, Slaughter’s ability to not just write a relentlessly good thriller, but also retain a prescient cultural awareness never ceases to amaze me. I loved the intensity of this book and it’s going to be my go-to recommendation for summer reads.*Thanks to my favorite librarian Merricat for sharing her ARC with me!

Even more so when the sequel was one not originally planned by the author while writing the first book. So upon starting Dear Justyce, Nic Stone’s follow-up to her staggering novel Dear Martin, I really appreciated that the dedication she included not only thanked the boys that inspired the continuation of Quan’s story, but doubled as an explainer to why she decided to write this book in the end. It primed the reader for what this story was about, who it was written for and set the tone for how Quan’s life and the words he writes will be different from Justyce’s.Vernell LaQuan Banks Jr., known as Quan to almost everyone outside the US legal system, is currently incarcerated. He was arrested during the events of Dear Martin, presumably, but we have never gotten much information besides that he was Manny’s cousin and a former acquaintance of Justyce’s. He begins this novel writing letters to the boy from his childhood, Justyce McAllister, discussing his time in jail, his frustration with the system(s) that failed him and whatever small hopes he has for his future. Unlike Justyce’s letter writing project to Martin Luther King Jr. in the previous book, the subject of these correspondence is still alive and able to read Quan’s words—and he does. I don’t take issue with Stone’s decision to write a sequel. And I think a lot of the issues Quan is dealing with are important especially for a teen audience to read and discuss. I do think some of the choices made in the book, though, may have resulted from the author’s attempt to walk the fine line between a realistic story and an aspirational one. Despite Quan having even more of the system stacked against him, he still felt like an outlier in how kids in similar situations would be treated. It seemed like Justyce and his friends just swooped in and saved the day, in a way that would be hard to replicate in real life. Though Quan may have faced challenges more relatable to a number of kids who’d be reading the book, the way it all played out felt pretty far removed from reality.Some of the dialogue between characters, even characters that existed and interacted in the previous book, was a little cringey. I think I might have glossed over parts of it before because of how impactful other portions of Dear Martin had been, but the way that SJ and Jared speak sound like parodies of that type of character, rather than actual people. Justyce’s meeting with nearly every authority figure and adult played out like a fan-fiction reimagining of how that kind of conversation would go. It’s not that no people have ever spoken like that, just that it’s more reminiscent of how teenagers and young adults communicate online, rather than in person. These were largely isolated instances, but in such a short book they still stood out. I did like the way Quan was portrayed. I think Nic Stone did an excellent job with both him and Justyce. The tone of Quan’s letters fluctuate between tenuous hope and muted despair, basically someone just trying to hold it together. The fact that both of these boys are teenagers who had to learn hard adult lessons early in life only makes the experience of reading their innermost thoughts and feelings all the more painful. I haven’t read any of Stone’s work outside of this duology, but if she nails her main characters like this across the board, then I may pick one of them up next. Although it’s tempting to keep revisiting familiar characters and a setting your readers are accustomed to, I’m hoping the author leaves these two books on their own for now. Perhaps down the road she may want to round it off and make it a full trilogy, but I think giving Justyce and Quan space would be the best thing for now....more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Dec 26, 2020","Dec 31, 2020","Nov 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37829267-dear-justyce

It’s not just a True stories of injustice always seem to be the most difficult to stomach, probably because they’re harder to separate yourself from. It’s not just a hypothetical, however realistic some of those narratives may be, but the reality of the world you’re currently living in. In actuality, some of the most gut-wrenching and nearly unbelievable stories told are the ones that tend to be rooted in fact, for the simple reason that nobody would be able to buy into them otherwise.Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson is absolutely filled to the brim with those stories. The truth of the criminal justice system in America, from the police departments to the court systems to the correctional facilities, is rife with corruption and distortion of the law and structures in place to protect and enforce those laws. More disturbingly, though, is not the diversions from those laws, but the lawful evils allowed, and even encouraged, under them. But knowing these realities and truly reckoning with the human casualties are two very different things. I’m not going to patronize further to try and convince people that our system is broken. That should be abundantly clear at this point. What the question is now is what we as a society intend to do about it. Will we re-examine and release those erroneously charged and jailed? Will we elect politicians who make changing harmful laws a priority? (this is my shoutout to President Elect Biden from the entire city of Chicago: DO NOT PICK RAHM EMANUEL FOR ANY JOB, MY GOD.) Will we start to charge and prosecute law enforcement and correctional officials who abuse their power? And most prudently, will we finance the huge overhaul of our systems and payouts to those wrongly convicted and abused so that they can start to move on with what’s left of their lives? Currently as a country we can’t even agree to ban the death penalty, so you’ll forgive me for remaining skeptical of all the police officers taking a knee in front of tv cameras.As for the author, Bryan Stevenson, he seems to be an ever-flowing supply of productive hope. As the co-founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, Stevenson started his legal crusade in Montgomery, Alabama as a nonprofit attorney for those condemned to death row. His practice eventually expands to include many more of the unjustly convicted, including the mentally-disabled, people convicted as children to life sentences, young mothers blamed in the death of their stillborn children and more. Dozens of these cases are discussed, but the one that we follow throughout, the case of Walter McMillian, is one of the EJI’s first and a huge reckoning for Stevenson’s upstart firm.McMillian’s case is significant not just because it was one of Stevenson’s initial cases or because of the media attention it eventually draws, but because it is a shining example of failure and malicious malpractice in the investigative, correctional and legal professions. Every single person who seems to touch the case inevitably corrupts it more, leaving the EJI with an ever-growing list of misconduct to sort through. It’s such a spectacular and intentional fuck-up that it’s almost impressive. How both Mr. McMillian and Mr. Stevenson don’t lash out at every person they encounter through the process is a testament to their character and a sign of how thoroughly the deck is stacked against them. One wrong move and their entire case could be thrown away like there isn’t a man’s life on the line. This book was gutting and infuriating, but left so much room for each reader to decide to keep pressing forward anyways. The only thing that can combat the certainty of injustice is the certainty of hope. That hope along with people like Mr. Stevenson who tirelessly chase after it are the best chance we have in making lasting systemic change in America, and I’m choosing to believe that it will happen....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Nov 20, 2020","Nov 30, 2020","Nov 16, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20342617-just-mercy

There’s been a bit of a blurring of the lines between Young Adult and Adult fiction over the years, and sometimes it feels like teenage readers, especially ones in their early teens, get left behind. Maybe it’s due to the reluctance by publishers to classify books as New Adult, but about half of YA book readers are adults. This is fine, but adult readers and ers need to understand that these works are not made specifically for them, and should be able to acknowledge that before picking one up.Dear Martin is a book for high schoolers, whether they’re big readers or not, and meets them on their level. It’s not juvenile and it doesn’t talk down to them. It deals with serious issues and will probably be triggering or upsetting to many of them. But it also is easy to read and has characters who think and act like real, modern teenagers. It’s short, which, honestly, was my favorite characteristic for assigned readings in class. And like other more recent YA novels, like Speak and The Hate U Give, I think it would be an excellent addition to a school’s book list. Justyce McAllister has a lot going for him. He’s successful academically, goes to a great school and has some really solid friends. He doesn’t cause trouble, even at times when he would have good reason to. But to some people he will always be seen as Black before anything else—as someone inherently threatening. The police officer who accosts him one night certainly does, and though Justyce survives the altercation, he’s forever changed.Dear Martin is a story specific to Justyce, but is one that we should all be familiar with by this point. Especially after everything that’s happened in the United States in 2020, but also because it’s been happening for decades. You can see it stretching back centuries if you want to look that far. The characters go through a lot, but nothing that’s even approaching improbable. What makes Dear Martin so affecting is how familiar it all feels. I would recommend this book to everybody who is willing. If you’re white especially, and this is not the type of book you’d normally reach for, I implore you to read something outside of your typical experience. It’s not just necessary for personal growth, but societal as well. There is no point of ‘wokeness’ that can be reached where we will no longer have to vigorously interrogate our own biases.

I mean, check that synopsis—”Ferris Bueller's Day Off with murder”. How could you *not* get excited with that description?[image]Like all McManus books, there’s a handful walking stereotypes students who end up thrown together in some sort of deadly situation. The hook here is that these three, Ivy, Mateo and Cal, are based off of the characters from the famous 80’s movie. They ditch school one day and through a sequence of terrible events end up in the immediate vicinity of a recently committed murder. And because they are teenagers and thriller protagonists, they do not go to the authorities (or their parents) for help and decide to try and solve it on their own.I would be lying if I said it didn’t take me a while to get into this. The first half of the book was a lot of them just walking around. Getting donuts, sitting in the car, waiting in empty buildings, etc. The pacing picked up for me in the back half, but it still never reached what I think its full potential could have been. This might have something to do with the twists and the way they were revealed. Though some of the information we’re fed in the first part was a surprise, most of it didn’t seem to matter in the grand scheme of things. By comparison the plot twists at the climax of the book were executed so well that they left me reeling. I didn’t see them coming until they were nearly on top of me.But what is a thriller if you’re only thrilled for a fraction of the story? Even after all the big reveals, when the bad guys are unmasked and taken away, it dragged for me. Those after pages, the length of the book after the final climax/resolution, were way too long and explanatory. We don’t need five additional full-length chapters gift wrapping the ending for us. The Cousins seemed to have a similar problem, although the slower pacing of that one made a little more sense with the tone of that book. There just has been very little action in her last two YA thrillers, and the only standalone of hers I really enjoyed was Two Can Keep a Secret. Obviously the author of One of Us Is Lying, a book that’s still on bestseller lists years after publication, is not in danger of ever not making money through writing. But with the announcement that her sixth novel is going to be another sequel to her runaway hit, I’m wondering if she’s doubling back to that familiar ground as a way to try and catch some of the initial energy that her earlier books contained.If McManus is feeling a little uninspired by YA high school dramas, I feel like this would be a good time to pivot into New Adult territory. A lot of what she seems to want to do with her characters falls outside of this format she keeps going back to. Characters in college or their early-mid twenties might end up being a better fit. The way that You’ll Be the Death of Me played out, especially with minors being involved, felt very contrived. We’re beyond suspending disbelief at this point—because just about every major plot detail in this book would not be in the realm of possibility for teenagers. [image]And if I could get into a couple specific things: (view spoiler)[That ‘relationship’ between Cal and his teacher….what even was that??? What was the point? Seems a lot to tease a student/teacher scandal that amounted to nothing.

Poor, plain Jane has recently ended up in Birmingham, Alabama after leaving behind an old life, and name, in Arizona. Working as a dog-walker to the rich residents of the bougie neighborhood Thornfield Estates, Jane finds herself literally knocked off her feet by Eddie Rochester, a widower who is looking to fill the recently-made hole in his life. Eddie is charming, wealthy and good-looking, so Jane is caught off guard when he suddenly shows an interest in her. Their romance is a whirlwind and a shock to all who know the couple, but nobody is more surprised than Jane herself, and she’s committed to leave the old version of herself behind and become Mrs. Rochester.But can Jane escape the ghosts of her past as well as the ones haunting Eddie’s? Bea Rochester and her best friend Blanche died suddenly in a mysterious boating accident almost a year ago, leaving the town devastated. Eddie’s first wife was an icon in Birmingham society; beautiful, talented and the owner of a successful business, Southern Manners, there’s little Jane can do to prevent herself from being constantly compared to Thornfield Estates’ fallen angel.I haven’t read Jane Eyre, so I can’t comment on the similarities this to that book, but I might want to read the original after finishing this one. There’s a lot of reading between the lines in stories like this, and I enjoyed guessing how it would all turn out, even if a lot of the answers felt really obvious. I also liked most of the characterizations in this book, but I think the least believable for me was Eddie. The entire relationship between him and Jane, from the timeline to their interactions, felt forced instead of a natural love (or even lust) at first sight.This is not the first 2021 book I’ve read (that would be The Gilded Ones), but it’s still not a bad start to that stretch of books. What I’m hoping for from thrillers in 2021 is to keep me guessing, instead of repeating some of the same tropes of the past decade. The Wife Upstairs was intriguing and suspenseful, but nothing that will leave you stunned and breathless.

As soon as I finished one story I would think well I’m sure this next one will be good, but there’s no way they could top that, only to be immediately proven wrong.As stated in the above synopsis, this is the fourth collection from We Need Diverse Books, a nonprofit initiative with the goal of expanding diversity in children’s literature. A Universe of Wishes is the organization’s first fantasy anthology, and when I saw the list of contributing authors I was sooo excited! [image]me looking at the list of authors in this bookThe editor of the collection, Dhonielle Clayton, is an author in her own right, and is the writer behind the popular The Belles series. Other contributors you might recognize include Nic Stone (Dear Martin), Rebecca Roanhorse (Black Sun), Zoraida Córdova (Incendiary) and more! The one I was most excited about was V.E. Schwab’s story A Royal Affair, which is set in the A Darker Shade of Magic universe. It depicts the initial love story between two main characters in that trilogy, Rhy and Alucard, following until their relationship’s heartbreaking end. (this is not a spoiler for the books, as the series begins several years after the events of this story)I’m not going to get into more specifics than that, because I don’t want to spoil any of them for potential readers. But the only drawback I can see is that some of these stories are so short (duh). But a number of them were a little *too* short and incomplete for me. Ones like The Scarlet Woman built up all of this tension and plot and then.....it ended. Pretty abruptly. I really loved so much of the writing here and the stories were for the most part utterly imaginative and brilliant, but I almost wish a few of these ideas were saved for a novel-length work instead of a few dozen pages worth. In all, I’m so glad I got to read this collection! Some of the stories I may have enjoyed more than others, but that came down to personal preference, not competency. There weren’t any weak links present, and with such a large number of contributors and a broad genre like Fantasy, that’s not an easy thing to pull off. Props to We Need Diverse Books, the publisher, Dhonielle Clayton and all the authors who participated for creating something really special.

Not because there isn’t anything to say, but because it leaves you feeling helpless. It’s not just the stories themselves, which are some of the most heartbreaking and demoralizing I’ve read in nonfiction, but the resignation in the tone with which they’re told, both by the author, Karla Cornejo Villavicencio, and the people who she’s chronicling. It isn’t the American story we’ve become accustomed to hearing, that many have sardonically referred to as the ‘bootstrap stories’, but a harsher version without the trademark happy ending. Cornejo Villavicencio’s portrayal is a more honest account, which is why we’ve all been, for the most part, content to ignore it. A DREAMer herself, the author sidesteps the well-treaded reporting of undocumented immigrants like her. She was brought to the US as a child, graduated from Harvard in 2011, and is now working towards her PhD at Yale. Cornejo Villavicencio knows she is the exception, and she resists the urge to write the outlier’s story. What she gives us instead are accounts of people who don’t let us retreat into the idea that we are part of the “greatest country in the world”. The Undocumented Americans is the portrait of the utter cruelty of an apathetic nation. And something that becomes abundantly clear while reading is that wherever there is crisis in America, there will be the Undocumented bearing the brunt of it. They will suffer themselves, rally together to help one another as well as American citizens, and then once the emergency has passed will be swiftly shuffled back into the margins. It’s a cycle where our government and society takes and takes while offering little in return besides stigma and scorn. And you can feel the underlying fury in Cornejo Villavicencio’s words. She has grown up in this country, succeeded in it, but her own undocumented status made her vigilant for cracks in the foundation. Her gaze is withering, but there’s not one critical comment or dark-humored joke that is not earned. She knows exactly where to stick the knife to deliver that killing blow. There’s no insulting attempt to “humanize” in this work, as the subjects’ humanity is inherent.I’m not going to get into specifics of the essays in the book; I won’t be able to do her storytelling justice. The audiobook is excellent, for anyone who may be interested in that, but make sure not to crank up the speed or you’ll miss a lot of the author’s tone and some casual sideswipes. Once I finished, I was struggled with what the next step would be. Not everyone can organize or run for office, and outside of a few specific career paths there’s not much direct policy that can be impacted by the average person. But maybe that’s the point; that this is a book that’s supposed to knock your morale down to its lowest level. It’s supposed to make you question your own humanity and the inherent ‘rightness’ of a system that has allowed you to live, if not thrive, while others struggle to survive. This is not a book that’s meant to uplift; you will find no comfort here. Is the eventual goal to change minds? Possibly. That would be something to hope for. Though the author is aware that she doesn’t have direct control over people’s response to her words. And if she can’t make you empathize, can’t make you understand—at the very least she will not allow us to look away. **For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,116,1,"Jan 26, 2022",Feb 2022,"Oct 28, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41880092-the-undocumented-americans

But though Namesake was still a decent YA fantasy, I think there was some of the magic of the first book missing in its follow-up. Like I feel full after finishing it, but a little unsatisfied.This will be a spoiler-free  for both books, if you’re worried about not having read either and still might like to down the road. As far as the plot, Namesake picks up with the main character Fable (her name as well as the title) and a good amount of the book is her separate from the rest of her crew. While I understood why this happened within the story, it wasn’t as engaging as when they were all working together. Portions of the book ended up dragging, and the sense of adventure threaded throughout the previous novel was not present here. I get it, sequels are hard. And so are endings. That’s probably why Young ended Fable with such an intense cliffhanger. Namesake might have stuck the landing with wrapping things up, but not without wobbling a little first. It was all a little too neat and easy to see where it was all going. It’s not a mystery novel so I don’t need to be surprised every chapter, but there’s a supposed ‘big reveal’ or two at the end and neither were the plot twist that I think Young was hoping for.Also, why was so much of the book about contract negotiations and trade treaties? What happened to all the cool pirate stuff? I don’t know, maybe I’m being to hard on it, because I did get through the book quickly, but I think I was hoping for something a little more fantastical. Maybe something with a little more tension. If you were a fan of Fable I wouldn’t say skip this. But if you’re deciding whether this is a *must read* fantasy duology, I think you can afford to wait on it.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,89,1,"Mar 25, 2021","Apr 04, 2021","Oct 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53138025-namesake

I went into it mostly blind, besides just the basics: a queer vampire novella, originally written in 1998, translated from Spanish & published by Silvia Moreno-Garcia, the author of Mexican Gothic. I haven’t read Dracula, which I think put me at a disadvantage, because the story follows the voyage of The Demeter to England. I know a couple of other ers had said you don’t need to read it before going in, but I was a little lost sometimes and didn’t really understand the context of what was happening until the end. That said, it was still an enjoyable read for me and I think anyone who’s a fan of Dracula, vampires or gothic horror would probably like this. The writing is rich and incredibly descriptive. I obviously can’t compare it to the original because I don’t know Spanish, but for an English-speaker this feels like a great translation. The language builds in a way that gave me a growing sense of dread, where I was afraid to continue but also had to get to the end. It was genuinely scary at times, which I think is a credit both to both Mr. Zárate and Mr. Bowles.Much of The Route of Ice and Salt focuses on desire that borders on a craving or hunger, which I believe is supposed to symbolize vampirism. As both the author and publisher have said, the fact that this featured a gay main character struggling to rein in his sexuality in a novella published in Mexico in 1998 is significant. I feel like other ers were better able to articulate this significance, so I’d recommend scrolling and reading some of those s. The text was a good deal more erotic than I was expecting, sometimes abstractly and sometimes more explicitly, if that’s something that will impact you’re enjoyment of the story.In all, I’m glad I read this. It makes me want to go and read Dracula now that I understand how one fits into the other. It probably says something about modern fiction that my first introduction to vampires was the sparkly variety, but I’m glad there are authors who are putting out and making accessible the types that exist in this story. I don’t think this is going to be appealing to everyone, but for a specific type of reader it’ll probably resonate strongly.*Thanks to Silvia Moreno-Garcia, Innsmouth Free Press & Netgalley for an advance copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Jan 09, 2021","Jan 14, 2021","Oct 25, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56357561-the-route-of-ice-and-salt

Djèlí Clark is the perfect fantasical horror story to pull you away from the real life one we’ve been living this week. Set almost a hundred years ago in Macon, Georgia, Ring Shout follows Maryse Boudreaux, a monster slayer who is hunting the KKK. Not just Klan members, though, but a particularly heinous type of demon that walks around in human skin. They’re called Ku Kluxes, and they have infiltrated one of the most hateful organizations in the last 100 years of American history. Maryse, along with Chef, a former soldier and bomb specialist, and Sadie, one of the sharpest shooters in Georgia, are tasked with taking these creatures out before they hurt anyone else.The historical context of this novella is amazingly done, with much of what was happening in the US in 1922 front and center in the story. The dangerously racist The Birth of a Nation has insighted violence and rebirthed much of the dormant Klan during this period. It’s a revelation among the white masses looking for someone to blame, and some of the most effective and lasting white supremacist propaganda to come out of the twentieth century. P. Djèlí Clark brilliantly blends reality with this type of dark fantasy and has created a really poignant story for America in 2020. My only complaint is it’s short, obviously since it’s a novella, so I do feel like a lot of the plot had a more rushed feel. That said, there is absolutely no skimping on characterization or action, and everything flowed nicely, if a little quickly. There’s definitely potential for both an adaptation and a sequel here, so I will be looking to see if either of those end up happening....more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,"Nov 03, 2020","Nov 05, 2020","Oct 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49247242-ring-shout

Tudor’s last book The Other People, and I’m so glad she’s retained that same kind taught, twisting thriller with a hint of paranormal elements mixed in for The Burning Girls. Chapel Croft is like a lot of small British towns; it wears its traditions proudly and plays its secrets close to the chest. And now it has a new vicar, Reverend Jack Brooks, who has moved into town with a teenage daughter Flo in tow, looking to escape some of their own demons back home. The pair are trying to make the best of the situation, but from the moment they step foot in town something that feels sinister seems to be haunting them. In trying to better understand their surroundings, Flo and Jack will have to reckon not only with the town’s eerie history, but also their own obscured pasts.Wow that was a tough paragraph to write without including any spoilers! I have a newfound appreciation for synopsis writers. That said, even if you’re scrolling through s and happen upon a rogue spoiler or two, I wouldn’t worry about it. Because there are SO many twists and turns in this book that if I had all day I genuinely do not think I’d be able to keep track of them all. So if you guess any of the twists early on, know that you’re either completely wrong or that you’ve only guessed part one of a 12-part plot revelation that‘ll leave you slack-jawed. Seriously, the twists have twists that have twists. Almost to the point at the end where I felt like I was drowning in new developments. I mean I’d rather have too many surprises than not have enough, but it can feel overwhelming to jump from one to the next so quickly. A lot of that has to do with the multiple-generation murders and disappearances that stretch back to the sixteenth century. The Burning Girls probably has around a dozen of these cases that have to be solved or wrapped up by the end, and in a 300 page novel it’s gonna turn into a sprint at the end. The sheer number of characters left me flipping back and forth trying to remember who this random person was and what year they were alive in. And the last hundred or so pages felt like I was being pelted with curveballs. For some readers, though, this is great news! Especially for people who read a toooon of thrillers and are looking for something that has the ability to surprise them, this might be just the tonic you’re looking for. But for the casual or rare mystery/thriller/suspense genre reader, it could be too much. Or maybe my last 2 brain cells are just have trouble following intricate plots now—I don't know!

Vicious is exactly the type of gritty, street-level exploration of what could really happen if someone suddenly woke up with superpowers.[image]I’m really going to try not to give much of the plot away, because it’s better to go in knowing as little as possible. But the story follows two young men in college, going from that point in their lives until ten years later in present day. They live in a world with rumors of enhanced individuals called EO’s (Extra Ordinaries) and decide to chase those legends to their inevitable conclusion. They become obsessed with not just making a scientific breakthrough, but furthering their own personal legacies, no matter what, or who, the cost may be.What I love about this book is that there aren’t really any heroes. There are definite villains and you could make the argument for or against anti-heroes, but the people at the center of the story are almost entirely acting out of their own self-interest. The only way you can glean any sort of moral superiority from their actions would be in direct comparison to one another. As in, what one character did was good because what the other did was worse. I always like to see how Victoria Schwab plays with moral grey-zones like this because she does them so well. It’s hard to know who to cheer for when both teams have blood on their hands.That said, I’m glad she resists the urge to ‘both-sides’ any altercations between Victor and Eli. They’re complex characters and though you can maybe understand where both are coming from, you’re probably going to find yourself agreeing with one more than the other. I love the examination of god complexes among people who are functionally gods. You can see it in tv shows like The Boys or Watchmen; having a power or skill in one thing doesn’t equate to superiority across the board, and can in fact lead to a specific kind of moral erosion. [image]As always, Schwab’s writing is beautiful. There’s a reason that long-time fans of hers have been recommending this duology to me like crazy. Though this came out years before The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, there’s definitely some of the same themes that she loves to explore: the purpose and value of a life, being remembered, death, the struggle between two opposing forces locked in eternal battle, red coats (this one is actually A Darker Shade of Magic). These are all ideas that are really engaging to me, and I’ll always be interested to see what Schwab has to say on the subject.Anyways, I read this with a group of slowpokes, so I hope they don’t mind if I start Vengeful soon.

If someone is discovered to be an orogene, best case scenario they are sent to a training facility known as the Fulcrum to teach them to use their powers and contribute to society. Worst case they are killed by their communities before the Fulcrum’s Guardians are able to retrieve them.“When we say that ‘the world has ended,’ remember—it is usually a lie. The planet is just fine.”The world of Ths Broken Earth series is the way it is primarily because of human actions. The books take a harsh but necessary look at climate change and the human obstacles in the way of correcting previous environmental missteps. A huge stress by N.K. Jemisin is put on the fact that the Earth does not need life in order to exist, but we—life—need to preserve the earth if we plan on surviving ourselves. But it’s the human elements of this series that are the real heart and soul of these books. Through the races of people on the page, Jemisin creates a stark comparison to how our own human history has subjugated and conquered other groups of people. Dehumanization is at the root of all of it, and is a necessary step in stripping people of their rights, livelihood and autonomy. And the generation trauma will be felt years and years beyond the initial offense, especially if left untreated and unacknowledged. History is written by the winners, and it must be thoroughly interrogated if you’re looking for anything that gives even a passing resemblance to the truth. “Conquerors live in dread of the day when they are shown to be, not superior, but simply lucky.”On a more personal level, Jemisin’s characters are filled to the brim with raw and often very painful emotions. They’re grieving and they’re despondent and they’re angry. There are moments of hope and levity, but this is a series that will make you feel things, so be prepared. So much of that hurt is rooted in love. The love of a mother to her children, the love between a child and surrogate parent. The love of a community and of humanity. Even when they all seem to let you down or fail you, that love is still present in the way you decide to keep living for them anyway. The mother/daughter relationship in particular between Nassun and Essun was so wrought and complicated it was hard for me not to start thinking about my relationship with my own mother. These books will really sink their claws into you.“I think...that if you love someone, you don’t get to choose how they love you back.”A brief note one complaint I keep hearing—I don’t really understand the people who are bothered by part of the books being written in second person. Maybe they’re just so used to first or third that second just throws them off completely? There’s a reason these portions are told in this way, one that’s relevant to the plot. And even if it was just a rhetorical or stylistic choice, that’s the prerogative of the author, in my opinion. It just feels like a lot of backseat writing to me, and if you get anything from reading this series, it’s that every choice N.K. Jemisin makes is deliberate, considered and probably brilliant.This isn’t a quick or easy read. Some of the lore is very dense and you’re going to have to deal with unfamiliar terminology and names. But the examination of a complicated humanity, the kind of love that causes pain and what we owe one another & the world we all inhabit is totally worth that commitment for me.“Don’t be patient. Don’t ever be.

Maybe you’re looking at the s and the cover and thinking “Oh come on, it’s got a 4.27 star rating and the cover art is gorgeous, how could it not be good??!?” Well hypothetical person I’m responding to, I have been fooled before!! There’s no shortage of YA fantasy books that have striking artwork and a killer synopsis and the best s or blurbs, but then you actually begin *reading* said book and it’s just.....meh. The story is either too convoluted or the dialogue is repetitive or the entire plot seems copied and pasted from the last dozen or so fantasy series you started but never finished—it gets tiring!So I’m happy to report the latest offering from Adrienne Young, author of the Sky in the Deep duology, is an incredible adventure from beginning to end. I’m usually someone who struggles more with starting books than finishing them, but I fell right into Fable from the get-go. The title character, Fable, has been fending for herself for four years after being abandoned by her father without warning. She’s now seventeen and after surviving on Jeval, she’s ready to make her move to leave and seek out the only family she has left. She’s able to narrowly secure passage to the city of Ceros, but the crew Fable finds herself among on that journey end up being different than she’d expected.[image]What’s most impressive from Young for me was how knowledgeable she seems to be about sailing and shipbuilding. There’s so many references to the mechanics of these huge, now largely obsolete vessels as well as the terminology each crew member’s job, just things I would never even know to ask about. I’m sure she did a lot of research into......something. I don’t know—the history of pirating? See, I wouldn’t even know what to Google!! But if she ended up being raised on a merchant ship herself for her entire childhood I would probably believe it.Fable has everything you could want in a heroine. She’s clever and skilled, but not infallible. She’s easy to root for and easier to become invested in. Her dynamic with the crew of the Marigold is one of the best things about this book. If you were a fan of the group-heist storyline from Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom, I think you’ll enjoy this. Fable is a much more grounded fantasy than anything out of the Grishaverse, there’s no magic shooting out of people’s hands, but the same kind of camaraderie and not-always-gentle ribbing is present between the characters. And the inevitable plotting the occurs is always fun to follow along with.And what’s the other best thing about this book? Its sequel is already slotted for an early 2021 release!

A dark and twisting novel about religion, patriarchal structures, othering and reclaiming your power, The Year of the Witching was quite a debut from author Alexis Henderson.[image]Immanuelle has lived in Bethel all her life. Isolated from the rest of the world, her repressive religious town is surrounded by a sinister forest known as the Darkwood, where no person is permitted to enter. And nobody has, not since Immanuelle’s mother disappeared years ago before coming back heavily pregnant with her. Orphaned after her mother’s passing in childbirth and her father’s execution, Immanuelle has always felt the darkness of the woods calling to her, no matter what the Prophet says. And now that she’s found her mother’s diary, she’s ready to explore the pieces of herself that she’s long kept hidden away.This is a fantasy that’s different than most others I’ve read in the genre. It’s definitely an adult fantasy, so keep that in mind when making comparisons, but I feel like it still had a differing tone. Much of the plot moves like historical fiction, likely based on a specific historical time period (I am bad at identifying stuff like this), even though this world is an invented one. The inhabitants of Bethel are terrified of all things magical and actively shun it. So the only time that Immanuelle is able to access magic is primarily when she ventures outside of her community. As a result, I think many of the non-magic portions of the book felt slower comparatively, which led to an uneven pacing at times.(view spoiler)[The thing that kind of bothered me at the end was how the witches of the forest were built up then quickly discarded. The author makes the point several times that they were previously women who were abused in one way or another and turned to magic for protection, only to then cast them in the faceless evil villain role. Why do they all have to die but the Prophet gets to be spared? Immanuelle is depicted as being the moral compass of this story and I took issue with these decrees of hers at the end. To me, a feminist fantasy that punishes female villains but spares that male ones (who had a large hand in creating the female ones in the first place) is majorly missing the mark. (hide spoiler)][image]I do think it was a beautifully atmospheric novel featuring feminist themes, so of course I was going to pick it up. I’ll probably continue with the series too, whenever the next book is announced. I’m really curious to see how Henderson expands on this world because it’s been very self-contained so far, and there’s a lot of potential for exploration here.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Apr 10, 2021","Apr 28, 2021","Sep 29, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49789629-the-year-of-the-witching

You’re not going to believe this, but I—[image]I loved this. I really, really enjoyed it.Well I’ll be honest with you, I went into this not expecting to like it at all. That’s not to be a contrarian against books that are popular, I just have read three other Maas books before and was not super impressed by them, though I could see why so many seemed to love them.My biggest gripe with Throne of Glass and A Court of Thorns and Roses was the heroines that starred in them. I just did not like Celaena and Feyre at all. The people around them treated them like they were perfect, and a lot of their dialogue felt set up to try and give the main characters pithy one-liners. So much of their own power in the patriarchal societies they inhabited was at the expense of other women. Whether it was slut-shaming around ~vIrGiNiTy~ or an Evil Step-Sister stand-in, there was no supporting character that wasn’t depicted as inferior in some way. I just found these two characters insufferable and kept hoping someone would kill them.Which is why when I began reading House of Earth and Blood, Bryce felt like such a breath of fresh air. Not only does her name have significantly fewer vowels (finally a Maas name my mouth doesn’t mangle—HALLELUJAH), but she’s decidedly not flawless from the get-go. Does Bryce eventually start to fall into those Practically Perfect in Every Way™ pitfalls that the previous two Maas heroines do? Well.....yes. Bryce’s flaws in the first half of the book eventually dissolve in the second half, which is annoying, but by that point I didn’t really care. I was 100% invested, and there was no amount of cringey innuendo that could stop me!!!!!I really can’t articulate why I loved this book as much as I did in the way I want to. It’s been three days since I finished it and I don’t feel any more capable. If I tried breaking it down into components like I did above, I can definitely find things to complain about. Like,  why does Bryce “pad” everywhere?? can’t she just WALK or is it possible for a Maas main character or love interest not to be so inexplicably lusted after by every nearby person with a pulse? There’s probably inconsistencies in some wider world building. It definitely could have been shorter. It’s also likely way too horny for a Fantasy murder-mystery. .......and yet[image]Sarah Jane while writing this bookAnd yet. It’s the only book I’ve really torn into this month as everything in America seemed to be going off the deep end. I thought I would have to skim it to finish, but I ate up every single word. My friend Kristen over at @kraysbookclub read it with me and absolutely adored it as well, despite also not liking ACOTAR. We initially picked Crescent City up at the recommendations of our friends Jordan (@jordys.book.club), Zubs (@zubscovered) and Paige (@paigethroughbooks), but went in expecting a hate-read. Jokes on us, though, because the plot was completely riveting. There are fae (lol duh it’s SJM) but also angels and werewolves and witches and demons—all living in a version of a modern metropolis. They’re working together to solve a slew of murders in the city, all while trying to navigate the politics of a complex magical hierarchy. And by the end I was frantically flipping pages while futilely yelling at my library copy. So yeah...........you could say I was into it.Some of you will definitely not like this. I can already guess who those people might be based on other books they’ve read and disliked. What I will say is this may be a book and series written for adults but I would like to clarify that further for potential readers: this is a book written for adults who like to read Young Adult Fantasy. Most older teenagers can handle reading it, and a good number of adults will enjoy it. But if you’re sitting on the fence I would recommend trying it for yourself—it’s one of those books that has the potential to surprise you.That’s all I’ve got for now. Anyways, off to go beg Bloomsbury for the sequel before it comes out in November February, like the newly-minted, reluctant Maas stan I am now.

In a year full of incredible releases this was easily in my top 3 most anticipated of 2021. Luckily my good friends Natalie and Carmen also got early copies, so we decided to read them together![image]live video of us readingBut before I begin this  I’m going to do a bit of a preface—If you are already a Silvia Moreno-Garcia fan then I’m sure you’ll love this. If the only work of hers you’re familiar with is Mexican Gothic then it may diverge from your expectations. While Mexican Gothic was a slow-burn gothic horror novel set in the 1950s, Velvet Was the Night is a crime noir that takes place in 1971 Mexico City. It’s not a thriller. There’s nothing paranormal. And if those are deal breakers then this might not be the book for you. One of the things I love about Moreno-Garcia’s writing, though, is that she never does the same thing twice. And for that reason it’s really difficult to anticipate what direction the story is going to take. Velvet Was the Night was an engrossing journey through a tumultuous period in Mexican history, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Before even the first chapter of the book, there’s a (real) telegram from the CIA describing a paramilitary group known as Los Halcones (the Hawks) and their actions as unofficial enforcers of the Mexican government. The Corpus Christi Massacre, or El Halconazo (The Hawk Strike), took place on June 10, 1971 in Mexico City. A group of students were protesting and marching when they were attacked by their own government in an effort to control and eliminate dissent from left-wing organizations. My own cursory research puts the death toll at almost 120 killed and hundreds more injured, but the exact number remains unknown. This event was part of a larger campaign known as the Mexican Dirty War, where the Mexican government, backed by the United States, waged an unofficial war on leftist students and guerrilla operations. Why am I telling you all of this? Well the majority of the novel is set after these events, but I feel as though having some background on the political climate at the time adds a lot of important context. When examining the choices that characters make you have to keep in mind that there was a current of fear surrounding even the suggestion of opposition, and that fear ended up being well warranted. [image]The story is split between alternating perspectives of two main characters. Maite is working as a secretary in a law firm, and feels content only when reading her favorite comic Secret Romance or listening to records from her extensive collection. She’s intentionally uninformed about current events in general until a favor she does for a neighbor thrusts her into the middle of a conflict she’s unprepared to navigate on her own. On the other hand, Elvis knows exactly what he’s signed up for. As a member of the Hawks, he was there for the bloodshed and is still dealing with the ramifications of his choices during it. Slowly, Silvia Moreno-Garcia weaves these two characters’ stories together, testing existing loyalties and building new alliances. There’s a moderate amount of action in this book, but a lot of it is sleuthing, inner-dialogue and tense character interactions. The story evolves as the characters wade into various shades of moral grey and I was genuinely shocked by a couple major twists at the end. But like I said earlier, this is not going to be a punchy, heart-pounding thriller. I’d say out of all of Moreno-Garcia’s books that I’ve read so far, it’s the closest in tone to Untamed Shore, which makes sense as it’s also a noir and set during the 1970s. Still, this book has a vibe all its own and I appreciated learning some of Mexico’s more recent history while being thoroughly entertained. I loved this book, and I think a lot of other readers are going to enjoy their time with it.*Thanks so much to Del Rey Books & Random House for an advance  copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,94,1,"May 02, 2021","May 13, 2021","Sep 27, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54746205-velvet-was-the-night

I suppose that’s my fault, because halfway through I went to re-read the synopsis and it turned out to be pretty faithful to the events of the novel. Suffice to say, I was expecting more action. What this was instead was essentially ‘super accounting’ with some mean-spirited pranks thrown in for good measure.I don’t think that’s necessarily a knock against the book. Natalie Zina Walschots writes with a lot of momentum and charisma. Her characters are interesting, even if some end up being a little flat. But I initially used a gif of Homelander from the Amazon Prime show The Boys and I don’t think that was an apt comparison at all. It wasn’t a comparison I came up with myself, but one that was used in some of the marketing material by the publisher. I just want to dispel any assumptions that might be made about Hench resembling something like The Boys or Watchmen so that people don’t go into this expecting one thing and then leave feeling disappointed.What Hench is very successful at is larger societal observations and critiques. There are parallels between the ‘Heroes’ and the damage and cost inflicted by, say, the military industrial complex. There’s commentary on the role of social media in spreading both information and misinformation, some of which may be applicable to the #MeToo movement. The way that the super-powered act with impunity and are glorified to the point of being worshipped resembles how law enforcement in this country are treated much the same way. It’s impressive the way Walschots is able to extract some of these finer points which are typically ignored in superhero stories.That said, the story itself was pretty mundane. A lot of time is spent analyzing data or trying to cause interpersonal conflicts between supers. For someone supposedly working for one of the great ‘Super Villains’, Anna’s antics are fairly benign. There’s also a substantial part spent going over her various injuries and healing time and procedures and physical therapy, etc. I just got bored when it felt like her story had stalled yet again. I understand this is probably one of the more realistic depictions of what a society with super-powered people would be like, but to be honest I didn’t go into a book like this hoping for someone struggling to pay medical bills or dealing with roommate drama. That’s just a little real for me, with not enough of the fantastical mixed in.I still think this is a good book, and I’d read more by the author. But I just don’t know if this is one that I would prioritize in an already bloated genre. The ending also gets unexpectedly gruesome in a way that was difficult to sit through. I don’t know, maybe someone who usually avoids the Marvel of it all or is just *deep* into the lore would enjoy this more. I just can’t stop thinking about some of those earlier Agents of Shield episodes where they had Phil Coulson with a broom and dustpan cleaning up whatever mess the Avengers had just made.

Of course we can’t be expected to let go of characters like Lila, Kell and Rhy just like that. So thankfully Victoria Schwab has written a trilogy of books (so far) in this color-coded London full of magic, intrigue and danger around every corner.My biggest complaint with A Darker Shade of Magic was how relatively small the story felt compared to the exciting world Schwab had created. It was a little too contained for me, and a big part of my four star rating was rooted in that. Well Victoria must have heard my feedback from the future and took what I, personally, said to heart because A Gathering of Shadows is *significantly* chonkier than its predecessor. (Also I’ve done a sneaky peeky at the third book, A Conjuring of Light and omg guys it’s HUGE. I’m pumped.)After following the enigmatic thief, Lila Bard, as she swashbuckles her way aboard the Night Spire, it doesn’t take long for her to feel the draw of the place where it all started for her. She’s just beginning to unlock the secrets of her own magic, but can’t resist the the pull of the one thing in the city she’s left behind: Kell Maresh. Kell on the other hand is feeling a push away from his home, really the only place he’s ever known outside of each of the London’s. He’s shouldering a lot of the blame for what happened at Rhy’s party and is dealing with the ramifications of their lives now being linked. Still, he can’t help but hope that the girl between worlds would make a reappearance in his again. I would compare this book’s turn in the series, both in tone and in structure, to the Triwizard Tournament and all the events immediately after, from The Series that Shall Not Be Named. The Essen Tasch is taking place in Red London, approximately four months after the events in book one. And here we see not only the capital city in Arnes, but beyond into neighboring countries within the ‘Red’ world, Faro and Vesk. Although I don’t really think this event amounted to much, it was a really clever way by Schwab to not only world-build, but to explain the nuances of their magic that wasn’t detailed fully in the previous novel. It propelled the plot forward in an exciting way and provided a lot of background and history without being a big information dump.I think A Gathering of Shadows is for the most part able to avoid the pitfalls of being the ‘middle child’ in a trilogy. The majority of its events are self-contained and it’s less like a stepping stone to a more important story than many other fantasy books I’ve read. That said, Schwab uses her first cliffhanger at the end, and it is a big one. I will credit her restraint in this regard because she hasn’t used this tactic in her previous books, but I am very thankful I have A Conjuring of Light here next to me, all ready to go. Recently my Schwablin Queen has also announced that she’s expanding the Shades of Magic world with a brand new trilogy staring all new characters. (Don’t worry, the old favorites will also appear, but won’t be the main characters.) But if you need your fix in the meantime, an anthology of stories by an assortment of great authors is available next month called A Universe of Wishes. The story that V.E. Schwab has submitted is entitled A Royal Affair and is about “beautiful beginnings and tragic end of the affair between Rhy Maresh and Alucard Emery, long before the events of the series unfolded.” I’m super excited to read this one although I’m sure it will be devestating!!!! ...more",Notes are private!,0,72,1,"Oct 26, 2020","Nov 07, 2020","Sep 21, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20764879-a-gathering-of-shadows

I did not find Anna K or Vronsky to be endearing as love interests or people. One scene with a homeless man in particular rubbed me the wrong way. Lolly and Steven were annoying and Kimmie’s self-actualization by the end did not ring true. Dustin was one of the only characters I liked, but I still felt a layer or two removed from him. I don’t know, maybe it was the writing style, but this did not feel as immersive to me as I think it could have been.The other kind of weird thing was the sex scenes written between teenagers. Some of them are young at that and not just their willingness to jump into bed, but also the sexual experiences themselves were bizarre. There’s simultaneous orgasms and perfectly choreographed seductions and other ridiculousness that I challenge anyone who was sexually active as a teenager to confirm as realistic. It’s not. Not even for super rich kids. Since this is a YA novel I feel like there’s an extra responsibility for authors to depict the lives of teenagers in not just a truthful way, but in a way that’s not going to negatively impact the younger readers’ perceptions of themselves and their relationships. You don’t need to sanitize the story and pretend teenagers don’t have sex, but maybe don’t promote the idea that the way to keep your cheating boyfriend interested is to immediately fuck him after you find out? One of the things I really liked about the story was the depiction of micro-aggressions among people who would likely think of themselves above the concept of racism. I can’t tell you how many people have made jokes or comments similar to the ones in Anna K around me and then gotten defensive once called out. Usually with a response akin to, “Uh my best friend is Asian and she doesn’t get offended when I say that so why do you??” Seeing the inner thoughts of Anna and Steven as they accept these words by people who are supposedly friends and peers of theirs as just part of their day-to-day lives is heartbreaking and an area where I think Lee really succeeds.There’s some more to this book than “A Love Story” would lead you to believe. Some of the heavy-hitting emotional plot points landed better for me than others. I realize this is a Gossip Girl-esq version of Anna Karenina, but that series and the show had the luxury of several seasons and books to develop it’s characters beyond their vapid exterior. In Anna K, it was hard to see them as anything besides spoiled, privileged teens who repeatedly behave like assholes without consequence. I’m open to reading more from Jenny Lee in the future, but to be honest that’s probably not going to include the sequel....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Sep 20, 2020","Sep 24, 2020","Sep 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45043369-anna-k

Jemisin’s work is in this trilogy. I don’t know that I’ve read a sci-fi/dystopian/fantasy that better understands the human condition than The Broken Earth trilogy does.We are back with Essun as she tries to either save or destroy the world, I don’t think anyone is sure which yet. She’s recently reunited with Alabaster, albeit not to his normal strength. He still has so much to teach her, but they are running out of time. The world is running out of time. All the characters we met and arrived with in Catstrima are still around, for now, but facing some new challenges. There’s even more exploration of what it means to be an orogene and how the obelisks are connected with their powers.The biggest difference between The Obelisk Gate and The Fifth Season is the inclusion of Nassun’s perspective. She was a character that was very much at the center of Essun’s journey in the first book, but one that we never actually got to meet. Not only do we catch up with what Nassun’s been doing in the mean time, but Jesimin gives us a full replay of what happened to her and her father, Jija, from the horrific event that spurred their departure from Tirimo to present day. But Nassun doesn’t just have to deal with her angry and temperamental father, but another figure, this one from her mother’s past, who’s intentions are difficult to discern. This is definitely a middle-of-a-trilogy book, but that doesn’t mean it still isn’t excellent. It has more character depth and world-building than most other books in a series do combined. The first one was mind-blowing for me, and I think it was better, but I won’t be marking this one down because it didn’t reach that level completely.

Maybe that’s a phrase you’ve heard before, but for me it namely means that most readers will not like it, but a segment of them will LOVE it. If you’re a Bestsellers reader, you probably won’t like this. If you’re a Book Club reader, you probably won’t like this. If you’re a Genre reader (fantasy, thriller, etc.) you probably won’t like this. Who will like this? Readers who do not mind wandering around aimlessly through the first 100 pages of a 250 page book. Also, most likely readers who enjoy the types of literary fiction that can be alienating to the average person. I’m not trying to be dismissive of these books, I read and like some of them! But I‘ll sheepishly admit that I sometimes feel like I’m too dumb to understand other ones, and I wonder if some are so abstract and inaccessible by design.So what’s the deal with Piranesi? Basically there’s a guy in tunnels? Or caves? That’s just incurably confused and doesn’t know it. He’s unreliable as a narrator, but he’s also extremely boring. The labyrinth he finds himself in is somewhat more interesting, but he spends most of his time studying tides or talking to birds, then writing it all down. Reading this was a good deal more frustrating than it was fascinating for me, unfortunately. I got about halfway and honestly did not want to keep reading. Yes, things are eventually uncovered and revealed, but the journey to get there was just nooooot worth it.I can’t remember reading a book so short that was also way too long. I saw someone mention this should be a novella—I fully support that! You could cut the length in half and essentially lose nothing important. I wish I had read the author’s other book so I could compare this to it, but I have not. And based off of the length of that one and how long this felt, I don’t know if I’m up for it. Additionally, Piranesi was compared to Madeline Miller—I do not see that comparison AT ALL. I loved Circe and The Song of Achilles and do not understand what the two have in common, except, maybe Clarke references Greek mythology? The writing styles are completely different.That said, Piranesi continues to have a really high rating on Goodreads, so who knows! Maybe check out some other s as there are plenty of positive ones to choose from. I’m sure Susanna Clarke is doing something very unique and probably clever here, but I’m just not clicking with it.

I’ll admit it took me a little bit to get into, but it eventually was able to find its groove. Yadriel is a teenager from a long line of brujx, those with the power to bridge the living world with the dead. After he and his cousin, Maritza, perform the coming-of-age ritual for brujos that’d been denied to Yadriel, they meet Julian, a recently departed spirit who’s in the dark about his own passing. Both boys have things they need to accomplish, one wanting to prove himself and the other unwilling to leave unfinished business, so they decide it’d be better to work together.I liked the Latinx cultural elements as well as the Trans rep with Yadriel. The brujx are an interesting way to bring paranormal aspects into the story and I enjoyed reading about Yadriel, Maritza and their family as they prepared for the Día de Muertos celebration. What I appreciated with Yadriel was that this wasn’t a story of him ‘struggling with his identity’; he firmly knows who he is. What Cemetery Boys depicts is Yadriel’s family struggling with it instead, and how their refusal to see him as he is negatively impacts him. Even at times when they don’t mean to be hurtful, they can still cause harm.This novel was also a refreshing way to approach death. Día de Muertos is probably responsible for that tone, as celebration of life rather than wallowing in death. I don’t think you have to necessarily believe in any kind of afterlife to appreciate this storyline, but if you do then you may find The Cemetery Boys to be a comforting way to remember those you’ve lost.In all, this was a good YA novel. It’s as intriguing as it is inclusive, and as an #OwnVoices book by a Trans and Latinx author, I don’t think you’re going to get a much more authentic story. Especially as a debut, I think Aiden Thomas did a great job writing interesting and layered characters, and I look forward to seeing how he grows as a writer.

The Nothing Man is going to be one oThis is a such a fresh take on a fairly familiar story, if you watch/read just about any True Crime or thrillers. The Nothing Man is going to be one of my favorite thrillers of the year, definitely in my top 3. I’ve pulled back from the genre after binging a slew of mediocre ones last year, and it’s probably helped me to enjoy the ones I have picked up that much more. Eve Black is The Girl Who, as in the girl who survived. The girl who lived while her family was murdered. The girl who is seeking not just answers, but justice. The Nothing Man killed her family 18 years ago when she was only 12, and now as an adult, Eve is ready to tell her story. And once that story hits shelves, it seems as though nobody is able to resist its enigmatic pull. Not even the man at the center of it.The Nothing Man is a book within a book. The title of Catherine Ryan Howard’s thrilling novel is the same as character Eve Black’s true crime account. The perspective flashes between Black’s words recounting her horrific memories & her search for the man responsible and that very man himself, reading and reliving his past crimes. It’s a chilling way to experience the story, and adds a thick layer of tension that’s incredibly difficult to pull away from. What’s so impressive about Howard’s writing here is the massive tone shift between Black and The Nothing Man as they recall the same traumatic events. The fictional book is a smart way to provide exposition and information in a way that doesn’t feel clunky, but the real hook is when we cut to the man himself, and witness his intense emotional reaction paired against the utter mundanity of his life. Even if she hadn’t been clear about The Nothing Man’s premise being inspired by real true crime book I'll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara, I think the comparison would have been an obvious one. I’ll Be Gone in the Dark is one of my absolute favorite books, and the one I credit with getting me back into reading several years ago. Michelle is the glue that holds that book together, injecting so much humanity into the examination of the crimes of a man who seems to have so little. Howard for her part brings the best of McNamara’s consideration for the victims of violent crimes over the usual grim obsession with their perpetrator. I think it would have been very easy to give that character perspective a voyeuristic tilt, but Howard holds firm against that kind of impulse.“These are no dark magicians. They have no special skills. People seem to forget we know their names because they got caught. In fact, the only remarkable thing about them is what they took from the world: their victims. It’s their names we should know.”I watched a great in interview with the author on Instagram Live, which is still available on @scaredstraightreads’s page. There Howard talks about not just her inspiration for the book, but society’s obsession with serial killers and true crime. It’s fascinating and another really great interview from Dennis, so if you’re interested I’d check it out! This book got amazing s from both Chelsea & Dennis, and I don’t really read a mystery or thriller these days without their recommendation. Listen to Mom & Dad, kids.

I was genuinely scared I’d fail at reading this the same way I did for my expedition into Dune. N.K. Jemisin is an absolute titan of the genre(s), though, and so many authors I love admire her in return. And while I was able to successfully read the first of the series, I don’t want to understate the immensity of this book and world. It’s a big venture to begin, but utterly worth it by the end. In the beginning, though, there can be a bit of a learning curve. It’s one of those books where not everything is explained right away, which means there isn’t a dump of boring exposition right off the bat, but you also just kind of have to go with it. The story alternates between three perspectives: Damaya, a young orogene who’s whisked away from her small comm by a Guardian to be trained, Syenite, a young woman of the Fulcrum sent on missions at their command and Essun, an 42 year-old mother who’s searching for her husband after he killed their son and kidnapped their daughter. Each character is grappling with their roles as part of a larger struggle for humanity’s survival. The Fifth Season takes place on a supercontinent referred to as The Stillness. This world is a harsh one, where every couple of centuries a catastrophic disaster takes place, which is called the Fifth Season. The season is the ecologically devastating result of climate change, though the people of the Stillness don’t seem to know the cause of it beyond that. In order to survive during these deadly periods, people have organized themselves into different ‘comms’ spread out over the continent. Among the humans, (sometimes called ‘stills’), live the orogenes, which is a race of people with the power to shape and shift the earth, if occasionally at a deadly cost. Humans have turned to Guardians to protect them from orogenes, who once discovering a child with orogeny, take them away to train into becoming tools of society, instead of as potential threats. That’s the idea, anyway. “Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall; Death is the fifth and master of all.”Though the world of The Fifth Season is thorough and expansive, there’s more here than just a science fiction/fantasy (it’s genre-bending like that) adventure. Jemisin is able to critique and analyze our own societies through the exploration of this fictional one. The topics of race, climate change, otherness, slavery and more can be observed without some of the personal biases we might bring into it. One of her strengths as a writer is in how applicable the truths garnered from examining the people of the Stillness can be to figures in the real world. This is a book that will stay with you for a long time. I’m going to be thinking about it all the way up until I read the next one in the trilogy, The Obelisk Gate. And afterwards, I’ll likely be thinking about that one as well.“When we say ‘the world has ended,’ it’s usually a lie, because the planet is just fine. But this is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends.

I actually finished this book yesterday for what it’s worth.I was a child in September, 2001, so I don’t remember specific rollbacks in privacy; I didn’t have any real privacy to speak of at that point. But I do remember the way the adults around me changed. Three months after having to stand up and say the pledge of allegiance again, in the middle of the school day on a random Tuesday, my school’s choir sang a song entitled “American Tears” about heroes and firefighters and pilgrims (?) to a gym full of sobbing parents and teachers. At the time I was like, ‘Wow we must be amazing singers.’ And while I would like to continue thinking that they were just blown away by my solo two-thirds through the song, the more likely and obvious conclusion is that they were reacting to the words themselves. We were in a stage of unflappable patriotism, a stage that has extended over the past 19 years.One of the more damaging things about this rise of hyper-aggressive patriotism is that we started to make allowances in our personal liberties that we would have never accepted pre-9/11. All the government had to do was mention “terrorism” or “national security” and they were given a legal hall pass to act in whatever way they pleased. And in a country where the the worst thing you could be accused of being was ‘unAmerican’, any criticism was headed off before it had a chance to be truly considered.This is the version of America that Edward Snowden came of age in. Like many others, he wanted to serve his country, because he assumed his country was serving its people. I was only somewhat familiar with him based off of the few news snippets I’d come across during the past 7 years and the trailer for the Joseph Gordon-Levitt movie Snowden from 2016 (I did not actually watch the film). But it was a Last Week Tonight with John Oliver story from 2015 that first gave me any background information about why Snowden did what he did. It’s been five years since that piece aired and I did go and rewatch it to see if the reporting holds up. It definitely does. ‘Government Surveillance’  A good amount of time is spent going over Snowden’s early years and the beginning of his career. He talks about his family, his personal life and relationships, just as much as he does explaining the interworking of the NSA and other government agencies. This is as intentional as it is necessary. I’m sure Snowden would have preferred to keep much of this personal information to himself, but unfortunately it’s not just his technical expertise that’s being judged here. One of the first things the government will do to discredit whistleblowers is to paint their actions as a deficit of character, by going after who they are as a person. If the public doesn’t trust the source of information because they believe he or she is working for their own selfish motivations, our leaders won’t have to address the validity of their claims at all. So there in lies the difficult task of trying to convince millions of people to like you, while being in exile in a hostile foreign country. I don’t want to get into too many specifics of Edward Snowden’s experience; it’s his story to tell. But the system of mass surveillance in the United States that has grown over the past 2 decades is inexcusable at best and sinister at worst. My only criticism of what he did isn’t related to the government at all, but how he kept his partner, Lindsay, in the dark during the whole ordeal. If he did indeed trust her, I feel as though depriving her of the decision and time to prepare herself for the incoming storm was unfair. Maybe not cruel in intent, but in effect. And for those outside of the US reading this, please know your country is likely allowing the same thing to happen to you. The UK, Canada, Australia, etc—you are also being surveilled. The end of Permanent Record does not let the reader get away with a proverbial shoulder shrug in response. This is a call to action not just in the vague ‘Vote!’ talking point that we’ve been beaten over the head with for the past year. Frankly, it was the Obama administration that continued Bush era surveillance programs and trapped Snowden abroad. Chelsea Manning was imprisoned for seven years under Obama as well. This isn’t as simple a solution as switching political parties. There needs to be radical change in the way people, companies and governments approach individual privacy, or we will continue to fall deeper and deeper into the surveillance state we’re currently living in.[image]A week ago courts struck down the NSA surveillance programs Edward Snowden exposed back in 2013 as illegal and unconstitutional.

I cannot adequately describe to you how much I needed this book right now, today, National Sandwich Day Election Day in the US. If you are American or live in a country even vaguely American-adjacent (that’s gotta be most of you, sry), you are probably also very anxious today. You may have even been anxious for many days, weeks, months—maybe years (four, exactly?? Who knows!).[image]I am right there with you friends. And if you are trying to quiet that sense of impending doom for exactly the amount of time it takes you to read 272 pages of a book, I can not recommend Lindy West’s Shit, Actually enough. I have been milking it for over a week, trying to retain my sanity, and it has mostly worked! In her first book, Shrill, West discussed her life, feminism, body-shaming and other topics that were Big News in May 2016 when the book came out. (ha! haha!! it all seems so quaint now~~) Then in her follow-up The Witches Are Coming, West went even more overtly into the politics of Trumpism, racism, sexism and All The Other Bad Things, in her signature comedic way. While these were the books I needed at the time, I think most of us are just trying to drag our limp, half-comatose bodies over the finish line today. For that reason, Shit, Actually is the perfect book for right now. Why? Because it’s about MOVIES! It’s funny! It’s written by someone smart and hilarious who has strong opinions about things that don’t matter. Here is a book where I can get in a heated comments section argument with someone about Bad Boys II and everything is still OKAY afterwards. I’ve been desperately craving something and it turns out that something is someone explaining to me with excessive punctuation why all popular Bro Movies™ are trash! And my god, Lindy West delivers.[image]I will now definitively rank the movies Lindy discusses in the book, which I have watched, so that even if you don’t read Shit, Actually (you should!!!!!!) we can argue about them in the comments anyways:The Lion KingForrest GumpTitanicHarry Potter The Series That Shall Not Be NamedTwilightThe FugitiveThe NotebookThe Shawshank Redemption Jurassic ParkHoney I Shrunk the KidsBack to the FutureAmerican PieThe Santa ClauseLove, Actually[image]And here are the ones mentioned that I have not watched but that sounded so dumb that it’s all but guaranteed I never will: Face/Off, Top Gun, Bad Boys II, Garden State, Terminator 2, Reality Bites, Speed.And ones that sounded kinda dumb but also kinda cool idk I’ll check to see if they’re on Netflix: The Rock, Rush Hour.In conclusion, I am completely in love with Lindy West. This is the perfect book and you all should write it in for the Goodreads Choice Awards in the Humor category! I’m allowed to campaign here, I’m at least 100 feet away from the polling location!!! (election day joke) Unfortunately, I guess Ms. West felt like she adequately roasted Adam Sandler in her other works, so there was no further commentary on his movies. :( Dear Lindy or Lindy’s publisher, if you’re reading this, please let her know that she can never write too much about Adam Sandler! There is no ceiling on the number of times you can dunk on him!!

I was lost for chunks of it—I must have amnesia of some sort because there are entire portions I blacked out during. And anything else that I remember was boring.

I’m very impressA fast-paced crime thriller that has just as much grit as it does heart, Winter Counts had me flying through the pages up to the end. I’m very impressed by this debut by David Heska Wanbli Weiden.Left with little recourse against injustice on their reservation, Virgil Wounded Horse is the man you call when seeking retribution. Wounded Horse is a Lakota man living on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota along with his teenaged nephew, Nathan. Virgil is a hired enforcer, a vigilante judge and jury that hands down sentences with his fists as opposed to throwing offenders behind bars. It’s a difficult way to make a living, so when the leader of his local tribal council makes him an offer to track down the lowlifes smuggling drugs onto their reservation, he’s not in much of a position to turn him down.I’m not usually one for a tough-guy main character that plays by his own rules, but for the most part I really liked Virgil. He reminded me of Bug Montage of Blacktop Wasteland in that way. He equally loves and is wary of his community, understanding what they’re up against but also knowing what they’re capable of. The members of his tribe view him in much the same way, with barely veiled contempt until they are in need of his services. Winter Counts cracks a window for non-Indigenous readers to see into a small sliver of what life on a reservation is like. You witness both things specific to this reservation and the Lakota people, as well as in a general sense for most ‘Native Americans’. The legal limbo was one aspect that is crucial to the story but probably will surprise most readers. Crimes committed on reservations are typically not prosecuted, by tribal police or federal agents. Reservations are also often the last to get resources, if they make it there at all, and then the residents are criticized for not ‘bootstrapping’ their way out of poverty. It’s a cycle the U.S. government seems unwilling and uninterested in addressing meaningfully.“Sadness is like an abandoned car left out in a field for good—it changes a little over the years, but doesn’t ever disappear. You may forget about it for a while, but it’s still there, rusting away, until you notice it again.”I won’t say too much more about the plot, but I really loved this book. I guessed a few of the big twists, but still had a good time as I sped towards the conclusion. I imagine this author is going to have a long and successful writing career in the future.

The e“Unfairness is a far more natural state in the world than fairness.”I knew going into this that Beartown was going to be a difficult one to top. The emotions were so raw, but vital, and you immediately fell in with the characters. I became invested in them. The storytelling was spectacular, with a dozen separate character threads all being pulled and woven together into something greater than its parts. A follow-up to that is always going to be a difficult thing to create. In many ways, I’d say Fredrik Backman succeeds in pulling it off. The story picks up right after the fallout of the events in the first novel. Kevin is out of the picture, but everyone else is still trying to carry on the best they can. Peter is desperately attempting to keep his team together, and Kira is left picking up the slack he’s left at home. Benji is figuring out who his is if he’s not Kevin Erdahl’s best friend. A new coach is brought in and the traditionalists in town struggle with change. Maya is shouldering not only her own trauma, but the pain of those around her, while Leo is acting out in frustration he’s not able to express.But I think where Backman falls short is with the balancing of all these character arcs along with the new ones he’s introduced. They just didn’t come together as naturally as they did in Beartown, so some of the conflict points feel heavily contrived. His use of foreshadowing of future tragedies didn’t land in the same way for me. Instead of inevitable, the eventual heartbreaks came off as boxes that needed to be checked. Of course it’s still sad, because you’re still invested in the characters, but it wasn’t the gut-punch I’d gotten in book one.And this extends beyond plot points. I really did not like the way several characters were handled in this book. (view spoiler)[Namely Ana, but also Vidar to an extent. Ana taking that picture of Benji and spreading it around was just completely out of character. I’m not surprised that Backman went with ‘forced outing’ as an extra layer of torment for Benji, but Ana doing the outing made no real sense. I cannot imagine any version of Ana, even one who’s “scorned”, acting that way. It feels like an unfair stereotype of young women, that when rejected they can’t contain their eMoTiOnS and have to act spitefully in response. Maybe Backman wanted to write her in a redemption arc? I’m not sure, but every bit of how that was handled, from the spurned lover angle to how Maya ‘figured it out’ to Benji telling Maya to forgive Ana and Maya just being like “oh okay” & their fight being immediately over, was so clumsy. As for Vidar, I hate when characters are introduced as literary ‘red shirts’ that serve no purpose beyond being expendable and eventually killed off. He didn’t get any character development that wasn’t ‘poor impulse control’ and ‘Ana’s boyfriend for 10 minutes’, but was apparently important enough a catalyst for everyone to quit fighting? After everything that’s happened to have it end with that felt really anti-climactic. I don’t really even want to talk about the crash because it was so FORCED that I’m just going to get mad. (hide spoiler)]“It’s so easy to get people to hate one another. That’s what makes love so impossible to understand. Hate is so simple that it always ought to win. It’s an uneven fight.”What I think Backman did really well was portray the tensions in a small town that is on the decline. They’re desperately clinging to what they have left, their hockey team, and it feels like the only thing in the world that matters. The slow burn and incrementally increasing levels of retaliation and violence was handled beautifully and was entirely palpable. The silences were just as wrought as the climaxes. I liked this book, but no, it’s not as good as Beartown. For my next Backman, I’ll probably be picking up Anxious People, as it’s a Six Spotlight pick and the perfect, radiant goddess Natalie has sent me an extra copy she had.

I’d been following Victoria Schwab on various social media platforms before finally picking up A Darker Shade of Magic. Even settling on this series to begin my Schwab-ification process wasn’t something I’d planned on, but it was a book that me and my buddies Madison, Natalie, Paige & Kristina all had access to but hadn’t read yet. That said, I feel as though this was a strong introduction to the works of Victoria Schwab. Or I should probably say V.E. Schwab, as that’s the name she publishes her adult books (such as this) under. The world-building is spectacular and vivid in a way that makes me feel as though I could open a door and step into it myself. The Shades of Magic trilogy begins in London. Kell is also from London, but not the London you know. He’s from Red London, which sits in the exact same geographic location as our London, Grey London, but in a world running parallel to it. Once long ago, there were doors between the four Londons: Red, Grey, White and Black, but now they are sealed. Only the Antari have the ability to move through the four parallel cities, of which Kell is one of the remaining few. During one of his excursions, one where things seem to have gone very, very wrong, Kell comes across Lila, an inhabitant of the magic-less Grey London. Though there appears to be no reason for them to meet one another, they are drawn together as a dark force threatens each of worlds they call home. I loved seeing the cities through their eyes, as someone accustomed to magic and someone unfamiliar with it. There are so many possibilities here, a new secret obscured around every corner.I do always have some sympathy for the first book in a series. So much groundwork has to be laid in addition to the added responsibility of hooking a reader for future books. As far as the set-up is concerned, Schwab hit it out of the park. I’m incredibly interested in reading more about the magic of the four Londons and finding out the rippling effects of the events in the first novel. Where this book didn’t quite reach its potential for me is in the plot itself. There’s certainly an action-packed climax at the end, but the first half is very slow-going. I almost wish there was another subplot going on so that the lulls in the narrative weren’t felt as much. And while I like Kell and Lila as characters, they are missing something for me. Perhaps a third member of the crew is needed to round out their more serious energy, or I just need some more depth from each of them. But so far they felt like ‘Grey‘ people, not the vibrant ‘Red’ from a world teeming with magic. Like I said earlier, I appreciate how much of a foundation this book is likely to be for the rest of the trilogy, but I wish there was just a little more going on in this one so I could have given it a full five stars.Now the only question is what do I read next?? The logical choice would be the next in the series, A Gathering of Shadows. But I have also heard amazing things about the Vicious series, so I kind of want to start that. And then The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue is coming out on October 6, which is coming up fast!

I’ve read pieces she’s done for various publications, I’ve seen interviews she’s given and I hang off her every word on Twitter (highly recommend following her, btw, she s books, people and [formerly] airlines.) In fact it was 10 days ago when she tweeted about Bad Feminist going into its 18th printing that I decided now was as good of a time as any to dive into her backlist. The main reason I think I haven’t read her books is that I don’t really do much nonfiction, and of those I do very few are essay collections. So I’m even more thankful that the audiobook version, read by Bahni Turpin, was available on Overdrive. Turpin does an excellent job capturing the tone I can imagine Gay using if she had done the narration herself. She brought the words to life and made it feel like a friend was just telling me a story instead of reading me an essay.Bad Feminist covers a variety of topics, most centering around feminism (duh), but also included are the intersectional parts of Gay’s identity and some more personal parts of her life. For example, there’s an essay on competitive Scrabble competitions, which I really enjoyed, even as someone who isn’t particularly good at the game. This essay is also where one of her infamous ‘nemeses’ is discussed, and as a very nosy person I am very interested in finding more out about these people.Additionally I loved the analyses of pop culture figures, including: Quentin Tarantino, Robin Thicke, Daniel Tosh, Tyler Perry and so on. Some of these were a little more relevant when the book was originally published in 2014, but plenty hold up exceptionally well. The movie The Help, based off of the book, has recently come under renewed scrutiny when it catapulted to the top of Netflix’s Trending page after the George Floyd protests. Gay’s examination of American culture’s obsession with the ‘White Savior’ narrative feels timely, but was in fact ahead of its time for most white people I know, myself included. The way these essays seem almost prophetic now only make me wish I had read this book years ago.But this book is not limited to just film s. Gay discusses more serious topics as well, from discrimination she’s faced as a black, female member of academia to her own experiences with sexual violence. As separate as any of these subjects seem, they’re all connected through the society that continuously enables them. Opening up honestly not just about the details of these assaults and slights, but the way she’s able to move through the world afterwards, I think will be helpful to a large number of people who have been through something similar. It won’t make any of it okay, but it might provide some hope or relief.Though these essays may appear to carry contradictions, that’s what in the end ties them all together. Gay is, like all of us, an imperfect feminist. But feminism doesn’t require perfection in order to be committed to the cause. It just requires some sense of self-reflection and a good amount of listening to those the movement has in the past ignored. Roxane Gay acknowledges her privilege, so we can too. She enjoys things she’s maybe ‘not supposed to’, so we can too. She speaks up when she sees injustice, so we should too....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Aug 10, 2020","Aug 15, 2020","Aug 10, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18813642-bad-feminist

Beartown is likely the exception instead of the rule here, which is a disappointment. But based off of a lot of the positive feedback it seems I’m in the minority with this opinion.I feel as though, stylistically, Anxious People tried too hard to walk the line between whimsy and emotional depth and ended up not succeeding with either. It got to the point where I would have to skim over the first paragraph of every chapter because he was so unnecessarily wordy. It just became so incredibly grating. If you haven’t read any of Fredrik Backman’s books before, here’s my impression of the beginning of a chapter: ‘The sky is blue. Though I suppose you could call it cobalt, even indigo on some days. Occasionally azure is thrown around, but nobody is quite sure why. But if we’re nitpicking, today it was probably more of a sapphire. Although, most people are not, picky I mean, and will simply refer to the sky as blue. That’s not to say anything one way or another about these people, but is does make one wonder why that is. Why do some see the world in shades of blue, but when others look upward they merely gaze into a monochromatic abyss?Anyways, Doug drowned in the periwinkle sea.’The portions that were supposed to be emotional ended up falling flat, mostly because all of the characters were intentionally obnoxious and aggravating. My god, I have never cared less what happened to a fictional group of people. Tragic backstories were doled out one after the other to try to make you empathize with them. Each irritating member of this ensemble was also in turn revealed to be ‘like super deep and introspective, actually!’ and I couldn’t help but roll my eyes at the lame one-liner set-ups.I think the author did pull off a couple of good twists, and he’s really skilled at using the reader’s assumptions against them. But in all, I don’t think this is my kind of book. Everything’s a little too idiosyncratic, and it all wraps up a little too nicely. But if you’re looking for a vague sense of hope or whatever, I think you might still enjoy Anxious People.*Thanks to Natalie for this  copy!! ...more",Notes are private!,1,223,1,"Sep 15, 2020","Sep 29, 2020","Aug 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49127718-anxious-people

I was in the middle of reading Ikenga when the news broke about Chadwick Boseman’s death. He was an invaluable part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and was the hero of so many kids, especially black kids, all over the world. So going back into this story after learning of the sudden ending of his was difficult, if I’m being completely honest. But it was also cathartic, in a way. Ikenga is a middle grade book about a 12 year-old boy in Nigeria who’s father, the former police chief of their town, Kalaria, has recently been killed. Nnamdi is passed down magical powers that he doesn’t fully understand, but he still tries to carry on his father’s legacy and protect his town. The themes of this book carry the emotional weight of it. Nnamdi and his best friend, Chioma, grapple with grief, friendship and a thirst for justice. Nnamdi in particular struggles to control his feelings of anger at the loss of his father and all the injustices he’s had to put up with since. When he suddenly has all of this strength and power, what is going to do with it? Will he hold himself to a higher standard, or will he succumb to his urge to seek vengeance?As always, Nnedi Okorafor is such an evocative writer, conveying the world built in her head vividly out onto the page. As many comparisons can be made between this and Black Panther, I also think this book would be great for kids who are fans of Spider-Man. Especially in the way the story is more localized, with Nnamdi trying to protect his town, there’s a lot of overlap between his motivations and those of a character like Peter Parker. But really I can’t think of anyone who I wouldn’t suggest this book to.

I didn’t really plan to read it, but I have bully friends who said they wouldn’t read Six of Crows if I didn’t read this one, so here we are. There’s many reasons I didn’t like A Court of Thorns and Roses, most of which I had figured would be issues for me before picking it up, but I guess you don’t know until you know.[image]I was expecting this to be about horny fairies and I.......was not wrong. The entire plot feels like an elaborate setup for a few drawn-out sex scenes, which is fine, I guess. That isn’t normally something that interests me, but I know plenty of people who like that type of thing. But a lot of it was, frankly, goofy. “I was moaning his name when he sheathed himself inside me in a powerful, low thrust that had me splintering around him.” Girl, OW! My vagina just shuddered. I do not want to be splintered, what the hell?? Someone who reads a lot of romance/erotica might be able to help me out here—is this normal prose? Please advise, thank you. I also had a similar issue with Feyre that I did with Celaena Sardothien. Sarah J. Maas heroines simply can’t exist unless there are ‘worse’ women to compare themselves too. Feyre’s sisters, Nesta and Elain, filled that role here. (ALSO SHE WROTE IN A BOOK kdjfjfkjshdkdkfhdh blasphemy.) In fact, all human characters that are not the Practically Perfect in Every Way main character are some combination of dumb, mean or useless. The fairies are pretty one dimensional as well. They have one personality trait, occasionally also with a tragic backstory to help you get over the shitty way they behave. It didn’t work; I hated them all.Going back to the flimsy premise, that’s probably the point when I first hopped off board. Nothing really makes sense, even for fantasy, if you think about it for more than five seconds. One of my least favorite fantasy tropes, which I’ve called ‘captive in luxury’ in the past, is on full display here. This happens to Feyre multiple times just in this book. She’s taken against her will by an evil-but-dreamy royal stand-in who she hates but then, idk starts to think is kind of a babe? and then is supplied with countless excuses to why, um, it’s actually *okay* that she’s kidnapped. She gets bubblebaths and dessert? Everyday??? Yeah everything’s cool now, thanks. [image]I know this is supposed to be a Beauty and the Beast retelling, but besides having a ‘beast’ and roses tacked on as an afterthought, it hardly resembles the (already creepy enough) original fairy tale at all. If anything, this struck me as a Twilight fan fiction. And the last third is part Vampire Diaries as well. I can already predict the romantic subplot for the next books: Oooooh which gaslighting abuser will she choose?!? Tough call, they’ve both threatened to kill her and sexually exploited her! She’ll probably have to flip a coin?Also as an aside: did Maas make the ‘Ireland’ of this universe the vicious, cruel invaders????? That’s not actually something she did, right?? Please tell me nobody is that dense. Plenty more I could say, but I don’t think that’d be particularly productive. If you like Maas’ other books, like the Throne of Glass series or House of Earth and Blood, you’ll probably enjoy this one too. She has a writing style that’s very readable and characters that absolutely enrage me, but she’s also one of the most successful in the genre so what do I know. I’m not planning on continuing the series, even if the second one is “so much better”. If you’re looking for another fae fantasy series, I’d recommend The Cruel Prince before this one. The new covers are pretty though...more",Notes are private!,0,105,1,"Aug 02, 2020","Aug 13, 2020","Aug 02, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54386622-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses

This is probably my favorite type of sub-genre to read: a character-driven novel with and underlying mystery. I just really like the discovery of long-held secrets while slowly uncovering information about each character. And the mystery element running through the entirety of the plot keeps me unable to stop turning the page. The book is about, obviously, The Death of Vivek Oji, a character living in modern day Nigeria. There’s flashbacks from all points of his life, from birth until his death, as well as the present after he’s died. The author takes us backwards then forwards then back again only to finish where it all started. If I felt like I knew what happened to Vivek, a new line would appear and snatch away my assuredness. Akwaeke Emezi is a beautiful writer. I’ve wanted to read their book Freshwater for some time, so I guess I’m going to have to do that sooner rather than later. There’s plenty of people who like to read books set in far-off countries as a means of ‘escape’. This is not going to be that kind of novel. Nigeria is as much like the United States or any other ‘western’ country in the ways that influence the story. Meaning, what happened to Vivek, the kind of life he lived, could have happened anywhere. The location and culture Emezi describes just adds another layer to the touching story they’re telling. I do feel like I’m in Nigeria while I’m reading, but not like I’m on vacation.The Death of Vivek Oji was a journey of love, loss and absolution. So much of what, not just Vivek, but the rest of the characters go through is thoroughly heartbreaking. The examination of the LGBTQ+ experience, especially in a very patriarchal society, is masterfully handled by Emezi. One of the truest things I think this novel makes clear is that people who fall under that umbrella are not a new invention, and there is no place on this Earth where they don’t exist. And pretending otherwise doesn’t make that any less true, it just makes it more dangerous for everyone involved.Thank you to Natalie at @bookreadreceipts for sending me this book!

I’m a vengeful spirit who gets her power from hating things that everyone else loves. But the truth is I fucking loved this book. Damn it. Now I’m going to have to read everything Fredrik Backman has written while all my friends and acquaintances comment “I told you so” until I die. And probably even after that. Anyways, I listened to the audiobook and really enjoyed it. I don’t think I’ve listened to anything read by Marin Ireland before but she’s exceptional. She expresses so much nuance and cadence in the voices of the characters; I’m really hoping she’s done more of Backman’s books.I want to write a useful , but truly I went in blind and I think that’s the best way to do it. The minimal information I’ll provide: it’s set in the fictional community of Beartown, Sweden, the story follows this town’s hockey team and it’s probably the most gutting thing I’ve read in a long time. Holy shit, it was just bang, bang, bang—one right after the other. Backman is such an incredible writer. He doesn’t only capture the culture and subtleties of a small town, but also the wider extent of human nature itself. He just gets people. You don’t have to know anything about Sweden or hockey to get into this. If you swapped out those two things for somewhere in the southern US and football the book would still work. I think part of what makes this novel so impactful is that it transcends its very specific setting and is instead a more universal story. There’s really nobody I wouldn’t recommend Beartown to. It almost makes me want to call up all the hockey players I knew in school and send them a copy.

Amelia Unabridged wears its heart on its sleeve, and though I breezed through it I can see why so many people have fallen head over heels for Amelia and co.For me the first quarter or so is the strongest portion of the novel. That initial gut-punch was extremely well done, which is why I don’t understand why the publisher decided to include it as a spoiler in the synopsis, of all places. If you haven’t read that yet and don’t know what I’m talking about, then I’d recommend not looking it up!The back half of the book is focused on a quirky romance between two people in their late teens. They bond over shared traumas and a love of storytelling, which as a theme is practically catnip to YA Contemporary readers who’d normally be drawn to a story like this. The romance is sweet, if a little corny and predictable, but I say that about a lot of books in this genre, so if you’re typically a fan don’t take my word for it!I found the premise of how Amelia actually *goes* to Michigan (where the majority of the story is set) to be a stretch. She is handed money, freedom and almost a suspicious amount of random kindness from total strangers to chase down something that is pretty far-fetched, if I’m being honest. That transition from where she begins in Texas and where the author wants the story to end up needed some more consideration. A lot of Amelia Unabridged feels like it’s trying to be a Bridge to Terabithia type of fantastical without actually making the jump into full-on fantasy, and putting further thought into that early plot development would have given the story more credibility to build upon. Schumacher’s writing, though, is really good. There’s plenty of memorable lines and even the sad bits have the potential to uplift and buoy you. The characters’ thoughts and musings take on a lyrical quality, which isn’t surprising since they are all big readers and writers. I liked this book well enough, even though it wasn’t as affecting for me in the way a lot of other s have described.

And for the most part, that has been a good thing. I’ve really got to hand it to Rebecca Roanhorse here, she’s crafted an explosive start to a series set in a time and place not normally seen in this genre. Consider me thoroughly impressed. The first book in the Between the Earth and Sky trilogy, Black Sun begins with a brutal opening scene that sets the tone for the rest of the book. The story picks up several years later following Xiala, a rogue Teek ship captain with a chip on her shoulder and not much left to lose. As she sets out again on a near impossible mission, we watch as her and the paths of the three other POV characters start to move together towards Convergence.Serapio, a formerly scarred boy, but no longer scared, Naranpa, the Sun Priest who wants to prove herself worthy of her station, Okoa, a young man trying to preserve his clan as best he can and Xiala are all working towards the same event during the winter solstice in Tova, even if they don’t know it yet. There’s adventure and betrayal on the high seas, cunning palace intrigue behind closed doors and a lot of untapped magic just waiting to be put to use. So much is going on in Black Sun that it’s a triumph in and of itself that Roanhorse is able to tie it all together.That said, I do think the ending was a little rushed, where so much is unresolved. I won’t know if that was the best ending point in the story until the next book is released, but I do feel like I was left hanging somewhat. There’s so many questions left and though some are probably left that way intentionally, I wonder if I just maybe missed a few resolutions on my first read through while trying to get to the ending. Maybe I’ll try a re-read before the second book comes out.Either way this was an excellent start to a series from my first experience reading this author! I believe she has a short story in an anthology I’m about to read, but I’m very interested in picking up more from her. And for anyone who’s looking for more diversity in their fantasy, Black Sun has some of the more inclusive characters I’ve come across, especially when it comes to LGBTQ+ characters.

He’s divorced with an adult daughter, doing well at his job but feeling the burnout. He’s wondering if it’s time to move on to something else, maybe try to meet someone new and settle into a different sort of life. In walks Diane Alison, who’s in a similar place herself. The only difference between Alex and other men his age is that his job falls on the wrong side of the law. Namely, he’s a thief—and a damn good one at that. Just coming off of a big job in Vegas, when Alex meets Diane the attraction is instant and undeniable. The two are swept away on a trip to Mexico, where the secrets they’ve been holding back threaten to upend everything. And though Alex wants to retire, he soon finds out that getting out of the game is far more complicated than getting into it. Love and Theft is full of adrenaline and glamour. It’s basically a blockbuster action movie in book form. It’s a lot of fun, and the locations Parish describes in Mexico and Europe are lush and evocative.

I guess that’s both somewhat true and sarcastic, because Station Eleven did have an uptick in interest last year, likely *because* of what people were going through at that time, not despite it. Personally I could have put off reading this indefinitely if HBO hadn’t decided to release a limited series based on the book. But you all know the drill—new adaptation out, so I’m suddenly interested in reading the book that’s been on my TBR for years.[image]It’s a normal winter night in New York City. Snow is falling, there’s a stage production of King Lear staring a fading Hollywood actor. As he suddenly starts slurring his words and crumpling over on himself while on stage, a man leaps up from the audience to try to save his life. A helpless audience looks on. A young girl is crying offstage. And still the fake snow continues to fall.Meanwhile a deadly contagion is spreading too fast for people to process what is happening until it’s already too late. Most of the world’s human population is wiped out in weeks, and everywhere civilization stops functioning. But twenty years later, humanity still grinds on. We’re following the Traveling Symphony as they move their caravan around the former United States, performing Shakespeare to the remaining small settlements. Despite everything lost, the Symphony refuses to cease living.Because this is a Emily St. John Mandel book, we know a few things are going to happen. There will be jumps in time, altering locations and shifts in perspective. There’s quite a bit of time spent on the old Hollywood actor’s life pre-pandemic, perhaps a little too much for what the story ended up being. Location also plays such a big role in the novel, not just because of shared roots between the characters, but because of how crucial proximity was in the lead up to the collapse. And if there’s one thing that Mandel is going to do, it’s give all of the characters secret connections to each other. Everyone is related, in one way or another, and these relationships are revealed slowly throughout the duration of the book. So in a sense, a lot of the story is predictable. I was able to figure out a big reveal pretty early on by calculating the age(s) of the respective characters. We know that most people die from or after the Georgia Flu, based on what is learned from the flash-forwards. But still somehow Station Eleven feels wholly disconcerting. There’s always the sense that something even more disastrous is just waiting around the corner, the other shoe that has not yet dropped. You fall into the panic and fear in those first few days, even knowing it’s all for naught, but desperately hoping nonetheless. [image]Then in the future chapters you experience those same places as almost an alien visitor. Despite how our own pandemic has impacted us, there’s something truly haunted about seeing the shells of peoples’ former lives left gathering dust or scavenged for parts. Those post-apocalyptic moments are some of the novel’s strongest. It’s a new world built on an old one; a quiet devastation interrupted with intermittent bursts of both human violence and kindness.So it’s with the rest of the book—the hyper-fixation on irrelevant characters, the lamentation on the importance of Shakespeare, specifically—that kept me from devouring this work completely. Some of the characters’ connections feel…incomplete. There were a few full-circle moments that I feel like she missed, whether intentionally or not, that could have pushed this novel from good to great for me. And passing over “The First Year” as something too traumatic to revisit seemed more like an aversion by the author, like she was too hesitant to get into the details of that period of time. Based on the trailer for the Station Eleven TV show, I feel as though I’m going to like what they did with that portion better. I think there’s a lot of room to improve upon the book, but hope none of its emotional punches are pulled for the sake of the viewer’s comfort level. There’s some ruins that we need to witness in order to fully understand what’s at stake.**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,98,1,"Dec 04, 2021","Dec 11, 2021","Jul 13, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20170404-station-eleven

Some portions have been edited for clarity or to remove identifying information.Dear potential reader,I agree with what some other ers have said, that there’s a moral responsibility for people who have power to do right with that power. I also understand the feeling of helplessness when reading these stories. I’d guess that’s a pretty common reaction, one that leads to the emotional responses so many people have had towards the book, like sadness and anger.There seems to be a disconnect in where those ers think the power in these relationship lies. Perhaps I just know more about the process Helena took in finding and speaking with the individuals in the book because I’ve put more time into researching its background. But I’ve got my copy of Craigslist Confessional right here and I’ve re-read the introduction. She goes through every step of how the project started, the ways she made sure the subject was comfortable, giving them control over their own words. She gave them the option to still be listened to even if they didn’t want their stories shared or recorded. The ball is entirely in their court.But I feel like the most important component of these conversations is the fact that they’re anonymous. That’s why people responded when they saw her ad on Craigslist. I understand that while reading you may want to help those that are struggling, I feel the same way—but that’s not what they asked for. These are people that just want to be heard. They wanted to vent to a stranger, and maybe let their stories be spread around so they can reach other people, people who might be feeling similarly alone. They did not want their name attached. And if any of them decided to identify themselves and ask the public for help, I have no doubt Helena would be the first one to step up and assist them. They want someone to listen and understand, and they want us to want to do something about it. But asking for nominal amounts to be provided to people who’ve shared their stories is not going to help in any meaningful way. You know what would help Steve, the man with Schizophrenia? Comprehensive healthcare coverage in the United States. And Lucas, who spent 15 years in prison on an erroneous drug charge? He doesn’t want five cents per copy sold, he wants his life back. But he also might settle for criminal justice reform.Honestly this level of scrutiny of an author’s intent just baffles me. Do you truly believe a person trying to nefariously profit off of “the misfortune of others” would listen to hundreds of people recount their pains and traumas day after day just to earn a not-so-quick buck? If I wrote a biography about Queen Elizabeth, would I have to send her a check for the sake of “morality”? What if I was a journalist writing on the exact same topic? Nonfiction is different from fiction. Its not made up from the author’s imagination and there’s always going to be a real, factual subject or topic. With this logic, who has the right to write about anything? And for what it’s worth, nonfiction books, including this one, go through several legal s which would vet both the methods and results of the project in question, by experts with much more experience than us in these matters. The point of this book isn’t to “make a big difference” in the lives of the subjects. If someone’s interested in making financial contributions to people in need, they can check out GoFundMe. But sending thank you notes does nothing for the people in the book and goes against their wishes to speak to the author once and then never have to meet again. More than anything else those suggestions sound like ways to make the reader feel more comfortable without having to interrogate themselves thoroughly. Yeah it sucks we live in a society that lets so many people fall through the cracks, so this book is and should be treated like the wake-up call that many of us need to finally address these problems. Personally, I don’t find that “worthless”.I didn’t intend on this being so long, but I felt inclined to speak about some things that had been glossed over in other s and their comment sections. I can’t say why some ers decided to delete half a dozen comments, including one of mine, and leave so many others that are far less constructive with some being downright spiteful. But it comes off as massively hypocritical to delete comments that disagree with you and leave ones that affirm you, while also claiming everyone has the right to their opinion. Lastly, I do know the author’s donated profits to multiple organizations. But I think it’s ridiculous to demand someone prove that they’re giving money to charities. It reeks of performative activism. I would probably be less interested in reading a book where the author brought up they were donating whatever portion of the proceeds because it would seem like a marketing ploy. If you still at this point doubt Helena’s character and intentions, I’d like to link you to some of the Instagram takeovers she’s done where she’s talked about her book: @bostonbookfanatic, @downtogetthefictionon, @kraysbookclub, @momandmadreads. They should be one of the first highlights on their profiles.And what‘s been said about power, I do believe that. But there’s power in having a large platform on a site like this too. As negative and slanderous s have gotten more attention and their words, suggesting the author “mixed and matched” facts or otherwise took advantage of the people she‘s spoken to, are seen by more people, please consider what that will mean for a debut author that’s only ever tried to help people. And potential reader, I hope that you do decide to pick up this book and see for yourself. If you do, pay special attention to story #40 if you want to understand why so many of us feel the urge to passionately defend a person we’ve never met.Thanks for your time,Elle...more",Notes are private!,0,112,1,"Jul 23, 2020","Aug 02, 2020","Jul 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52765639-craigslist-confessional

But despite this book not being written for me, specifically, I believe there’s still a lot that can’t be learned from the author’s words and experiences.“The spectrum of our traumas can be as broad as our identities.”Johnson’s stated goal in All Boys Aren’t Blue is to offer some guidance to kids navigating an LGBTQ+ and/or black identity in America right now. He wants to be a lifeline to those that feel isolated because of who they are or how they feel; one he didn’t have access to growing up. In order to achieve this he shares memories and stories from his own life. Some are funny, others are painful, but each is 100% candid. I was impressed with how open he was in bearing his scars to the world, and I appreciated how he shared even the most intimate pieces of himself.There’s a rawness in Johnson’s storytelling that I think will reach most people who pick up this book. I’d recommend it to not just teenagers going through something similar, but to the adults around them. Johnson has an incredibly understanding and loving family, and that’s something that I’m sure would be beneficial for a number of parents to listen and learn from. *Audiobook (narrated by the author) is currently available for for free on Hoopla*...more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Jul 09, 2020","Jul 13, 2020","Jul 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44280883-all-boys-aren-t-blue

But not only was Brit Bennett’s sophomore novel both a GMA and Barnes & Noble book club pick, it set off a 17-way bidding war between different networks before the adaptation rights went to HBO in a seven-figure deal.A lot of that has to do with Bennett’s beautiful writing. She transports the reader to a not-so-distant era, where we follow the Vignes twins, Estella and Desiree, two light-skinned girls from a small town in Louisiana. They witness horrors as children and learn to grow up by leaning on one another. Eventually they go their separate ways, with Stella now passing as white, while Desiree continues to identify as Black. Their lives, once so entangled, are now almost completely separate entities. And they seem to inhabit two very different worlds.This book also came out in early June, which made its perspectives on race all the more timely. The author is great at documenting micro-aggressions and just full on aggressive-aggressions. It’s likely difficult for many white readers to see some of their own previous behavior reflected back at us so starkly. But the story of Stella and Desiree isn’t just about racism against the Black community, but also a thorough examination of colorism and what it means to be ‘white’ and ‘black’ in America. The privileges afforded to one of two identical women and not the other, all based on someone’s subjective perception, was an utterly fascinating premise to begin your story at.Part of me can see why this book is so popular; the characters have extensive depth and it’s easy to take sides or form opinions on them. Some of these stances may change over time, but by that point the emotional connection is already there—you’re hooked. Bennett is wonderful writer; she can breathe life into even some of the more mundane aspects of a character’s day-to-day life. And maybe that’s why it took me so long to finish this. The circumstances that Stella and Desiree are born into and live through are probably some of the most compelling I’ve come across in fiction in recent memory. And I can’t help but feel like The Vanishing Half didn’t live up to that potential. So very little *happens* in this book that when I got to the end I felt let down. I’ve read and liked books that don’t have much plot to speak of, but never one that’s felt so passive. Once I started reading I would get into it, but it was never something I was drawn back too—I was always pulled towards something else I was reading that seemed more interesting.It’s still a good book, and one I think a lot of people would enjoy. I appreciated the look at mother-daughter relationships, how they can grow, like sisters do, to compliment one another. It’s hard to know where you end and she begins.

For some reason when I first saw the cover I assumed it was historical fiction? Maybe that’s because it features a silhouette of a woman in a long(ish) dress, and that’s basically the period-drama cover template.Thankfully it’s not historical, Saving Ruby King is a work of contemporary YA fiction set in modern day Chicago. Though it’s been tagged as a Thriller, if you’re looking for a traditional whodunnit you’ll probably be disappointed. You’ll find plenty of mysteries and secrets revealed throughout, some you’ll be able to guess and some you won’t, but this novel derives its power from the tension and emotional stakes at play between the characters, not jump scares and cheap thrills.One of the biggest themes present is the idea of generational trauma. It’s passed down from parent to child and can feel predestined at times, like there’s no breaking free. When a place is so heavily surveilled and policed, like Chicago’s south and west sides, members of that community are more reluctant to report and speak up when something is wrong or amiss. That can lead to internalizing that silence and suffering through abuses nobody should have to endure. What you’re left with is a heartbreaking cycle and that’s reinforced on both an interpersonal level and an institutional one.“What goes on in your house stays in your house.”I ended up really liking the roving perspectives given to us by Catherine Adel West. At first, I wanted nothing to do with hearing from Lebanon. Honestly, I thought the moral of the book was going to be ‘all men are trash and who needs them’ which would have been accurate based on the ones in this story! I didn’t think he, or even Jackson to an extent, added anything to the book. But eventually I came around to it. You won’t get the same well-rounded narrative without hearing from everyone involved; even the church itself has a point of view worth exploring.

I normally don’t think much of the comp titles that marketing departments like to toss out there to help sell books, but the two from the synopsis, Sorry to Bother You and The Wolf of Wall Street were pitch-perfect to me!I’ve seen some complaints about how this book is over the top and to those readers I say......that’s kind of the point. This is a satirical novel. It’s also about a topic that’s likely to be uncomfortable for the average white person to explore. Black Buck is not supposed to be a ‘realistic’ depiction, true to life in every single way, but I think that people who operate outside the world Mateo Askaripour is discussing would be surprised to learn how much is pulled from real life examples. As for the story, it’s a little all over the place for me. I felt like I read multiple books back-to-back as opposed to one cohesive narrative. Black Buck is broken down into five parts, and where a couple feel like natural breaks in the story, others feel like a complete departure. I don’t want to put spoilers in this , but there are some pivotal moments in the main character’s life that really change the dynamic of the story Askaripour is trying to tell, and not always for the better. Sometimes I think he struggled with exactly what this book was trying to be, and instead of making some difficult cuts he decided to just include everything. I also didn’t love the ending. Not because it was bleak or I didn’t appreciate the point the author was trying to make, but because it didn’t feel as well thought out as the rest of the book. It features a character introduced at the eleventh hour as a mustache-twirling villain instead of letting the natural consequences of Buck’s actions lead him to that conclusion. I just think there was a way to accomplish the same things without cheapening the effect. As a whole, though, I did like the book. The narrator of the audio version, Zeno Robinson, really brought the story to life. I’d recommend the audiobook to anyone who might be interested! And I’d recommend the book itself to anyone who’s interested in reading a searing debut about the intersection between the business world and race in America. *Thanks to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt & Netgalley for an advance copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,"Jan 29, 2021","Feb 06, 2021","Jun 21, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53091994-black-buck

It’s basically a compulsion at this point; I had no choice. The first in the Killing Eve series is Codename: Villanelle, novella that explores how the two titular characters, Eve and Villanelle, found their way to their current occupations and eventually crossed paths. It’s the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Villanelle as an elusive assassin and Eve the agent tasked with tracking her down. But by the end of the book we’re left wondering, who is really hunting who here?I haven’t started the show yet, but I can only imagine what Phoebe Waller-Bridge (the brilliant writer/actor behind Fleabag) will have brought to the source material. Frankly, I think there’s some room for improvement in Villanelle, especially around her sexuality. She’s a psychopath, so there’s room for some artistic interpretation, but the way she speaks about sex and her body is so clearly written by a man. She’s hyper-aware of her body the way that men assume all women are. Shes incurably horny but....doesn’t get anything out of it? It’s not so much the amount of sex Villanelle has (which honestly could be a whole other conversation), but the way it’s discussed. In all, though, this isn’t a bad start to a series. It’s a little dry and slow at times, which is odd considering it’s a novella, therefore already shorter in length, but there’s still some good action sequences.

Stamped From the Beginning is almost 600 pages chronicling the beginning and evolution of racist ideas in America. I decided to listen to this audiobook after almost the entirety of Bookstagram picked it as a group read. It is currently still available to borrow through Hoopla, for anyone interested, and I can’t recommend it enough. “Racist ideas always seem to arrive right on time to dress up the ugly economic and political exploitation of African people.”The book itself is split into 5 parts, each with their own ‘guide’, usually a person speaking against racism during that period of time, in whatever form that takes. The five guides are Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois and Angela Davis. Some of those names may be familiar and some might not be. Each historical figure introduced Is scrutinized through an anti-racist lens, even if that means we as readers have to challenge what we have previously believed about that person. Nearly all of them, save Angela Davis, have contradictions in both their words and beliefs. In re-learning about these figures, it’s important to not whitewash history into something more palatable for white people to consume.The main point Ibram X. Kendi hits on is the difference between three consistent, yet ever changing groups of Americans: the segregationists, the assimilationists and the anti-racists. One of the more difficult things I found reading this book was having to identify which of my previously held beliefs fell into either of the first two categories. Perpetuating racist ideas that may seem positive or complimentary just add another layer of racial bias that will have to be scraped off later.“Hate and ignorance have not driven the history of racist ideas in America. Racist policies have driven the history of racist ideas in America.“There’s a lot of nonfiction books about racism getting attention right now. The one thing I would suggest is to pick one by a black author. There’s no reason why White Fragility should be the title dominating the NYT bestseller list other than white people are more comfortable listening to the words of a white woman on the subject of racism over the voices of black writers. This isn’t the time to avoid uncomfortable conversations.

Literally from the first chapter this book went off like a firecracker and never let up. Beauregard Montage might be the most inherently badass character I’ve ever come across while reading, all in a way that doesn’t feel contrived by the author. I’ve been lamenting lately that the Thriller genre has been too homogenous, and I know I’m not the only one who feels that way. Blacktop Wasteland is a crime thriller that’s full of memorable characters, intensity and a whole lot of heart-racing action. The novel follows Beauregard, a former notorious getaway driver, as he’s tried to settle into the quiet life with his family. Through circumstances both within and outside of his control, he finds himself in constantly escalating situations that put the life he’s built in danger. The world he’s left behind is not for the light-hearted. It’s harsh and ruthless and left me audibly gasping multiple times. Not everyone is cut out for that type of environment. The tone is set right away; you’ll know if this is a book you’d like by the end of chapter one. As a character, Bug’s strength has an quiet quality to it—understated until it isn’t. He’s easy to identify with and there’s a good amount of second-hand catharsis whenever he catches up with those who did him wrong.[image]Literally BeauregardI also liked that Beau didn’t try to hide what was happening from his wife, Kia. He wasn’t necessarily forthcoming and didn’t go into detail, but I feel like that’s more because she didn’t want to know specifics. Any questions she had, he more or less answered. I fully expected him to just lie to her face about both the heist and what Javon did, but was pleasantly surprised when he told her immediately. The one thing I wish S.A. Cosby did differently is give Kia a little more to do in this story. She’s the loving but no-nonsense wife who ‘worries about him’. Her and the kids’ role is reduced to being liabilities that Beauregard needs to protect. I honestly think this book would struggle to pass the Bechdel Test.In all, though, I absolutely loved this. It’s well-plotted and paced and totally captivating. Natalie (@bookreadreciepts) and I did this as a buddy read, and even her stingy butt gave it 5 stars!

They stir up complex feelings that I can’t really articulate and maybe don’t even fully understand yet. Jesmyn Ward is such an evocative writer and one of the best in her field. There’s not a word out a place; every paragraph is finely crafted perfection.The story centers on Esch, a 15 year-old girl living in Bois Sauvage, Mississippi, with her three brothers and father. Salvage the Bones follows their lives in the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina, and ends right after the storm has. There’s a lot at play here. Esch’s family experiences the common tragedy of American poverty. You can see this disparity in their respective preparations for the hurricane. Only the people who have the means to flee do; the rest are forced to hunker down and try to bear it. One of the most affecting things about the characters in this novel is how their community comes together in difficult circumstances. It’s tough not to be moved during those interactions.Esch’s brothers love her, but fail to see a direct line between how they and their friends treat girls and how their sister is then treated. In some senses, after their mother died they also lost their father. Yes he’s alive, but much of the responsibilities seem to fall onto the oldest (Randall) and the only girl (Esch). This is not going to be a book for everyone, but that’s alright. There isn’t a ton that ‘happens’ in the first half to two-thirds or so outside of China, Skeetah’s pit bull, having puppies and everything associated with that. It’s a lot of character development where things left unsaid end up hitting you the hardest. I don’t think I’ll read another book like this until I pick up Ward’s follow-up, Sing, Unburied, Sing.Also—apparently Jesmyn Ward only got $20k for this?

Diane Guerrero was only 30 when this books was was published back inNormally I don’t think I’d be interested in reading a memoir by someone so young. Diane Guerrero was only 30 when this books was was published back in 2016, but she has experienced more in her childhood, teenage years and 20s than most of us will in our whole lives. I’ve read some celebrity memoirs that have just been very....bland. They all begin to run together at some point. Guerrero’s story is as unique as she is, though some elements of it are all too familiar.After her parents are deported when she’s 14, Diane is on her own. The United States government was persistent in its attempts to expel her mother, father and brother from this country, but apparently couldn’t spare a thought for the minor left without a guardian. No agency checks on her, none calls—it’s like she’s invisible to them. This is the part of the story most going into the book know about already, but that doesn’t make it any easier to read. It’s heartbreaking and devastating. The fear that loomed over the Guerrero’s never seemed to go away, and it’s relegated countless families like theirs to living in the shadows of American society.Written in conjunction with Michelle Burford, this book takes on an exceedingly casual cadence. Diane comes off as she does in real life: funny, personable, like someone you’d want to be friends with. The structure was interesting. Some information is withheld, (view spoiler)[like the self-harm (hide spoiler)], so it feels like you’ve gotten the air knocked out of you once it’s revealed. Every chapter seems to end with a cliffhanger, kind of like a true crime series right before it goes to commercial. I don’t think it needed the extra element of drama; there’s enough tension to engage readers on its own.When talking about growing up and going to school, Guerrero seems unsympathetic to some of her classmates. While pointing out times that the system failed her, specifically, she’s simultaneously calling kids in just as difficult situations “smart-mouth punks”, as if a few sarcastic eighth graders is what’s held her school back. It’s hardly other 12 and 13-year-olds who are to blame, and I wish she wouldn’t keep deriding them as “ghetto”. I also feel like she’s dismissive of her family members outside of her and her father. Though as an adult she does reflect on how she treated her mother unfairly, Guerrero doesn’t seem to understand why her brother might be acting out against a step-father who has made it clear multiple times he’s not going to treat his stepson and his daughter the same. And it doesn’t end there for Eric; his parents treat him differently, but so does the country both he and Diane grew up in. She’s an American citizen and he is not. Her options are limited, yes, but his are virtually nonexistent. He’s not simply being ‘lazy’. He’s had his wings clipped, but then has to watch his friends and little sister move past him in life and take opportunities he will never get. That’s absolutely demoralizing.That said, the beginning is filled with sweet memories of Diane and her family, as she grows up in New England. Though there isn’t any part of her life left untouched by the US immigration system, this is more than an immigration story. It’s about a young woman trying to find her path, and constantly failing to. There’s a lot that Diane goes through that I think plenty of people will be able to relate to. The way in which she succeeds in the end, by landing her career-launching role as Maritza Ramos in Orange Is the New Black, feels like a triumph for everyone following along....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jun 21, 2020","Jun 28, 2020","Jun 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41150411-in-the-country-we-love

In a series that has consistently knocked the wind out of me, I know I shouldn’t be surprised that its grand finale has left me an empty void of emotion, but I’m in complete shock right now. Rebecca Kuang you utterly brilliant bastard, I hate how much I love you and your work.[image]This has been the year where so many of my favorite series have ended. The Daevabad Trilogy, The Arc of Scythe and now The Poppy War. But unlike some other authors, Kuang refuses to give her readers a neat and tidy resolution. Every victory comes at enormous cost, the edges jagged and torn instead of a cleanly cut. The world of The Burning God remains as unflinchingly brutal as her previous books, but just as beautifully crafted as well.What I love most about this series is how harsh it is. And I don’t just mean violence and death, though there is plenty of that. God help the poor soul who goes into this series expecting a fun YA Fantasy, for whatever reason. But that harshness is in the story itself, not just the means of achieving various military goals. So much of writing, especially in fantasy, has to revolve around plotting. Creating problems for your characters to face is infinitely easier than actually solving them. It’s why a TV series like Lost or Game of Thrones can begin so amazingly and then completely fall apart at the end. You try to come up with the perfect solution to a complex set of problems without one, and inevitably end up failing to fully address any of them.There’s a temptation to try and ‘do it all’: achieve a hero’s journey, provide complete redemption arcs, pay off fan service, etc. But in that it’s easy to lose what makes a story like this special in the first place, the willingness to be honest with your readers about the reality of most wars and conflicts. If you are looking for a series that gives you a feeling of resolution or catharsis, I’d suggest looking elsewhere. The Poppy War is a trilogy for those not seeking satisfaction, but truth. And the truth is that war may make for some great stories and legacies, but it fucking sucks to live through, whether you’re fighting or not. And it affects people unevenly based on class, gender, age, race, socio-economic status and proximity. It’s hard to fit all of that in a catchy battle anthem, though.The pace of this book is one that mimics that reality as well. There’s a series of stops and starts, battles that happen quickly and bloody aftermaths that seem to linger. And just when it feels like things might be starting to stabilize the ground starts immediately shifting underneath your feet and you’re knocked off balance yet again. The perilousness of the natural & political environment that the characters are trying to navigate just highlights further how young, inexperienced and unstable those leading these military assignments are. It’s a constant reminder that Rin and even Kitay are not infallible, but traumatized soldiers just out of their teens, trying to struggle through a conflict that predates their involvement. They are but another chapter in a long, wrought history, and far from the final one.I don’t know where this one ranks compared to the other two books. I don’t think anything will compare to the initial devastation I felt after reading The Poppy War. And the way The Dragon Republic sideswiped me near the end was just so well done. I think what I felt most from this book was the consequences. The Burning God is the eventuality that nobody should be shocked by but will inevitably feel like a kick in the gut. Made even more impactful because all of the pain and suffering is not manufactured but realistic. I’m looking forward to the book Kuang is currently working on, a complete departure from this series, which will center around dark academia. Inspired by her time at Cambridge and Oxford, I’m very interested to see what she’s able to reveal under the harsh light in which she prefers to write.

And after the brilliance that was Ten Thousand Doors of January, there was no way I wasn’t going to pick up Alix Harrow’s sophomore novel. I’ll bring the hemlock if you bring the thistleseed, ladies!![image]Taking place at the tail end of the 19th century, we meet the Eastwood sisters: Beatrice, Agnes and James (or Belladonna, Amaranth and Juniper, if you prefer). After years separated, they find themselves drawn towards one another, despite some of their best efforts otherwise. Underneath the surface of the town of New Salem, women are organizing to obtain the right to vote, but there’s also something more nefarious at play. Even the shadows seem to have eyes, and it’s difficult to rally support when the town seems to be in an escalating state of fear.“That’s all magic is, really: the space between what you have and what you need.”I loved Harrow’s use of magic in this book. She’s able to incorporate domestic necessities without reducing ‘women’s magic’ to the patriarchal ideas of ‘women’s work’. Yes, women & witches can mend a tear in your blouse, but they can also lead a revolution. Once and Future Witches uses alternating perspectives of the three Eastwood sisters. Their personalities are not only distinct from one another, but they also differ in the ‘type’ of woman each represents. Namely, the mother, the maiden and the crone (this one in particular makes me wince because she’s supposedly in her 20s????).The memories of the previous witch trials in Old Salem hasn’t faded from the town’s collective memory, and there appears to be an enemy who will do anything to smoke out those responsible for trying to bring the magic back. I really enjoyed this story conceptually, but my one criticism is that it just seems unnecessarily long. I’m not asking for a YA pacing—I fully understand that this, like January is an adult novel. But I felt like parts of the story dragged when they shouldn’t have. There’s too much good stuff here for me to be counting the number of pages I have left!Additionally I liked the inclusion of those who the women’s movement has historically left behind. This includes black women, poor women, sex workers and people in the LGBTQ+ community. The established organizations for women’s suffrage were almost entirely rich, white women and the author made clear that it was that way by design. Instead of accepting these prejudices, the women turned away created their own spaces to fight for their interests, both in the book and in real life. (view spoiler)[Though we get only glimpses behind the curtain at some of these spaces, I saw Alix Harrow talking on Twitter with an #ownvoices author about writing a sister novel focusing on The Daughters of Tituba AND I REALLY HOPE SHE WAS NOT JOKING!!! (hide spoiler)]In total, though, congrats to Ms. Harrow for a successful follow-up! The story is unique and compelling with a lot of elements I could not have seen coming.

I’m still planning to make it to the end of this series, despite its flaws. There’s a lot of build-up, and I’m just hoping it amounts to something epic by the end. We pick up with Geralt recovering from some pretty serious injuries, though it isn’t long before everyone’s back in the swing of things. I guess I’ve just got to accept that Andrzej Sapkowski will keep jumping around without explaining who or what is happening until well into the scene. His style is ‘confusing the hell out of the reader’ and that’s that. Maybe this is just my bias after reading those first two short story collections, but Geralt and Dandelion gallivanting around without hunting monsters is not as fun as it used to be. Thankfully there’s a little bit of monstering *as a treat*, albeit not as much as I would want. The pair end up picking up some companions on their quest to find Ciri, and I think this is probably the best gang of ruffians they’ve traveled with thus far. I really liked Milva in particular. Though every time so far it’s been, ‘Oh cool, a new female character that’s not at all sexually interested in Geralt and.....oh never mind she’s naked now.’ I’m eternally grateful that she ended up being the one to finally break that trend.(view spoiler)[ The wading into abortion conversation was weird. So each male character got to give a rousing speech about being pro-choice and then...they throw the abortion medication away? And 10 days if being bedridden is excessive; it’s more like 2-3 days of varying amounts of discomfort, with the pregnancy passing within hours of taking the second pill. And despite not having sex during the events of the novel, Milva is still sexualized in the end. Seriously, Andrzej, not every female character has to devolve to a struggle to overcome a ‘woman problem’. (hide spoiler)]As for the missing princess, she falls in with a new crowd and is pretty much separate from her guardians the entire time. I liked The Rats subplot just because it mixed stuff up a bit. Do I want them to be a sustaining part of the series? Probably not, but I appreciate what this change of lifestyle does for Ciri’s character. The sorceresses continue to be the best part of these books. Yes, I enjoy Geralt, have come around on Dandelion and I like most of the minor characters they interact with along the way, but their journeys always seem so directionless. I don’t know why Sapkowski insists on making me wait so long for Yennefer to appear time and time again. Her and Ciri are the highlights, and I always want to find out what they’re up to.I’m kind of disappointed the first real LGBTQ rep in the Witcher saga is so problematic. That ‘relationship’ Ciri has with another female character is coerced and predatory, and I’m bothered by the fact the author doesn’t acknowledge it. Is she even attracted to women? There’s no way of knowing at this point. I can only assume that Andrzej Sapkowski, the guy who sprinkles sexual violence (or at least the threat of it) into nearly every interaction a woman has with a man, has kept Ciri’s “vIrTuE” in tact up until this point intentionally. So why give that up for an adult (or near-adult) preying on a lost, 13-year-old girl, where there’s a major power imbalance at play, among a whole bunch of other shit? The sole conclusion I can draw is that he doesn’t see this as exploitative, and that’s pretty chilling.The only other complaint I have is that the constant politicking went on for too long and kept making me zone out. But I loved the Elven lore and I’ve decided the best way to get exposition out of the way is with a dozen terrifying sorceresses sitting around a table and explaining who-married-and-birthed-who hundreds of years prior.

As easily as she can sweep you away, McDaniel can yank you suddenly back into your body.Betty follows the life of Betty Carpenter and her family as she grows up in the fictional town of Breathed, Ohio. Her father, Landon, is Cherokee and her mother, Alka is white. Every significant moment in their lives from the time the two of them meet until the final pages of the book is documented by their youngest daughter, Betty, as she learns about who she is and what her place is in the world. Most of these lessons are hard, made harder by the time and location she resides in. But they are also made easier by the fortifying nature of some of her family members and ancestors. This is not a story of family drama but one of family trauma. It’s also the story of all the beautiful things that grow in the cracks between them. In the Carpenters, we watch as the scars of one generation are passed on to the next. It can be hard to reconcile when a person unloads that pain onto someone they’re supposed to love unconditionally.

I didn’t know what to expect from A Door Between Us. As a debut, there weren’t any other books by the author I could compare it against. All I really knew was the setting and backdrop: the aftermath of the 2009 Iranian election. The Green Wave or Green Movement was completely new information to me; I had never heard of it before. For anyone else who’s going into this book without much background knowledge or that’s unfamiliar with Iranian customs, I’m happy to report that you do not need any of that before beginning. Sadr weaves history and context into any situation that calls for it, so there won’t be any frantic Googling to understand what’s happened. The novel starts at the wedding of Sarah to her husband, Ali. Tensions have been bubbling in the months leading up to it, and they eventually spill over during the ceremony. Ali’s sister, Azar, and her husband, Ibrahim, are actively speaking against an authoritarian government, while Sarah’s family are loyalists to the current leadership. Her cousin, Sadegh, is even a member of the Baseej, a state-sanctioned policing force that is known for operating outside of the law.Iran is a country that almost every American ‘knows‘, but without actually knowing much of anything about. What we know is that they’re a country that the US has almost constant friction with. The mindset that we’re the good guys and they’re the bad guys is a hard one to break out of. But part of what struck me the most in this book was how, well, familiar a lot of the conflicts felt. The protesting against a corrupt regime, political disagreements tearing families apart, so much of what I read about Iran in 2009 echos what’s happening in the US in 2020. The Hojjati family, in particular, is so reminiscent of nearly every conservative religious family I’ve encountered, regardless of faith. They were an incredibly frustrating group of people to follow. There’s of course the members of the family who are true-believers in whatever the cause may be, but then there are those who somehow think that these topics have nothing to do with them. They are so insulated from the realities of the world that they assume by just keeping to themselves and not speaking up, they’ll magically be immune to its effects. There are no bystanders in a revolution. By not ‘choosing a side’, they are in fact supporting those currently in power.Eventually, though, everyone is pulled into a high-stakes chain of events that can’t be deterred. Family ties and loyalties are tested, and not everyone makes it through to fight another day. The pacing is taut. Though not a thriller, there’s ample tension and action. I felt anxious for characters who were suddenly thrust into a dangerous situation. It wasn’t lost on me that these characters, though fictional, are likely rooted in the experiences of real people.I think with A Door Between Us, Ehsaneh Sadr succeeds in her goal. Bombing Iran doesn’t hurt the people that our leaders think it does. That show of violence only reinforces the narrative of the Iranian government—that all Americans want to do is destroy them. Hopefully by better understanding one another, there may be more opportunities in the future to heal and move forward.*Thanks to Blackstone Publishing & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,"Aug 18, 2020","Sep 02, 2020","May 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51375623-a-door-between-us

It also features one of the most compelling opening sequences I’ve read from literary fiction in quite a while. Within the Nasr family we follow the three adult children, Ava, Mimi and Naj, as they attempt to wrangle their bickering parents during a family trip to Lebanon. Each are dealing with struggles within their own separate lives while also navigating their place in such a, let’s say, ~colorful~ family. Then about a third of the way into the book, the narrative suddenly shifts and we are focused on a young Mazna, their mother, in the times before, during and after meeting their father. This is probably the most heart-wrenching portion of the book, with a hefty amount of pages devoted to Manza’s story specifically. No spoilers, but damn. She really couldn’t catch a break, could she? It was admittedly not easy to read through ordeal after ordeal that Manza had to go through, how even when she had a choice she was essentially deciding between ‘bad’ and ‘slightly less bad’. And it was while reading her section that I had a revelation: I do not like most of these characters.There is not one male character (save for a distinct exception (view spoiler)[Zakaria (hide spoiler)]) that I felt an ounce of sympathy for. Idris, Mimi, and literally every dude Manza comes across—I hate them! They suck so hard. I wish them the worst. The kids in general were just way less interesting than I was expecting their plot lines to be. Naj is clearly the best of them, but the bar isn’t particularly high. Even Idris’ extended family I could take or leave. The order I would rank my empathy for each character would be:1. Zakaria2. Zakaria’s family3. Mazna—end of list—Obviously you don’t have to like characters you’re reading about, but you should care about what happens to them. And all I kept thinking while reading about this family is how privileged they were relative to literally every other person around them. Idris’ family growing up were rich and shielded from the worst of the conflict in the region. The kids have the textbook definition of First World Problems. And in my opinion, Idris himself made out like a fucking bandit. (view spoiler)[Also yes Idris, you killed your best friend. Mazna was never yours, and you never bothered to ask her how she felt, so in the end you actually stole her from your dead friend. Your dead friend who’s mother still lives in the camps while you whine about wanting to sell your second home. (hide spoiler)]The ending wasn’t what I was hoping for either. With all of the deft ways Hala Alyan demonstrated her characters’ privilege and ignorance, I was hoping they’d come to atone more for their past complicity. Specifically, (view spoiler)[they should have given Zakaria’s mom the Lebanon house (hide spoiler)]. By all means, this is beautifully written, if only somewhat too long, and the setting was stunningly rendered. Though if I read more by the author, I think I would prefer following a different kind of character.*Thanks to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt & Netgalley for an advance copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Dec 16, 2021","Dec 28, 2021","May 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48930261-the-arsonists-city

I don’t think anyone is ever really going to be “ready” for this kind of patriarchal bitchslap, though, so I’m just gonna wade into it.[image]I’d also like to take a moment to apologize to my Kindle, which I shook, tossed and slammed in frustration so often whilst reading that it’s probably going to take out a restraining order against me. I didn’t know so much unspoken fury could live in such a small book. It’s not even 200 pages.This novella starts at the end, where we meet Kim Jiyoung as an adult. She’s married and has a young daughter, but is slowly losing her mind. We observe her from an outside perspective, through whispered discussions between her husband and in-laws. Then the story takes us back to the beginning, when Jiyoung was born in 1982. Following her from childhood, through adolescence into adulthood, what’s striking isn’t how distinct or special she is, but how ordinary. Her life, with all of its mundane injustices, is instantly recognizable to every woman that’s reading. They’re Korean characters in a Korean setting, but much of the experiences are universal.“The world had changed a great deal, but the little rules, contracts and customs had not, which meant the world hadn’t actually changed at all.”I feel like if I tried to summarize all of the things this book touched on, this  would be longer than the text itself. But suffice to say that Kim Jiyoung, and the women she represents, have had the decks stacked against them from the beginning. From the first moments of her life, where her mother apologized to her mother-in-law for having a daughter, to the subtle and blatant ways boys were coddled and favored while girls were shoved into the background in childhood, is it really any wonder what kind of adults they became?It’s positively sinister what we convince ourselves is normal. What we convince ourselves we want and choose, as if the societal expectations put on us from birth aren’t nudging us one way or another. It makes me angry and it makes me sad. Worst of all it makes me doubt my own feelings and motivations. This type of realization has the potential to be completely debilitating. And the fact that Jiyoung would be only ten years older than me is seriously fucking with my head. This isn’t a Black Mirror episode, this isn’t a dystopian futuristic novel; it’s here and now.Honestly, the most devastating part for me was the footnotes. Any time the author referenced a statistic about Korean gender imbalance, she attached the relevant study. It’s one thing to cite these numbers, but the inclusion of the data to back them up just reinforces their stark existence. Plus, I can’t help but wonder if she felt compelled to do so because she expected male readers to doubt her words and experiences. Women don’t really need to have these facts proven to us; we’ve lived them.My favorite thing about this book was how much it pissed people off. The controversy it stirred in Korea when first published just demonstrates how much discussions on these topics are overdue. As of 2016, South Korea was the worst ‘developed’ nation to be a working woman. (And btw, this isn’t an opportunity to dunk on another country for being ‘worse’ at something than us, because it’s not like America is known for it’s generous parental leave policy.) Famous Korean women who said they read the book were lobbed with criticism, while their male counterparts mostly escaped scrutiny. The actress cast as Jiyoung in the movie adaptation was bombarded with hate online. By trying to rebuff critique, the misogynist parts of society only succeeded in proving Cho Nam-Joo’s points.Like that article on The Lily that’s been circulating the past couple of days has pointed out, most of the onus for maintaining the status quo falls on the men who let it happen. Whether it’s Ginetta Sagan, “Silence in the face of injustice is complicity with the oppressor”, or Lizzo, “Why men great ‘til they gotta be great?”, it’s clear these aren’t cases of isolated ignorance—it‘s systemic and widespread. Men need to speak up for women when it matters, even when nobody else is watching.Basically, listen to Rihanna:[image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,238,1,"May 22, 2020","May 24, 2020","May 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46041199-kim-jiyoung-born-1982

(I KNOW, I’m SORRY) So I’m probably not the person to go to for a thoughtful comparison of your works, but I don’t know if there’s one out there more infamous and synonymous with your name and brand than IT. For even those who have never picked up one of your novels or have avoided the terrifying adaptions of them, who hasn’t at least heard of the ravenous murder clown living up in Maine?“There are things here in Derry that bite.”This book is vastly intimidating for a number of reasons: its size, its villain(s), the evocation of childhood fears in the adults who read it, etc. I think what gave me the most apprehension, though, was the fact that it’s also famously.....weird. Probably beyond weird, it’s really, really insensitive and offensive at several points. The (view spoiler)[child orgy (hide spoiler)] is the one I knew about beforehand, but it’s not like King was super-chill in the thousand pages leading up to that. There’s pretty liberal usage of homophobic and racists slurs, which may be explainable based on context. But even in something like Richie’s ‘p*******ny’ impression, which he continues to do as an adult in the 1980s (same era IT was written), I had to wonder, how is it possible such a ‘woke’ literary giant gets so much so wrong? Beep beep, I guess.Though I don’t want to make it seem like I didn’t enjoy this book. I was rapt. I started reading it, then switched to Stephen Weber’s audiobook version and he did an amazing job. He nails not only Pennywise, but Bill’s stutter and Richie’s various impressions. I seriously might go look up some other audiobooks he’s done because of how well he voiced this complicated cast of characters. And, of course, King has such an addictive writing style. He’s truly the ‘king’ (heh) of just one more chapter. Do I wish he had a more ruthless editor? Yes. The point has been made that a good amount of the stuff here would not be present today and honestly? The book would be better for it.“We lie best when we lie to ourselves.”Besides the copious n-words, King’s commentary on racism during the 20th century is fairly impressive, especially when you consider he wrote it 3 1/2 decades ago. This even in a northern state like Maine, where I’m sure his neighbors would have preferred he not be quite so candid about its sordid history. There’s really no topic he shies away from, for better or for worse. Wondering where else it’s for worse? When he talks about fat people. He just really seems to hate them. The amount of mocking and dissecting of fatness in his characters is really jarring. Reading this was kind of like playing derogatory pinball.And I’ve put it off as long as possible, but what the fuck is Stephen King doing sexualizing Beverly at every conceivable point? My god, man, SHE IS ELEVEN. STOP TREATING PRE-PUBESCENT TEENAGED GIRLS LIKE THIS. IT IS NOT NECESSARY. (view spoiler)[Also, this doesn’t start and end with the boys taking turns (have their balls even dropped??) on their good friend Bev in the sewer, but I was flabbergasted to see her just offer herself up to them. What is that even trying to prove????? We’re supposed to believe an eleven-year-old came up with that on her own, like, ‘Hey guys, I have the BEST idea for how to make y’all remember this shit!’ Fuck that, it’s the creation of a man who’s brain is short-circuiting on stimulants. It’s bizarre and inexcusable and now I understand why everyone who’s read this before me had said, “Yeah.....just pretend that part didn’t happen.” Okay—I will TRY. (hide spoiler)]And even more of a spoiler-y discussion:(view spoiler)[Why is Beverly the only adult who is still completely debilitated by her trauma? Why does she go from abusive father to abusive husband while everyone else lives mostly contentedly? And not just the abuse, why is he given credit for ‘making her’ what she is in present day? Ben, Bill and Richie get to own their talents and Bev’s is obscured by the looming figure of Tom in her life. Maybe you can argue that Eddie is repeating patterns with the ‘marrying your mother’ trope, but that’s hardly oppression as much as a choice that’s been (for the most part) positive for him. Perhaps if King had done more than simply wink at his potential sexuality, and Eddie had been confirmed as gay or bisexual, it could be the case that he was suffering as a closeted man as an adult. Still not the same, but more substantial. Also of note, Mike is the one who is left behind in Derry. He does not get to thrive in the world the way the others do and is left to shoulder that responsibility alone. This, at least, makes some narrative sense, and I’m not going to say otherwise. But it’s hard to ignore the only female character and the only black character getting the short end of the stick while all five white boys in the group are allowed to self-actualize before returning home. Different times, indeed. (hide spoiler)] So, why is this still 4 stars for me? Because the rest of it is that captivating. The way King has woven these characters’ childhood fears together with their adulthood ones is brilliant. The story is iconic for a reason. Like I mentioned before, I don’t know what the ‘best’ book of his is, but this feels like one that will give you a bit of everything.

Some of the biggest accounts were singing its praises, and well, I’m very susceptible to contagious enthusiasm. Even after reading the description and tons of s, though, this book was still not at all what I expected.For one, I (probably wrongly) assumed that to be a thriller someone has to be murdered or missing or be pursued in some manner. Pretty Things more than likely falls in the suspense genre, which the author has agreed with in some of the interviews I’ve read and watched. There’s surprises and a lot of intrigue, enough to where Nicole Kidman’s production company has optioned the novel for an adaptation. Still, for every unexpected twist, there’s another one you can see coming a mile away.It also does feel a little bloated, mostly in the first half. It’s a lot of backstory where not much happens and I felt like I was trudging through it. The two narrators, Nina and Vanessa, provide dueling perspectives on the same interactions, and I definitely skimmed over a number of those parts. Some of it felt like a rehash and enough about each character probably could have been inferred without all the narration. Additionally, the plot didn’t end up being as nefarious as I thought it would be, but maybe that says more about me than about Pretty Things.That said, I’m very excited for the adaptation. Janelle Brown is a really great writer and I’m hopeful this will have some Big Little Lies vibes on the screen.

Lo used to have parents too, but they’re gone as well. Lo used to have a family, and probably even used to be happy, but that part of her life is done now. Barely past her childhood and out on her own, Lo relies on herself alone—the only person she could ever count on to be there. “Having a sister is a promise no one but the two of you can make—and no one but the two of you can break.”Though she still has one living relative in upstate New York, Lo has long considered her sister a lost cause. Bea joined The Unity Project six years ago and nobody has heard from her since. Lo has tried to her best to put that ache behind her, until a man appears like a bolt of lightning before her, claiming to know things about the elusive Unity Project and its founder, Lev Warren. This could be Lo’s only chance to reach her estranged sister, and to finally get answers to why Bea walked away from her and never looked back. And so she takes it.Cults have long been a source of morbid fascination for much of the population, myself included. What is it that turns people, who seem perfectly normal otherwise, into hollowed out versions of their prior selves? What is the process that causes a person to willingly yield their free thought and will? Why can they not see the strings so clearly being pulled on their behalf, being positioned like marionettes by some greater force? If it’s baffling and frustrating for those of us who are only observing from afar, I can only imagine how someone watching a loved one succumb to that kind of malignant influence feels.This is a large part of what Summers focuses on in this novel: the how of a cult personality and community. It’s a good amount of slow-burn groundwork being laid to help the reader feel invested in not only the relationship between Bea and Lo, but in their respective ties to Lev & The Unity Project. The story is told in flashbacks to the time Bea is first recruited and then to Lo in present day (2018). As the two timelines converge we see how each of the sisters, independently from one another, fall victim to the same tactics deployed by a looming manipulative leader. In classic Summers style, the story breaks into a sprint near the end, thrusting the reader head-first into some dark and menacing truths that we probably should have seen coming all along.As far as the audience goes, The Project would probably be classified as more New Adult than YA, but Courtney Summers has always blurred that line between what’s specifically for adults, young adults and teens. And since New Adult is not a popular or even widely-known genre (at least in the US), I am glad she’s found a comfortable place to write without arbitrary constraints at a YA imprint (Wednesday Books). Whatever age the protagonist may be, this is a book that I believe transcends past traditional genre restraints and will be an attainable read for people of all ages.Thanks again to Jordan (@jordys.book.club) & Carrie (@bostonbookfanatic) for having me and Natalie on board for December!

The Searcher was one of my most anticipated books of the year, and I’m so relieved that it has lived up to most of those expectations. Is it as good as her famous Dublin Murder Squad series? I mean, no, those books are on another level in my opinion. But this was a well-paced, suspenseful novel with a backdrop in a rural, small Irish town—something right up French’s alley.So if you’re looking for a typical up-tempo thriller, you’re likely to be disappointed with this. The start is slow, but with something itching at the sides of your vision. Something you just can’t shake, but don’t know what it is. It’s a type of menacing that’s like the cold in Ardnakelty, Ireland—it sneaks up on you.Cal Hooper is a former American detective from Chicago, Illinois. After putting in 25 years on the CPD and a difficult divorce, he decides to relocate to a rundown shack in Western Ireland and fix it up as a retirement project. It doesn’t take long for him to notice something amiss in this receding village, and his instincts won’t allow him to ignore it for long. I read in a couple of interviews with the author where she said this is her take on a Western, which I definitely see. It’s more rooted in a movie I hadn’t heard of before, The Searchers from 1956, but I did pick up on a True Grit vibe while reading. A kid comes seeking out Cal to help find justice for a missing brother, and he finds himself unable to refuse.Cal definitely plays the part of ‘outsider cowboy who plays by his own rules’ well. These types of characters can be a hit or miss for me, but Cal is I guess, for lack of a better term, ‘one of the good ones’. If you’re wondering if he falls into that category during his time as a Chicago police officer, it’s never totally made clear. He probably thinks of himself as mostly good, and part of the reason he’s present in Ireland for the events of the book is because of his disillusionment with the department he worked for, but it’s not really relevant to the story. The acknowledgement of police corruption in the US, especially someone from the Chicago PD, felt cursory here. I think there was more of an opportunity to delve into this portion of Cal’s psyche, and it’s not like French hadn’t gone there before with her Dublin Murder officers. But for whatever reason, she backed off before getting into any meaningful commentary. There was just a quick acknowledgement and then moving on.The Searcher has one major thing in common with her last standalone and a few from her series, which is a focus on men and how they interact with each other. Specifically, as an examination of how patriarchal structures negatively impact men and boys as well. Where The Witch Elm featured a main character so lost in his own privilege he couldn’t see things happening two inches in front of his face, The Searcher shows what happens when men who are ill-prepared for a changing world try to retain control of it. What they know is eroding due to time and circumstance and they are incapable of processing these changes.(view spoiler)[One of the most obvious examples of this is how Cal responds to both the assaults of Trey and Alyssa. To be honest, this comparison ended up being a little on the nose for me, but might not be to a male reader who may have responded similarly to Cal. Here some people, especially men, feel the need to ‘solve’ problems instead of being present and receptive to whoever has turned to them for comfort. When a person close to them, especially if they’re a woman or girl, has been hurt, they feel helpless and don’t know how to process it. So they channel all of that frustration into anger and an attempt to ‘get the bad guy’, even though that’s rarely what the victim wants or needs. Trey, like his daughter Alyssa did years ago, just needed a father figure to care about her and be there for her. By ignoring that need in favor of your own vendetta against the perpetrator, you’re centering your feelings over the victim’s trauma. (hide spoiler)]If you’re the type of person who needs everything to come together neatly, you’ll probably find this book unsatisfying. There’s a rough edge to The Searcher, which I appreciate, but might not be for everyone.

When your fellow citizens decide enough is enough? Where do ‘regular people’ fall during this split between protesters and the enforcers? If these questions resonate with you, you may have been around during the Arab Spring in 2011. Or you might be living in the US in 2020. Or Hong Kong in 2019. Or Latin & South America since 2015. And on, and on, and on...There really hasn’t been a period in time where people weren’t fighting for their rights against oppressors, whatever form they may take. In Egypt during the first few months of 2011, people were inspired by the initial protests in Tunisia at the end of 2010, which ended up spreading widely through the Middle East. The protestors moved against authoritarianism and corruption, against poverty and unemployment. They were met with violence and attempts at further suppression. Many regimes, including Egypt‘s, turned off their phones and internet access. There were curfews and people were jailed without justification. But just outside these uprisings are the countless people just living their lives. They may not be actively participating, but that does not exclude them from the effects of all the upheaval. Their proximity makes them involved, whether they want to be or not. And the characters in Spring, by and large, definitely do not. Sami and his American girlfriend, Rose, are trying to figure out how to make their relationship work when they seem to have so little in common. Rose’s maid, Jamila, is a pregnant Sudanese refugee that’s struggling to find her place. And Sami’s mother, Suad, can’t help but worry about how both he and his sister, Ayah, are going to thrive in this world that seems so different from the one she grew up in. They each try to wage their own personal battles but are unable to ignore the changes taking place around them. These types of conflicts have a way of dragging everyone into the fray.This isn’t a book about the Arab Spring as much as it is one about how characters coped while living through it. In that way, it might be even more relevant to the average person reading. For those of us who find it easier to ‘not take a side’—it might be more difficult for you down the road. You can’t play bystander for long before it’s all on your doorstep.While reading, I came across this New York Times article written less than a week ago. I’d recommend it anyone who wants to understand what’s at stake here. The author compares some of the differences and similarities between the movement in the US right now and the one in Egypt in 2011. (Would you believe that Donald Trump called Egypt’s current autocrat, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, “my favorite dictator”? I mean, yeah, probably.)This is Leila Rafei’s debut novel. I know I’ve talked a lot about the implications of the real-life events that take place in it, but know that this is also a very good book! She writes beautifully and evocatively, in a way that would make me want to visit the country under different circumstances. I hope that she continues to write and I’m very interested in what else she has to say.I don’t think I’ve ever been the first  for a book on Goodreads, but I’m guessing with the continued unrest in the United States, there may be an increased interest in books set during modern revolutionary periods. Another one I’ve got on my TBR, also from Blackstone, A Door Between Us by Ehsaneh Sadr, which takes place amidst the Iranian Green Wave protests in 2009. With all of the new reading the book community is doing to better educate themselves on racial justice and inequality, I just hope we’ll be able to translate this information into some systemic change in this country. If not I’m afraid we’ll end up repeating the very same mistakes that led us to this point in the first place. *Thanks to Blackstone Publishing & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"May 29, 2020","Jun 06, 2020","Apr 29, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53287921-spring

Not the kind that’s pOne of my Top Ten Books of 2020!I think I have a soft spot for stories with a feeling of inevitability running through them. Not the kind that’s predictable, where you know what’s going to happen before it does, but ones where once you’ve finished you sit back and think ‘There was no other way for this to end.‘ I find the stories that give me that feeling are some of the most well-constructed and generally thoughtful ones out there, and I never hesitate to recommend them to anyone who asks.The Invisible Life of Addie La Rue definitely falls into that category. Victoria Schwab has been really open about her process with writing Addie, and I fully believe she used every second of the ten-odd years it took her to write it. I almost feel like I took just as long to finish reading it. Part of that I can attribute to the timing; initially I was trying to stretch my reading so that it would still be fresh enough to discuss with my book club. And by the time we were at the end of October/early November, I could not bring myself to focus on a work of dreamy fantasy that would need my undivided attention during the most consequential election of my lifetime. By the time the ground had settled some, I’m not sure why I didn’t immediately pick it back up. I had read half and been utterly engrossed, hungry for more, but the longer I waited the more daunting the task seemed to be. So here we are, comfortably into December, and I’ve finally fortified myself enough to finish what has ended up being one of my favorite books of the year.“Never pray to the gods that answer after dark.”It’s a beautiful summer day in Villon-sur-Sarthe, France, and Addie La Rue is running for her life. She’s not in danger of being physically harmed, but in the year 1714 she’s had her life promised away without her consent, and she feels it slipping from her, turning into something she does not recognize. To save herself, to give her more time and to free herself of the future she has not chosen, Addie makes a deal. Her prayers are answered, and she gets exactly what she asks for. There are no longer the same societal expectations for her, the wedding is called off, she is free to do as she wishes—because no one remembers her.We follow Addie, who is now also immortal, through the years that turn into decades that turn into centuries of her life, sometimes drifting and sometimes running through time. The one thing she can’t do is stop moving. She can’t set down roots when nobody remembers she exists. Once she is out of sight, she is also out of mind. Addie has freedom, she’s surrounded by it, immersed in it, but she can’t hold it. It falls through her fingers, never keeping its shape long enough to grasp.It goes without saying that much of this book is devastating. Perhaps not the kind of typical heartbreak we’re used to reading about, one that feels separate from ourselves. But one that you can’t help but see a reflection of in your own life and existence. What does it mean to be human? To be part of a larger humanity? How do we reckon with our own mortality? In The Invisible Life of Addie La Rue, Schwab answers some questions and leaves others to our own interpretations. Some are just accepted as unknowable, things we’ll have to set aside if we long to move forward. This book is a beautiful tragedy, a fulfilling love story, an exceptional escapist fantasy and wonderful work of literary contemplation. I feel so grateful to authors like V.E. Schwab who put so much love and heart into creating stories for us to read, enjoy and, occasionally, cry to. “What she needs are stories. Stories are a way to preserve one’s self. To be remembered. And to forget.”[image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,146,1,"Oct 12, 2020","Dec 12, 2020","Apr 24, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50623864-the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue

One of the best things about her as an author is that she’s sort of genre-fluid (a term I just made up). Gods was a Mexican/indigenous fantasy taking place in the 1920s, Untamed Shore was a noir set in Mexico in the 70s, and now we have Mexican Gothic, a Gothic horror novel from the 1950s that’s set in....you guessed it, Mexico.Honestly reading the first third or so of this book, I was nervous I wouldn’t love it. Moreno-Garcia is so gifted in writing locations and time periods, but the beginning was a lot of Noemí just walking around an old, moldy house. Obviously this just ended up being a set-up for the absolutely insane stuff that happens later in the novel, but if you’re reading Mexican Gothic right now and it feels a little slow, then keep going! I promise it will start to pick up and the tension will only increase. It’s a little bit mystery, mixed with some horror and supernatural elements. There’shistorical context, plus it’s totally dripping in gothic tone. I loved it, and I’m so grateful to have gotten to  an early copy. Mexican Gothic is equal parts menacing and suspenseful, with plenty of bite—check it out when it’s released June 2020!*Thanks to Boston Book Fanatic & Jordy’s Book Club of the Mystery Book Club and their partners at Random House for an advance  copy of this book!

Split between the years 1999 and 2014, bear witness to the lives of these women that move within or adjacent to L.A.’s darker underbelly.I hadn’t heard of Ivy Pochoda before picking this one up, but she’s a beautiful writer, even when writing about sinister subject matter. She really nailed the distinct voices of each woman in their respective chapters. Dorian, Julianna, Essie, Marella, Anneke and Feelia exist in the vicinity of one another, but their worlds very rarely overlap. That is, until they’re forced into proximity by the heinous acts of a man seemingly unknown to them.While this might fit into the Mystery/Thriller genre, if you’re looking for something you can ‘solve’, this probably won’t be it. The answer of who is behind all of the murders is pretty obvious once you get a decent way into the novel. But that’s part of it, the fact that the audience knows who is responsible. It ups the tension and refocuses you’re attention. This is not the story of the-guy-who-did-it, but of the women who fell into his path. He is only consequential in the ways in which he affected them.There’s a lot at play in this book. Who does society care about? What types of people are expected to ‘fall through the cracks’? What types of privilege allow these men to get away with acts of violence over and over again? Why do we insist on holding women responsible for the crimes of the men around them? The author is smart in how she asks these questions, then backs away to let the reader try to answer them. (view spoiler)[For me, I found the way Marella and Anneke acted to be particularly nauseating. A young, privileged white woman stealing the pictures that a young Latina woman, who was just murdered violently, for her own perverse art installation is bad enough. But the fact that it’s Marella’s father who ended Julianna’s life is just egregious. And Anneke...Jesus Christ. The poisoning of the birds was the tipping point for me. She’s punishing the mother of one of her husband’s victims in such a cruel way. That whole family is fuuuucked up. (hide spoiler)]These Women was gritty and addicting. It’s probably not going to be heart-racing, but there’s a lot to mull over even after you’ve finished it. I can tell it’s going to be one of those works that lingers for days.

A deadly illness known as the “Indigo Death”, or more commonly, the “Blot“ is ravaging the land of Montane. In the small village of Aster lives Shae and her mother, though they’re barely scraping by. Following the deaths of her brother and father, Shae and her mother have been turned into community outcasts, all from fear of this mysterious plague. After another tragedy strikes her family, Shae realizes she has nothing left to lose, and she sets off on her own to seek out answers.Not much is known about the Blot. Reading and all other written forms of language have been banned, as well as some specific words and phrases, such as ‘murder’. Once she decides to leave her village, Shae attempts to track down the Bards, a group of magic-wielders who have the power to alter reality at will. Their magic is not elaborated on much beyond that, and that’s honestly one of the things I struggled most with in this book. There’s really no explanation of the magic system at play. Some people can speak magic, but there’s no specific instruction on how they can do this. Apparently you can also sew your ‘Tellings’ into existence, but there’s only one example of this. I don’t know, there was a lot of interesting ideas here. I think the author had issues with the story and narrative construction. There’s not much build-up, even if the ‘tension’ is there. Farrow’s writing is a lot of ‘this happened, then this happened and oh yeah this happened a while ago but I’m just telling you about it now’. I was missing elaboration. I wanted the world she created to feel palpable, but it all came off so flat. The dialogue was also pretty basic and a lot of the characterizations were stereotypical. My guess is that she just hasn’t read that many fantasy books, especially YA fantasy, and is unfamiliar with the tropes of the genre. I‘m left with so many questions. What were those ‘training’ sessions about? How does the labyrinth work? How is this country governed? As tempting as it can be in this genre, you can’t just answer every question with ‘because magic’! I want to give Dylan time to grow as a writer. Like I said, there were a lot of good ideas. The way that Shae can’t distinguish between reality and delusions was done really well. As a reader I was questioning my own perceptions of what I was reading. I think I would like to see more of that going forward, not a half-baked romance with some guy who has the personality of wet cardboard. Usually I wouldn’t continue reading a series I didn’t absolutely love right away, but there is something compelling here. Maybe it’s how compulsively readable the story is, I don’t know, but either way I will definitely be back for book 2. *Thanks to Wednesday Books, St. Martin’s Press & Netgalley for advance copies!...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Aug 27, 2020","Sep 09, 2020","Apr 13, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44244775-hush

I did go back and read a summary as well as my  of the previous novel before starting this one, which was definitely a smart move. A Torch Against the Night picks up immediately after the events of An Ember in the Ashes, and Sabaa Tahir wastes no time jumping back into the fold with Laia, Elias, Helene, Marcus and the the Commandant.A few of my feelings while reading the first book have carried over into this one—the plot is fast-moving, the villains are over-the-top evil, it’s compulsively readable, etc. The pacing isn’t as breakneck as the last book, which I appreciate more. Much of the story is consumed with what I have lovingly described as The World’s Longest Hike, where we follow the main characters through various stages of walking to far-off places. There’s also a few attempted prison breaks which go exactly as well as those usually do.Overall, I really liked it. My attention was held the entire time and there were quite a few twists I didn’t see coming. Laia and Elias have their own POV’s again and I enjoy reading in their voices. There’s even more exploration of the magic in the Empire and it feeds into the series’ world-building easily. I wish there was a little more information given to us at this time about how some of the lore and mysticism works, but I understand the author is probably saving that for later books. A lot of what’s been provided feels untethered since it’s not fully tied together yet, but I guess that’s just more of a reason to hurry up and pick up the next book!But the biggest upgrade Tahir gave us this time around was through Helene, who got her own POV. I was so annoyed with how she was depicted in the first one that I’m almost glad she kind of went through the wringer here because she was able to prove herself a formidable character. While largely isolated from everyone she knows and cares about, Helene was given way more space to grow once she was out from under Elias’ shadow. I really don’t have any complaints about her development besides what the antagonists put her through.Which brings me to Marcus. I do not get what his deal is. The Commandant had a more scaled back role in this book, which means Marcus became the resident Big Bad. Look, he was evil in the last one, so it’s no surprise he was evil this time, but I’m going to need more examination of his character in the future books or I’m not going to be able to take his villainy seriously. Evil for the sake of being evil is not fully-formed writing, which is how he is being portrayed currently. I’ll give the author the benefit of the doubt because there are some indications she’s intentionally holding back, but A Reaper at the Gates is gonna need a big ‘ol Marcus explainer or I’ll probably start skipping over his sections. All that said, I’m excited to begin the next book before *finally* getting to A ​Sky Beyond the Storm.

The actual writer is a debut author named Lora Beth Johnson, and I have been SO excited to read this one since I first saw it appear on BookishFirst.A thousand years after being cryogenically frozen along with her family, friends and everyone she knew, Andra wakes up. Or is woken up, more accurately. She’s on a strange planet and recognizes nothing—not the landscape, not the people, not even the name they’re calling her. Nobody can seem to explain what’s happened to the ship she was supposed to be traveling on, or why she had been “asleep” for so long. Andra finds herself in a precarious position, trying to navigate political regimes without leaving herself vulnerable to the sharks that keep circling her.(For my part, being woken up only to be worshipped as a goddess sounds like an actual dream of mine. Maybe in slightly better circumstances than what Andra ended up with, but you’ve got to work with what you got, girl!)I also appreciated reading about a heroine with a different body type than we usually see in this genre. I’m really sooooo over the ‘young, female assassin’ archetype, being waif-ish or slender with ‘cUrVeS iN aLl ThE rIgHt PlAcES’. What does that even mean???? Andra isn’t special, she’s a truly average teenager who found herself in an insane situation. And that’s what I like most about her, that I can see parts of myself in her reactions to things.One of the biggest plotholes for me was how Andra seemed unable to find even *one* picture of the previous two goddesses. I mean, they’re on the MONEY, for Christ’s sake. The whole ‘Oooooh who were the other two?!?’ charade was not believable to the point where it took me out every time someone trotted out a lame excuse as to why she didn’t know. Additionally, I understand why the language deviation was introduced, and to an extent I agree that it’s probably a likely outcome for this world, but it was also kind of distracting. By the end it was easier to discern, but yeah, early in the book it was rough going for a bit.The romantic element came off pretty ham-fisted too, if I’m being honest. It was just really unnecessary. In the midst of all this chaos and upheaval, they have the mental capacity to wonder if, idk, that cute guy maybe likes me? It felt tacked on, like someone told the author, “Hey this is a YA novel, make sure to have some PG-13 kissing or you’ll lose your audience!” It almost undermined their friendship in the end, because I was left wondering if they’d have worked so hard to help one another if they weren’t each nurturing a crush. This might be a good Science-Fiction book for someone who doesn’t normally read much sci-fi. You don’t have to understand the technology behind what’s happening and a lot of the character interactions (a monarchy, rebel insurgency, etc.) have a very fantasy feel to them. It’s firmly sci-fi cause, duh, it’s set in space, but the YA aspect makes the subject more approachable to the average reader. If you read the blurb and it sounded interesting, I would give Goddess in the Machine a go.*Thanks to Penguin Teen & BookishFirst for a finished copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,113,1,"Aug 07, 2020","Aug 25, 2020","Apr 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52894698-goddess-in-the-machine

The Hate U Give was a major hit that’s still sitting pretty on the New York Times bestseller list after ✨ 2 0 5 ✨ weeks!! On the Come Up, my favorite of hers, was technically not part of this two-book series, but shares a common setting with the others, and features some of the most memorable characters I have come across. Thomas has really become an auto-read author for me and I’m so glad her books are so widely available to teenagers in the US right now.[image]As difficult as it can be to write a sequel, it seems even harder to successfully pull off a prequel, especially to a book so beloved. But in the Acknowledgments of Concrete Rose Thomas says that she was inspired to write a young Maverick’s story after seeing Russell Hornsby depict Starr’s father in the movie adaptation. This is the kind of organic extension of a story that I think makes for compelling spin-offs, as opposed to just a general reluctance to leave a world behind or as a way to capitalize on former successes.In this novel, Maverick Carter is a 17-year-old living in Garden Heights, with his mother working two jobs and his father incarcerated. His world is turned upside down when he finds out a one night stand resulted in a pregnancy and is soon struggling to balance the new responsibilities thrust upon him. Between trying to help out his mother, high school, fatherhood, his girlfriend Lisa and tension amongst the members of the gang he’s basically been born into, the King Lords, Maverick is having a hard time coping under the mounting pressure.If you read The Hate U Give, you can probably guess some of the other challenges Maverick will soon face as well. He’s really still a kid, a teenager, but is suddenly stricken with pains and burdens most adults won’t have to face until much later in their lives, if at all. The dehumanization of young Black men in America has been a topic that many authors, including Thomas and her friend Nic Stone, have been writing about years before the George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. And I expect them to keep writing these stories as long as they are, unfortunately, relevant to the society we currently live in.As per usual Angie Thomas’ characters are just next level. They feel so tangible and real, like you know them personally. It’s difficult not to empathize with their struggles even if you have no real experience with what they’re going through. But that’s the sign of good writing and probably why most of us read; we want to feel things entirely new but also familiar. The humanity in Thomas’ writing is probably her greatest asset and why I will always go back to her work.And though it doesn’t contain any direct spoilers, I’m decided to put what I thought of the ending under the tags just to be safe: (view spoiler)[Based on Maverick’s history in The Hate U Give, I kept waiting for the final shoe to drop at the end. Even with only a couple of pages left, I was expecting a flash of sirens or an ominous knock at the door to take Maverick away. But since that didn’t happen in this novel, I think I’m only now fully appreciating the way Angie Thomas decided to end this portion of Maverick Carter’s story. I’m sure there was pressure as an author to put a final twist at the end, but she chose to prioritize not just her character’s journey but what ending this book with that kind of negative scene would mean to a reader who identifies with Maverick. Infinite respect to the author for being so conscious of the implications of her work!

I can see why Holly Black didn’t put this into her novels. It’s a departure from the Jude/Cardan-centered story she’s been telling. Plus the one thing the fandom can agree on is how Taryn is trash, so I doubt it would have gone over that well. Despite all of that, I still would have preferred to read it in the correct chronological order, or at least before picking up The Queen of Nothing.But since my library is building up their digital collection while they’re closed due to the quarantine, this one popped up in my Overdrive account and so here I am, dutifully reading and reporting on the content.

What may appear to be a formulaic set-up, orphaned girl gets into a prestigious military academy and uncovers her own secret powers, pushes beyond what you would expect from that type of story. R.F. Kuang gives the reader just enough of the familiar before ripping the rug out from under your feet.But scrolling through the s, I can see The Poppy War is evoking either glowing, gushing responses (like this one), or people just not having it, and that’s alright. So I’ll put trigger warnings up here: there’s a lot of violence. It’s a war story, told through fantasy and history, but a war story nonetheless. If you’re aware at all of China’s history during the period this series is supposed to emulate, I’m sure you can guess at the types of brutality that’s depicted. There’s fighting and addiction and mutilation and a lot of death. There’s racism, classism, genocide and all types of carnage. There’s torture and sexual violence. If those things will upset you, I would not recommend reading this book.Despite all of that content, it’s not an unbearably dark and grim slog. Part of Rin’s role in the story, beyond being the protagonist, is to cut some of the tension of the punishing world she inhabits. She’s biting and stubborn and occasionally insufferable, but you can’t help rooting for her. Honestly, I sometimes get annoyed when it seems like characters are being flippant and sarcastic just for the sake of ~*bAnTeR~*~, but it didn’t feel forced here. Kuang writes her characters while completely aware that they are at times teenaged angst-monsters. (As a side note: Rebecca Kuang is one of my favorite authors to follow on Twitter & y’all need to go find her ASAP @kuangrf. You’re welcome.)[image]But I really loved this. There’s so much that happens—to the point where if she wanted to, Kuang could have dragged it out into several books. I think the way Rin goes from a struggling student to being thrown into the midst of a huge international conflict is realistic to how young people have been customarily drafted into the military. She’s ill-equipped and has to learn on her feet if she wants to survive. The fighting doesn’t stop just because the protagonist is having a personal crisis.It’s a wonderful start to sweeping fantasy series based on 20th century East Asian history. Kuang is able to weave in real aspects of Chinese culture while creating something entirely new. And though it was over 500 pages, I found myself tearing through it. Now I really can’t wait until I can get my hands on The Dragon Republic & The Burning God (coming out Nov 19, 2020).Anyways, here’s more Poppy War tweets by the author: [image][image]*I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank Bryan, a man on Twitter who was giving away free digital copies of this book, for supplying me with mine.

Plainly, the world is blunt, harsh and unexpected—just like this novel. When I’m picking historical fiction to read, I usually try to steer clear of the over-saturated time periods or perspectives. I’m pretty much burnt out on anything even approaching the World Wars, especially the second one, for as long as it takes for there to be a third....so hopefully not in my lifetime. Taking place during the American gold rush of the mid 19th century, How Much of These Hills Is Gold is a look back at a period in time when this country was rapidly expanding, and its inhabitants changing along with it. As the children of immigrants from China, Lucy and Sam, along with their parents, represent a portion of the American experience that history usually prefers to gloss over, if not exclude all together. The two siblings’ lives vary so much from their parents as well as their white neighbors, that they can’t seem to find a sense of belonging. After the deaths of their Ma and Ba they wander the Wild West somewhat aimlessly, not sure what they’re really looking for. This ended up being my favorite part of the book, as we get to unravel a complex sibling relationship through observing how they coped with this shared sudden devastation.The West is a hard place full of hardened people. One of the themes of the book centers around parents who feel like they have to ‘toughen-up’ their kids. The idea is that by enacting cruelty on their children, they‘re more prepared for a cruel world. This isn’t a concept that’s totally disappeared, especially if you’re trying to raise kids in a country that (still) has rampant racism and discrimination. But for the adults who are responding to misbehaving children, with anger alongside punishment, is that actually their reasoning or just a convenient excuse after the fact? In the novel, I found it difficult to empathize with the alleged grown-up(s) who rationalized their own bad behavior instead of trying to curb it.The effects of this type of discipline also manifests differently based on the children themselves. I alternated feeling bad for both Lucy and Sam, as they took turns feeling rejected by their family and community. Even the appearance of favoritism can lead to resentment, and it’s heartbreaking to watch it play out between two siblings who are supposed to love one another. Sam and Lucy may share a history, but they have completely different struggles and desires. But they’re still bonded forever because of what they’ve been through together.This is a pretty short book, and I found myself unexpectedly caught up in it. I’m not usually a western person, but maybe after this I’ll give them a chance. I’ve had True Grit on my TBR forever, so possibly that or something by Cormac McCarthy. Any recommendations appreciated, but I’m not super interested in any ‘Lone Man’ narratives or anything that involves “frontier justice” targeted at Native Americans. Basically anything that Clint Eastwood would star in is gonna be a no from me.*Thanks to Riverhead Books & Goodreads for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Apr 22, 2020","Apr 30, 2020","Apr 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45895362-how-much-of-these-hills-is-gold

There was magic and Bolivian history and politics and some pretty stark realities we don’t see often in YA fantasy (like food shortages and ration lines). But all of that seemed to melt away pretty quickly and the story devolved into a trope-heavy and predictable offering from this genre.I’m not sure if this has been given a name, but there’s a particular type of plotline that I think of as ‘captive in luxury’, which I’ve become increasingly exasperated by. It’s typically a young woman who is held against her will in a lavish setting with servants, elegant gowns, an abundance of decadent food, etc. But she is very angry about being forced to sit around & eat bonbons all day and takes it out on whatever poor sap has to be her keeper. She lobs sarcasm at anyone who crosses her path and feels bad about being surrounded by all that opulence for approximately two seconds before indulging in another bubble bath. I know this is a pretty cynical take on this type of character, but it’s just been done so much and I dread it every time it starts to happen. There’s this vibe that’s not unlike a bunch of rich celebrities or corporations singing about ‘coming together’ while the rest of the world is suffering. I dunno, maybe I’m just sensitive to that kind of thing at the moment. As for the book itself, Isabel Ibañez is not a bad writer. The characters are grating, but her descriptions are lush and inviting. The magic system isn’t elaborated much on, so you just kind of have to go with it. It’s not really explained how moon dust makes you sleepy, but also lets some people see the future and can be used by others to weave magical tapestries? I wish we had gotten more of Bolivia and the setting as opposed to whatever bullshit Ximena is getting up to with her Stockholm-Syndrome family. And even though there’s a lot of death, you don’t really form emotional attachments to the characters, so they’re no biggie. I’d still be willing to pick up more from Ibañez, all that said. This one just disappointed me, despite the pretty cover.

What a triumph oOne of my Top 10 Books of 2020!I don’t know how anyone could finish reading Homegoing and not find themselves changed afterwards. What a triumph of a debut from Yaa Gyasi. If there ever was a work of fiction that would be beneficial for American high school history students to read, this would be it. Homegoing is as expansive as it is devastating. Following one divided family, Gyasi traces the lineage of two half-sisters as they diverge from the Fante & Asante nations to the United States and modern day Ghana. Every chapter is a new branch of alternating generations, and we get to watch how each new character introduced is shaped by the traumas of their past. Even those that they may have no memory of, their generational pain rippling.Yaa Gyasi does not pull any punches or dull any edges. Her writing is beautiful, but I can’t imagine anyone sitting down and reading this in just one sitting, despite the shorter length. It felt like every chapter was crafted in order to find a different way to break your heart. The parts with the most levity happened when you’re least expecting them.

Chakraborty & Tomi Adeyemi, I couldn’t really overlook this series any more, could I? It’s an interesting combination of YA fantasy & adult fantasy elements, and while some parts are fairly predictable, An Ember in the Ashes is still compulsively readable.I’m trying to find an apt comparison series so people who haven’t read it might be able to gauge whether they’d be interested in this one, but I’m coming up empty handed. Not because it’s unlike any other series, but because it resembles pieces of so many. For me, I’m not looking for anything like Throne of Glass. I didn’t like Celaena or her excessively-voweled name, and thankfully the heroine in this series, Laia, is nothing like her (except for the vowels). She’s not tHe GrEaTeSt aSsAsIn iN tHe wOrLd, just a regular girl who lives under an increasingly brutal regime. Elias is a bit of a Marty Stu (is that the equivalent??), though we never really apply that title to male characters who are just the best for no reason....but I digress.The plot is action-packed and there’s little time spent before we’re thrust into the middle of it. Most of the story involves spying and fighting, though there’s definitely magical elements. I think I would prefer if Sabaa Tahir went deeper into that lore instead of the 20 year-old-killer Hunger Games we got in this one, but I’d imagine she will in later books. The novel is at its most YA when the characters are acting on their romantic feelings. Or not acting, just longingly staring at one another. Basically everyone is horny and nobody knows what to do about it. There’s also, inexplicably, only one girl selected in each class of over a hundred boys, and I roll my eyes every time I think about it.Speaking of the one girl...Helene. Tahir did her dirty. She’s supposedly a ruthless fighter and ‘tougher than any of them’, but for some reason turns helpless whenever Elias needs to be the hero of a scene. He is constantly throwing her over his shoulder and it’s grating how often the other characters deride her by saying she’s “acting like an actual girl“ as if it’s insulting or surprising. I just don’t like how she’s infantilized in this damsel role whilst being lauded in faux-empowerment. Female characters don’t have to be stripped of femininity in order to be strong. I just think she could have been handled better.The villains were also pretty cartoonishly evil. I’ve never seen a character say “I’m going to rape you” explicitly, but I guess Marcus isn’t one for subtlety. The Commandant is your typical severe Ice Queen, but even more malicious. Some of the cruelty she enacts is what almost makes me not want to categorize this as strictly YA. I’m looking forward to the more complex motivations of the upcoming Big Bads that we’re given a taste of near the end of the book. All in all, I liked it. I’m probably going to pick up the next one once my TBR calms down a bit. I just got more of the Witcher series made available at my library and have The Poppy War waiting for me on my Kindle, so maybe I’ll stagger A Torch Against the Night with those.

Please??I’ve read a loooot of fantasy books starring young female heroines, ones who fight against an oppressive system. This story still feels new even in the face of all of those. It follows Deka, a young woman from a small, religious village in the northern province of the country Otera. Every year a new crop of 16-year-old girls has their blood let to prove “purity”; if they bleed gold they are sentenced to death. Deka ‘fails’ this test and is given a choice: subject herself to further torture at the hands of her former community or leave to fight for the empire. It’s not a particularly difficult decision.“Never forget: the same gift they praise you for now they will kill you for later.”The Gilded Ones grapples with a lot, colorism, tribalism, religion, racism, etc. But the greatest struggle the young women in this book face isn’t the monsters they have to fight, the Deathshrieks, but an overwhelming amount of misogyny. Women are forced to wear masks in public, they cannot go anywhere unaccompanied. Girls are the only ones who are tested for ‘purity’ and have little to no options for their lives besides marriage and children....and those are the ones with non-magical blood. The alaki are little more than fodder for the Empire, a government that instituted the blood ceremony and Death Mandate that condemned them to this fate.The author, Namina Forna, writes in a letter before the start of the novel how both her experiences in Sierra Leone and the United States informed her depiction of Otera. I’ve grown tired of excusing “dEePlY pAtRiArChAl” societies as anything other than ingrained sexist bullshit seeking cover under the guise of tradition, both in the US and abroad. Forna does an excellent job writing within one of those societies, while expertly critiquing it. Sometimes it can be exhausting having to read about institutional trauma over and over again, but here it’s handled in a way that doesn’t feel gratuitous or glossed-over. “Legend is what humans call the things that they do not understand.”The world-building in the Otera is exceptional, and this is a great foundation for the Deathless series. It was easy to read and almost impossible to put down. I honestly don’t know how I got approved for an eARC before the quarantine forced the release date back, but I’m incredibly grateful that I did! The characters are vivid and both their triumphs and pain is palpable. It’s an amazing story and I’m calling it now—in eight months The Gilded Ones will be published and it will be a revelation.*Thanks to Random House Children’s & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,133,1,"Jun 06, 2020","Jun 17, 2020","Mar 04, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53028775-the-gilded-ones

I gave some of the slower parts in Blood of Elves a pass because it had the more difficult task of transitioning from short stories to novels & being the first in the novel series, but what’s the excuse here?? The entire first half of the book felt like nothing was happening and wow it just draaaaaagged. And maybe I was just zoned out for the relevant stuff, but by the time the big second-act battle started up, I had no idea what was happening. I didn’t know who anyone was or why they were fighting or who was winning and which side I was supposed to be cheering for. Geralt, as usual, decided to sit on his hands when it came time to make ~*~dEsCiSiOnS~*, so I ended up just going along with whatever name I recognized. Oh, Triss! I know her! Get em, Triss! Wait, that’s Tissaia, I know her too! Are Triss and Tissaia fighting? Now I’m confused. IdkAnd I am unable to not keep pointing this out—Sapkowski doesn’t grasp how women interact with one another. The way the enchantresses spoke and moved around that party in the third chapter was just cringy. “‘Oh you men . . . You don’t understand anything. How can you show off your dress or figure if you’re hiding behind a table in the glow and smoke?’“ Like, what woman would say this type of thing? Out loud?? To other humans??? They’re supposed to be all-powerful and brilliant! Unless, of course, they come across some jewelry or eyeshadow, then they devolve into squealing, vapid tarts, amiright? I also absolutely hated the way he wrote Yennefer as a jealous, petty bitch and Triss as a skittish animal in need of a good kicking. Geralt comes off as absolutely pathetic here, like a lost, horny boy that’s never seen boobs before. How can you tell a fantasy series is written through the male gaze? No woman would end a description of a dress like this: “Fashion demanded it be split halfway up the thigh, but Sabrina wore hers split to halfway up her hip. And a very nice hip at that.” These errant thoughts are eyeroll-inducing, but hard to miss once you begin to notice them. There was good stuff too, lest you think I’m just gonna rag on it the whole time. Dandelion playing interpreter for Ciri during Geralt and Yennefer’s fight was a bit of unexpected sweetness I didn’t know I needed. Dandelion, that little weed, has definitely grown on me. Yennefer when she’s not being possessive is wonderful, and I love Ciri’s feralness. Geralt was kind of lame in this one. (view spoiler)[My favorite chapter is weirdly the one where Ciri is wandering around a desert with a Unicorn, eating bugs and being friends like Timon & Pumba. It was tedious, but I also couldn’t get enough???? (hide spoiler)]At this point, I can’t really help imagining each scene as it would play out in the TV series. I just think Lauren Schmidt Hissrich is going to really nail some of parts where Sapkowski floundered, like the aforementioned party. I’m also going to need Netflix to announce some upcoming casting decisions ASAP so I can start pairing names with faces—hopefully that’ll help me keep some of these Polish names straight....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Apr 28, 2020","May 07, 2020","Mar 01, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14781491-the-time-of-contempt

The medical insight was interesting, but that didn’t make up for the way the characters spoke and acted. They were like if aliens tried to infiltrate Earth by binging thousands of hours of reality TV and then tried to speak to regular people like that. They just came off as hollow and artificial human interactions. Plus multiple personalities can come off as kind of gimicky if it’s not done right. I didn’t really buy Daniel Rosenstein as a medical professional based off of a number of issues, least of all breaching doctor-patient confidentiality, which was surprising considering Mei-Fung Chung’s background. Alexa was an interesting character, but there was too much other stuff going on for me to really connect with her. And like others have said, the sex trafficking angle felt like a massive misstep.

I was expecting more from a novel that compares itself to Tana French, and it definitely didn’t reach that level for me. It was slow to start, slow in the middle and did not pick up the pace nearly enough at the end. There was also something about Maggie D’Arcy that came off as insincere, both in her job and how often she trotted out Irish fun facts. It was almost like she was constantly trying to prove her Irish-adjacency to the reader. And after checking the author’s bio, which is almost exactly the same background as Maggie and Erin’s, I think I understand where that influence came from.Maggie is the only person who can solve this in the way a lot of these books frame their heroines & heroes. But I never connected with her, the missing person, Erin, or any of the other characters. The writing was fine, though I wouldn’t go so far as to call it ‘lyrical’.

There was so much clunky plot, all linked together with just the barest whisper of continuity, that I had a hard time taking anything that was happening seriously. Which is really a disservice to the setting because there’s so much that’s supposed to be taken seriously. There’s sex trafficking and child abuse and death—plenty of the nastier side from Revolutionary France, but the stakes didn’t feel real. Everything was clipped. The author jumps from one huge plot point to another with no real explanation or breathing room. There’s fast-paced, and then there’s The Court of Miracles. Too much happened too soon.I liked the dynamic between the characters and there was a lot of potential, but where it reaaaaally dropped the ball was with the world-building. Maybe 80% of the dialogue was exposition? And there was no tension that wasn’t contrived. The initial conflict, Nina’s sister being sold into prostitution, is skipped over quickly, and I guess now she’s older and trying to protect some random girl? That she planned to do the same thing (sell into sex slavery) to, only to get cold feet at the last possible second? It’s a premise so flimsy it’s almost goofy, which is not how I wanted to feel reading about such a grave subject.What caught me the most off-guard was how much Grant seemed to really want to emulate a handful of other books. When the description said ”Les Miserables meets Six of Crows“, I didn’t think it would be those two stories literally smashed together. I actually had to stop reading at one point and double check this wasn’t a retelling or fanficton or something like that. Turns out, it kind of is? But I didn’t see that detail mentioned anywhere except in user s. And other than the time, place and assorted character names, I struggle to see how this would be classified as a ‘retelling’. I’m curious to see what others think as the s keep trickling in, but there’s still some buzz around this one and I can understand why. The marketing is beautiful and the blurb is attention-grabbing, and I actually really like her writing style. But I went into this wanting to love it, to be swept away in a new fantasy series, and I don’t think that’s going to happen at this point.*Thanks to Random House Children’s & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"May 07, 2020","May 14, 2020","Feb 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33973264-the-court-of-miracles

Returned to the mesmerizing world of the Grishaverse, and just in time for the new Shadow and Bone series on Netflix! Two long years since the last installment, and we’ve all been anxiously awaiting Leigh Bardugo’s seventh dalliance into Ravka, Fjerda, Ketterdam and the like. Now the only thing left is to see if she was able to live up to the incredibly high bar she set for herself.[image]No pressure, though!!!!!I did have the benefit of reading with my good friends Natalie Paige & Madison which was a great way to unpack all of the thoughts I was having while moving through this 600 page chonker. We’d been hyping each other up in the weeks leading up to the release and could not wait to rip into Rule of Wolves once it appeared on our doorsteps. In the end, I think we may have bought into the hype a little too much, and it didn’t quite reach our high expectations. The biggest running grievance in this book would probably be the way that Leigh Bardugo seemed to ignore a lot of the previous rules she’d established in the last six books set in this world. Many of the main characters were suddenly overpowered and a lot of the storylines felt underdeveloped. A few could probably have been dropped altogether and it would have made the story stronger. I just had a difficult time getting as fully invested in the new and even some of the old characters plot lines because the stakes felt so artificially raised.The characters from the main trilogy who haven’t really been present in the recent books, that made appearances in this one felt markedly different from how they were originally written. And on one hand, while I loved seeing familiar faces from Six of Crows, they also felt shoehorned in at times. This book was equal parts fan service and fan disservice, and there was one death in particular that was so pointlessly cruel that I might not be able to forgive Leigh any time soon. (view spoiler)[David. His death served no purpose except as a cheap gut punch in a series that has been overwhelmed with suffering. I don’t understand Bardugo’s obsession with punishing Genya at every turn. It didn’t even make sense for David to be where he was or die the way he did. I feel like she did this for shock value and nothing more, which is disappointing. (hide spoiler)]It’s hard to pin down the exact focus in a book with so many revolving points of view, but if King of Scars was about Nina’s grief and Nikolai’s ascension, then Rule of Wolves is where Zoya experiences both those and more. Even with huge number of perspectives, all more spread out from each other than we’ve ever seen from Bardugo, it’s still it’s hard to see this as anything other than the Book of Zoya. She’s got new powers that she has to learn to control and embrace, and a long list of friends and allies that she hasn’t really given herself the space to mourn. I enjoyed witnessing her transformation, but found the end point of it to be stretching believability.And maybe believability isn’t the most important thing in a fantasy book, but I just expected the author to pay more attention to logistics than she did. Things happened not because they made sense, but because she wanted them to end up that way. There was a secret whisper network that wasn’t elaborated on but provided a stunning amount of information and passed messages with the ease of sending a text. Characters almost seemed to teleport with how fast they traveled huge distances. What took years for every other similar character to master was learned in weeks because it would be more convenient that way. I just wish Bardugo had leaned more into the plausible struggles over the manufactured ones.If I sound like I was more than a little disappointed with this book, that’s because I was. It was as readable as ever, but could have taken serious editorial cuts. I wouldn’t say this is anywhere close to Bardugo’s best work—that remains the untouchable Six of Crows duology. And though there’s no concrete plans of when either series will continue, what is obvious is that they will ~eventually~. My only hope is that if and when she revisits Ketterdam and the Dregs, that Leigh doesn’t inject whatever she’s been doing in the King of Scars series into the next Six of Crows book. I’m only interested in it if she’s able to continue the original magic of those books PLEASE.[image]Don’t make us find you Leigh ...more",Notes are private!,0,102,1,"Apr 02, 2021","Apr 12, 2021","Feb 16, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54589790-rule-of-wolves

I probably sound like a broken record every time I laud a slow-burn suspense novel like this, but it really was that good. Her writing is both expressive and smart, with characters that are so distinctly human that they probably resemble actual people you know. There’s so many things I loved about this book; this  is probably just going to be me listing them out for you here. This is the first thriller I’ve read in a while where someone isn’t murdered in the first few chapters. So if you’re expecting the story to start with a bang, you may be kept waiting a while. Instead we follow Kate, a former journalist, now an archivist, who takes a job in the California Bay Area in order to get away from her old life and career. There’s a lot that’s left murky surrounding her past, and as she slowly peels back the layers of the family she’s now working for, we get to uncover more of what Kate’s kept hidden.My primary draw initially was to Miranda Brand, the famous artist whom Kate is now chronicling. She’s a fascinating character, and some of the best parts in the book are her transcripts, diary entries and letters that come at the end of each chapter. Kate becomes increasingly entangled in the enigma that is Miranda Brand, but also by her son, Theo, and his two young children, Jemima and Oscar.I was struck at how thematic this mystery was. Through the flashbacks to the late 80s and early 90s back to present day, Sligar really delved into some heavy topics, and did so with immense skill. Take Me Apart covers mental health, both the realities of and the stigma surrounding it, public image vs private life, nature vs nurture and more all while keeping and building tension. There’s even a peek into the utter tediousness and ineptitude of the US healthcare system.This is definitely a post-#MeToo novel. So much of Kate and Miranda’s lives are shaped by the men around them. Sligar uses her ‘strong female characters’ as an indictment of the world they live in. Through Miranda’s work specifically, we’re asked to examine the way that female pain is monetized and romanticized as a consumable piece of art. We believe so much has changed, but has it really? I’m not sure, but I find it hard to imagine this story being written in the same way even five years ago.But beyond all of that, this was just a really addictive book. My pulse started racing when the characters’ did, and I couldn’t turn down my frenetic reading pace until I finished it. I haven’t had my mood shifted in this way for quite a while, and I’m excited to see what Sara Sligar comes out with next.*Thanks to Farrar, Straus and Giroux & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Apr 06, 2020","Apr 12, 2020","Feb 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45892241-take-me-apart

I would probably classify this is as some sort of Suspense novel, because there wasn’t much of a mystery in sight. The dueling perspectives didn’t really work for me here. There’s no reason for it and all it ends up doing is getting exposition out of the way. Flipping back and forth between Shay and the two sisters, Cassandra & Jane, as well as flashbacks to each member of their ‘group’ took me out of the story every time. All of the tension leaks out when we know the sisters and their squad are nefarious from the get-go. It’s not even just hinted at, we hear from Cassandra and Jane themselves how they plan to screw over Shay almost immediately. Maybe if it had been set up where we start only seeing things from Shay’s perspective, then have a Gone Girl-style tone shift it would have worked better. So much of the initial conflict in the story comes from miscommunication and misinterpretation, which is a pet peeve of mine. For people who apparently ‘think of everything’, Cassandra and Jane have laughably bad intuition.I’ve read An Anonymous Girl, also by author duo Greer Hendricks & Sarah Pekkanen, and I had similar middling feelings about it. Ever since their joint debut thriller, The Wife Between Us, they’ve had monumental success in the genre.

There’s something about her YA thrillers that immediately pull me in and keep me compulsively turning pages until the end. Though a little different in tone from her previous hits like One of Us Is Lying and Two Can Keep a Secret, The Cousins is no exception to that rule.Milly, Aubrey and Jonah Story have never met their grandmother, Mildred Story, before. She mysteriously cut off contact from their parents twenty-four years ago, and hasn’t seen any of her children or grandchildren since. So it’s strange that all these years later she’s reached out and invited the three of them to visit her estate on Gull Cove Island now that they’re all nearly grown. Even stranger, they all accept and spend their summer living and working at one of her hotels, each seeking out something different from their elusive grandmother. As always, McManus uses a roving perspective, moving between the distinct voices of Milly, Aubrey and Jonah with ease. As the cousins get to know each other, they also begin to learn more about the history of the island they’re now living on, and by extension their grandmother. Gull Cove Island is a little-known east coast getaway that features local residents and wealthy vacationers alike. There’s layers of mystery and decades-old unanswered questions for the Story cousins to unravel, especially when they find their own parents at the center of it.I liked this book, but it felt a good deal slower than McManus’s previous works, especially in the beginning. I’m used to her books hitting the ground running and with The Cousins you have to wait for the story to come to a boil. The ending also felt a little rushed, probably because of the slower pacing in the first part. That said, I’m glad that the author is trying out something different from her last three books, and I hope she feels like she can branch out even more in the future. Karen McManus also has an upcoming book in 2021, You'll Be the Death of Me, which is sold as Ferris Bueller’s Day off meets a YA Murder mystery.

All of them seem too eager to help and too perfectly set up to give her whatever she needs at any given moment, like housing, information, etc. I don’t like characters introduced primarily as plot devices, which would be about three-quarters of the ones St. James included here. Carly and Viv are compelling enough, though, and it’s interesting to watch one retrace the footsteps of another, both intentionally and unintentionally, in search of answers.A nitpick I had: some of the names. Every time I saw Carly’s full name written out I misread it as Charlie, which is blech. (view spoiler)[And I don’t know if Simone St. James watches American Horror Story, but having one of Hess’s fake names be James March (in 1982, no less) seems a little on the nose, as he was a fictional, murderous hotel owner. (hide spoiler)]It’s a good, engaging thriller. Nothing groundbreaking, but still a great time. The supernatural elements may be a dealbreaker or dealmaker for some people, but they didn’t matter to me either way.

Stephen Graham Jones is an esteemed Horror writer, which makes someone like me, a big scaredy-baby, a little nervous to be honest. The plotting of this book is interesting. I’d say the majority of the time is spent on character development and relatively benign interactions of regular Native people living their lives. It almost hits you like a sucker-punch when everything starts going off the rails. Seriously—one moment I was reading about a guy obsessed with his ladder, and pages later someone has their head caved in. Part one in the novel, The House That Ran Red, didn’t have that much tension through the beginning and middle. But after a mid-book bloody climax, there’s a discernible current of it running through every seemingly innocuous action or phrase uttered by a new character. I ended up being pretty shaken thereafter.Not sure if I can say much else without giving stuff away.

I’m reading from an eARC I received pre-quarantine, so I can’t speak to the finished print copies, but Mero’s portions of the book are written ENTIRELY WITH CAPS-LOCK ON, just like his tweets. Desus uses normal syntax, but the font was actually significantly larger than the standard size. Perhaps the editor wanted their words to be more visually distinguishable? I’m not sure. The book isn’t that long, with nine chapters plus a preface and introduction. The topics covered include things from drugs to relationships to toxic masculinity, and whatever else pops into either of their heads; there’s really no set rubric here. And if there was ever any doubt: this book is written 100% by Desus & Mero. I don’t know if I’ve ever read a nonfiction book written more thoroughly in the authors’ voices. I will say if you’ve never seen their show before, it might be a little jarring at first, but that’s all part of their charm. The tone of God-Level Knowledge Darts is similar to a podcast, where each take turns, sometimes interrupting one another, discussing a general topic. I haven’t listened to the Bodega Boys podcast, but it feels very off the cuff. Mero is frequently high while writing (something he brings up multiple times), but that doesn’t take away from the conversation the two of them are having; it only enhances it. I kind of wish I had an audiobook copy narrated by the authors instead, but this was still an enjoyable read for me to take a break from some heavier ones.If you’re a fan of theirs, you’ll be a fan of this book too. If you’re not, maybe check out clips from their Showtime show on YouTube and see for yourself.

I can appreciate the pressure Gyasi was under to measure up to that book, and I think the direction she decided to go in with her sophomore novel was a smart one. Like how an actor who comes out of one distinct and identifiable role may want to pursue a next one that is completely different in order to avoid being type-cast in the future. While Homegoing was a novel spaced out over more than a half a dozen generations and two continents, introducing a new character focus and time period with each new chapter, Transcendent Kingdom doesn’t try to expand even further beyond that. Instead, it turns inward. The story follows Gifty, a woman in her twenties who is, and I’m going to take this directly from the description as the nuances of academia are beyond me, ”a fifth-year candidate in neuroscience at Stanford School of Medicine studying reward-seeking behavior in mice and the neural circuits of depression and addiction.” Essentially, she is observing and experimenting on mice in order to see if they can learn impulse-control. I’m a vegetarian for ethical reasons, so this wasn’t exactly my favorite portion of the book. But what I was able to glean from the scientific parts seemed interesting enough.What Gifty grapples with in Transcendent Kingdom, though, isn’t really anything to do with her work. The real focus here is on Gifty and her family: her mother, father and brother, Nana. Since leaving Ghana for the United States when her brother was a baby, Gifty was born several years later after the family had settled in Alabama. They struggled financially, with Gifty’s mother working long hours as a caretaker and her father unable to secure much work at all. It’s an added strain on a family already dealing with the stress of immigrating, the racism of their newly adopted community and the difficulty of raising two children in an unfamiliar place. A lot of these details are revealed through flashbacks woven into the modern day narrative of Gifty while she’s working at her lab. For Gyasi, the timeline wasn’t as structured as her last book, and I did get thrown off a few times. What’s apparent right away is that both Gifty’s brother and father are out of the picture and her mother is reeling from something yet to be named. Eventually more of these histories are revealed, and there’s a quiet devastation in finding out why Gifty and her mother are the way they are. Because of the nature of her studies and some of her family turmoil, a lot of the story centers around substance abuse. I’ve read several books this year where addiction, particularly the opioid crisis in America, is at the root of the narrative. It honestly doesn’t get any easier to read about. All the same feelings of hope flattening into despair and directionless frustration come flooding back as if they never left. And I guess they don’t have much of a reason to leave, really. What have we as a society done to help the people struggling? Which of the parties responsible have been held accountable? The answers are next to nothing and none.Much of the internal conflict within Gifty is that battle between religion and science. I wouldn’t call myself a religious person, and I didn’t have the stringent Christian upbringing that she did. But I can empathize with that struggle between what you’ve been taught and what you end up discovering on your own. It can really unravel some fundamental truths you may have held about who you are and what your place in the world is, so it’s hard to blame those who end up avoiding that personal confrontation all together. It’s difficult and a bit of a leap of faith to unlearn something when you’re not yet sure what’s going to take its place.By the end, though, I felt like I was still missing something. I’m having a hard time deciphering what Yaa Gyasi’s overall thesis of the book is. I think Transcendent Kingdom is well-written and heartbreaking, but it didn’t make me feel leveled in the way that Homegoing did—the peaks never reach as high and the depths never quite so low. It’s still an accomplishment for Gyasi, and indicative that she still has plenty to offer with her writing. I’m looking forward to any and all future works from her....more",Notes are private!,0,107,1,"Nov 12, 2020","Nov 20, 2020","Jan 31, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48570454-transcendent-kingdom

I‘ll admit I was pretty cocky and thought I knew exactly where this book was headed, but even when I was on the right track, I got the degree very, very wrong. At one point when I was maybe halfway through reading I commented on Chelsea’s status update that I was “waiting for everything to go off the rails”, and through time and space Rory Power HEARD me and decided to grant me that request. Be careful what you wish for, y’all!!The story starts with 17 year-old Margot and her mom, Josephine, barely getting by in their small apartment and meager income. Beyond poverty, there’s a massive amount of simmering tension between the two of them, at near-constant risk of erupting. Eventually this leads to Margot seeking out the family that her mother has always kept hidden from her.I’m always down for a complex family dynamic. I appreciated the relationship between Margot, her mother and grandmother, Vera, and loved dissecting what each microaggression (or full-on aggression) lobbed at one another meant. There were plenty of secrets that we get to uncover along the way, especially since none of the women are particularly forthright.“Does understanding her mean I have to forgive her?”I also adored Power’s writing. She captures these really specific, human moments between her characters just beautifully. My Kindle copy is filled with highlighted passages, and I’m guessing anyone who’s had even a somewhat-toxic relationship with a family member will be struck by her insights. I ended up skipping Wilder Girls last year and clearly that was my mistake. I know people were guuuushing about the cover, but I hope that the book itself ends up being just as engrossing.That said, I still feel like the story was missing something. Parts just felt underdeveloped. Tess was promising, but both her and Eli seemed like they were added as a means to and end. I never quite understood Josephine, and I think some of her ‘quirks’ needed to be explained a little more.

And it felt pretty dark for a YA novel; I get that the heroine is a teenager, but I don’t know if I would market this to teenagers.

This time set in Odessa, Texas in the 1970s, where an oil boom has rippling effects for all who reside there.Sometimes I feel exhausted after reading yet another book where women and girls are tread over and over again, and I decide maybe I’ll take a break from them for a while. But then a new one with a pretty cover and main character with just as much resolve as personality comes barreling into the world and I just...can’t resist. They never stop being relevant, so I guess we can expect even more novels of this nature going forward.As a debut, Valentine is a sound offering from Elizabeth Wetmore. She writes scenery beautifully and women with an abundance of depth and complexity. Theres little in this West Texas setting that you can’t see sprawling before your eyes, dust you can taste, sweat you can smell. Everything is atmospheric, for better or worse, and the inhabitants feel so alive they might as well be sitting in the room with you.Where I started to fall out of the story was with the style. I’ve read books before where there’s no quotations around dialogue, like Girl, Woman, Other, that didn’t take away from the plot like this one did. The characters start speaking in the middle of paragraphs, constantly, and it removes you from what’s happening. All the tension leaks out like a slowly deflating tire.I also just feel like this story was missing...something. There’s all these powerful moments that amount to nothing. No characters have changed over the length of the novel, at least not for the better. A couple are worse off than they were at the start and most remained static. There’s no real comeuppance, no lesson, just harsh reality. I might have had a better reaction to this type of ending if there seemed like a point that was trying to be made to the reader, but I couldn’t find even that. What was Wetmore trying to get across? That bad things happen to girls and women? That people don’t care? That it’s worse for marginalized communities? I feel like if you’re the type of person to pick up this book, it’s likely you already know all of this. So when I ask, ‘What was the point?’, I don’t mean it petulantly. I just want to know her line of thinking when she decided to write this novel. And on a kind of separate note...basically every misgiving I’ve had about having kids and crossing over from ‘woman’ to ‘someone’s mom’ is laid out here. And I think most women regardless of their current child count will be able to identify with much of what these characters experience. While those who are already parents will probably find their choices affirming, as someone without kids who doesn’t plan on having any, I feel like my reaction is the opposite of what the author intended. The loss of identity coupled with the (still present) societal pressures just further my belief that that’s not what I want.I don’t mean to discourage people from reading it, because I enjoyed my time with Valentine overall. But I feel like I read three-quarters of a book and the resolution was lost somewhere. Maybe someone else who absolutely loved this one will be able to explain to me what I’m missing, I don’t know.

It could be dI was first drawn to this book by the beautiful and eye-catching cover, but after reading the synopsis I immediately added it to my TBR. It could be due to American media and news coverage, but I haven’t been exposed to much of the experiences of the Palestinian people. Any Gaza & West Bank related news in the US has typically been filtered through a strong pro-Israeli lens, which paints an uneven picture of the ongoing conflict in the region. Told as flashbacks between present day Nahr as she is imprisoned in The Cube, an in humane solitary cell in an Israeli prison, and Nahr as she comes of age and into adulthood, Susan Abulhawa gives readers a peek into the struggles refugees face when they are deprived of the safety of their community and home. Moving from Kuwait to Jordan to Palestine, Nahr is forced to grow up fast in order to provide for herself and her family amongst that instability. She goes through a lot, and it’s painful to read at times. There could be some trigger warnings on this book, (view spoiler)[sexual assault, abuse, torture (hide spoiler)], but these details are not added flippantly; they’re included in order to give a realistic depiction of what someone like Nahr could feasibly experience.I think what struck me most while reading was how restrained Nahr’s actions were throughout the novel. I was expecting her to have a darker outlook, a more “radicalized” ideology based on the multitude of injustices and indignities that get thrust upon her again and again. But almost everything she does is for the sake of survival, and even when she occasionally lashes out beyond that, it’s with the expectation that she’ll be hit back ten times as hard in retribution—and she always is. I’m not sure if this is due to to Abulhawa’s ability to write an incredibly sympathetic character or because the treatment of Palestinians is so abhorrent that there’s no way to possibly root against the characters. Honestly, it’s probably a combination of the two; a triumph for an author in the midst of writing devastation. I’m really interested to read more of Abulhawa’s work, especially Mornings in Jenin, which has received some glowing s. There’s something to be said about educating through empathy, and if reading fiction about a place and people which have been historically disregarded helps teach us about Palestine’s over fifty-year occupation by the Israeli military (since 1967), then I’m all for that. The description of the conditions political prisoners live in, the annexation tactics to drive Palestinians from their homes and the actual war crimes that individual soldiers as well as the military in its entirety engage in are breathtakingly despicable. And I’m glad authors like Abulhawa are here and writing about them.The structure of the book worked for me on the whole, but I think the pacing could have been more consistent. I also tried to listen to the audiobook version, and it wasn’t as good as it could have been. Susan Abulhawa narrates her own book and while I appreciate when authors do this sometimes, I don’t think that was the best choice in this case. She spoke so quietly, I had to blast my phone’s speakers in order to make out the words. For works like memoirs and essay collections, it makes more sense for the author to double as a narrator, but for fiction....I don’t know. I think it’s generally better to leave it to the professionals. Maybe she couldn’t find an available narrator of Palestinian descent? Whatever the reason, I preferred reading the physical book to listening to it.Thanks to Natalie for sending me a copy of this book!

Though this is marked as book #1 in many places, including Goodreads, I really can’t imagine diving into this world without having some background knowledge and context for the events occurring. Whether that’s from The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, the several video games or the first season of the Netflix show, I wouldn’t recommend having Blood of Elves be your introduction to Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri.For one thing, there’s so many time jumps! The chapters are massive, so they’re broken up with a few line breaks, but you really have no idea what time or place Andrzej Sapkowski is going to pick up at. I wish that he was more clear, but at this point part of reading a Witcher book is being confused halfway through it until whenever Sapkowski decides to explain what’s going on. It’s just part of the journey! We’re all Dandelion, wandering around, singing about earning coins until Geralt comes swooping in to save the day.Speaking of, Dandelion (Jaskier) is much less insufferable this time around. I take back my wish from my last  that something would eat him. And only two (!!) women completely lose control of their faculties and throw themselves at Geralt for no discernible reason. It’s still ridiculous, and so obviously written by a dude, but at least he didn’t leer at any rogue nipples this time around.The highlight in this book comes in the last chapter, where Ciri and Yennefer are sequestered alone with one another. They are a riot and have some of the best interactions of the series. Solely for that selection of 60-odd pages I will give this one five stars, though the rest was pretty solid as well.

Sometimes I feel like we’re barraged with thrillers and it’s hard to pick one to read next based off of a blurb and hundreds of similarly-styled covers. I don’t remember why I ended up picking this one, but I’m glad I did. Here is a twisty legal thriller about the murder of a white teenage girl (of course), but with a lot more self-awareness than I’ve come to expect from the genre. Jessica Silver is the 15-year-old daughter of a billionaire who has vanished under suspicious circumstances, with her former teacher having been charged with the crime. The book primarily follows present day Maya Seale, a juror from the 2009 case, but also flashes back to her fellow jury members’ perspectives during that time. In trying to draw parallels between this fictional case and the real world, I went looking to see if I could find an equivalent to the character of Lou Silver, if such a man actually exists.He does, if you’re wondering. “The Man Who Owns LA” as the New Yorker called him, in real life would be Philip Anschutz. He’s not exactly the same, obviously. For one, Anschutz is a conservative Christian, not Jewish like Silver. Additionally, he doesn’t have one teenaged daughter, but three grown children who presumably could have teenagers of their own. Is this information relevant at all to the story? Nope, not at all. But he’s a secretive American billionaire that owns just as many assets & businesses, if not more than the fictional Silver family in The Holdout, and I thought that might be interesting to people.My only detraction comes with the ending. It’s not bad, I just wish it had some more elaboration and consideration. (view spoiler)[I wanted the fact that the end result is two innocent black men dying to protect a rich, white family to be emphasized more. I also didn’t think Elaine needed to deliver that huge information dump at the end. Graham Moore had the opportunity to deliver a real Sharp Objects-style ending, and I don’t think he quite got there. I understand the jurors all rallying in the end, to a point, but they way in which they decide this is just a little too neat. It also didn’t feel like Maya or any other characters learned anything, there wasn’t any growth. Again, it was the two black men who paid the price for white women who were protecting themselves. Maya didn’t really even seem to finish drawing the comparison between herself, Jessica and the character of Mayella, who falsely accuses Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird. I feel like Maya sees herself more as Atticus Finch, who is precisely the opposite of her. I don’t know, it didn’t sit just right with me. (hide spoiler)]As a thriller, it’s easy to get sucked into and is a lot of fun if you don’t think about it too much. There’s plenty of red herrings and Moore writes from multiple points of view with ease.

Now while the last set of tales were mostly introductions to some of our main characters, such as Geralt of Rivia and Dandelion the bard, in Sword of Destiny we get to go deeper into relationships between these characters. There’s a good amount of world-building that I’m sure will make reading the first novel of the series, Blood of Elves, that much easier to understand & delve into. And instead of just a list of creatures Geralt either will or will not kill, we meet non-humans who are just as intelligent and sentient as man, but are hunted or hated by most humans. Geralt can relate to the disdain they receive and tries to find amicable resolutions to whatever conflict has arisen—to...somewhat mixed results.[image]The stories this time around aren’t based on traditional folktales, so there’s more freedom to explore without being confined to any preset storyline. But with dragons, dopplers, mermaids and dryads, most of the new magical races introduced are at least somewhat familiar to even casual fantasy fans. The Law of Surprise, which show watchers are probably familiar with, is elaborated on beyond what appeared in The Last Wish, and we finally get to spend more time with young Ciri as she makes her way towards her destiny. [image]I was also happy to see more of Yennefer in this collection. We were introduced to her in The Last Wish, and since then I’ve absolutely fallen in love with the character and the actress who portrays her in the Netflix series. The show has given her more autonomy, and since the show-runner is a woman, there’s less of that leering-male-fantasy aspect at play on screen. The book, however, just had to undercut any moment of power she had almost immediately. In the first story, The Bounds of Reason, she’s stripped almost naked, tied up provocatively, threatened with rape and then a ’good guy’ male character ogles and salaciously mocks her, refusing to look away when she tells him to. (view spoiler)[Seriously, Dandelion is such a fucking creep. Adore him in the show, but I hope he’s eaten by a cockatrice or zeugl in the books. (hide spoiler)]Though the female warriors are just as formidable as Geralt, if not more so, it’s almost like the author can’t let them ‘get away with’ that. They must be brought down a peg, and are sexualized and fetishized in the typical way men write women with a sex drive. One minute ferocious and hardened, then suddenly a giggling, pliable sex kitten. It’s so common to the genre that many readers may not even register it, but it’s just another way to undermine any woman given the slightest bit of agency, and it never stops being disappointing.I don’t want these criticisms to come off like I’m not a fan of the series; I am. In fact, I wouldn’t  something so thoroughly if I didn’t care for it at all. But more and more lately any complaint or even a comment not overwhelmingly positive on a piece of writing or media is taken as a petty condemnation of the work as a whole by someone with an axe to grind. It’s not wrong to want more from the writers and creators we love, especially when it could simply be a blindspot in their point of view, not an intentional exclusion. Feedback works—granted an author is open to it. Someone like Brandon Sanderson, who in interviews has been reflective on his past works and has admitted faults in his previous attempts at writing women. Though I haven’t, many who have read his books noticed a measurable difference.Anyways, I vastly enjoyed these stories, but they do feel like a prequel to the major events of this series.

Beautifully illustrated by Harmony Becker, this is a graphic novel that follows the time the author, acclaimed Japanese-American actor George Takei, spent in American internment camps as a child during the Second World War.It’s a lesson in history that becomes a patriotic rallying cry. There’s plenty of parallels between the internment of immigrants at the southern border or the ban on Muslims entering the country. We acknowledge one injustice just in time to commit another. But despite the appalling conduct, the underlying message is one of hope. The reader is challenged to not just sit by passively, but to take an active role in shaping the way our country is run.Takei’s story is deeply personal, especially when speaking about his family. Woven throughout is a love letter and a thank you to his father, who guided their family through tumultuous times whilst being uncertain himself. It’s a bittersweet realization that not everyone who suffered received even the small vindications offered by the government years later.“Shame is a cruel thing. It should rest on the perpetrators, but they don’t carry it the way victims do.”Every classroom in America would stand to benefit from reading and teaching this graphic novel to their students. It’s both comprehensive in scope and individual to Mr. Takei’s life. It’s easier to follow a child’s story as a child, even into some dark places.

We know generally what happened to Elisa Lam, so is there a point in reading in detail what befell a young woman with her whole life ahead of her? Here, Anderson is attempting to make the case that there is value in examining not only her life and death, but the way we as a true-crime-obsessed society respond to the loss of a very real person.I would generally agree with that assertion, but I still had trouble getting on board with this book. I don’t really think it accomplishes what it set out to do. I’m not going to spoiler tag this piece of information because I feel like at this point it’s common knowledge, but there’s no real evidence of any foul play in the case of Elisa Lam. There was a TON of speculation, which Anderson pours over in detail, even the completely batshit stuff. But the question becomes: Can you write an effective True Crime book if there was in fact no crime? I’m not so sure, and Gone at Midnight didn’t do much to change that impression.Some of the best books in this genre are ones where the author is embedded in the story. They either have a role in the investigation or are somehow connected with the people and events being investigated. The book ends up being a natural extension of their involvement, and this is a distinction I wanted to make with Anderson. He may personally feel as though he’s a part of Elisa’s case, but he is not. Countless people all over the world are drawn to particular crimes, some to the victims themselves. This doesn’t mean they have more of a claim on writing about them at length. Anderson desperately wants to be on the inside of this investigation and clearly deeply identifies with Elisa, but the narrative he’s trying to weave here falls short because, in part, he’s outside of it.To make up for the lack of facts he has to present the audience, Anderson seems to wander off on several tangents that have little to do with his chosen subject. Other infamous crimes are recounted to spice up a chapter or two. He fixates on elements like drones and tracking dogs which the police did not use in this case. He gives credence to the idea that there was some kind of paranormal intervention...i.e. ghosts. It makes him all the more difficult to take seriously. He also has a petty disdain for the police and investigators in this case, seemingly put-off because they wouldn’t give him, a total stranger, access to sensitive information about a woman’s death.I just didn’t care for this book. I wouldn’t say it’s malicious in its intent, just there’s an exploitative quality I can’t quite ignore. Anderson talks a lot about his own mental health, especially whilst reading Lam’s social media posts where she references her own. Perhaps he could have used a similar platform to compare his own struggles with hers instead of trying to commodify it.*Thanks to Kensington Books & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Feb 20, 2020","Mar 03, 2020","Jan 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46184565-gone-at-midnight

I actually finished Little Women several days ago, but have been putting off finally writing the  for it because I was so massively disappointed. Obviously as a book published in 1868-1869 (was originally two volumes), there’s going to be exhaustive literary analysis going back a century and a half. There’s nothing I can say that hasn’t been said a hundred times over but OH WELL that’s really never stopped me before! In all seriousness, I intended on giving this book a thoughtful critique and trying to take into account the time this was written and how it was probably even considered transgressive then and blah blah blah, whatever. But by the end I was so pissed with the direction Alcott was going that I knew this was just going to be a huge rant-y, mostly unproductive , which is more about venting than informing potential readers. Sorry y’all, this ones for me!!!!Everything after this point is going to be a huge spoiler, so only read on if you’ve read the book, seen one of the movies or just don’t care.(view spoiler)[I’ll start with Meg because she’s the oldest and was the first to be totally dropped by the story. Seriously, Meg started off as independent and smart, but is tossed aside like a used rag as soon as she gets married. After Meg had inexplicably agreed to marry her trash husband John Brooke, the only time the author decides to check in on her is to see how not perfect of a wife she’s being. John, who is useless and proud, one of the worst combinations, all but abandons his new wife because she’s ‘always busy caring for their children’ and not the hot young wife he married. These are his actual reasons for staying out all night and ignoring her. And to add insult to injury, one of his worst enablers is Meg’s own mother.This becomes a theme in the book, where one of the girls usually rightfully points out things that are unfair or ridiculous to expect of women, only to be subjected to a Marmie Lecture® about why, actually, it’s good to be miserable all the time. Marmie’s speech this time went something like, “Ah, I too use to want to take care of my children (you), but then my husband (your father) got grumpy and I saw it was actually all my fault!” See how that works! You can not simply expect your husband to help out, you actually should just feel lucky he wants you at all anymore because you’re 22 and basically decrepit!! But anyways, on to Beth! The most likable because she has no personality. I’m not being mean, that’s literally a theme of the book, except Alcott calls it being “agreeable”. I never want to hear that word again. It’s just code for ‘do not give any indication you have any opinion whatsoever’, basically going along with whatever the man in the room says. This rule has made such a strong impression on Beth that she is genuinely afraid of anyone not a blood relative to her and she tries to physically hide herself whenever a stranger is present. The elephant in the room with Beth is that she famously dies near the end. The sickness came early on in the book and made a feeble girl practically invalid for the rest of the story. The character of Beth is based on Alcott’s sister, Lizzie, who died at 23. And though I’m sure it was comforting for the author to try to ascribe meaning to a beloved sibling who died so young, narratively, I really hated what she did with Beth’s character. It felt like as soon as Beth might start showing interests and goals outside of being ‘the quiet one’, that her agency was stripped away from her. I’m sorry, no teenage girl is actually ‘happy’ she’s dying young because she couldn’t figure out what she wanted to do when she grew up. That’s clearly an author’s issue in not being able to imagine Beth beyond the flimsy character development she’s had so far. It’s a way to make both writer and reader more comfortable with the death of a young girl, and I’m not here for it.I’m going to do Amy and Jo together, because they felt like they were written mostly as foils for each other. Amy is prim and Jo is messy. Jo acts like a tomboy and Amy is a girly-girl. Amy follows the rules and Jo likes to break them. I didn’t mind this characterization, but it was interesting to see them clash and figure out who they were when they were apart from one another. What I disliked the most about them was the romantic direction Alcott took with them. We could see the budding relationship between Laurie and Jo, and it came as no surprise when he proposed. I wasn’t surprised when she said no, either, in fact I actually really liked that choice for her. She’s fiercely independent and has shown no interest in any form of ‘settling down’, so no, I don’t think she should have ended up with Laurie. But oh my god Amy?????? Her and Laurie make even LESS sense together than him and Jo!!!!! He literally says “when he couldn’t have one sister he took the other, and was happy” WHATIs Amy not allowed to have her own romance? Her own dreams? Must she get everything second-hand from her sisters—even a husband?!? Amy from the first half of the book would NEVER have married Laurie, she wouldn’t dream of it!! Which brings me to the second most disappointing pairing of the book: Jo and whatever his name.There’s just no reason for this. She never wanted a husband, but if she did for whatever reason, WHY would she pick this middle-aged German man she knew for a few months over a boy her age who she’s been best friends with her entire life??? She wouldn’t, it makes no sense. And he’s not supportive of her! He literally shames her out of writing for money because he morally objects to some ‘popular’ stories that appear in papers. Ohhhh noooooo, not a story someone enjoys reading, THE HORROR!!! He lectures her at every opportunity, is twice her age, is ugly, poor and takes advantage of his position as her teacher to make a move on her. He’s gross, I hate him.  (hide spoiler)]As a coming of age story, this was terrible. I could not think of a worse moral for young women to pull from a book then ‘you cease to matter as an individual as soon as you’re married’, which is my assumption of what Alcott was going for. If you want to be entirely turned off the idea of marriage, I would recommend Little Women. Or maybe just read Part 1, which is superior in every way. If I average the star rating of the first part with the second, I guess that averages to three stars, which is the nicest I can do for this “classic”.

My biggest issue with this book was that tonal change. Natasha Ngan flipped back and forth between adolescent frivolity and the brutality of war in an almost jarring way. As just about everyone in the story at this point is well into adulthood, it seemed ridiculous that in the midst of fleeing for their lives they dole out so many cringey dick jokes or that one highly-trained demon fighter would refer to another as an “incredibly cute boy”, out loud amongst their peers. The romance in the last book was also so much more, well, earned. It was dangerous to develop feelings and even more so to act on them. But now, when the stakes are different, but arguably just as high, most love interests come off as superficial afterthoughts. As an aside, this book has such “Everybody is GAY!!” energy that the only evidence of straight people is the fact that clearly there are some still procreating. Unfortunately, the myriad of gayness wasn’t enough to save the plotting of this one.I feel like so many characters were oversimplified and turned into sass-monsters that it undermined the entire buildup of their personal journeys up to this point. I knocked Leigh Bardugo for doing this in some of her books as well—it’s really not necessary for everyone to be so biting and sarcastic all of the time. I get it’s YA, but please work on the time and place of these exchanges. Lei seems to backslide as a character here as well. She acts before thinking, making rash decisions and endangering those around her; I call this type of main character the Dunce Gryffindor. They are, unfortunately, very popular in Young Adult fantasy, which is a major bummer for me, a full grown adult who (still) loves the genre.Like I mentioned initially, this book is extremely readable and a good time generally. But based off of my expectations for it after reading Girls of Paper and Fire, it’s a bit of a disappointment. At least they talk significantly less about bathing in this one. I will never understand why so many authors love to go into such bath-related detail, but it’s apparently a thing....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Feb 11, 2020","Feb 17, 2020","Jan 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45554140-girls-of-storm-and-shadow

I probably also shouldn’t be making drug jokes right after reading Dopesick, but I don’t have a better way to describe it! Karin Slaughter’s books just do it for me—as soon as I finish one I’m immediately looking around to see if there’s another. Luckily we got The Silent Wife less than a year after The Last Widow, and honestly:[image]I had to double check, but I believe this is the first police/crime thriller I’ve read since the George Floyd protests, at least where the protagonists are almost entirely members of law enforcement. It’s interesting to revisit a beloved series with this different point of view, almost as if I’m seeing some things for the first time. While there may have been time for some tweaks, based on the international publication days I’m assuming pretty much all of The Silent Wife was written without this added layer of scrutiny. Therefore I was really pleasantly surprised with how well the material holds up.Slaughter has never been one to hold back, especially when depicting some of the realities for women and non-white members of the community and police force. Spoiler for Triptych: (view spoiler)[Hell the first villain that we see Will Trent chase down is a rapist cop. (hide spoiler)] But I was also glad to see that she didn’t gloss over prison mistreatment and all kinds of systemic corruption. It was a bit of a reality check, though, to see my beloved Will and Faith toeing the ‘Thin Blue Line’, even if they did so reluctantly. The Silent Wife is definitely a book about cops—I mean duh it’s a police procedural. But if you’re hesitant to see any glamorization of the law enforcement given the uptick in violence against protestors and the constant over-policing of communities of color, this one definitely isn’t going to make anyone feel all warm and fuzzy towards the boys in blue. Which brings us to the elephant in almost every room of the Trent series, Jeffery. One of the best ways Slaughter is able to pass a critical eye over some of her previous books, special attention to several of the *ahem* questionable members of the Grant County Police force of the past, is through utilizing flashbacks. In the case Trent and Mitchell are following-up on, they’re led towards one of former Chief Jeffery Tolliver’s prior cases. Every piece of information they collect is a knock against him and the people who worked under him. It’s yet another Jeffery-shaped strain put on Sara and Will’s relationship, but it’s also tough for anyone who’s carrying a badge to admit when mistakes are made at any level. I did love seeing Jeffery again, even in this manner, and even though it meant seeing Lena (...more",Notes are private!,0,152,1,"Jul 24, 2020","Jul 29, 2020","Dec 29, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53065750-the-silent-wife

Told as a series of stories about a mother to her daughter, from the perspectives of her former neighbor and classmate, we follow Liya as she tries to uncover who her mother really was. The neighbor, Zhu Wen, lived next door to Liya and her mother, Su Lan, when they lived in Shanghai. Her classmate, Yongzong, was an academic rival of Su Lan’s as teenagers who knew her well into young adulthood. Both of these people had complicated relationships with Liya’s mother and ended up being more formative in one another’s lives than any of them could have imagined. There’s not a lot of storyline to give away; most of the narrative is in the past tense being recounted by one person to another. The biggest plot points take place during the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, and the student-led democracy protests act as a backdrop to the events of the book. This works well with the family conflicts surrounding Liya and Su Lan, but also are significant moments in China’s history that the state refuses to acknowledge today. The portions I found the most difficult to get through concerned Yongzong and whatever bullshit he was doing. It’s becoming harder and harder for me to empathize with emotional, mediocre men who blame and use women to cover up their own failings. The fact that so much was familiar in him just highlights how common it is for women to pander to the petty whims of supposed “good” men. I’ll admit to skimming parts of his explanations.I liked this book a lot overall, especially Jin’s writing. I’m a sucker for a good roving perspective, so this was right up my alley. It’s not a fast-paced book, and I can see how some readers might not appreciate the meandering storytelling the author prefers here. I can’t give this higher than four stars, even though there’s not anything wrong, per say. Just a bit slow and not a lot actually, well, happens. The ending is pretty bleak, too.

There’s further crossover between the Stories and our world as we follow Alice as she tries to unravel another mystery. While the Hinterland itself was once following her, now she’s haunted by new foes and old friends alike. And if the previous storytellers are all out of the picture, then who’s really pulling the strings?I had a great time with The Night Country and so will anyone who liked The Hazel Wood. The setting expands, but still maintains that messy interconnectivity that I loved from Albert’s last novel. I never know where she’ll lead us next, but fingers crossed this isn’t the last we hear from Alice-Three-Times and her companions.While reading this series I kept wondering, is this really young adult? Yes it’s about teenagers/20-somethings, but it doesn’t feel the same way other YA fantasy does. I can’t tell if it’s just breaking some tropes or has a different tone, or if it’s been miscategorized. I’ve seen some female fantasy authors talk about this on twitter; their books about female characters are classified as YA, but books by men about male characters are considered adult fantasy. Someone pointed out that many of the “High Fantasy” by men featured sexual assault, which doesn’t really appear in this series or many of the supposed YA by women. While the Hazel Wood series is mostly chaste, consent or not, it’s fairly violent and has cursing, discussion of suicide and some pretty brutal deaths. I just wonder who makes the distinction and if there’s any explicit criteria to reference.But after finishing it, what this book really did was make me desperately want to read Tales from the Hinterland. Don’t hold back on me now Althea!! Though it’s supposed to be slated for Fall 2020, The Night Country was pushed back from 2019 to January 2020, so who knows when we’ll finally get the elusive collection that prompted the whole adventure.

I have been meaning to read Julia Alvarez for some time, In the Time of the Butterflies, How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, etc., but I just kept putting it off for some reason. Afterlife has propelled her works back to the front of the TBR pile. So many emotions and deep reflections were packed into this petite novel, I can only imagine what she does with even more pages.The best thing about this book is the dynamic between Antonia and her sisters. I so rarely get to read things where a woman in her sixties is the main character, and this book has four of them! Alvarez writes Izzy, Tilly, Mona and Antonia with such life and candor that I can’t imagine that they aren’t based on real people. When I read the description I was drawn in by the mention of “a pregnant, undocumented teenager on her doorstep”, but I absolutely stayed for the interfamilial conflict. At the heart of this story is grief and loss, relayed with such raw compassion that—yeah, I’ll admit it—I cried a bit. We watch Antonia struggle with loss long after the sympathy wave has dissipated. She pinballs from one crisis to another in order to distract herself from the empty space, both literal and figurative, that now inhabits her life. She’s making decisions and responding to situations differently than she had before, and is left wondering which choices are her own. (I’ve recently discovered one of my most read sub-genres is ‘Death’, so I guess this is right up my own morbid alley)The question that Antonia, Alvarez and the reader keeps being drawn back to is a philosophical one: what do we owe one another? And also to an extent, what do we owe ourselves? There’s no easy answers provided here. None as binary as ‘nothing!’ or ‘everything!’ The answer lies probably somewhere in the middle, in the excruciatingly non-specific “something”. Yes, we owe each other something.

It had some middling, mixed s and there’s just so much YA fantasy out there, I was just gonna skip it. But I got an ARC of the sequel, The Night Country, which comes out January 7, 2020 and decided that I’d try Melissa Albert’s series out for myself. So after putting it off as long as I could, I finally got around to reading the first installment, The Hazel Wood.And wow, this was so different from every other book I’ve read in this genre. It’s kind of a chaotic, dark fairytale that’s about chaotic, dark fairytales. I’m a total sucker for stories-within-stories, so I was hooked right away when I found out the plot centered around a mysterious lost book of magical fables by a reclusive author who dropped off the face of the earth. I also love when women, especially young women and girls, in stories are allowed to be inexplicably angry. The main character, Alice, and her eventual male companion, Finch, just do it for me. There’s no forced romance or stolen glances. On their journey they get genuinely pissed and snap at each other without some contrived sexual tension. I felt like Albert understood the tropes of the genre, so she was able to avoid some of the more grating ones.I get why some people didn’t click with it, though. There’s a lot that happens that’s obscured from the view of the reader. Since Alice also has no idea what’s going on, it didn’t bother me the way it usually does when a character is withholding a looming secret just for the sake of it. You’re not quite sure whether something is significant, and a bunch of weird shit just comes out of left field, and you’ve got to just roll with it. I was sucked in almost immediately, but after reading other s I understand the complaints. I would suggest checking it out for yourself. The Hazel Wood comes down to preference rather than being distinctly good or bad. For me, it was a terrifyingly beautiful fantasy land that seems just out of reach from reality. The Hinterland falls somewhere between my best dreams and my worst nightmares, which I believe is how it’s intended to come off.

But also because it seemed to be the most action-packed; reading the blurb felt like a thriller or heist movie. I mean, there’s a massive kidnapping of powerful people from all over the world by South American terrorists at a Japanese man’s birthday party featuring a famous American singer. But what it ended up being was a lot of ...sitting .....waiting .........and translating. That’s probably my mistake for interpreting the description incorrectly. Patchett has a pretty distinct writing style and point of view that I should have picked up on earlier. Bel Canto isn’t plot-driven, it’s all about the interactions between individuals ensnared in each others lives as they deal with difficult circumstances. Her characters are rich and layered and I never tire of meeting a new one. So if you’re looking for something fast-paced and suspenseful, this probably won’t be for you. Not to say this book is boring, it’s not, but that’s probably due to the writing. Patchett writes mundanity with such an elegant flair that you might not have even noticed you just read 20 pages about the vocal exercises involved with singing opera. ....Which was one of the bigger sticking points for me. I just don’t think opera is as big of a deal as, apparently, everyone in this novel thinks it is. Won’t go too deep into the specifics without a spoiler tag, (view spoiler)[but it’s just utterly bizarre and pushing believability that a group of 59, mostly men, half teenage boys who have never seen television before, would be so incredibly moved by an opera soprano that they crown her their unofficial princess. How is everyone proclaiming their love for her after, what, a week or less? I feel like Patchett may be one of those people who deeply appreciates opera and maybe she’s projecting a bit here, but every teenage or young guy I know would have zero interest in listening to that kind of music (hide spoiler)]. I would sum it up with this: Roxanne successfully negotiating with terrorists:[image]And sorry to keep using the spoiler tag, but I really don’t have any other option!

It makes sense, especially once I found out this was inspired loosely on the Japanese embassy hostage crisis of 1996 in Peru, so it couldn’t really end up any other way, could it? I wasn’t clear whether the captives ever acknowledged that they had Stockholm-Syndrome or if they kept the facade going, but maybe that was intentional.

It’s historical fiction set in the 1950s that follows indigenous characters reckoning with another attempt by the US government to erase their tribal presence. So while I didn’t connect with the novel, I’m incredibly interested in the historical elements of the story. Interestingly, while I was reading The Night Watchman, I saw a relatively small story break that had some parallels to the struggles faced by Thomas and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.In Cape Cod, Massachusetts the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe has been a recognized tribe of the Wampanoag people since 2007. On March 27, 2020, the tribe was notified that their reservation was being ‘disestablished’ and their land taken out of trust by federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior. 321 acres of tribal land are being snatched by the government in a way that hasn’t been done since the very same Termination Policy that’s at the forefront of this book.But what launched this sudden backslide in American native policy—in the midst of a pandemic, no less? Their very status as a tribe was challenged because a billionaire, Neil Bluhm, was denied a bid to build a casino on tribal land. As retribution he funded an attack on their legitimacy as a tribe. This case was heard by no court and its status revoked solely by the current administration. The president even tweeted about it while invoking a native slur. This particular move is unprecedented, but it comes out of the same playbook our country has been using against indigenous populations for centuries. It’s cruel, unnecessary, unfair and likely to happen again.I encourage anyone who was outraged by the way the characters in this book were treated to extend those feelings towards the very real native communities that are still being targeted today. And for those in Massachusetts, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey have pledged to fight this decision, but no matter where you live it probably wouldn’t hurt to reach out to your representatives....more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Mar 23, 2020","Apr 05, 2020","Dec 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46206688-the-night-watchman

All this to say: don’t let this cover deceive you. It’s anything but the light or glitzy novel you might be expecting. This is a story about female power and breaking free of constricting community and family ties. It’s relentless and strong in a way that only a story about girls and women could be. In Godshot, Bieker shines her golden spotlight on parts of American society that the majority of us passively choose to ignore. Religious leaders that can act with impunity, domestic violence hidden behind closed doors, child abuse, child brides, devastating poverty and lack of proper education—these are all things we don’t hesitate to decry in so-called ‘3rd-world’ nations, but neglect to address at home. They’re woven into the fabric of our country, as American as apple pie, and yet just enough obscured from our day-to-day that we can convince ourselves that they don’t exist. But they do. Characters like the tenacious Lacey May, her susceptible mother, Louise, and the rest of the inhabitants of the fictional town of Peaches, California represent real, living people. I haven’t read a lot of the books this one is being compared to, The Girls or White Oleander, but for ones I have, like The Handmaid's Tale, I see it to a point. But I think the story here goes beyond the circumstances these female characters are thrust into. At the heart of this book are the ways the women close to us can lift us up out of hardship, and sometimes how they let us down. It’s complicated and can be difficult to navigate, but those relationships are almost always worth pursuing.I’m excited to see more from Chelsea Bieker. And if I’m not mistaken, there was an Easter Egg for her upcoming book, Cowboys and Angels, hidden in Godshot. It sounds like something that would be right up Lacey May’s alley!TW: Sexual assault against minor(s); religious cults*Thanks to Catapult & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Mar 29, 2020","Apr 04, 2020","Dec 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41719463-godshot

This is a departure for the YA Sci-fi/Fantasy writer, and despite her Legend series being published first, I was surprised to learn she’d written The Kingdom of Back prior to it.The tone of this reminds me of Pan's Labyrinth, but centered around the childhoods of Maria Anna and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, known to one another as Nannerl and Woferl, respectively. In order to escape the wretched unfairness of being the child breadwinners of their family and the clear & constant favoring of Woferl by their father, Nannerl and her brother either discover or invent the mystical Kingdom of Back, where they can abandon their earthly troubles for new ones. Taking place in Europe in the mid-1760s, so before the United States was even a country, the gender roles are devestatingly restrictive. Passages like this are utterly heartbreaking, but somehow still resonate today:“He tells you to play, so you play. He tells you to curtsy, so you curtsy. He tells you what you are meant to do and what you are meant not to do, so you do and you do not do. He tells you not to be angry, so you smile, you turn your eyes down, you are quiet and do exactly as he says in the hopes that this is what he wants, and then one night you realize that you have given him so much of yourself that you are nothing but the curtsy and the smile and the quiet. That you are nothing.”As an older sister of two brothers, the youngest also being nearly five years my junior, I really felt for Nannerl immensely. The times where she would be blamed for not controlling her brother if he acted out or would be expected to care for him in lieu of the his two parents, whilst being a child herself, were so relatable that I almost didn’t believe that Lu was an only child. The love Nannerl has for her little brother despite how her family or the world treats them is steadfast and everlasting, no matter how frustrated she may be with him at the time.I feel lucky that I got to read this book several months before publication, and I’m glad that Marie Lu was finally able to publish it. I’d really love if she wrote even more standalones. I’m sure publishers like to put out sweeping series with loyal followings, but it would have been a shame if we never got to enjoy this sparkling, lyrical novel. If you’re an adult who doesn’t usually read YA, I’d still recommend picking this one up. It clocks in as Historical Fantasy before any other genre, and despite focusing on two adolescent characters, has lessons and reflections on loving your sibling that stretch far beyond whatever age you currently are.*Thanks to Penguin Teen & BookishFirst for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Dec 02, 2019","Jan 09, 2020","Dec 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45872054-the-kingdom-of-back

I know there was some backlash at the sharing of the 2019 Man Booker Prize, between Evaristo and The Testaments author, Margaret Atwood, but it’s not necessarily such a bad thing. That is, if the lesser-known author’s primary motivation was to have her book read by as many people as possible. As Evaristo said when calling her win “a real game changer,” she went on to say, “It means my work gets out there to a much wider audience around the world.” Certainly the novel speaks for itself, but sharing the title with a literary figure like Atwood could only boost her public profile, even if it feels like a cop-out for the judges to split their votes between her and the first black female recipient. The book itself is split into chapters, with each chapter divided into three closely-connected characters’ stories, where the chapters with one another are more loosely related. Evaristo has a distinct writing style, but within that style each person she brings to life is wonderfully their own. She’s able to flip between mother and daughter, or between two contrasting sides of a long-standing friendship with ease. She writes as an immigrant making her way in a very different England, to their first generation children all the way to their second or third generation grandchildren who have clashing experiences to their parents and grandparents. What’s most striking to someone like me, who’s neither black nor British, is not how dissimilar some of their lives are, but how much of the same bullshit is consistent throughout generations.The only time I’ve ever really heard anything about black Brits has been in the context of the entertainment industry, which Evaristo touches on as well. Actors like Cynthia Ervio and Daniel Kaluuya have found mainstream success in American films such as Harriet and Get Out, respectively, where roles in the UK have been lacking. It stirred up a conversation, especially on platforms like Twitter, where some felt like there were certain African American parts that should be filled by African American actors. The rebuttal by Kaluuya brought up the point that this was another way of ‘othering’ black Brits who have been subjects of discrimination across the pond as well. He finishes his statement with, “I resent that I have to prove that I’m black.”While this debate isn’t something I feel needs my own hot-take, I did appreciate where the author was able to incorporate these ideas into her characters and their stories. Who has the ‘true black British experience’? Is it the immigrants who made their own way, leaving their homes behind? Is it the later generations who have only known the UK and their lives there? Is there a threshold for suffering one has to meet in order to be considered ‘authentic’? Can privilege be granted later on or is it inherent? I loved reading Evaristo muse over these questions; questions I didn’t have before ever picking up Girl, Woman, Other.I don’t know what an adaptation of this would look like, but I know I’d love to see it. Whether it’s stage, streaming, film or television, I think this would be a great candidate for some new, innovative storytelling. And with so many unique and interesting characters, there’d be plenty of parts for black actors from all over the world. Maybe Atwood would even be interested in producing it with some of the split Man Booker prize money. Who knows? Even if there isn’t a production in the works, I will definitely be picking up the next work Bernardine Evaristo decides to put out....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jan 14, 2020","Jan 23, 2020","Dec 01, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41081373-girl-woman-other

There’s the attractive, young victim woman who’s mere existence is enough to give reason to her attacker(s). The heroine that’s icy or cold or ‘strong’ or bitter, whatever seemingly innocuous adjective she’s assigned that means more than just the word itself. Maybe there’s a bubbly friend or an insecure one who inexplicably calls herself “fat and slow” to a group of mostly men. I guess I just checked out before I even got into the story. And the men were, whew, not great. From the totally invasive and stalker-like cop who is ‘just checking in’ on random women he doesn’t know, to literally every town resident with eyes & a penis constantly leering at a teenager, as if that’s normal and acceptable. I couldn’t begin to list them all even if I wanted to, there were just so many names dumped on us at the beginning. I also don’t accept ‘welp, it’s a small town’ as an excuse for every bizarre fixation or inappropriate behavior. Really, any book that unironically expresses the sentiment that, “A woman that attractive to men didn’t usually have that many female friends,” is gonna be a huge UGH from me, dawg.

Not slow-burning mysteries, not courtroom dramas, but truly skin-tingling, suspenseful novels that are so engrossing you completely shut out the world while reading them. Maybe you think you know what’s about to happen next, but that’s all by design. The author lets you feel like you have a handle on the plot only to rip the rug from beneath your feet. For me in 2019, that book also happened to be the most popular on Goodreads this year, The Silent Patient, so 2020 is going to have its work cut out for it. I try not to go into most of the Suspense/Thriller/Mystery genre with these expectations, though, because it often leads to disappointment. And not every one of those books needs that same heightened level of hair-raising tension to tell a good story. But the s for The Other People have been excellent. I went into this cautiously optimistic. I’ve had C.J. Tudor in my periphery, but never got around to reading The Chalk Man or The Hiding Place. Just about every person I follow has left it a glowing , so it got added to my already daunting 2020 releases TBR. Maybe this is a lot of pressure to put on a book being published in January—there’s still eleven more months of potential releases that may still take that top spot. But long-winded introduction aside, my question going into this book is a simple one: Does it live up to the hype?My answer is going to have to be yes. It’s still a little early to start divvying out ‘Best Of’ accolades, but of the half a dozen or so upcoming releases I’ve gotten the chance to dive into, it’s currently my top ranked thriller. Tudor wastes no time advancing into the thick of the plot. Gabe finds himself living a parent’s worst nightmare—something that’s too horrific to possibly be true. Something has happened to his daughter. His wife has been killed. And three years after those events he’s still a man possessed, chasing ghosts and making little headway until a sudden break in the case. We follow him down rabbit hole after rabbit hole without respite, even when the whole world seems to be conspiring to get him to stop.There’s two other perspectives, one of a young mother and another a woman and girl on the run. They’re all haunted by seemingly independent circumstances, but how separate are we really from the other people around us? The author did an exceptional job in weaving each of these threads before tying them all up together. I appreciated that there weren’t any loose ends left dangling; there’s no questions unanswered except for the more existential ones.I didn’t want to talk this up too much, but there’s just so much predictability in a genre that’s supposed to keep you guessing, so I get super excited when I find something great. But in an attempt to temper expectations a bit...I don’t think the story needed the paranormal/magical element(s); they don’t end up being that consequential. But I will say that usually when authors throw in some fantastical bits, they’re using them as an out after writing themselves into a corner. That’s not the case with The Other People. It’s just an additive, a stylistic choice, not a crutch. Also, minor spoiler, minor nitpick: (view spoiler)[All the older people who somehow figured out how to order hits against their enemies on the elusive ‘Dark Web’ cracked me up. My mom is in her fifties and if I unplugged her router she’d probably just have to get a new computer. (hide spoiler)]This is just a well-paced, riveting, nicely constructed thriller that I needed to finish in one sitting. I’m not normally good at that, which is why I always have several books going at once. The increasing, building intensity wouldn’t let me put it down and do anything else.

I had no idea what type of book would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but this left quite the impression. All I can say is that this novel had maybe the best payoff for any book I remember reading. I absolutely adore (Janina) Duszejko. Her character just became more and more likable to me as the story went on. With every new idiosyncrasy revealed, I was increasingly enamored. By the end there was really nothing that she could do which would turn me off of her. Along with her band of misfits, whom are lovingly given nicknames like Oddball, Dizzy and Good News, I can guarantee that even if you don’t take to her personally, that this is a collection of characters unlike any you’ve encountered before.I can’t go too much into the plot. It’s just too hard to explain without giving things away, but I can say it all begins with the sudden death of Ms. Duszejko’s neighbor. She also provides the reader with poignant observations and biting humor, especially in regard to her fellow man. She’s an older woman, unmarried and living alone, who believes heavily in astrology and is an unabashed vegetarian that has no problem making her opinion known. So clearly she’s going to ruffle a few feathers, especially with the predictably dull type of patriarchal bullshit that inhabits many rural, conservative towns.If there’s one book I can implore you to finish, even if it seems like you’re going nowhere fast slowly, it would be this one. I promise, it’s worth it. This won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but I just can not emphasize enough how much I appreciated this novel.

When we need someone to step up, they hedge. They look out for themselves, just like their supreme leader taught them.Maybe this doesn’t seem relevant to this book, beyond subject matter, but it is. I’m so fucking sick of these cash-grab pretender “tell-all’s”. Publishers throw money at them because idiots like me and thousands of others across the country keep reading them because maybe it’ll bring some, I don’t fucking know, ‘clarity’?

Despite being “the world’s most widely read Spanish-language author”, I was unfamiliar with her before picking up A Long Petal of the Sea. Nope, I was simply drawn in by the historical context, blurb and how beautiful the book art was—like the cover slut I am.Adding her to the list of Acclaimed-Authors-I’ve-Never-Heard-Of, I ended up doing some research on her history and past books. Apparently the literary snobs of Chile don’t like Allende’s work, which honestly just makes me like her more. I was also surprised to see her own surname pop up in the book itself, as that of the former President of Chile, Salvador Allende. He was her father’s first cousin, and later his daughter, also named Isabel Allende [Bussi], was the first woman elected President of the Senate in Chile.But the former president wasn’t the only real person represented as a character in this novel. The two most significant examples being, Pablo Neruda and Elisabeth Eidenbenz. Neruda was a Chilean poet who’s poems begin each chapter of the book, and who was close with both the former president and one of the two fictional main characters, Victor Dalmau. The other real person, Elisabeth, was instrumental in getting Victor and Roser to safety...always in the nick of time. This seemed to be a theme in the book. Victor and Roser would fall into circumstances of the world around them, almost always entirely out of their control, and then would be saved by a friend in a high place before there could be much lasting damage. Honestly, for multiple-time refugees that survived all kinds of persecution, poverty and internment, they actually ended up being pretty privileged. This is one of my two complaints with the book, that it relies too heavily on real historical figures to the point where the fictional characters feel unsubstantial in comparison. The other thing was that her writing was really expositional. It read more like a really long recap than a meaningful examination of political conflict and war or how that impacts the average person. I feel like I barely knew Roser and Victor at all, despite knowing their entire biographies. I kept waiting to be swept away, but that momentum just never came.I will say that with Allende’s closeness to the subject matter, you get a really comprehensive historical account of those parts of Catalan and Chilean history. You may go into it with an idea of the politics surrounding the region, but I left with a lot more insight into how countries like Chile, Venezuela, etc. came to be the way that they are currently (spoiler: it’s the US’ doing). I’m not sure if I’ll read more of Allende’s work, her writing style may not be for me, but I appreciate her contributions to authentic Latin & South American storytelling....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Feb 07, 2020","Feb 13, 2020","Nov 14, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45897568-a-long-petal-of-the-sea

Eating ritual foods? What about a deer’s heart? So if she’s unseen and unheard, who prepares the sins food? And if she stole a loaf of bread, would Jean Valjean be a Sin Eater too? I decided to just dive in. With the exception of the Jean Valjean one, all of my previous questions were answered. It’s absolutely insane that this is historical fiction. Megan Campisi conveniently provides a list of foods and their corresponding sins at the beginning of the book. The job of Sin Eater is not highly coveted and in May’s case is clearly a punishment, but some of that list man... The foods are a mix of delicious sounding (honey cakes) and basically inedible (eel pie), but they seem pretty haphazardly assigned. Except for ones like rape and murder, where they make you eat a raw (animal) body part, I don’t see any food that makes much sense paired with their sin.But that’s probably part of what drew Campisi to this particular sect of historical Christianity. Similar to the nonsensical superstitions in The Mercies, people don’t need to have a sound reasoning to victimize one another. They just need a heaping amount of fear and some institutional power to point them towards a suitable scapegoat. I was once again both astonished and not at all surprised how quickly a community can turn on its own members with the slightest provocation. “I can’t be cursed. I am a curse.”Sin Eater is a highly localized story that’s greatest strength is in the main character, May. Yes the time period and heightened paranoia it produces is interesting and well-done, but it’s May that will hold the reader’s attention. Without her I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been too keen to finish this novel, as I found a lot of the ‘eating’ scenes pretty gnarly. Nonetheless, I was often unable to tear myself away from May’s journey from a lonely & hungry teenager to a self-actualized, shameless member of the damned. *Thanks to Atria Books & Goodreads for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Mar 16, 2020","Mar 23, 2020","Nov 14, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52185082-sin-eater

I read Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s historical fantasy plotted around an ancient Mayan god of death a little less than a year ago and have been hoping for more from her ever since. With Untamed Shore coming out February 11th and the absolutely seductive-sounding Mexican Gothic arriving in June this year, I’m beginning to wonder if Moreno-Garcia herself has made a deal with an ancient spirit to keep churning out these utterly unique and appealing projects, one after the other.The book itself was a little slow to start, with not much happening until about a third of the way in, and even after that there wasn’t a lot of action til the very end. But that ending, my god, it’s satisfying. I probably wouldn’t really classify it as a thriller, either, but more of a domestic suspense. That’s not really my favorite sub-genre, but I still plodded through because I really loved the setting. Viridiana lives in the small town of Desengaño in the state of Baja California, Mexico. The major industry of her quiet beach town is fishing, with many still catching and killing sharks, despite the overall drop in profitability. The entire village is in a plateaued decline with tourism all but dried up, so when three Americans arrive carrying with them the allure of a world outside of what Viridiana can even imagine, she gets swept up in their plots, in hopes it will help her carve out a new life for herself far away.Some of the characterization is a bit heavy-handed, especially the dialogue. There’s also very little mystery surrounding the events of the novel, but that doesn’t mean you won’t still be on edge. I liked Gods of Jade and Shadow more than this and am desperately awaiting Mexican Gothic, but all in all this was a solid performer by Moreno-Garcia.*Thanks to Polis Books & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,73,1,"Jan 19, 2020","Jan 24, 2020","Nov 12, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/48657701-untamed-shore

How do you even begin to rate and  something this upsetting? Seriously, Kate Elizabeth Russell, how did you even write it? It’s truly impressive what she was able to do with My Dark Vanessa. The star rating and any the critique of the writing (which is excellent btw) doesn’t seem nearly as important as the meaningful discussions that have been happening since before the release date. So yes, five stars, but that’s not how I think we need to measure the impact of a work like this.Vanessa is such a complex character. So naive, so frustrating and so much of our own worst impulses blatantly on display. Her fate seems both random and predestined, and Russell doesn’t spare us from the associated ‘what if’s’. What if any of the adults had noticed sooner? What if someone decided to actually do something once they did? What if there was a system in place that considered safeguarding students more important than protecting the reputation of institutions? As much as anything else, this is a story of everyone who failed Vanessa when she needed them the most.It’s absolutely excruciating watching this man pluck a girl with so much promise from her life and utterly derail it. It’s from the moment he zeroed in on her, a girl already isolated from her peers, makes her feel special for it and then pulls her further away from the people around her. Years and years later, she’s still entangled in him, unable to break free from the unhealthy behaviors cultivated as an abused teenager. The gaslighting is what got me the most. This man assuages his guilt by pretending like she’s pushing for it all, when it’s clear how much he’s steering her actions, based on both the verbal and nonverbal feedback she reacts with. Even if Vanessa’s mind won’t admit there’s something wrong happening, her body knows. She keeps having all of these negative reactions to what’s happening, but can’t process them or what they mean. Her gut instinct in wanting him to get caught, throwing the phone after hanging up with him, etc. That’s what gives me hope for the people that Vanessa represents, that eventually they’ll be able to trust those feelings over the ones that have been hurting them.I can’t remember feeling this much venom towards a fictional character before. I don’t even want to type out his name. He mentions to Vanessa how ”hungry” she makes him, as if she’s something to be consumed. Her young body, her youth, her innocence...she’s all for him. When I came to the part where he considered Vanessa “too old” to even hold an erection for at 27, I had such a guttural disgusted response—I had to stop and walk away.(view spoiler)[The only regret I feel towards Strane that man is in the way he died. I wish Vanessa and an army of survivors were able to run him down on horseback, like fearsome Valkyries, charging as he ran away in terror. I wanted him to be confronted publicly, repeatedly and relentlessly with his own actions and choices over and over again until he was begging for release. I wanted one of the girls he preyed upon to have the honor of flipping the switch or pulling the trigger, and I wanted him to know it was her who was doing it.Because there was no way he would ever truly feel remorse, I wanted him to feel pain, one way or another. But that’s not how it happens, how it ever seems to happen. Instead he chose the most cowardly way an abuser can go, by his own hand and delivering one final kick in the gut to all of his victims, especially Vanessa.  (hide spoiler)]Honestly, this  is probably more for my own processing of what I just read than to educate any potential reader. I don’t think I’ve really criticized anything beyond the characters who we’re meant to hate. Is this book too long? I don’t know. I would have taken a while to finish it no matter the length.

I listened to the song before reading, and I still found the start of the book very abrupt, so I can only imagine what a person going in blindly would think. It’s written well, if a bit repetitive. Nothing is so complex that it needs to be repeated multiple times; once you get your bearings the story is not difficult to follow. I would have loved to explore the lore a bit more, but there’s only so far you can go in 170-odd pages. What the author does really well is explore the idea of shared history, memories, pain.

Inspired by a real crime, What’s Left of Me Is Yours is a mystery where we already know the killer, a romance that sours and a family drama located in the heart of Tokyo. I had no knowledge of the ‘wakaresaseya’ profession before beginning, but trust that Stephanie Scott is an expert not only in the real case that inspired the book, but seemingly the entire Japanese legal system as well.I really have to take a moment to mention how different Japan’s criminal justice process is from our own. I mean, one of the biggest flaws in the American system is how inconsistently people are treated across the board. In Japan they seem to have the inverse problem, preventing discrimination through absolutes and rigidity. It’s all obviously a lot more nuanced than that, and as someone who’s really only vaguely familiar with one set of national laws, I’m not really equipped to dissect those intricacies. But from this perspective I can’t really wrap my head around some of the tenants in Japanese law. Basically if I ever get arrested in Japan, I’ll have to call Scott to bail me out.This novel moves quietly, but with enormous intent. I almost felt as though I was reading two different books simultaneously, which in a way I was. The story of Rina and Kaitarō is a slow burn that we already know ends in tragedy. It’s suspenseful not just because of its grisly outcome, but because of the precariousness of their budding relationship. There’s a muted menace waiting just around the corner of every romantic outing or forbidden tryst, even if it’s not referred to directly. In present day, Rina’s daughter Sumiko is unraveling the mystery of her mother’s death. It’s not that the details are unknown to authorities, they’re just out of reach for her. While not your typical ‘thriller’, the tension as both narratives slowly find their way towards one another makes for plenty of revelations.It’s fascinating and shrewd. Well-paced, but definitely a slow-burn. These are some of my favorite kinds of books to read, but I always get nervous they’ll be misunderstood by a reader who’s going by a 5-word blurb. I’d recommend taking your time while reading this one; enjoy the scenes Scott paints of both metropolitan and rural Japan so artfully.

A YA novel about a sex trafficking victim seems like something that can go off the rails pretty easily. The subject matter feels like it might be beyond teenagers, but aren’t teenagers the ones who are more susceptible to being trafficked? Maybe I was initially apprehensive, but it turns out that Kate McLaughlin was more than up to the task.What Unbreakable Looks Like skillfully walks a fine line between being honest about harsh realities without being exploitive. The story is about Alexa’s survival and coping after being freed from sexual slavery as a teenager. She’s not okay yet, and it can be difficult to read even a fictional account of the kind of turmoil that girls who have been through this experience while just trying to live a normal life. What this is not like is My Dark Vanessa. It might be easy to make those comparisons, but Alexa is in a very different place than Vanessa was. My Dark Vanessa is, in part, the reflections of an adult woman decades after her abuse. She has rationalized away much of what happened to her and reading some of the excuses she comes up with on behalf of her abuser can be stomach-turning. Alexa and Vanessa have both been repeatedly sexually assaulted, blame themselves, were initially failed by those who were supposed to protect them and will have to bear some of this burden into adulthood, but the key difference here is Alexa got help. She got help she asked for and help she didn’t. Vanessa was left to fall through the cracks and try to put herself back together. That’s where I think this book can do a lot of good for a YA audience. If they’re experiencing abuse or have feelings similar to Alexa’s, they can watch her come out of it better than when she started. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Vanessa’s story is not a happy one, because she still hasn’t completely surfaced from the hold her abuser had on her. In Unbreakable, we get to see a girl not just survive, but begin to thrive. Alexa has surrogate parents that love & understand her, best friends that are loyal to her, school administrators who listen to her and advocates in her local police department. I can only imagine what Vanessa would have been like if she had that type of support system.I wouldn’t go so far as to call this novel uplifting. It’s hard to feel good while reading about child abuse and rape. But there’s a level of comeuppance and hope here that can be difficult to hold on to in books about sexual violence. McLaughlin is letting her readers know that yes, it does get better, in a way that feels real and attainable. I know it’s probably going to get banned from a lot of schools, but I hope this book is still able to make its way into the hands of teenagers who need and want to read it.*Thanks to St. Martin’s Press & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"May 14, 2020","May 18, 2020","Nov 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51056342-what-unbreakable-looks-like

We’re introduced to the Trần family through hardship and triumph alike, led by their unwavering matriarch Trần Diệu Lan. From French and Japanese occupation to both domestic and international conflict, this family is tested in ways that most of us can hardly begin to imagine.Although quite beautiful, The Mountains Sing does not shy away from the harsh realities of war. We fall witness to famine, torture, sexual violence, all kinds of brutality and death. From Diệu Lan‘s childhood in the 1920s all the way to her granddaughter’s, Hương, in the 1970s, there’s little that its citizens can do when a nation decides to turn on itself. Your neighbor’s resentment can turn to cruelty, anger into callousness. As easy as it would be to claim an ideology is the sole cause of any given conflict, it’s not that simple. It doesn’t matter if you’re killed by invading capitalist Americans or murdered by your own maniacal communist countrymen, dead is still dead.And it doesn’t start and end with a single tragedy. Explored is the rippling generational devastation that constant waring leaves in its wake. But even in such a stark and punishing reality, there’s an uplifting amount of tenderness exhibited in the Trần family. Their love is incessant and gets them through any tribulation that comes their way. And when it may not be enough, their fellow man steps in to help them along. Strangers, who are referred to with the same titles given to family members, Sister/Brother/etc., have an enormous capacity for compassion, just as much as their counterparts do for cruelty. War brings out both the highest and lowest parts of humanity, and Quế Mai traverses it all.I was very impressed by this author’s writing, especially considering English isn’t her first language. Though she’s an accomplished Vietnamese writer, it’s even more difficult to author something originally in a foreign language, as opposed to having your mother tongue translated, so I have that much more respect for her work. I also enjoyed the proverbs scattered throughout the text; they were charming and enlightening. The Việt Nam described in The Mountains Sing is scenic and breathtaking, and I feel privileged having gotten to see it through Diệu Lan and Hương’s eyes. Though this is a book that takes place in the throes of war, I wouldn’t consider it a war book. It’s a novel about family, about relentless perseverance in service of those you love. There’s parts that are grim, yes, but the heart of the story lies in the way the characters take care of one another, their diligent devotion. With familial love, there’s always someone to come home to.*Thanks to Algonquin Books & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,104,1,"Jan 25, 2020","Jan 29, 2020","Oct 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49631287-the-mountains-sing

I’ve been especially interested in how women in other parts of the world live and interact with one another, so when I saw in the description that this was “...set in contemporary Seoul, Korea, about four young women making their way...”, I really couldn’t pass it up. Though the four main characters live in close proximity, in the same building, their lives feel separate from one another. When I first started reading I was wondering if this was going to be more of a Sex and the City vibe, where four friends are navigating the dating world and trying to self-actualize. Or maybe there would be petty feuds and backstabbing. It was decidedly not that, and all the better for it.Frances Cha identifies astounding depth in what’s considered to be the more superficial parts of Korean society. She doesn’t shy away from the uncomfortable parts of typically glamorized industries, like K-Pop and Korean Beauty. Sometimes when we read about other places and people, there’s an instinct to react with relief, like, ‘Oh thank God it’s not like that here!’ It was funny to see some of those reactions directed at American society by the Korean characters, and really made me question my own responses. In If I Had Your Face, Cha challenges our perceptions of what’s acceptable and has been normalized in our respective parts of the world. Both our commonalities and differences are striking.I absolutely fell in love with all of the female characters. They’re so distinct from one another, but there’s a familiar undercurrent that runs through them all, connecting them when there doesn’t appear to be much common ground. Ara is quiet, but has a ruthless streak. Kyuri seems shallow, but is endlessly ambitious. Miho’s earnestness can come off as naive, but she’s not to be underestimated. And Wonna feels disconnected and alone, though she’s struggling to rekindle her own will. Even the women who don’t have any first-person chapters are layered and complex; it’s difficult not to root for them all. There isn’t the unattainable levels of achievement and wealth we may have come to expect, like what we get from following around Rachel and Astrid in Crazy Rich Asians. There’s a grittiness to the glamour of the women in this story. They’re connected by the fact that they’re all yearning for something the world seems reluctant to provide them.

I did not know about them when I read the book, but I probably would not have picked it up at all had I been aware. Other prominent authors have spoken up against him and the Booker Prize for choosing to honor him. Here is a pretty good summary, though you may want to do your own research. I will leave this up for now and let potential readers make their own decisions, but I stand by what I said in the last paragraph—an article about the two families involved would be more than sufficient.**“There’s an old saying, he said, about how the foreign journalist who travels to the Middle East and stays a week goes home to write a book in which he provides a pat solution to all of its problems. If he stays a month, he writes a magazine or newspaper article filled with ‘ifs’, ‘buts’ and ‘on the other hands.’ If he stays a year he writes nothing at all.” -Asymmetry by Lisa HallidayNo, that’s not a quote from Colum McCann, but I came across it on Twitter in the midst of reading Apeirogon and couldn’t get it out of my head. Everyone thinks they have the answers to problems that they live outside of, and only realize how much they don’t know once they start to learn more. Just ask Jared Kushner how his plan for ‘Middle East peace’ is going.I don’t know what time or research McCann put into this novel. This isn’t a swipe at his choice to write Apeirogon, but more of an observation. The outsider coming in and telling locals how their own people should be governed is a theme in the book as well. The story of Bassam Aramin and Rami Elhanan and their daughters, Abir and Smadar, is an important one to be told. There have been articles written about them and speaking engagements given by the two men, but in this novelization McCann goes deeper into the struggles of two fathers left mourning their young daughters who are determined to prevent these tragedies from happening again. And again. And again.I’m unfamiliar with McCann’s writing style, but I can appreciate what he’s chosen to do with this work. Maybe it’s different than what he normally does, I wouldn’t know. While it worked for me at first, I found myself drifting away between passages because they were just so disjointed. I wanted to read this, but I had to drag myself back to the words on the page multiple times after wandering away. I’d say for that reason it’s probably not super ADHD-friendly.Of the two of them, I think Rami may be easier for ‘Western’ audiences to relate to. He was like every person who has the privilege of divorcing themselves from the political implications of the world. The problem with having an epiphany only after something affects you directly is that you have to wait for it to absolutely devastate your life before you understand that you were dangling precariously the entire time. You become awakened to that reality only after it’s too late to do anything about it. Prior to this you had convinced yourself that not only was it never going to happen to you or anyone you care about, but that anyone who does kick up a ruckus over such ‘divisive’ issues is a hysterical, partisan outrage-artist who can’t have any actual grievances in a world that’s been so good to you. Both nihilism and nonchalance are two sides of the same coin—indifference. Bassam, on the other hand, lived a life I could hardly imagine. He has been occupied his entire life, was brutally punished as a teenager and young adult, but came out of his seven year internment already wanting peace, not vengeance. Losing his daughter may have been a major catalyst for him, but it wasn’t the ultimate turning point. That said, both he and Rami’s message is stronger together than separately. It’s not often we get to see the same conflict discussed so completely from both points of view. Some people had strong reactions to the explicit depiction and aftermath of violence in the book. McCann relays the information very clinically and probably a little too in-depth. It comes off somewhat cold and removed, missing the compassion he has when talking about Rami and Bassam. Also, some of the hundreds of passages are used to weave in facts about various species of birds, as a metaphor or symbol. While some are interesting, I didn’t enjoy the detail that was used to describe capturing, torturing and killing the birds that were destined to be eaten. I understand why so many are raving about this novel. It’s an important subject and features real-life figures in the Israeli/Palestinian peace movement. After finishing it, though, I think I would have been fine just reading an article written about the two girls and their respective families.*Thanks to Random House & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Jan 06, 2020","Jan 14, 2020","Oct 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50185600-apeirogon

This time around we’re back at Bayview High, in a sequel to her smash hit One of Us Is Lying.It had been a bit since I submerged myself into the Bayview student body, and it took a little bit to catch myself up on all of the names, ages, cliques and relationships. The original Bayview four are present, though mostly peripheral to the plot. Instead we get a (mostly) new set of Gen Z kids with trendy names: Maeve, Bronwyn’s younger sister who was the tech wizard behind the takedown of Simon Kelleher; Knox, her best friend and former boyfriend; and Phoebe, who is drawn into the fold based off of proximity and shared secrets. While it was nice to see familiar faces in Bronwyn, Nate, Addy and Connor, I liked that we got to follow a different group of kids this time around.I had a good time trying to uncover the clues McManus scattered along the way. There’s enough where you can pick up on some, but even then you probably won’t be able to guess how they all fit together. Instead of a Gossip Girl-style blog exposing the hidden secrets of the students, this story is centered around a Truth or Dare game, albeit with a sinister twist. A student ends up dying, something we’re told in the prologue, but we don’t get any more details until near two-thirds of the way through. After that is a fast-paced race against the clock, and once the dust settles there’s even a Sharp Objects-style twist at the end—though not as gruesome.And for fellow fans of McManus, we’re in luck! Not only is there a One of Us is Lying TV show in the works, but despite One of Us is Next being published in January of this year, we get ANOTHER book of hers in 2020 as well. The Cousins is slated to be released in December and will be a standalone YA mystery.

It’s a Black Mirror-esque plot revolving around technology and how once we integrate it with our lives we are at its mercy. It almost seems too far-fetched until you realize that we already have most, if not all of the technology present in the book currently out in the world today. What I think this book is great at is depicting the relationships between the teenagers at the center of it. I believed their friendships, even if the premise felt a little out there sometimes. Which....it did. The story might have gotten away from the author at a few points, but that’s kind of the fun of it all. It’s better not to take these types of plot-lines as realistic depictions of where tech is headed, but instead look at the way the characters involved handle the new situations. So much of The God Game was a great example of a slippery slope. When you start making small bargains with yourself, they can eventually snowball into larger sacrifices that go against your character and integrity. And it’s that much harder to say no once you’ve already invested so much of yourself. By the time you realize you’re in over your head, it’s already too late.If you’re interested in a fast-paced Sci-fi thriller with a YA affect, you’ll probably like this offering from Danny Tobey.

I don’t know what higher power decreed that I must read this, but she seems very powerful and I am loath to disobey her.)In the winter of 1995 we meet the Thomas family, consisting of Alison, Claire and their parents on a family vacation in the Caribbean. Very quickly you get a feel for the family dynamics and mood of the trip. There’s a significant age gap between the sisters, the family comes from wealth and privilege, etc. Their parents act as most people who can afford luxury resort holidays do: searching for a vague sense of ‘authenticity’, but unwilling and unable to accept accommodation less than they’re accustomed to. When Alison disappears and is discovered several days later, there’s an added layer of outrage. This type of thing just doesn’t happen to people like them. To girls like Alison.But it feels like that’s all we hear about, doesn’t it? Perhaps I’m not the only one who noticed several beats of this story line up with some we’ve heard before. The first one that comes to mind is Natalee Holloway—missing 18 year-old American girl, one white & two non-white suspects, Caribbean island vacation—but there’s one huge difference so far: (view spoiler)[a body (hide spoiler)]. The Natalee Holloway case is one of the most dissected investigations I can remember being flashed all over television, and with some of the fewest concrete answers. That’s the one thing I wanted going into this book, more than the Aruban shoulder shrug we got with her.Though it’s a little more complicated than that, as it turns out. This isn’t the story of a hard-fought battle for justice against some deranged killer. That’s probably where some other s were marked down a star; this is a novel, not a thriller. It’s built on the back of a mystery, but that’s not the route that Alexis Schaitkin decides to pursue. There’s an examination of trauma and how we respond to sudden loss. A lot of time is spent with coping and deciding if a person can really ‘start over’. We see how media narratives twist and bend someone else’s misfortune to fit whatever bill they’re trying to sell. People project themselves onto tragic figures and they immortalize them in ways that are different from how they really were.One of the subjects Schaitkin scrutinizes well is how race, privilege and prejudice can cast people into roles they don’t align with. You just can’t divorce one from the other in cases like this. One victim in one tragedy can ripple out and create new ones. The author doesn’t shy away from the unfairness of it all, she leans into it. In the same breath a victim can be scrutinized and blamed for her own death, but her alleged assailant can be villainized to the point where you are expecting to see him with fangs and horns. If you’re wondering if there’s some sort of conclusion, if the initial question is resolved, I’d say yes, at least in the ways that matter. There’s a lot left unsaid and seemingly unfinished, but that’s intentional. Not much in life gets a perfectly plotted ending where you have some touching last words, drive off into the sunset or solve the problem to immense personal satisfaction. “With the truth we will do what, become what? And in gaining the truth, what do we lose?”*Thanks to Celadon Books, BookishFirst & Netgalley for advance copies!...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Dec 19, 2019","Dec 30, 2019","Oct 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43782399-saint-x

I know he writes spy novels, starting with his Cold War espionage thrillers featuring George Smiley. I know he was a former British intelligence officer before switching to writing full-time. I know many of his books have been adapted into miniseries and film. I also know he’s really old. For the sake of this  I looked it up: he’s 88.While probably not the book most le Carré fans would recommend starting out with, I think this is a good a point as any to jump in. For that reason I can’t really compare it relative to his prior catalogue, but I feel as though I got a feel for his general writing style. For me, it felt pretty dry and detached, thought that might just be how his spy novels are intentionally written. Either way, it left me pretty uninvested in nearly all the characters. All of the young people (basically anyone under 30) are depicted as emotionally unstable and in need of constant minding. They’re literally incapable of any type of impulse control and their older, wiser contemporaries are often left shrugging their shoulders at youthful naïveté or chuckling to themselves with a ‘Kids—what can you do?’ condescension. These are adults in their twenties, but in this version of the world they are uniformly arrogant and immature. The young men get some benefit of the doubt, though, as they are ‘passionate’ where the women are ‘hysterical’. Perhaps there’s just a cluster of irrational young people in this story alone, but as writers get older I’ve noticed they find it harder to write believably young characters.Le Carré has not lost his ability to construct a compelling protagonist, though. Nat is a British every-man-turned-spy that enjoys things like badminton, the company of his wife and scotch. He’s easy for a reader to imprint themselves on and is morally driven while being astute in his decision making. There’s really nothing negative to hang your hat on and he acts as an ethical compass for a cast of shifting and shrouded loyalties. I can see why people like these types of books. Honestly, I did enjoy reading it, but I lost the thread quite a bit. Maybe parts were above my comprehension or maybe he could have been clearer, I don’t know. I do think that conspiracy plots are convoluted by definition, and I wasn't always sure of the function of various British intelligence operations, so that may have contributed.All in all, probably not my genre. I’m still interested in the Smiley series if I can goad my library into purchasing Call for the Dead. I absolutely refuse to begin at book three. Popularity and ratings be damned, I am not ready for you The Spy Who Came In from the Cold! John le Carré fans will most likely enjoy this one, and everyone else can at least appreciate it. Cheers to him for still publishing at this stage in his life! For his part, le Carré absolutely went in on Brexit and Donald Trump.

The problem with rating books by people you already like, especially something autobiographical, is that it can be hard to separate the work from the man. Admittedly, I was afraid that I would be unbearably bored reading this when I first started. He begins by talking about his childhood and musical influences and drops the names of allegedly well-known musicians that I’ve never heard of, and it wasn’t really clicking for me. Luckily, as I started getting used to Sir Elton’s writing, I picked up on his dry humor and loving candor & my interest and appreciation blossomed accordingly.And when it comes to his own highs and lows, triumphs and tribulations, there’s nothing at all held back. I wasn’t really expecting Elton John to be so reflective towards his own professional or interpersonal failings. He doesn’t skate over them or try to cover them up with excuses. It’s a perfect example of how there’s really no greater critic than oneself, even if you have professional critics writing about you, too.And yes, the caliber of celebrity mentioned does climb higher and higher until we’re put in a room with both Hollywood royalty and the actual royal family. He’s not shy about describing a side of these public figures that diverge from what we’re accustomed to seeing. It’s clear that for each revelation disclosed, there’s countless more that he chooses not to share. But even for those in his life who have profoundly let him down, Elton writes them either glowingly or stoically. To be frank, I was expecting something much bitchier, so this was a surprise—nonetheless, a positive one! He’s overwhelmingly gracious and not in the slightest bit malicious. What ended up striking me most was how he was able to balance some very serious, heavy topics next to the utter absurdity of his life and general roguery. Such as when talking about a very significant addiction, he’d cut the tension by remarking, ”If you fancy living in a despondent world of unending, delusional bullshit, I really can’t recommend cocaine highly enough.” Even if it might appear glib, Elton John isn’t flippant with these subjects. While there’s portions that involve overdose, AIDS, depression and suicide, they’re broken up with stories featuring drag queens, misshapen hairpieces and sculptures that resemble testicles. He’s quietly hilarious in a way that doesn’t undermine the weight of his experiences.As far as celebrity memoirs go, this has to be one of the best of the year. Elton John has lived so much life that he could probably write an encyclopedia set of books on the subject.

This was a very entertaining series, packed with plot and wittiness, brimming with world-building structures and characters that I’m so glad Leigh Bardugo picked up in the two spinoff series. And while I appreciated these three books immensely, I feel satisfied leaving the remaining main characters behind with the ending and epilogue provided.This book was better than the last one for me, but still didn’t measure up to Shadow and Bone. Maybe it was the newness and magical feeling in exploring a different world, but I never got quite the same feeling from reading it. A lot of the story here felt similar to the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows where the gang is running around and hiding from the baddies, barely escaping death and capture, and frequently fighting amongst themselves. They spend so much time hunting horcruxes infinity stones amplifiers that there isn’t much else left to focus on. It was hard to know when they reached an actual turning point or if it was going to be another inexplicably close call.Honestly, I thought it was going to go in a different direction. And I guess I was never much into the Alina/Mal romance. Even though he’s admittedly grown up a bit by the end of the series, I still didn’t really warm up to him. He blew her off before she was ‘important’ and then became a possessive, needy douche after she got all badass and desirable. In this book he’s distant and pushes Alina away half-heartedly, like a girl who storms off but expects the guy to chase after her.I’m not completely on the other side, though. I don’t necessarily think she should have been with Nikolai or -dundun- The Darkling; she’s probably best off doing her own thing. The major reason I don’t like Alina with Mal isn’t really about how whiny he is, but how much worse she is when they’re together. She makes bad decisions and isolates herself. She gets defensive and snaps easily. And now that she has an established support system and *gasp* friends, I just don’t see the need for a boyfriend at all. She’s, what, 17? 18? And immortal? Girl, you got TIME.(view spoiler)[And the dumbest plot point out of the whole Grishaverse happens in this book, for the sole purpose of keeping him away from the action. Nikolai turning into monster is just so out of left field that it almost felt like a joke when I read it. Obviously Bardugo couldn’t kill one of her most popular and important characters, but if he was around then how would Alina keep making stupid decisions? And how would Mal become the BestBoy® by default? It’s never really explained and has no precedent in their powers and just poofs away when it’s convenient for him to not be gone. This and Mal being a secret horcrux amplifier are so eye-roll worthy that I’m going to pretend they didn’t happen at all. (hide spoiler)]Overall, I really liked the series.

Operating on the right side of relentless, there’s got to be nothing worse for abusers and predators than hearing the words, “Ronan Farrow is calling for comment.” But, Catch and Kill doesn’t yet know that version of Farrow. Before his name was synonymous with the downfall of the corrupt, he was struggling to gain any traction at NBC on the story of the decade—the heinous behavior of Harvey Weinstein.There’s really no question that Farrow is a talented journalist. His first book, War on Peace: The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence, was well-researched and fascinating, if a little dry. This second offering reads more like an investigative thriller, and by the end turns full-on espionage. And as he, mostly against his will, is pulled into and becomes part of the story, we get to see more of his personal life and personality. And, you know what, he’s actually really funny! For such a serious subject matter I’m thankful he was able to inject moments of levity that didn’t take away from the overall gravity. The constant dragging of the movie Jackie (screenplay by his boss at NBC), was particularly amusing.But there’s really nothing that can undercut the incredible amount of pain and frustration thrust upon these women who came forward. Farrow documents the innumerable smears against the likes of Rose McGowan and Ambra Gutierrez as well as the complicated stories of victims such as Asia Argento and Brooke Nevils. It’s insane just how much was stacked against them from the beginning. And we get just a peek behind the curtain of the machines created to protect the powerful perpetrators. There’s no wrong way to be a victim just like there’s no wrong way to be a woman.

We get to spend more time with Nikolai, the Grisha AND our favorite (view spoiler)[former (hide spoiler)] heartrender, Nina Zenik? I went into it wondering whether this newish venture by Leigh Bardugo would resemble her first or second series in the Grishaverse more. The answer appears to be c) none of the above.I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Bardugo could have really shaved this book down some one or two hundred pages and not lost anything important. Why was this sooooo sloooooowww?? I feel like I took just as long to read this one book as I did to read both of the other Grishaverse series. The Dregs duology was perfection, and the Shadow and Bone trilogy was at least compulsively readable, but I ended up dragging my feet with King of Scars. Everything that wasn't what Nina was doing was boring, the first half especially. How, tell me, HOW did two of the most interesting characters, Nikolai and Zoya, become so tedious?? I’m sorry, but I don’t care about a bunch of young twenty-somethings and teenagers playing at war and politicking. And seriously, not every sentence needs a sarcastic rebuttal. It’s like instead of a cast of different Friends characters, everyone is trying to be the Chandler. A little vulnerability or sincerity won’t actually kill them. Stop trying to be the funny/witty one; Chandler only works in small doses!!This world desperately needs a new villain. Part of what made Six of Crows such a knockout was how self-contained it was. There were new bad guys to beat and challenges to face beyond the previous big-bad of the books. You also really need to read the previous five books to understand what’s going on here. This isn’t a complaint about the book, just a heads up for anyone who might see s other than this one (whoops) and want to immediately jump in. At the very least, you’ll need to read the trilogy. Or else spend 514 pages desperately trying to grasp what the fuck a ‘Darkling’ is.(view spoiler)[And NO!!!! I see what you’re doing, Leigh Bardugo! I know you have some underlying compulsion to pair off every one of your characters with another one, but please don’t. And not to go too heavy on the Friends references, but Nikolai & Zoya make even less sense together than Joey & Rachel. I just can’t entertain the idea at all—my head canon rejects it completely.And while I like Hanne and wouldn’t normally mind her as a potential love interest for Nina or another main character, I just don’t like how much of it is wrapped up in Matthias. Literally minutes after burying him, Nina stumbles upon a stubborn, warrior Fjerdan that she bonds with after they’re forced to cooperate for mutual survival. It almost feels...I don’t know, disrespectful? The whole thing is new, so maybe I’ll warm up to it, but for now I’m not really on board. (hide spoiler)]At the very least, King is Scars sets up good conflicts going forward and—thank God—some fresh, new evil-doers.

For what I was expecting, it’s kind of a let down, but for what it ended up being, it’s pretty well-done. Based off of the title, I knew at least part of the story would be framed around “one woman’s search for justice in Indian country”, but for some reason I assumed that woman was the author. It’s not; the author, Sierra Crane Murdoch, is a reporter who frequently followed stories on a reservation in North Dakota. The actual subject is a woman named Lissa Yellow Bird, who ends up entrenching herself in an amateur investigation into the disappearance of a man working on the local oil fields. While Lissa is investigating an actual crime, I think fans of the True Crime genre will be disappointed with this work. You can tell Murdoch is endlessly interested in this woman and her life and heritage, but the book wasn’t packaged as a biography. I’d say about half of the content is the Yellow Bird family’s genealogy and history, in conjunction with backstory about the many, many injustices put upon the tribal members over several centuries. I’m interested in those topics, but I don’t think they relate to the narrative being relayed here. If there’s a relevant story or facts, then sure I’ll take it, but an information dump ends up being a disservice to each respective account.If Lissa Yellow Bird had written this book, I think a lot more time would have been spent focused on the crime. She was obsessed with the disappearance of Kristopher ‘KC’ Clarke and he becomes the sole focus of her life. Murdoch is more interested in Yellow Bird, who admittedly is has had a fascinating and difficult journey, but draws too much of the author’s attention away from the man who was killed. It could border on reductive the way Lissa and tribal politics become the focus of another person’s death.But Murdoch is an excellent writer and reporter, so I do feel like I’m not being fair by grading her based on my expectations not being met in the way I anticipated. I guess I still would give this book three stars as a True Crime book, but as a ‘True Life’ story probably more like four. It could have been edited down some, and I think a lot of people reading this will end up skimming portions. *Thanks to Random House & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,121,1,"Feb 13, 2020","Feb 20, 2020","Oct 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46180988-yellow-bird

It’s a horror novel with “imaginary” antagonists and one of the most out-there premises I’ve ever encountered. There’s so many aspects I would normally comment on in this beast of a book (over 700 pgs), but I really can’t cover them all without writing something half as long as the actual text. I think I’ll get some common, trope-y complaints out of the way before going too much into the overall themes. The majority of these stemmed from poor and/or lazy depictions of stereotyped characters. The plot repeatedly punishes a religious teenage girl immediately after having sexual thoughts or acting on them. Beyond that, nearly every woman mentioned is scorned or abused. And it doesn’t accomplish anything other than holding up the same blandly heinous female suffering for the sake of it. As my beloved Patron Saint of Writing, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, said about dealing with characters who are misogynistic, “...the important thing is that [the work] treats the women properly. [The character] doesn’t have to. He needs to be true to this character.” I just wish Chbosky handled his characters a little more thoughtfully. The other instance I’ve got to mention is the kid with a cruel nickname who is almost exclusively referred to by that nickname, “Special Ed”, even when he’s not being addressed by another character. It’s just the author calling him that. Come on, dude, is this 2007? Are you going to make jokes about the short bus next? It’s just entirely unnecessary. I don’t think Stephen Chbosky is doing this intentionally. Similar to authors like Stephen King, it’s just his blind spot. There’s actually a lot in common with King’s work and this new offering from Chbosky, other than genre and length. Neither seem to really understand how kids act? The children at the center of it all are seven. That’s second graders. They’re learning how to tell time. Some still can’t tie their shoes. They are not capable of (view spoiler)[sneaking out at 2 am and building a miniature house in a tree by moonlight unsupervised (hide spoiler)], among many other things. As touched on earlier, they don’t know what to do with teenage girls, their bodies or their desires. But despite this, they both deliver truly scary stories that made me jumpy whilst reading at night.I can’t go much further without big spoilers so here we go: (view spoiler)[I guess I didn’t expect this to take such a religious turn. I didn’t have a problem with that being a theme, especially considering the afterlife was a major component to the story, but I thought it would be more in the vain of The Good Place, than ‘I’m God’s secret daughter’. What was really even the point of Mary Katherine and her family/congregation? There were so many morality lessons tossed around that I’m not sure what the overall thesis of it was supposed to be.And my god, the ending dragged. What’s the opposite of a false start? A false end? A trapdoor? I don’t know, but there were a bunch of instances where the story could and should have wrapped up in the last hundred pages, and it inexplicably kept going. I felt like the coyote smacking into the roadrunner’s painted tunnels over and over again. The whole book was a lot to get through and did not need so many instances of varying perspectives. It could have been a couple hundred pages shorter and lost nothing significant. The epilogue some how confused me even more. Is this supposed to be an actual immaculate conception? Or is she pregnant with the Anti-Christ or something? Do people have needle scars on their eyes now? Can that throat-less guy talk? Wtf is going to happen to these people?? I just.....whatever. In this moment, my questions are infinite.  (hide spoiler)]All in all, this was an interesting departure for The Perks of Being a Wallflower author—a gruesome and sickly horror story that fans of that genre will enjoy. I eventually grew to appreciate the book for its uniqueness, even if it stalled at times.

Certainly the premise is enticing: an undocumented immigrant from Sri Lanka currently living in Australia is a potential witness in a violent crime. This isn’t just a possibility, but a reality for many from undocumented communities all over the world. Fear of deportation or imprisonment is so great that they are wary to go to the authorities when they themselves are victims of crimes, and therefore are more likely to be victims than perpetrators.But the execution of this idea is a little all over the place for me. We follow a man, Danny, who is slowly unraveling in trying to decide what to do with the information he possesses. We get flashbacks to various times in his life, such as his time back home in Sri Lanka or spending time in Australia with his girlfriend, and get the context for whatever small decision he’s about to make. As a rule, he almost always picks the one that makes the least sense. I haven’t read The White Tiger or anything else by Aravind Adiga, so I’m not sure if this is his writing style or not, but I found it hard to get a grip on Danny. I really don’t know if he’s generally unstable or if it’s a heightened sense of dread around the murder or the just the sheer panic of deportation that makes him so erratic, but it was hard to connect to.I found Adiga’s commentary on the differences between legal and illegal immigrants as well as between immigrants and their first generation descendants to be really fascinating. It’s something you don’t think about, being a white person in a white-majority country, but a reality for millions of people worldwide. Danny is just trying to exist and scrape by, but even the smallest thing that we take for granted could be an immense obstacle for him. In these comparisons and reflections I feel like the novel excelled.Overall, I think it was a little too disjointed for me. Though it’s only 272 pages, so much seemed to ramble on and on. The entire plot only spans one day in Danny’s life and he spends so much time going over the same things again and again. It’s not a thriller, but somehow is a bit tedious while leaving me feeling anxious.

I don’t think this is that bad of an offering, but in such a crowded genre it just doesn’t really stand out. The mystery of who Mr. Nobody is hangs over the first half of the book, with not much else going on. A secondary question, what happened in Emma Lewis’ past, is also present but feels inconsequential. It all definitely picks up later, with mixed results as to how satisfying this conclusion is.I did like how much Catherine Steadman tried to explain the science behind the plot. I have no idea whether it was accurate or would hold up to scrutiny, but it at least sounded right enough to me. The eventual ‘big reveal’ was unexpected, but really stretches reality. Everything comes together because she’s decided it will, not because it makes sense. So much of the preliminary buildup was hinged on the two main characters, ‘Matthew’ and Emma, not meeting each other, and I think it threw off the pacing. (view spoiler)[I really had a problem with the characterization of Zara, particularly paired off with Chris Poole, a police officer & her husband working on the same case. With the recent controversy around how Clint Eastwood decided to portray journalist Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) in the movie Richard Jewell as trading sex for a story, their relationship was all the more jarring. Zara doesn’t just bring up the case in passing to Chris, but goads and begs him to divulge confidential police information while performing some bizarre sex kitten act. The simultaneous infantilization of a grown woman, reducing her role in their relationship to cunning seductress and undermining both her own integrity & entire profession is pretty succinctly demonstrated here:“‘I’ll make it worth your while.’ She pouts provocatively.” Ugh.And after that HE WILLINGLY TELLS HER. But he gets to come off guilelessly, which is some bullshit. He should have been fired for gross negligence and she needed to be arrested for a whole mess of crimes. They served no real purpose to the plot besides annoying me profusely. I’ve decided to pretend they didn’t exist. (hide spoiler)]The memory loss and amnesia is pretty fun. One case that the book keeps referencing, The Piano Man, was an actual guy. The real person, Andreas Grassl, is kind of fascinating and I enjoyed reading up on him.

Won’t someone think of the white men?!???!!!!!?,?! In the words of SNL’s least-employed former cast member, “Ali Wong is making it so Asian chicks are funnier than white chicks.” Good on him, taking a break from calling Asian people c****s to compliment her in a way that insults other women.But I agree with that conservative diversity hire’s overall sentiment. Ali is funny as hell. Everything reads in her voice, from the stories about childbirth to the antics of her study abroad trip to Vietnam, she is unapologetically herself. There’s also a lot of vulnerability on display that her fans may not get to see very often. In the very beginning of her book she discloses that she’s afraid of being outed as “a fucking idiot”. Obviously nobody with an encyclopedic level of knowledge about various Asian cuisine could be stupid, but I appreciated the candor she gave when talking about her hopes and fears, in addition to the usual sexcapade stories.Since she’s primarily a stand-up, I feel like the audiobook version would be even better. There’s nothing that quite measures up to an author reciting their own words to their audience. While most of her stories were inherently funny, there wasn’t an abundance of quote-unquote ‘jokes’. I think it will work better delivered by Wong herself. Some of the best material wasn’t necessarily funny at all. Her experiences with Asian American culture and as a struggling comedian/writer were insightful and heartfelt. The only part I really went yikes at was when she brought up male virginity. Sometimes it’s hard to recognize gender stereotypes that stigmatize men instead of women, but it felt like when everyone collectively lost their shit over ‘The Virgin Bachelor’. Like come on....we’re better than this.The book was framed as letters by Ali to her two young daughters. I don’t think these are the actual letters she would write them if she wasn’t also using them as a book, but there’s still plenty of guidance to be gleaned on the whole. The Afterword by her husband, Justin Hakuta, was especially sweet and a great note for it to end on.

It’s not particularly long or dense, but was just difficult to get back into once I put it down. The characters are charming, fleshed-out and full of life, but initially it was hard to connect with what they were doing. Honestly I was over halfway through Deacon King Kong wondering what it was even about. I mean, I knew what was happening, but I didn’t understand what James McBride was trying to say. I had no idea where it was headed, even as pieces began to overlap and fall together. The seriousness of the catalyst and crime, Sportcoat shooting a 19-year-old drug dealer in broad daylight, was played against the absurdity of the life he’s leading. I didn’t know how I was supposed to react: should I be on the edge of my seat or should I be cackling at the hijinks of the Cause Houses’ residents? Was Sportcoat’s utter confusion at the crime he was being told he committed funny or sad? I think those questions ended up being indicative of the skill in James McBride’s writing. In places of poverty and where the only real ways to get ahead are on the wrong side of the law, you have to be able to find the bright spots or you’ll be drowned in the dark places. You can’t just live to survive.While I did feel kind of aimless in the first half, the back half was nearly impossible to tear myself away from. I kept hoping for not just an ending, but a resolution. Despite not seemingly having anything in common with a majority of the characters like I originally felt, I became engrossed in their lives. Deacon King Kong is one of those novels whose brilliance sneaks up on you. I haven’t been this pleasantly surprised by a book in a while, and I’ll be looking to pick up more by McBride going forward.*Thanks to Penguin Group - Riverhead & Netgalley for an advance copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,2,703,1,"Feb 07, 2020","Feb 23, 2020","Sep 20, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51045613-deacon-king-kong

I like Jonathan Safran Foer. I appreciate what he’s trying to do here. And most importantly, I agree with his ovThis book was incredibly frustrating. I like Jonathan Safran Foer. I appreciate what he’s trying to do here. And most importantly, I agree with his overarching message. We need to care more collectively about the state and future of the planet. There are things we can each do to lessen the burden on our natural resources. Climate change is an issue that requires immediate, decisive and immense attention. But I’m not ing political topics, I’m ing a book written on one. And this just wasn’t effective at much of anything except making me want to get Mr. Foer to stop rambling vaguely about the climate.At many points I didn’t feel like I was reading an actual book. It’s one part science fact-dump and one part devolving Reddit thread. If you aren’t familiar with how Reddit works, in this case it’s one random thought in response to another, linked by an unspoken “....And another thing!” The book is split into five parts, with each part containing a multitude of essay-like mini-chapters, many with too-clever titles. Individually they can seem offbeat, but collectively they’re just goofy. He doesn’t really make points, but paraphrases or quotes verbatim the words of influential figures at the head of other powerful movements.And again, I get what he’s going for. I agree with his urgency, but am left gaping at his thought process. The climate crisis is incredibly severe, but do pages and pages lamenting about World War II or the American Civil Rights movement do anything to make this point? Is Rosa Parks really the perfect analogy for what you’re trying to accomplish here? You can’t just compare two injustices as if they’re the same thing. Economic inequality is the Holocaust. See? That doesn’t offer any insight or tangible solution. It doesn’t reframe the way I think about either thing. It just makes me think about the Holocaust and muddles the meaning of whatever you’re comparing it to. Add in the anti-modernity diatribes, like his strange admonishment of selfies, and some may be less inclined to take proactive action after reading what this author-turned-advocate has to say on the subject.As far as intended content, I do have a bit of a problem with that too. Public perception is huge. Especially since the public has been gaslit by corporations, industries, politicians and certain media outlets into doubting scientists and our own lying eyes for years. Major moves can be made by large groups of people motivated to change the world for the better. But there is simply too much onus put on people to fight a system designed to minimize their impact. Why not start with the industries and companies who profit from the death of the planet as opposed to the people already vulnerable to the negative effects we’re already seeing? Why is electing representatives that create legislation with these things in mind dismissed by the author as something that simply ‘makes us feel better’? In this way, Jonathan Safran Foer isn’t any better than the only TV network he criticizes for being counterproductive to the movement, which, inexplicably, is MSNBC. (Is he confused? Did he forget Fox ‘News’ exists? Where they seemingly breed millionaire climate-deniers?)So much of the time Foer keeps saying “we” to make his points. “We are”, “we need”, “we must”; what he really means is ‘you’. This book is purely instructional, and no amount of common man pronouns are going to shake the feeling that a privileged person who has the luxury to consider the ethical implications of his dinner is telling people who may not be able to afford food that they aren't doing enough to save the world. As a vegetarian (one who doesn’t dabble in airport burgers...wtf Jonathan?), I understand there’s no point in demanding people make the same dietary decisions I do. It’s not practical or helpful. What is useful, though, are alternatives, incentives and awareness. Corporations need to be regulated and face steep consequences if in violation. Electric vehicles and alternative power need to be economically advantageous options. Don’t force regular people to make hard choices. You may not like what they choose.The best I can say for this book is that at least it’s trying to to talk about the subject, which I guess earns a couple of participation stars in the awareness column. I guess this means I probably shouldn’t check out Eating Animals if it’s anything like We Are the Weather, or else it might turn me back into an omnivore.*Thanks to Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Netgalley & Goodreads for advance copies!...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Oct 16, 2019","Oct 23, 2019","Sep 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43565381-we-are-the-weather

We track mass murderers like athletes, each snuffed life another tally added to their total stats. Serial killers receive their own classification, often including sexual transgressions. They’re followed and discussed, known by name, number of victims, means of violence, etc. We learn about their families, their mindset, their jobs, their lives. We learn the entire person, culminating in the human-shaped creature staring back at us through our screens. We call them monsters because it’s easier than admitting they’re people, a product of the same world that created you and me and everyone else.In our obsession with the offender, the offended are often diminished & forgotten. For those who are able to speak, we only ask them to relive the same terrible episode over and over again. This is why so many refuse the distinction of ‘victim’. Not because they weren’t harmed or victimized, but because it feels reductive. Nobody wants to be thought of as just a vessel to which terrible things are done.This book is about Emily Doe, how she came to be and who she is now. It’s about Chanel Miller, the person who was reclaimed from Emily’s trauma. They are one and the same, and in so many ways, they are us as well. This is not the story of the assailant. He is a player in it, a character, a catalyst, but not the subject. Everyone who reads this memoir will already know his name, so I’ve taken the title as instructional: this  will only bear her’s.We expect so much from survivors purely for our own peace of mind. Yes, the personal growth Miller acquires in the few years after her assault is greater than most of us could hope to reach in our lifetimes, but this is not a book that exists for us to harvest inspiration & exaltation for ourselves and then be on our way. Chanel lets us fall deeply into her fear and sadness. Into her aimlessness and devastated denials. She’s frequently lost and compartmentalized. There’s resilience, but consistently she is nearly swallowed by feelings of hopelessness.But what she described that most resonated was the anger. In her own words, in her own head she is free to be livid. She is free to vent frustrations with nearly every part of the punishing system that was built to accommodate the perpetrator, not the victimized. My rage echos her rage; her pain is all of our pain. But that fury doesn’t stay nicely contained with in her, it seeps out into every moment of her life. Every injustice thrust upon her without consent is waiting to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting. Yelling back at street harassers feels cathartic after being picked at and degraded by your attacker’s attorney for hours on end. Let everyone fear the wrath of a woman silenced.Miller does not dress her distress up in a way that makes it more palatable for us. That would be a disservice. She is not a “perfect victim” because that person does not exist. Eventually she does recover most of herself, returning to the body of the girl she had to rebuild from scratch. Reading her testaments is difficult, but crucial. I can’t remember the last time I read something this slowly; I wanted to absorb every word. Chanel Miller is an immensely talented writer, regardless of the subject matter. I know she has plenty to say, and I hope we get to hear more.So many along the way tried to snatch her voice or repurpose it for their own narratives. For this reason, I will end with her words that Stanford promised to post on campus, then reneged in because they weren’t “uplifting” enough. I’m going to have to disagree with that assessment. “You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.”...more",Notes are private!,0,149,1,"Oct 03, 2019","Oct 08, 2019","Sep 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46264398-know-my-name

I appreciated these and felt like it helped me get in a proper mindset, especially if you’re planning to read multiple stories right after one another. I had to take breaks after reading many of them. There was often so much to digest and process that it can be difficult to just power through in one sitting.This is just a testament to her writing, though. It’s very fitting that she’s releasing this collection on Halloween. I didn’t know quite what to expect going into this, but I was delighted with how grim and twisted they could be. Maybe delighted isn’t the right word...it feels weird to be so happy with something generally unhappy, isn’t it? I was satisfied, how about that? ‘Deeply satisfied’ feels more akin to how I felt after each work of fiction. One of the things I liked the best was the abundance of female ‘villains’, for lack of a better word. McGuire doesn’t typically make it as simple as good and evil, but there are some truly sinister women in these stories and I loved it. It reminded me of what Gillian Flynn had said about her own female villains, “Women have spent so many years girl-powering ourselves to the point of almost parodic encouragement [that] we’ve left no room to acknowledge our dark side.” I want more interesting women in fiction, which includes scary, ruthless and even the dreaded ‘unlikeable’.

Twisting and turning like a winding river itself, this novel covers a lot of ground that somehow works as an exceedingly cohesive story. It’s not the jump-scare style suspense you may be used to, and some of the biggest reveals have nothing to do with the major mystery the plot is set around. But it’s incredibly well written and I absolutely tore through it.At the center of the book are two sisters, Mickey and Kacey, who, though seemingly starting from the same less-than-ideal beginning, have diverged into adulthood on two vastly different paths. The subject of addiction is handled expertly by Moore. You feel the utter and sweeping devastation left in its wake, how it ripples through families and across generations.

I’ll even put the verdict up at the top here so you can get on to reading the dozens of other s for the Controversial Book of the Year®: It’s fine, but not worth the hype. It didn’t live up to the exaltation initially received or the condemnation that came later. It’s not even worth the hate-read. I struggle to understand the strong emotional response to the actual work itself, both positive and negative. I mean, the main characters, Lydia and Luca, were so grating that I had to really dig deep and power through the first third where the story was focused primarily on them. Luca is an 8-year-old human atlas and prodigy. He speaks perfect English, has memorized the entire North American continent to where he can direct traffic better than GoogleMaps and talks to his mother like he has a whole team of TV writers feeding him dialogue. This kid would have been an unrealistic adult, but as a young child dealing with trauma it’s just obnoxious.Lydia is just so clearly written for suburban books clubs that it’s almost kind of an insulting assumption by Jeannine Cummins to so obviously pander to her audience like this. She’s an upper-middle class indie bookstore owner who read Tolstoy to her baby and has such an irresistible personality that the local cartel boss fell in love with her (more on that later). If Liam Neeson in Taken is an action fantasy for suburban men that just ‘need to protect their family’, then Lydia is the female version of that—an unrealistic audience surrogate thrust into a situation that’s rooted in some reality, but is not to be taken as a representation of that reality.And that’s where this book initially started to receive backlash, with how it was marketed. American Dirt shouldn’t be treated like literary fiction or as a ‘true immigrant experience’, because it’s not. It’s not the next The Grapes of Wrath. Personally, I don’t think it deserved the huge advance that Cummins was given, but publishers can spend their money however they want. What I think a lot of the people who are defending this book, the backlash to the backlash if you will, are missing is that the original marketing for it was grossly inadequate and took space in an already tight industry from better representations of the current South/Central American migrant experience. That’s without mentioning how Cummins and Flatiron misrepresented her own background or the huge missteps like those barbed-wire centerpieces.The frustration with the publishing industry was warranted, and there’s probably still more to come. But it’s not really about American Dirt itself, at least not entirely. This book is clearly written for white ladies who Cummins wanted to entertain first and foremost, and possibly ‘enlighten’. She wanted us to have that Oprah A-Ha moment (and she got it!), but it didn’t end up being what she expected. And on a more personal point, I kind of resent the way a character I’m supposed to relate to (as a white lady) was shoehorned into this real crisis. The part that saved this book from being a DNF for me was the two teenage girls from Central America, Soledad and Rebeca, who Lydia and Luca meet along the way. I don’t need a character to have the same interests and socioeconomic background as me in order to empathize with them. The story of the two girls was so much more engaging and I found myself caring about them far more than who we were meant to be following. It feels like the author broke a huge writing rule here: don’t underestimate your reader.Also, the cartel was a joke. You will honestly find a better depiction of Mexican drug smugglers and gangs in Narcos: Mexico on Netflix. The local cartel leader was the same type of literary snob as Lydia and their interactions were laughable. Their weird pseudo-romance was like a bad Hallmark movie but with references to beheadings, plus the message was pretty messed up. Just for the record, do not refer to a brutal mass-murderer as, “This tortured poetic soul, full of remorse. He’s funny. He’s kind. Maybe things could still be different.” Ugh, gross.This  is already stupid long, and I didn’t even get to half the stuff I could have, but you get the idea. Not everything is awful, the brief acknowledgement of Indigenous people fleeing and the dangers of women traveling showed Cummins did some research for this novel. But I just don’t know that there is an amount of research that she could do to make up for her lack of firsthand experiences; if there is, she did not make a strong case for it. The whole thing just felt like it was trying too hard. I didn’t hate it, but I wouldn’t recommend it. I can’t really even pan it with a low rating, because it just didn’t leave a strong enough impression either way. It’s got a pretty face cover, but not much substance underneath....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Mar 02, 2020","Mar 16, 2020","Sep 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046527-american-dirt

Luckily, Tanen Jones’ The Better Liar isn’t one of those books. There’s something about the two main characters, Leslie and Mary, that hold your attention with a vice grip. I couldn’t read anything else until I finished this one.Apart from the literal first and last chapter, not much actually ‘happens’, per say. Leslie finds her sister dead, befriends a local woman in Las Vegas and they both go back to her hometown in New Mexico. But from the first interaction you can tell something just feels “off”. There’s so much that’s just desperately waiting to be revealed. I love stories where everyone might be lying and you can’t take anything at face value. In this way, I agree with the comparisons to Gillian Flynn, Megan Abbott and Paula Hawkins; these women could easily be some of their characters.There’s plenty of twists, with a ‘big one’ near the end. The ending even gives you a final thrust of the knife, so to speak. I was totally engrossed with this book and loved speculating about the tilted lives of the people who inhabited it. I’m definitely going to be looking for more from Ms. Jones going forward. Also—anyone who’s interested should check out the Author’s Note at the end.

It even came out during my last year of high school. Ugh, 17-year-old me, what were you DOING?! Honestly, probably transitioning from The Hunger Games to Divergent movie adaptations, which puts the Legend series right up my [former] alley. I’ve been nervous to go back and read some of the YA books of my, ahem, youth for this very reason. I don’t know if my 26-year-old, very *~cultured~* brain will be able to appreciate them in the same way my angsty teenaged one did. Truthfully, this book kind of confirmed this fear has some merit. It has some of the tropiest tropes in the genre and I found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit. That said, they weren’t the peeved eye-rolls I might give a book that was obnoxious or played too much into stereotypes. It was just predictable and a little sappy.There’s all the YA fan favorites: dystopian future with evil government overlords, teenagers of immense and inexplicable skill fighting the power, the same mega-adept teenagers falling into a meekly passionate romance. On that last point, I was amazed at just the amount of blushing and brushing against one another and oh my god the stolen, longing gazes they threw at each other. Was Twilight like this? Twilight was like this, wasn’t it. Damn it.And I get it, they’re all super-geniuses with military special forces tactical training and the thieving abilities stolen from an Ocean’s Eleven remake, but I’m sorry, YOU CAN NOT LOOK AT SOMEONE AND KNOW THEY ARE NEARSIGHTED. Or whatever other weird thing the protagonists ‘just noticed’. That’s dumb and wrong. The obsession with the idea of ‘innocence’ and compliments like “perfectly symmetrical, a mix of Anglo and Asian” are strange and fetishy, but damn if this wasn’t incredibly easy to read.

Despite that, it’s nearly impossible to move through the world without being aware of his work. He’s permeated our population with his writings at an unmatched level of cultural relevance. So while this is my first full-length novel of his, it’s hardly my first experience with the twisted imaginings that dwell in his head.King was recently on some late night show promoting his book, and told the host the plot was inspired by the children imprisoned at the USA-Mexico border who had been taken from their parents. Maybe some people prefer their entertainment to be separate from politics, but I’d argue those people have a poor understanding of both literature and politics. There is no divorcing one from the other. Not when one person’s ‘job’ involves the complete devastation of another person’s way of life. Writing and reading can be escapism, yes, but it’s never really just that. Fiction helps us process harsh realities through someone else’s narration, even though we may not be aware of it at the time.And not everyone has the luxury to pretend that there are not people suffering. That was the most unnerving part of the children’s imprisonment in The Institute. The adults in charge—caretakers, administrators, even doctors—are completely unbothered by the abuse inflicted on their charges. They lie and gaslight, making these scared kids doubt their own sanity. There’s so much cognitive dissonance and straight-up delusion, that they’ve convinced themselves that the kidnapping, torture & worse they inflict on children daily isn’t just necessary, but a good thing. This attitude isn’t an invention by King, it’s relied upon by the real-life, human monsters that skulk near positions of power. Add in those complicit in enabling them and you have what we in the business like to call, an administration.It’s a scary book. Though more horror in the front half and thriller in the back, the story is fast-paced and engrossing. Some of the ways the kids talk to each other seemed a bit off, and for the love of GOD, Stephen, why do you describe preteen girls this way: ”the girls in skirts and leggings, their bosoms just beginning to bloom,”But after a little bit of a slow start, I was totally hooked and the 550+ pages just flew by.

That, in conI'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer is the book that got me back into reading last summer. That, in conjunction with Gillian Flynn’s Sharp Objects adaptation on HBO, pushed me from true crime and thrillers back into the book world that I relentlessly follow today. Billy Jensen, along with Patton Oswalt and Paul Haynes, were the crucial force that put this book in my hands, and I am perpetually grateful to them for that.A lot of this book is stop and start, and that’s by design. Jensen depicts the moment to moment frustration when after finding a case and throwing out a line, you’re left simply waiting and hoping that someone takes a bite. There’s so many cases discussed that I don’t know how he keeps them all straight. But he does because he feels an intense connection to not just the victims, but their loved ones—the people who have been left behind.In this way he mirrors Michelle McNamara quite a bit. There’s an outpouring of empathy they both exhibit in their fervor to uncover answers, and in the outrage they feel at the overall situation that has to go mostly unexpressed. As a reader, you feel it too. It’s not fair. And that’s just not something you can say without sounding petulant and hearing an irritating voice from your childhood smugly retorting, “Well life’s not fair. Deal with it.” This is Michelle and Billy’s righteous calling: to try and tip the scales. You shouldn’t get to destroy someone’s life and keep on living yours free of consequence. So we follow people like McNamara and Jensen and hope that by dragging some of these cases into the light, that the world will be a little more livable. Maybe with another perpetrator behind bars, even if we haven’t heard of them or their crimes, something in the air will shift and we’ll feel that small bit of justice reach us wherever we are. I still feel like the world was robbed of Michelle McNamara’s voice. She had an unfairly short life. Her family and friends got an unfairly short time with her. And the people that didn’t know her, but now have her work sitting on their shelves, got only a glimpse at who she was and what she was capable of. And it doesn’t feel like enough. Even though in a lot of ways it was. The Golden State Killer was caught, in the manner she predicted. Her limited writings on the subject were sufficient enough to become a national bestseller. And we get people like Billy Jensen, carrying on in the way she would have. His book is part tribute to her and their friendship and part pursuing his own investigations. I loved following along with him. I loved seeing their shared passions and the work put in behind the scenes on her behalf.

Set in Depression-era Minnesota, two brothers, a mute native boy and a young girl escape from The Lincoln Indian Training School, a miserable institution intent on, among other things, smothering indigenous ways of life. The story takes on a The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn vibe as the crew travels in a canoe and bears witness to the harsh realities of the country while trying to figure out their places in it.For American high school classrooms, this might be a better alternative to The Grapes of Wrath. That’s not saying that Krueger is a better writer than John Steinbeck or This Tender Land is a better book, but it is more likely to appeal to students. The main characters are a group of kids that embark on their own; it reads like an adventure story. There’s also a more nuanced look at topics that had only been narrowly explored previously. We witness firsthand an array of injustices thrust upon marginalized populations through the eyes of the characters. Religion isn’t presented simply as imagery and blind faith, but scrutinized by teenagers and children through the lenses of their own experiences. We see it utilized by both good and bad actors. Plus, teachers won’t have to ignore the plagiarism rumblings associated with Steinbeck’s famous novel.

As far as YA fantasy goes, it’s one of the better ones I’ve read this year. The characters aren’t that revelatory, but the setting is absolutely exceptional. When I read that it took place in completely underwater version of London, I assumed the inhabitants were all going to be mermaids. Or something similar at least, but nope! In this post-apocalyptic future the surviving civilization lives in airtight dwellings and travels in personal submarines among the other creatures that inhabit the ocean. The author is a little vague on what exactly caused this calamity and how the people pulled off this great underwater escape, but the events of the novel happen about 70 years after it happened, so it’s not entirely relevant to the main plot. And speaking of that...The first third felt like a cross between The Hunger Games and podracing in Star Wars, but then takes a turn towards something more like an undersea adventure. Our main character, Leyla, is your classic YA heroine, for better or worse. She even gets to yell “I can take care of myself!” at various authority figures in her life before eventually realizing that she, in fact, cannot take care of herself at all. Her hunky, brooding ‘protector’ who’s perpetually clenching his jaw fulfills the love interest role in the YA way of starting as a mortal enemy before embracing one another as lovers in less than a day. My biggest issue, though? The freaking dog. Shut up about the dog. Nobody cares about the dog. I don’t know why book-dogs annoy me so much, but I never enjoy reading anything with them, and this one is mentioned on nearly every page. Also Jojo is a dumb dog name. The tropes are redundant, and the symbolism is a little heavy-handed, but I was able to read through it without wanting to go back in time and murder a teenaged version of myself, so I consider that a win.

Now, eight years later, we have been given a story crafted so carefully and lovingly that I feel silly for having any doubts in the first place. If you come into this with any remaining concern that she may be unable to capture the same magic of her last book once again, let it be cast aside now.In a comment to promote her book on Goodreads, she said:“I write places. There are spaces that live in my head long before I find the characters and the stories that live in those spaces and figure out how best to tell them.”This was evident in her last book as much as this one. Nobody rivals Morgenstern in her lush setting descriptions. Every room we step into, every article of clothing put on, the smell in the air, the color of the sky—it’s all there, dripping with detail and waiting to be soaked up greedily. The story-within-a-story style that The Starless Sea takes on lends itself to even more opportunities to transport her readers to times and places we’ve never been before. In this way, this book is truly stunning.The beginning of each ‘chapter’ is a new story, seemingly unrelated to the overall plot-line running through the book. After several of these, I did feel a bit lost. It was like there was always one thread too many for me to keep track of, but that could have been intentional. It feels overly convoluted before everything starts to come together in the end. This is probably a book that will reveal something new on each re-readMaybe this is more a complaint with my ebook, but I found the ‘Book [I-VI]’ style of breaking up the text much more difficult to navigate than traditional chapters. The Night Circus had several jumps to different time periods and places, and even when Morgenstern was being purposefully opaque, they were clearly defined. I could go back to each of those subsections on my Kindle and reference the titles of them or the date given, but there was no such luck with The Starless Sea. With all of the interlocking plot points and metaphorical and clever story titles & subjects, I think this was a misstep in the overall structure. Perhaps the print version is better in this regard.I love reading books by this author, and I hope we don’t have to wait another eight years for a third one.

In the first sentence of the first chapter, the narrator, Gwendolyn, reveals that her sister Estella murdered three hundred people. They’re members of her family, extended family and friends, poisoned for no discernible reason. This is where the story starts, but also where it ends. It would be wrong to classify this as a thriller or suspense in the traditional sense. If you’re looking for heightened happenings similar to the initial bombshell to be peppered throughout the rest of the novel, you may be disappointed. The majority of the book, basically every chapter between the first one and the last couple, is more an examination of one family’s discord spanning several years and generations. There’s so many layers present, from the inherited wealth, to racial frictions, to domestic abuse and even geopolitical ramifications. The description of this book compares itself to Crazy Rich Asians; this is true only in the most superficial way. The characters are crazy rich, from a wealthy Chinese-Indonesian family. There’s complicated familial dynamics and pressure to live up to the standards that have been cultivated decade to decade, grandparent to parent to child. Where the Crazy Rich Asians trilogy was criticized for not much acknowledging the realities of the majority population living outside of their enormous wealth, The Majesties brings a refreshing, sometimes dark level of self-awareness to the class struggles in Southeastern Asia, specifically Indonesia and the capital city of Jakarta. Though the story detours to parts of southern California & elsewhere, it’s focal point continues to be the family rooted in Jakarta.The unraveling of Gwendolyn and her sister’s family is crucial to understanding why Estella did what she did. The entire plot centers around that question: Why? What could have possibly possessed her to kill everyone in that room? It’s not a mystery in the way we’re accustomed to; the answers to the questions we’d normal be asking, ‘Who?’ ‘What?’ ‘How?’, are already known. There’s several big revelations at the end, twists and turns and bleak truths that leave the reader shell shocked.

Patchett puts as much care and color into her characters as an artist puts into each brushstroke of a painting. If you told me she also created the portrait of Maeve on the cover, I would believe you.There’s no great twists or action-packed plot, just wonderful writing about complicated family dynamics. So many times I was filled with anger or resentment that mirrored a character’s, and sometimes surpassing it. Only to, by the end of it all, have it evaporate away and leave me wondering why I felt so much. To those with your own familial tensions: expect to be confronted with them as well.It’s not a sad book; it’s sad the way life is. Or beautiful the way life is. Or unfair the way life is.

The cover gave me major The Silence of the Lambs vibes, and I was glad to see the butterflies weren’t just confined to imagery, but were incorporated in the plot as well. While not quite at the level of The Silent Patient, The Whisper Man is one of the better books among the genre this year.Set in a small British town, you have to know there are going to be plenty of connections among the characters. A couple are predictable, but most took me by surprise. Not necessarily because they’re so out of left field, but because I think I expected everyone to secretly be a murderer hiding in plain sight. Sure, most people have their secrets, but those secrets all aren’t usually actual skeletons in their closets. The perspectives shift from Tom, in first person, and a handful of other characters in third person. It’s interesting, if a little confusing at first, but ultimately doesn’t take away from anything that’s happening.On to the spoiler-y part: (view spoiler)[I loved the look at relationships between fathers and sons. So many had such similar internal dialogues that seem to echo what we hear of ‘troubled’ young men now. There’s a real look at coping with past traumas and how different people respond to it. The disconnect between these boys & men and their peers or families can distort their perceptions of reality and fantasy. There’s so many “lost boys” present in this book that I don’t think I could name them all on the first go. The crimes being portrayed are horrible, but they’re also immensely sad. It brings up an interesting debate of nature vs nurture. Did Francis do what he did because of a genetic predisposition or because of what he was exposed to at the hands of his father as a child? Were his actions inevitable either way? Basically, does what he witnessed make him who he is, or was he that person all along?The part that bugged me, however, was Rebecca. What was even going on with her? North made it seem, at least to me, like Tom murdered her and left her body for his son to find, up until the end. Her death wasn’t really ever elaborated on besides that she was...near stairs? What? I just don’t know why there wasn’t more clear-cut information given on a woman’s death who ended up being little more and a narrative devise. (hide spoiler)]It’s a good book, overall. It feels eerie and precarious and I flew through reading it.

Since originally published in 1This is an interesting time in entertainment, world politics & media discourse to pick up Watchmen for the first time. Since originally published in 1986-1987, Alan Moore’s work has continued to influence both popular culture and counter-culture in seemingly contradictory ways. The cult status of Watchmen has persisted for a reason, if not many, and I’m glad I finally got to experience it in its entirety. It’s kind of uncanny how many of the same elements that are at play during the events of Watchmen in 1985 are still relevant today. Tensions with Russia and conflict in the Middle East, radicalized right-wing extremists, fears of government conspiracy, looming climate change, corrupted politicians, etc—so much feels like it could have been written within the past couple of years. And with the total domination of super hero movie franchises, a la the MCU as well as others, the corporate cashing in on masked ‘avengers’ seems to resonate now more than ever. But since this was a “genre-changer”, some of the novel aspects are somewhat lost on those jumping in now for the first time. The dark grittiness and moral ambiguity are stark in comparison to traditional Superman-style heroes, but in a post-Dark Knight landscape and especially with more recent releases like The Boys on Amazon, these aren’t exactly fresh takes anymore. And maybe with the benefit (or curse) of hindsight I’m more able to critically look at those aspects overlooked at the time, than if I had picked it up 30 years ago.One of the parts I enjoyed the least was the culture surrounding the comics. There’s a lot of aggression, hyper-masculinity, political extremism and graphic violence present in the book(s). This in and of itself isn’t a big deal, especially since the author himself makes it quite clear that these are negative qualities, both in and out of the story. For this reason the people who identify with characters and themes in Watchmen seem like those least likely to do so, in some ways. As a satire of violence, Moore is criticizing not only characters like Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan, The Comedian and Ozymandias, but their entire way of thinking. But in the way that young men identified with Tyler Durden in Fight Club, another parody of toxic masculinity, some have misinterpreted Watchmen in the same way. There may not be a ‘good guy’, but there’s definitely bad guys.As is typical with many works from this era, representation leaves a lot to be desired. Basically all white, and the only female characters have been relegated to the roles of Discarded Older Woman, Girl Who Cries But Still Fucks, and Victim/Potential Victim.(view spoiler)[The decision to have Sally Jupiter, a victim of sexual assault, not only take up a relationship with her almost-rapist after the fact, but eventually forgive and fall in love with him, could be interesting in context with other characters who are deeply flawed. But if a portion of the intended audience reading sympathizes or worse, finds no fault in, characters like Rorschach or The Comedian, then this plot line is essentially a rape apology that excuses their actions or complicity. Complicated feelings towards an abuser isn’t uncommon, and the fact that a peer of hers was taking advantage of their pre-established relationship to attack her should make the betrayal all the worse. BUT the misinterpretation by so many of these characters and ideas makes it hard to appreciate this storyline as anything but icky. (hide spoiler)]Unfortunately, the same demographic that I described earlier probably won’t care about these things, and I’m just preaching to those who already agree.I think separate from the fandom, and in proper historical context, it’s still 5 stars for me. But when I see Red Pillers and Alt-Right forums that salivate over some of the characters and adopt their personal philosophies as their own, it makes me wonder what it means that I like it too....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Aug 18, 2019","Aug 24, 2019","Aug 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/472331.Watchmen

I mean, she didn’t go anywhere and I read Shrill only two months ago and I still haven’t seen the show and she’s written pieces for a dozen or so other media outlets, but I still miiiiiiissed her!While Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman was a lot of West’s own personal life, growth and realizations, The Witches Are Coming examines societal shifts more holistically and offers a ruthlessly necessary cultural critique. If her previous book was in part a crash course on the history of the internet up through the first half of 2016, we’re now taken on a trip through many generation-defining events that have taken place over the past three and a half years. The election of Donald Trump, Brexit, the #MeToo movement—these all have happened in the relatively short but also inexplicably long period since. In addressing not only these happenings, but the inevitable backlash to the backlash, Lindy West provides a thoughtful and well-reasoned examination of subjects that still are too discomfiting to bring up in some ‘polite company’. And she does it all with the same level of cutting humor that you’d come to expect from her work.And, guys, it’s really really funny. I was cracking up over even the chapter titles. Come on, Ted Bundy Was Not Charming—Are You High? That’s fucking classic; I want it embroidered on a pillow or something. And she replicates one of my favorite parts of her last book, which was the reflective look at one the idols of her youth, Howard Stern. But instead of Stern this time, she devotes entire chapters to examining the legacies of comedy legends such as Adam Sandler and Joan Rivers. Even some of the chapter titles, like Is Adam Sandler Funny?, would be enough provocation to set off a pack of furious fanboys to defend his honor, but I beg you all to take the time to read what she’s written. These aren’t hit pieces; the conclusions she reaches are nuanced and even the criticisms aren’t really levied at the performer personally, but at the society that shaped as well as consumed them.Even those who weren’t #blessed with their own chapter received credit where it was due. Ricky Gervais and Louis C.K.’s contributions to comedy aren’t merely tossed aside by a changing world, but they also aren’t immune to being challenged by it. One of the funniest chapters features Gwyneth Paltrow in all her Goopiness and it’s not mocking or glowing in the way we’ve come to expect towards her, but instead is refreshingly giddy and candid. West balances comic whimsy and difficult truths with the same level of deftness as Mary Poppins, disguising the bitterness of medicine with a spoonful of sugar. It really does make it all easier to swallow.Most chapters feature a story from West’s own life, either a hilarious anecdote or a moment of frustration, that is used as a segue into a topic of importance for her. A few are really Trojan Horses that don’t reveal their true nature until further into the piece, but some are upfront about the content for good reason. In What Is an Abortion, Anyway? she discusses not just her own real abortion, but her fictional one as well. Her insistence to include Shrill’s main character, Annie’s, abortion in the pilot was the same determination that birthed the #ShoutYourAbortion movement online. While not as satirical as the other essays, it’s just as sharp and truly beneficial to anyone who considers themselves pro-choice.Real talk, I was so giggly while reading this. My Kindle copy is so full of highlighted passages that if I had done the same thing to a physical copy it would be like 65% highlighter. Her self-awareness makes her so endearing and her biting wit is funny as hell—I just thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this book. The end left me optimistic and with a sense of pending accomplishment, which, yeah, is probably unearned at this stage, but with a clear path forward. I don’t know what else to say; Lindy West left me feeling happy and gave me some hope.*Thanks to Hachette Books & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Sep 20, 2019","Sep 24, 2019","Aug 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38362811-the-witches-are-coming

I’m on my way.Seriously, I’m not sure if I was even planning on watching the announced Netflix series before I found out it was based on a book series...and yet, here I am. Just a total slut for any book that has even a whisper of a potential movie or tv show adaptation. And the fact that they got Henry Cavill, aka literal Superman, playing the title character who hunts monsters and demons to star in a horror-leaning interpretation of the story just makes the whole thing even more enticing.I had a tough time figuring out where to start, though. Andrzej Sapkowski really had to make the ordering more confusing than Doctor Who & The Chronicles of Narnia...but I was able to check the recommended reading on the Witcher subreddit, so for anyone who’s also a little lost:1. The Last Wish (short stories)2. Sword of Destiny (short stories)3. Blood of Elves4. The Time of Contempt5. Baptism of Fire6. The Tower of the Swallow7. Lady of the LakeAnd then there’s Season of Storms which I guess is its own thing, technically is after The Last Wish, but should be read last. Or so they say.This was a short story collection, so it was a different way to introduce a character and fantasy world than I typically see. You do get a feel for Geralt as a person over the course of them, and I’m assuming some of the characters touched on will pop up again. Each story is almost like a mini quest that Geralt has undertaken and typically features a new monster, location and errand for him to complete. They’re framed by another story we’re fed piecemeal, chapter by chapter, in between the other tales. It’s an interesting way to relate a character backstory, but it did feel disjointed and made it hard at times to get truly invested.The stories are based on or inspired by other fairytales and folklore, albeit with a grim twist. Some are more easily recognizable, like Snow White or Beauty and the Beast, while others I had to look up, like Hans my Hedgehog, but they all divert majorly from the originals, so there’s not much of a spoiler there. I found Sapkowski really clever in crafting these takes on classic fables, and they fit exceedingly well in the darkly magical world he created for the Witcher to prowl.The rest of my complaints are the same ones that unfortunately come up in a lot of fantasy written by men. The women need some work. Either they’re unattractive, therefore barely worth mentioning, a sorceress who’s only personality is being super hot or, strangely enough, there’s a multiplicity of young women & girls who are straight-up monsters. They’re still ‘innocent’ but simultaneously ‘ruined’ and completely interchangeable. Plus there’s a good number of teenaged girls having their clothes ripped off, and this is apparently totally fine. Of all the stories in this collection, The Last Wish has the cringiest descriptions of female characters by far. I actually disliked that one so much I almost ended up taking an entire star off this , but for now I’ll leave it at four. I just dread going forward if Geralt is going to fulfill some kind of male fantasy role and every woman he encounters will be throwing themselves at him. From what I’ve read the games are even worse in this regard...but that’s not really the standard I want to judge books by, ‘Well at least it’s not as misogynistic as the video game!’Also, fight scenes are boring to read.

He’s such a self-important twat that I just don’t understand how Lisbeth is the one who’s life is being constantly threatened. And of course at nearly every turn, any single woman (under 45) just hops in bed with him. They just can’t help themselves, you see? This was a complaint in Larsson’s novels as well, and I just kept holding out hope that Lagercrantz would buck that ridiculousness, but they both seems to think arrogant, generic-at-best middle-aged writers are the universal standard of male desirability to women.Though it’s not just Blomkvist or the out-there plot developments that left me feeling lukewarm throughout the book. For me, the characterizations left a lot to be desired, especially for the women. The disclaimer again being that the rest of the series was also plagued with poorly devised female characters, but I read those a long time ago and didn’t note any specifics then. So...oh well!There’s basically just two kinds of women in this book. There’s young women (under 30), who are vapid and stupid, and older women (30+), who are lonely and horny. If they’re too accomplished then don’t fret, because they’ve been given very tragic backstories to explain why she’s, like, such a cold bitch? At one point an accomplished journalist, after being yelled at for no discernible reason by Mikael, gives in to his raw sexual magnetism and stays in bed with him for days. Then, whilst experiencing troubling flashbacks, decides to go outside and just start gardening away the trauma. At HIS HOUSE. Because women do menial chores when they’re sad. Or don’t eat. Or have sex with men and cry. That’s the only way~~~~There’s also the disturbing trend of Mikael, multiple times to multiple women, demanding they tell him about their deeply distressing past experiences. For anyone who may have been pressured to do this at some point, YOU DO NOT OWE ANYONE AN EXPLANATION OF YOUR PERSONAL TRAUMAS. The brazen entitlement to someone else’s tragedies here is just staggering. And in return he grills them further and then refuses to disclose any relevant information he’s withholding. So once again: Are we supposed to like Mikael Blomkvist?Lisbeth is the exception to the women rule because she doesn’t count. Her story is just as wild as it was in the last two novels, so don’t expect anything remotely realistic here. Honestly, it’s all pretty convoluted. But Lisbeth is still interesting, and I had to see her story through to the end. That’s who I’d recommend this book to, anyone who needs finish the series.

I did feel a little deflated when I found out this wasn’t going to be her typical suspense/thriller, but it ended up being a welcome departure from the usual.Be prepared to take sides. That’s probably the best advice I can give someone going into this novel. And be ready to have your convictions challenged, thrown on the ground and jumped on repeatedly. It’s a book where everyone’s suffering and there’s no real right answers, which is frustrating. The characters waver between rational and emotional responses, and neither feels quite right. Likely because there is nothing right when your child is dying. That said, I wish Mackintosh had made a commitment one way or another. There could have been flashes to “what could have been” throughout without having distinct, parallel paths. But with the two dueling outcomes, it feels like she’s saying these are the only two ways it could have gone. There were so many variables: Dylan could have died en route, his tumor could have slowed down, he could have picked up an infection at any point, could have the surgery but end up worse off, etc. It felt as though the author gave one choice the best possible outcome and the other the worst possible one. (view spoiler)[Plus, she was way too easy on Max. He’s indignant and unsympathetic to everyone around him, especially his wife. Both versions of him, where he won and lost, were off-putting at best and really shitty at worst. And when he started complaining about British healthcare, as an American reading that, I almost threw my Kindle across the room. Bro, people over here are literally crowdsourcing for insulin because our health insurance is so terrible. He’s apparently forgotten what a thousand dollar medical deductible is like or taking an Uber to the hospital over an ambulance and—UGH I’m going to stop myself here.

It had so much potential—varied perspectives, X-Men style superheroes, a school for ‘gifted’ children, etc. I was really expecting to love it, but alas, I ended up reading about 25%, skimming up to 50% and then skipping the rest.I didn’t care for any characters, and that’s beyond just “likeable” or “unlikeable”. They all had one personality trait and that’s basically it. Some, like Fahima, leaned so hard into playing against type that it became a whole new, even worse characterization. She wasn’t funny and blunt; she was an asshole. Avi’s entirely lame personality amounts to journalist, and he doesn’t even seem to be that good at it. And honestly, his (and our) inevitable introduction to the ‘supers’ is one of the worst I’ve ever seen played out. It’s like they each thought of the best way to approach an outsider in this situation...and then intentionally did the exact opposite.The book was also 500 pages long. It felt even longer. I think there were a lot of interesting ideas Bob Proehl was playing with, but he needed to pick a few and put the rest away. Was his editor on vacation? I feel like if you’re going to recycle so much from different sci-fi and comic tropes/plot-lines, then there has to be something revelatory in all of those pages or else just leave 150-200 of them on the cutting room floor.I think I’m being so hard on this book because I expect more from a super-powered ensemble story at this point. He’s a competent writer, and most of the ideas on their own were good. I probably would have had more positives to say if I liked the characters more or it dragged less overall, but it didn’t.

The book read somewhat like a narration of a movie, but plot is so entrancing that I couldn’t pull myself away. For anyone else who hasn’t seen the 2006 film, it’s a grim fairytale set in post-World War 2 Spain. Under the authoritarian Francisco Franco regime, many rebel groups struggled and failed to defeat the dictator before his death in 1975. I appreciated the historical context, especially the way it was not WW2 historical fiction set in England/France/US. This isn’t a book for kids, despite a child being the main protagonist. In reading up on the movie, I saw it was rated R and was a Spanish-language film. Both surprised me, but I really shouldn’t have been. I enjoyed the book, but what it really made me want to do was go check out the movie immediately. *Thanks to HarperTeen & Goodreads for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 09, 2019","Sep 10, 2019","Jun 15, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42117981-pan-s-labyrinth

I’m not even entirely sure what was missing for me, but I just didn’t connect to the story the way I was expecting.If you’ve read any blurb or  about Dear Edward so far, you probably are aware of the premise. A boy survives a plane crash that kills everyone else on board, then deals with the effects after the fact. It’s very sad, and I was expecting a lot of grief, but I didn’t really feel much of that overall. I think where Ann Napolitano succeeded was in the writing of a 12-year-old survivor’s trauma. Edward is a well constructed main character who is convincingly suffering from PTSD and depression, among other things. He feels disconnected from a good portion of the events of the book, which is a realistic depiction of someone going through this type of tragedy.That said, I really think she dropped the ball on the flashbacks. It felt like Napolitano was trying to replicate those types of scenes from Lost where they’d flash into random characters’ lives, but it just did not translate here. I don’t know how to fix it, exactly. Maybe if they were condensed and combined near the end? Or if we had gotten more information about the other passengers in the ‘present day’ story? But as it was just jumps to a half a dozen strangers, who were all stereotypes or caricatures (view spoiler)[  flight attendant is a tease, closeted gay soldier, leering businessman, woman finds out she’s pregnant WHILE on the flight—very soap opera-y(hide spoiler)], that had no relevance to Edward and his family/friends....besides that they should be remembered? I guess? I think without those parts, the narrative would have been stronger.(view spoiler)[I didn’t like Part 3 on the whole, either. The resolution for Edward felt hollow and unfulfilling, despite the story going for something uplifting. I was expecting something impressive or at least thoughtful for him to spend the money on. But buy your teacher a greenhouse because he was sad his plants died? Why not something like a scholarship or grant for the specific wishes of the people who wrote him those letters? You want to be a chef? Okay! Here’s money for culinary school in Betty’s son’s honor. Just seemed like such a waste.And the cockpit flashbacks were so unnecessary. That could have played out a hundred better ways, rather than going over in technical detail why one of the pilots was dumb for killing them all. We could have unraveled what happened slowly in bits and pieces throughout the novel, but instead we get that information dump at the very end. (hide spoiler)]I guess I didn’t know how disappointed I was until now. I appreciate that it wasn’t just tragedy porn, which something like this could easily fall into, but I don’t think the plot or characters carried the weight like those from Celeste Ng or Ann Patchett, which this has been compared to. There wasn’t much of a...story? It was just a tragic circumstance and not much beyond that. Napolitano is a talented writer, though, so I’m not put off from reading more by her going forward.*Thanks to Random House & Netgalley for an advance copy!**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,149,1,"Nov 29, 2019","Dec 06, 2019","Jun 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45294613-dear-edward

You can tell she spends a lot of time observing people then mulling them over. She's able to capture in her characters at very human and honest moments. Hating them is because you see some of yourself reflected back and you don't like to be made to look at it.That said, I don’t think this I was the target audience for this book. I don’t have much to compare marital strife or living in a big city or pressures with kids or almost anything the characters go through to. The protagonist (I guess), Toby Fleishman, is completely and totally insufferable. Hats off to Taffy for writing someone this unlikeable and obliviously self-centered. All of her characters have some flaws, but he seemed to have every single flaw at once. And this is a realistic depiction of a type of person who actually exists. I just found it difficult to care about his life.And that was kind of the crux of it for me. Fleishman Is In Trouble is a wonderfully written composite about a character I don’t want to know more about. A lot of the revelations are crushing and bleak. It really only reenforced my feelings about marriage, which are basically AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Part 3 was a lot easier for me to get through, but it’s only about 80 pages out of 373. I wanted more about Rachel and Libby and the kids and even Seth. The 3rd person perspective kind of reads like a voice over in a movie, which removed me yet another layer from the events occurring. Eventually I finished, and I’m glad I did, but I was fighting my instinct to abandon ship and watch more Netflix.Though, none of this will discourage me from picking up whatever she decides to write next—as long as it’s absent one Toby Fleishman.*Thanks to Random House, Netgalley & Goodreads for advance copies!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 13, 2019","Jul 27, 2019","Jun 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41880602-fleishman-is-in-trouble

A private school for magic with a murder mystery sounds like a cool idea that can go horribly wrong. Luckily, Sarah Gailey was able to pull it off. The other-worldliness is grounded, but still a little rogue. Kind of the way Netflix did super-hero shows like Daredevil and Jessica Jones without feeling silly. There's a grittiness that's tangible and less like a straight-up fantasy, if that helps anyone bridge the gap at all.The mystery/thriller element is equally well done.

Not for any particular reason other than I haven’t gotten around to it, but because of this I’m not going to be able to compare themes, characterizations or anything else they may share. I can only look at it as a stand-alone, so apologies if I miss any obvious references or tributes to the original novel.I think the biggest drawback to being unfamiliar with Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra’s masterwork & Salman Rushdie’s writing is that I had no idea where it was going. So much of the story feels meandering and nonsensical before everything finally clicks together. The two parallel character journeys blur the distinction between reality and fantasy that at times I forgot who’s perspective I was currently reading through, which I think was the point. A writer (character) is using a fictional persona to explore his own struggles and insecurities, whilst being in perpetual denial about it. The (actual) author writes about a novelist that’s writing about a former journalist—it’s like a literary Inception. In the end I didn’t know whether Rushdie himself was supposed to be represented through these characters. I still don’t.Rushdie skewers popular culture while also empathizing with those enraptured by it. He’s able to pinpoint exactly the type of man who could believably convince himself that stalking a woman is akin to an Odyssey-like quest. He makes it easy to identify with a protagonist that at first glance you may not have much in common with, but grow to see as a part of yourself—just one that may be uncomfortable to acknowledge. The story is mostly framed as a look at American culture, with an Indian-American focus and a couple detours to the U.K. and India, but I think Quichotte is still accessible to all.I’m not a huge fan of ‘pop culture dumps’ of just listing random references for readers to pat themselves on the back for recognizing, BUT this was probably the best use of it I’ve seen so far. (An example of this that’s, in my opinion, pandering would be Ready Player One.) I would recommend this book if you’re willing to set aside any pre-set rules for reality or how people behave and don’t really mind non-answers.

At least I can say the first one is, I haven't gotten to the other two yet. It's a dystopian magical future set in some version of London where King Edward(?) didn't succeed the throne from Queen Victoria and instead was outed as a clairvoyant before fleeing. I'm not super familiar with the British monarchy, but I think I would have heard about that if it had happened. England has been replaced by Scion, the new evil government, and the blend of future sci-fi technology with fantastical elements is really cool.The world building is immense here.

We don't really get to feel the weight of her emotional connections to those she's left behind, too.But onto the big gripe:(view spoiler)[I have a huge problem with the Paige-Warden romance. He's her slave master. He uses the word slave repeatedly, in fact. It reminds me of those gross romances people try to write about black slaves and their white masters, or between Nazi soldiers and Jewish women. It's not endearing. He's not redeemed because he, like, didn't even hit her much. There's no pardon because he decided to help humans rebel once after 180 years of kidnapping, enslavement, torture and murder. Then once again 20 years later when he thinks one of them is hot. I was just not at all expecting this turn and was totally blindsided. For god's sake, HIS NAME IS WARDEN! Was Overlord taken?? He just keeps gaslighting her and it's beyond infuriating.  (hide spoiler)]That said, it doesn't take away from my overall enjoyment.

She’s also super snobby.And truthfully, I’m not even sure this is considered romance. It’s a (view spoiler)[sexual relationship with a ghost (hide spoiler)].

They didn’t feel totally consensual and didn’t seem to serve any purpose to the plot besides the perceived transgressiveness, so I just started skimming them. The paranormal aspect was one of the interesting pieces of the story, but it never actually pans out. So much build up for literally nothing. Also, apparently everyone in this town is an inept townie and only Ava notices when a bunch of people have disappeared or died in the same geographical location for decades.It wasn’t unreadable, but I didn’t like this much at all.

I think with Thomas Harris there were expectations that a lot of previously successful authors feel when they decide to write something completely new, many years later. Cari Mora wasn’t hard to get through, but it was hard to get into.The biggest departure from the Hannibal Lecter series is what the plot revolves around. It’s kind of a cartel/heist book and takes place primarily in Miami, though there are some jumps to South America in present day as well as in flashbacks. Cari Mora is the name of the heroine, which was kind of a let down honestly. The author kept using her full name, I think to drive the title home, but I was hoping there was something more significant about it. Spoiler: there isn’t. And despite being the protagonist, she’s not given a lot to do. She’s young, attractive, vaguely useful, and eventually becomes the target of a murderous psycho (of course), but isn’t featured much until the end.The cartel stuff felt like someone trying to copy Narcos, and he even references the popular Netflix show in the book. I wasn’t sure who any of the cartel members were and who we were supposed to root for, and I frequently had to reread portions because I accidentally skimmed over someone’s death. The dialogue was choppy and weird at times, and the narration felt removed from the events being described.What was familiar just didn’t capture the same twisted interest as Harris’ other books. The main villain, especially, was just a cheap knock off of The Tooth Fairy or Buffalo Bill, that never quite landed for me. He’s a man with genetic defect, a social outcast, and is obsessed with mutilating women’s bodies in a really disturbing way. The stakes never felt real and neither did the characters.

This book is probably better for those who aren’t already huge Howard Stern fans. If you haven’t listened to his show much or heard his interviews OR if you only know him by his shock-jock past, this is a great insight into his growth as an interviewer and a person. There’s a nice array of guests spanning several decades, so I think you’ll be able to make up your mind about him either way by the end. As I mentioned in my Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman , I read the books concurrently and was able to round out some of my conflicting feelings about Howard Stern individually, and perhaps more broadly, what he represents. Stern of the 80s, 90s and into the 00s was a reactionary and crass contrarian who has admitted since that he harbored a lot of bitterness and feelings of inadequacy. He lashed out frequently and showed very little compassion at times. He said hurtful things not despite this fact, but because of it, just for the reaction. I would have not been interested in anything Stern of the past had to say.But he’s grown since then. He’s become more empathetic. He’s been given more freedom and has been able to let go of the anger he had. It’s a success story that I cling to now when it feels like cruelty for the sake of it has become more and more acceptable. His journey is laid out in segments at the beginning of each chapter introducing the guest and usually providing a personal anecdote that contributed to his line of questioning or mindset at the time. Some of them are more significant than others, while a few come off as self-congratulatory. On the whole, these parts have more of a memoir feel than the interviews, but both work well together.What I had more of a problem with intermittently was what he said to his guests. There’s a huge tonal shift if he’s speaking to a woman that’s more ‘sexualized’ in his mind vs the average man he has on. There felt like so much more inherent respect with the men and a select few women he has seemingly arbitrarily deemed worthy. The way he speaks about women with the men he’s interviewing can be diminishing as well. This isn’t limited to the Trump interviews or conversations 10+ years old; some are relatively recent and feel jarring compared to, say, his empathetic consideration of mental illness or drug addiction. If anything, the book is a great example of self-improvement. And perhaps an even better example of how we all have so much more room to continue to grow....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 22, 2019","Jul 31, 2019","May 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40591597-howard-stern-comes-again

The only other one, Suspicious Minds, received mixed s from fans of the TV series. Darkness on the Edge of Town, however, is a backstory of one of the most beloved characters from the show, Jim Hopper, as a detective in the NYPD, seven years before he first meets Eleven. The majority of the text is set in 1977, but there are several intercut scenes in 1984, where Hopper is recalling the events of the story to Eleven. It's kind of like a Princess Bride thing.It starts as any by-the-book police procedural. Hopper investigating multiple homicides, a rookie cop, Feds vs local police conflict, etc. Don't expect much in the realism department here. He's a rogue cop who plays by his own rules & that's miraculously always in the right. Hopper in the book doesn't really seem to have the temperament to be a detective, and it didn't do much to make his character more sympathetic. A lot of the stakes for him seem melodramatic. Someone threatens his family in a completely unnecessary and cartoonishly villainous way. The bad guys don't seem coherent, and law enforcements eventual solution makes no sense. There's several cliches, my least favorite is the ""I can't tell my wife what's going on because reasons."" The back half of the book, though, picks up and gets pretty exciting. I'd just set both your expectations from the franchise and how police officers work aside before jumping in.I did really like the portions with Eleven, though, and wish there were more of them. Hopper at one point was explaining to a young girl in the 80s about sexism and racism in the 70s (for an audience in 2019).

Classic literature has been tIn Ta-Nehisi Coates’ Between the World and Me, he wrote on the idea of serious writers and their characters being white. Classic literature has been taught to us as historically being by white men about white culture, where other perspectives are interpreted as inferior. At one point, Coates considered a question by Saul Bellow that asks who the Tolstoy of the Zulus is. Later, he accepted the response by Ralph Wiley, “Tolstoy is the Tolstoy of the Zulus,” and in that sentiment affirmed that stories by black authors about black characters matter just as much as white ones, but without reducing them to merely a ‘black version’ of their counterparts. Though he’s written both Black Panther and Captain America’s comic series, this is Coates’ first full-length fictional work. Taking place during the middle of the 19th century, Hiram is a member of the Tasked in Virginia. He serves the Quality until he attempts to join the Underground and discovers the power of Conduction. The terms used are intuitive and historical, stemming from language used in the old south by both slaveholders and those enslaved. Most characters are created by the author, but historical locations, events and figures are skillfully interwoven with the magical realism of the novel to create a truly remarkable story.Coates is a talented writer, and I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve read of his. But, the beginning especially, was pretty slow going. Eventually the plot picks up a bit, but there were so many breaks in the story where Hiram would reflect deeply, and he felt like a stand-in for the author to have yet another introspection. These ideas seem to work so much better in Coates’ non-fiction books, but at times took away from the overall narrative he was trying to tell here. The book could have been much shorter without taking away anything crucial.I did enjoy it overall, though, and this was an excellent debut novel for an already very accomplished author.*Thanks to Random House & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Aug 29, 2019","Sep 09, 2019","May 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43982054-the-water-dancer

Despite Mickey not being real, her struggles and her pain are representational of a national crisis that feels like it has no end in sight. I don't really enjoy stories about downward spirals. There's an inevitability to the despair the characters face and the best you can hope for is that the current rock bottom is the actual bottom this time. The prologue is a flash forward to multiple character deaths while the 'heroine' of the book is in the depths of her addiction. This is a massive spoiler before even the first chapter, but in a story like this, is it actually? What other way could it have ended? It's difficult to read about their lives while knowing how they will meet their end. And the element of surprise being taken away doesn't pull the eventual gut punch. Mindy McGinnis also doesn't hold back on the really unglamorous parts of addiction. From lies told, to the crimes committed, to the really gross bodily functions losing control, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of upsides to being an addict. One of the most poignant examples was when Mickey was self-medicating to counteract her other medications. Every new substance she put into her body to solve one issue kept creating a new issue in its place. It felt a lot like The Lady Who Swallowed the Fly.

So in this book, Chelsea starts by working on the only person she has direct control over: herself.I've read a few of her books before and loved both her E! & Netflix shows, but this book feels like a new era for Chelsea Handler. She starts by acknowledging her privilege as a white woman in America. She feels spoiled and selfish for living in luxury and wants to fix those parts of her.

Learning more about her family dynamics, the loss of her brother, then mother, explains a lot about the Chelsea Handler of today. There's a lot of useful revelations that struck a chord with me as well. I found myself getting emotional with her at times.Chelsea has always been sharp. She's known in part for being crass and crude, but is also really smart and an excellent writer. The best part of her is put on display, and that's her incredible level of self-awareness. She's not condescending in her experiences, and there's still plenty of levity and funny moments. The chapters featuring her dogs are classic Chelsea.

After The Girl in the Tower, I started reading a bit about the rule of Dmitrii Ivanovich and when I saw there was a warrior monk named Aleksandr that served him...well I’m very satisfied with where Katherine Arden decided to conclude the series.I will really miss Vasya, though. She’s a heroine for the ages and if the world was fair, would have an infinite number of books written about her. I feel like a lot of medieval fantasy drips with this unrepentant misogyny that’s given a pass under the guise of “historical accuracy”. Arden didn’t shy away from the harshness of this period, but put it into context without feeling gratuitous. There was no hand-waving, saying that’s just how it was, and I appreciated her ability to present feudal Russian in a way that didn’t make me gag. Vasya understands the nature of her place in this world, and she is able to carve out her own version of agency.The Winter of the Witch returns to the old, dark kind of fairytale—the type where Ariel turns into sea foam at the end instead of a princess. There’s more Russian and Slavic mythology as well as real historical events, which are masterfully melded together. Lingering questions and blank spaces are filled in with a level of detail that I’m not used to seeing in many series, if I’m being honest. The arc of Vasilisa Petrovna feels complete and on a clear trajectory. Plus, there’s a lot of action; you definitely won’t be bored.I wish the author was writing more for adults right now, but she’s been doing a middle grade series that I’ll still probably pick up eventually.

If there's any kind of complicated scenario or relationship I'm more likely to take the kid's side. Multi-generational stories like Ask Again, Yes always challenge those beliefs and I'm grateful for that. Even so, I think a big part of that is that I'm not a parent, and I have no plans to become one at any point. I feel like people who have kids are easier on other parents, more understanding of some mistakes because they've made them too. Parents are just people. I don't think that's much of an excuse, but is more of a reason that some adults shouldn't reproduce. I really felt for Kate and Peter as children and young adults, especially when they started living lives of least resistance. You might not outgrow the scars of childhood, but I guess you can treat them. I struggled with wanting to assign blame throughout this novel. It just feels like someone should be at fault. There are parties who bear some responsibility, but I just get so frustrated when they never seem to be the ones to bear the consequences. In this case, life really does imitate art.Mary Beth Keane does an excellent job juggling multiple viewpoints without abruptly announcing a new 'narrator' or harshly switching the tone. It feels like a movie in that way, just seamlessly checking in on another character, having the passage of time speed up or slow down accordingly. She's also able to put us into the minds of people struggling psychologically, especially when a character is having a breakdown or paranoid episode. Everyone is hurt by untreated mental illness, and she makes you feel that pain multidimensionally. This was a sad story of hard lessons. Not a happy ending, but some kind of a resolution. The best we can hope for, I guess.*Thanks to Scribner & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 13, 2019","May 18, 2019","May 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42201996-ask-again-yes

It's well-written and compelling enough to want to finish. I just have been struggling with YA fantasy lately. Some is done really well, and others feel phoned-in. This one fell somewhere in the middle.A lot of this book felt really familiar. A beautiful maiden, a sullen & smirking prince, a girl thrust into luxurious royal life, falling for the alternative love interest, etc. That's also not to mention the similarities Crown of Coral and Pearl shares with The Cruel Prince: twin girls, betraying betrothals, switching places, one submissive twin & one defiant one, being taken from your home. It's not the same story, but it felt as though they both covered the same themes.Except for the obsession with scars. I found it incredibly jarring. Almost every character either proclaims or sadly agrees that any skin blemish is literally the most disgusting thing ever, and it's never really challenged. Even by the end, I found the attempts at addressing it unsubstantial. The way Nor's facial scar is described is just nonsensical. It's so small and light you can barely see it, yet apparently it's the first thing anyone notices and is incredibly memorable. The idea of her being 'ruined' for it is just so absurd to me that I found it more unbelievable than the magic healing coral or mystical sea spirits.And for an alleged ""queendom"", there was some of the lowest levels of female agency that I've seen in a while. If the aim was to make anyone on the island of Varenia even somewhat sympathetic, it did not come across. It's probably not the best sign when an entire population is threatened with extinction and my first reaction is GOOD. I'm not sure if the ending is a set up for a sequel, but I think it would be best as a stand-alone. I liked the relationship between the sisters, but the romance(s) felt forced. And the villain seemed to just do whatever would make the story most interesting for the protagonist.

And when it never died down I just snagged one of my libraries 15 digital copies when one became available. And it was...woof. It was truly a lot to take in. For some reason I assumed it was more aspirational in nature, something like Girl, Wash Your Face of last year. It ended up being more like The Glass Castle, a memoir I deeply love. Maybe the giant pencil cover threw me, idk. Whatever the reason, I wasn't ready for Tara Westover's devastating recollections of her childhood.The Westovers are not bad people. It's not like they set out to actively harm their family. But they are also not fit to be in charge of children. The saddest thing about their story is that these situations are more common (to varying degrees) than we want to admit. How can we mediate situations that we don't know exist, by people who are naturally adverse to involving any type of 'outsiders'? There's a terrifying and dangerous amount of intentional ignorance and seclusion in some parts of the US & the rest of the world. I don't know the solution to problems like this.Almost as concerning is some of the negative reactions to this memoir. How someone can call this ""fake"" or ""exaggerated"" is beyond my understanding. I actually saw a  that said ""I've heard of worse upbringings"". It's not a contest. And that just adds credibility to Westover's story. Some even doubted the education she received, despite the professors & institutions being Google-able. Good God, I hope those people aren't ever approached by a cult. If they are, they'll be hiding in their own bunkers, stockpiling weapons and canned fruit with the rest of them.I found Tara Westover's chronicling of her own self-doubts and criticisms her best asset in warding off nay-sayers. The gas-lighting by her family and constant purposeful regression really drove home how deep the trauma goes. The entire family is stunted, and even after Tara and some of her brothers have 'gotten out', their father (and to an extent mother & brother) still have such a strong grasp on them. At one point she mentions not wanting to be referred to as 'impressive' by an academic audience. I can understand that, but it's really all I can say to sum up her harrowing life. She's impressive not just for her higher education or subsequent career, but her resolve.

In the Author's Note she describes her time working at a UNICEF refugee camp in Greece and how deeply it affected her. With the help of refugees in England and informed by her own experiences at the camps, the characters of Nuri and Afra took shape, representing the thousands of displaced from Syria and other war-ravaged places. These perspectives are crucial to the construction of the book. You can see Aleppo like a painting in front of you, hear the voices echoing in Athens, taste the salty Aegean Sea. But you also feel the devastating and all-consuming hardship of the people displaced from their homes. We move from Nuri's prior life in Aleppo, Syria, back and forth to his applying for asylum in the U.K., one slowly catching up to the other. Every relocation and obstacle hits you like a punch to the gut and the immensity of their situation sinks in steadily until you're swallowed whole.This is a book about family, friendship, distance and grief. The physical scars may eventually fade, but psychological ones only fester.

Among them, it passed for ‘good luck’.”[image]As much as I enjoy reading fantasy, sometimes I feel a little hesitant before starting a new series. There’s so much world-building and lore that has to be unpacked to appreciate the characters and their motivations that sometimes it can be rough going in the beginning. After debating between the original trilogy, first duology and the currently incomplete second duology (so...one book), I decided to pick up Six of Crows despite the chronological order of the Grishaverse. This series has had such glowing s that I thought it would give me the best shot at falling in love with Leigh Bardugo’s work and fully committing to her world. And.....I think I made the right choice. With a plot that centers around a heist and a half a dozen distinct character points of view, there’s so much going on in absolutely the best way. From Jesper, the cheekiest and best sharpshooter you’ll come across, to Nina, who’s powers paired with her charm will keep you on your toes, to Inej, just as endearing as deadly, with a particular set of skills that will have you checking over your shoulder—there is not a weak character in the bunch. And when they team up with Wylan, Matthias along with their forever-scheming leader Kaz, you’ll be hard pressed to find a treasure or secret out there that they‘ll be unable to extract.“Kaz leaned back. ‘What's the easiest way to steal a man's wallet?’‘Knife to the throat?’ asked Inej.‘Gun to the back?’ said Jesper.‘Poison in his cup?’ suggested Nina.‘You're all horrible,” said Matthias.” The Dregs, as they’re known, are rambunctious and brilliant and funny and exactly who you’d want in a group of frenemy gang members to be. There’s enough information given to easily follow along with what’s happening, with enough withheld to not overwhelm but keep you guessing. I was totally enraptured. I even had to force myself finish other books I was reading before I would let myself come back to this one. Bardugo’s writing has found its rhythm here, and her greatest strength lies in her characters’ interactions.[image]This is one of those stories that you’re just going to have to experience for yourself. Out of all of the books I’ve recommended to people, Six of Crows has one of the highest success rates, even among my notoriously picky reader friends. And honestly, the biggest drawback of reading her other series set in this universe has been that they never quite reach this level of radiance again. Though if you want to revisit some of the same characters and locations, there is a direct sequel, Crooked Kingdom, which is her second best novel. But I don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to knock against the original trilogy—it’s still good! Show-watchers who stumble across this  will absolutely want to read that if they want to deep dive into the Ravkan turmoil. And for those who prefer to read it in chronological order, this is what you’re going to want to do:Shadow and Bone -> Siege and Storm -> Ruin and RisingSix of Crows -> Crooked KingdomKing of Scars -> Rule of Wolves[image]I’m sorry Alina, I still love you.And now with the second KoS book out this year, I’m sad to say there are no Grishaverse books currently in the works. That said, Bardugo has mentioned there is *potential* for a third one “many years down the line”, which makes me equal parts ecstatic and anxious. I’m completely ravenous for any future books set in this universe, but afraid that she may not be able to recapture the magic of this specific duology within the world she’s now expanded on even further. Only time will tell, but either way I’m still going to be reading up and tuning in to whatever has Bardugo’s name on it....more",Notes are private!,0,78,1,"Sep 05, 2019","Sep 11, 2019","May 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows

The book is structured as stories and glimpses into the lives of several different people living in the same peninsula of Russia. We see how two stolen children are used to tighten the already rigid hold on women across many communities. This book is about trapped women and trapped girls. Yes, there's a resolution to the two girls' story, but for many we meet, there's no such satisfying conclusion.Which is perfectly acceptable, and closer to the truth for those living similarly.

It followed some of the familiar beats of a private boarding school, but quickly it turns into something else entirely. We're thrown into the planning stages of a budding rebellion, with none of the unnecessary explanations of why the characters would be so outraged at the state of their school. One group of students is being despicable to another group through various acts of manipulation and fear. By the time the revolt comes to a head, I'm ready to take up arms along with them.

Either way, I'm glad to have gotten the opportunity to read it.The story focuses on Kya, a young child who grows into young woman after being abandoned by her family before she was able to read. She spends a lot of this time desperately sad. So much of her life seems tinged with desperation. Desperate for human contact, love. Desperate to get away from it. She's the tragedy of a girl left to fall through the cracks, and then be blamed for those circumstances. Really heartbreaking to think about.There's a suspicious death and eventual investigation, but while it may be a 'mystery', it didn't really pull my focus. I thought I could see where it was going, but even if you can 'guess' parts of the resolution, it's by no means the end. The final third or so felt like it dragged a bit, so I can see how some people got bored. I feel like if you're only reading for plot-driven reasons, then you're more likely to be disappointed.Where the Crawdad Sings is a portrait of American life that seems to be preserved in part from generation to generation, for better or worse.

It starts out familiarly enough, a plucky young girl raised by a wealthy benefactor at the turn of the century, and while I enjoy some of those stories, they can feel a bit stale after a while. Even though it was immediately apparent Alix Harrow was an exceptional writer, I didn’t expect to be so enraptured by the world she has crafted and shared with us.There’s adventure and intrigue, there’s mystery and mysticism. There’s magic and contests of wills. There’s so much heart poured into this book that I often found myself very moved. It gave me a feeling deep inside that anything is possible. If I read this as a child I might have believed it to be secretly true, even if I knew better, similarly to how I felt about The Chronicles of Narnia.

This mirrors Alicia Berenson's journey, as she lives out the 'is she telling the truth, actually crazy or crazy like a fox' theme that I love so much.There's also something about therapists/mental health facilities/shrinks that people instantly distrust. It could be entertainment media portrayal or historical precedent or personal experience or maybe just something fundamental about the idea of someone trying to get into your head.

The brilliant Aidy Bryant plays a Lindy-like character and I’m assuming there will be plot lines that mirror her life, but right now I can’t compare them any more than that. All I can say is that I loved Ms. West’s writing and I hope the show lives up to it.Despite the title, the book is not just about loud, outspoken women. The author is an unflinching feminist and has repeatedly called out those who promote sexist and harmful rhetoric, but it’s not just about the misogyny. West discusses the intersection of sexism and fat-shaming, along with other issues like racism and online trolls, and links them in a way that’s easy to understand and hard to unsee once it’s been pointed out.Interestingly, I was reading Howard Stern’s new memoir at the same time, and I was caught off guard when West proclaimed her love of his radio show throughout her formative years. She writes about struggling to reconcile her admiration for him with the outright sexism on his program, where she felt like she had to laugh along with a joke to which she was the punchline. This really mirrored some of my feelings reading the thoughtful reflection by an older Stern at the beginning of a chapter, followed by jarring language in the transcripts immediately following. A lot of the interviews weren’t even that old, like around five years or so, but it still came off as dated and not very funny. The two books ended up being unlikely companion pieces to each other.The part about losing her “funny card” really got to me. Having to decide whether or not to continue to weather abuse in a community that you’re a part of and otherwise enjoy or take a stand and end up subjecting yourself to even more vitriol, whilst having your membership to that community revoked is just so desperately unfair. And time after time of taking those hits eventually causes an instinctual avoidance of it altogether, if you haven’t already been kicked out at that point. The fact that this happens in comedy, where so many outsiders and outcasts have found reprieve from the harshness of the world, is just even more depressing. I’m glad that Lindy West and her book have done so well. She’s a fantastic writer who validated my impulses to use CAPS for EMPHASIS, without taking away from the ‘seriousness’ of her work. Her upcoming book The Witches Are Coming is one of my most anticipated for this year, but until then I’ll just be reading old Jezebel articles of hers to pass the time....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 30, 2019","Jul 31, 2019","Apr 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29340182-shrill

The princesses are all sarcastic and the princes are just a smirk personified, and all this ground feels very well-treaded. I’m reading too much into this, but what does it say when all the important and powerful characters are determined by ‘blood’ and the station to which they are born? I never thought I’d pine for the Bella Swan styled regular girls *sigh*, but here we are.The character interactions really aren’t charming in the slightest. They’re just mean to each other, then their ears and cheeks flush. Not to mention how inappropriate some of these relationships are; if someone is your ‘guardian’ growing up, but as soon as you get boobs it becomes something more, then he needs to be shipped off to the Woody Allen Island of Misfit Predators. Also—what’s desirable about a guy crashing through your closed bedroom window, leering at your “low neckline”, then slapping him while he clutches a...baby bird? Is this what teenagers think is romantic now? Back in my day, creepy older men in books simply snuck into teenage girls’ bedrooms to watch them sleep, like NORMAL people.And woooooow the male posturing is just next level. Two dudes are arguing and fighting every other chapter over said sarcastic princess’s **vIrGiNiTy** and it’s incredibly toxic. She also hits them both a lot. Hopefully I don’t need to explain why these are problematic, especially for teenagers. Relationships shouldn’t be this hostile, and there’s nothing in the least bit romantic about how these characters act with each other.It’s fine, just too familiar. I only got halfway through before I decided to throw in the towel. If you’re looking for a paint by numbers YA fantasy novel, then this is as good an option as any.

In fact, I don't think I had any formal instruction on basically any of the conflicts between England and Ireland besides possibly a blurb about how so many of the Irish immigrated to the U.S. in the last couple of centuries. And after reading Say Nothing, it's clear that this is by design. I couldn't help the alternating waves of outrage and fatigue coming over me. With every chapter I demanded justice and that someone pay for these crimes, and by the next one I assessed that the people had paid enough--it was time to stop. The absolute terror of this localized violence feels nearly impossible to those who have never experienced it, and the more that regular people were pulled into the crossfire, the more I felt like several key players who held the most responsibility ended up escaping the carnage relatively unscathed.""The romantic idyll of a revolutionary movement is easier to sustain when there is no danger that one's own family members might get blown to pieces on a trip to the grocery store.""Though Patrick Radden Keefe touches on several time periods and references many players in this undeclared war, we follow a few in detail to frame the unfolding of key events. Chapter 1 opens in 1972 on the abduction of Jean McConville and we follow her children as they search for what happened to her well into their own adulthood, past even the age she was when she was taken. The second chapter looks at the Price sisters, Dolours and Marian, during their childhood in the 1950s growing up in an IRA household. We follow their radicalization as a template for how many young people became involved in the new Provisional IRA. Through them we meet Gerry Adams and Brendan Hughes, and in their friendship we see the power structure of the Provos and associating organizations working for the cause.The search for Jean McConville grows over time as we learn new information. It goes from what happened to Jean McConville, to where is she, to who took her, to why was she taken? The first two questions have been conclusively answered, and the second to last is nearly there as well. Keefe satisfies most with his own deductive explanation, but it won't be confirmed without the passing of one of the people involved. To the final question, there isn't a consensus, but it doesn't really matter. For those who seek justification for this crime and others, you won't find it. And similarly, for those of us who seek traditional forms of justice, we're unlikely to receive it.The Troubles aren't a unique type of conflict, but unlike those that seem to be further removed from North American and European lives, North Ireland feels like our own backyard. In situations like these, there's no real winners, just loss.

In an act of ultimate projection, she’s been accused of witchcraft by the total creep-fest priest, Konstantin, and has to disguise herself as a boy to escape the patriarchy (marriage & convents, ew). After linking up with the frost demon Morozko and their respective sassy horses, the two embark on a buddy comedy called Made In Moscow or The Byzantine Brothers, with new episodes airing weekly on NBC.**I’m using humor to distract from the fact that it’s been a few weeks since I read this and kinda forgot what happened—BUT it’s all coming back to me now I swear!   [image]After reading better ers’ synopsizes, I actually do remember how I felt during The Girl in the Tower for the most part. This sequel was a lot more political than the last book, with Vasya having to navigate complicated power dynamics while also concealing her identity. Her only two siblings that matter, Sasha and Olga, are there in Moscow with her, both trying to protect her from outside forces as well as from her own dangerous impulses. (The two other brothers, one of whom I forgot was even a thing, basically don’t exist in this novel, so don’t bother trying to remember their names.)The villains of this book feel less defined. They’re more ambiguously human and less ‘evil one-eyed bear’ or straight-up Frollo. (view spoiler)[I did get kind of lost for a bit in the Kasyan vs Morozko beef, but I’m like 85% sure I got it now.

From the moment we met Nahri in The City of BrA 2020 Goodreads Choice finalist in Fantasy!It’s really no secret how much I’ve adored this series. From the moment we met Nahri in The City of Brass, I knew this was going to be a special story. I’d like to just take a beat and thank Shannon Chakraborty for transporting us into a world of her own imagining; I feel truly lucky to have been able to experience her creation.“Creator, every time I think I’ve found the bottom in all of this, I get some new story of murder and vengeance.”But for those who haven’t had the opportunity yet, I don’t want to mislead anyone into thinking this is a series of just beautiful magic set in a far away place. Though the characters are powerful djinn, the setting an enchanted city, at the center of the story is revenge and violence, passed down through the generations. Pain and grudges are inherited, just like their powers, and it can be a difficult cycle to break out of. Empire of Gold is the final comeuppance for all the characters who have been reeling with this legacy of grief and trauma. Each of the younger ones are forced to make a decision: will they let their ancestral anger dictate their paths or will they forge their own? I’m sure there’s a lot of parallels to Middle Eastern history and politics represented between the 6 tribes which I am not aware of. But you don’t have to have any sort of background knowledge before diving into this series; you just need to prepare to have your beliefs challenged again and again. And take my word for it, Chakraborty doesn’t let anyone get away with feeling 100% vindicated. This is an entire society painted in shades of grey, much like our own.“she wasn’t going to waste her life regretting other people’s choices”There wasn’t one character I didn’t feel for in some way. Nahri is our protagonist that tries her best, but is struggling with identity. Ali is devout, rigid in his beliefs, and always attempting to do the right thing. Dara is strong, passionate and stubborn, with a relentless loyalty to those he loves. I won’t give a blurb for every single character, but Zaynab, Muntadhir and Jamshid are also completely captivating. Throughout all three books, Chakraborty explores themes of family, both who you’re related to and that which you choose for yourself. Similarly, we examine the importance of a shared history, of a shared culture. The importance of someone’s name. It’s up to each person to decide which pieces of themselves make up their own identity. You don’t have to answer for every mistake your family or friends have made, but each of us is responsible for the choices we make. We are culpable in accepting the status quo when it benefits us to someone else’s detriment, even if we aren’t the ones to created that power structure in the first place. Seeing something wrong and doing nothing causes just as much damage.Please note I have barely scratched the surface of everything covered in these books! Read some other s so you can get a fuller picture. If this was being adapted for film instead of a Netflix series, this book would be split into at least two movies. Not just because of the length, but the huge amount of plot and territory that’s covered. But since it is going to be a Netflix show, I would also like to congratulate Shannon & the fandom because honestly this is huge for us too!! ...more",Notes are private!,0,150,1,"Jun 29, 2020","Jul 15, 2020","Mar 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52166786-the-empire-of-gold

As others have pointed out, there’s nothing that’s incredibly groundbreaking in this series as far as YA fantasy goes. What has made it so popular is that it’s all done excruciatingly well; there’s that elusive quality that you can’t quite put your finger on which makes it incredibly addictive.That said, no matter what the star rating ends up being, this was pretty definitively the weakest installment of the Folks of the Air trilogy. I’m not sure if Holly Black felt the need to hurry to get this one out, but considering The Wicked King came out only earlier this year, I feel like she could have waited until 2020 and taken her time wrapping everything up. Much of the book felt rushed, and coming in at just barely 300 pages, there was room for a little extra narrative.Now for the spoiler-heavy critique: (view spoiler)[The biggest thing missing (besides MORE PAGES) was the looming sense of fear and precariousness surrounding Jude. The first two books had her scrambling to simply survive, but all of her supposed ‘threats’ in The Queen of Nothing felt toothless. I was never actually afraid she or another main character would fall to harm. The ending was so anticlimactic. I was waiting for literally any of Chekhov’s guns to surface, but Black just dropped them ALL. Lady Asha (Cardan’s mom) amounted to nothing. The Undersea turned tail. Locke, one of the most quietly menacing villains of the series, was killed before the book even started. I just...don’t understand what happened here.And that’s not even touching on the characters who suddenly did an about face for no discernible reason. Oriana I guess has no loyalty and no motives, which undermines her prior shrewdness. Madoc is all over the place, seemingly just there as a foil to Jude’s plans. Cardan has been reduced to a schmaltzy romance novel cover-boy. And—I’m sorry, but I am definitively NOT here for the Taryn redemption arc. Whoopsie I killed the husband who I betrayed you for, who almost killed you, and who was meeeean to meeeee after. Can you take the fall for his murder for me and our baaaybeee. I have not actively rooted for any character’s death as much as Taryn’s, good lord, she is T-O-X-I-C. The only ones who seem unaffected are Vivi and Oak, who both are just as delightfully apathetic to the Faerieland skirmishes as ever. I really didn’t like the softening of characters in an effort to make them more, I dunno, likable? Why bother trying to redeem any of the characters? One of this series’ strengths is that the characters are so easy to hate. You don’t really want to root for any of them because they’re bad people, but you do it anyways. Why not just own that? Instead everyone gets a pass for all of the shitty stuff they’ve done for the sake of a touching family pizza party at the end. (Seriously, Madoc killed their mother & father, stole half the army, almost killed Jude, plotted against her, tried to enslave her and turned her friends and family against her, and his punishment was....having to live comfortably with his wife, daughter and adopted son? WHAT?) (hide spoiler)]In a year with so many great fantasy and YA fantasy releases (including the second book in the same trilogy!), The Queen of Nothing didn’t manage to leave much of an impression. I really hate to give this anything but a glowing , but I can’t let the hype overshadow the actual contents of the book. I wouldn’t say I’m disappointed, but, yeah, this was a bit of a let down.As an aside, I love when authors I love are friends, and this dedication made me inexplicably happy:“For Leigh Bardugo, who never lets me get away with anything”...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Nov 18, 2019","Nov 23, 2019","Mar 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44428899-the-queen-of-nothing

Each member of the family is struggling with feeling responsible for other people's happiness and well-being, even at the cost of their own. The responsibility Lydia felt towards her family during her life isn't quashed in death, it's passed on to the people she left behind. Every interaction is tinged with pronounced regret.

During Annihilation we were kept wondering, 'What's the bigger picture here?', 'Is this all part of a larger plan?', 'Who's actually pulling the strings and to what end?', so I was excited to see the back-end so to speak of these explorations. Even if it meant a near entirely new cast of characters.If there's a difference between OMG what's happening?! and Wait, what happened?, then I was waffling between the two of them much of the time. I wasn't sure whether my attention span was just failing me or whether parts were unclear, but I found myself having to go back and re-read portions where I missed some information. Jeff Vandermeer reveals information in a really strange way, and he does it this way multiple times.I wanted more information into the members of the Southern Reach other than The Psychologist and Control. All other employees seemed like stand-ins for actual characters. Even ones we get more interaction with, like Whitby and Grace, feel like they only act as obstacles for the protagonist, not as their own entities. Similarly, Central was a total mess. I get it's supposed to represent 'The Government' shrouded in secrecy, but it just came off as disjointed and unnecessarily ambiguous.The first half or so was nearly unbearably slow. So much was repeatedly dwelled on in Control's past and inter-office conflict that could have just been done away with. I had no idea the book only spans a week; it felt like months. Part 4 ended up being the most intense, and I wish portions like that had received more attention. There were some really interesting insights into the beginning of and initial responses to Area X, but they just weren't explored enough. Also, I understood nearly nothing until three-quarters of the way through, which feels excessively withholding.I like the world Vandermeer crafted, but I wish he was more consistent in his storytelling....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 16, 2019","Mar 27, 2019","Mar 14, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18077769-authority

Part magical fantasy, part courtroom drama and part murder investigation, there's a lot of plot in this one. The question of who killed the king is dangled over us as the new queen has to attempt to navigate her country's legal system as well as the court of public opinion. Hesina additionally goes up against her own advisors, ministers and even her own people. There's a complex political structure in Yan that did away with the 'unquestioned tyrannical king' that usually exist in stories like this, which I really appreciated. There's also a religious cult-like mindset that invades the population and mimics some of the abuses of power and widespread fear & animosity that parts of the world are dealing with today. Both the audience and the characters are asked, is it better to try to appease a mob or to dismantle it? ""In trying times, truth is the first thing we betray.""Hesina has a pretty large and complicated family, with an adopted brother and sister, a half-brother and a full brother along with her father, mother who doesn't live with them and the courtesan mother of said half-brother. There's resentment and anger bubbling beneath the surface at all times, and it at times was difficult to follow people's motivations. Sometimes even after the explanations of some characters' actions, I was still left confused on why.I don't know if this is a theme with the fantasy books I've read lately or just in general, but it seems like the endings are always set up for a sequel. Which is fine, but I like to know that going into the book, so I can rate it as a stand-alone or one of a series. If this was a stand-alone then I feel like it left me with some questions, but if there's more coming, then the epilogue was the perfect post/mid-credits scene like out of a Marvel movie.

After breaking myself from the hypnotic trance that is the cover, I'd hoped to conquer this book but was still a little nervous. Maybe it’s the size.......yeah it’s mostly the size, but the s had also made it out to be something supremely epic and I felt a little apprehensive as if it could actually swallow me whole. The Priory of the Orange Tree definitely lives up to the hype. It's expansive and intricate and had me in awe of the world Samantha Shannon had constructed. I was a bit lost at first and constantly referencing the map, but by the end I had a general idea where the characters were most of the time. Chapters are organized by regions 'East', 'West' & 'South', but you’re not always aware of which kingdom or perspective you’re following. It ends up forcing you to focus and not passively read; this is a story that demands your attention.But finally, I have found a fantasy book that doesn't follow arbitrary gender roles in a world of magic and dragons. In crafting Priory, Shannon puts women and men on an equal playing field. When designing their own societies with their own sets of rules, I never understood why so many authors choose to restrict half the population in the same way they've been restricted in our own histories. It wasn't until near the end of the book that I realized there hadn't been any sexual violence. There wasn’t even the threat of rape, which is so common in fantasy that most of us are probably desensitized to it.There's also none of the teenager sex scenes that appear more often in YA fantasy either. This is a book written for adults that doesn’t have to resort to cheap potshots at female characters in order to distinguish itself from YA and doesn’t use hIsToRiCaL aCcUrAcY as an excuse to subject them to further harm. Women are heads of courts, they're villains, they're mothers, they're soldiers, they're complex and whole and none of their character development is done at the expense of male characters. And it’s all done without being explicitly addressed. There's no grand declaration that women are subverting expectations or are just as capable as men. They just are. And it's wonderful and well-done.I know it's a doozy of a book, but it's sooo worth it. Really, I don't know how Shannon is going to get away with not writing a follow-up. There's just too much potential! Although I expressly forbid her from writing anything longer than this. There's as much plot in her one book as there is in like 3 seasons of Game of Thrones.[image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,-1,164,1,Apr 2019,"Apr 14, 2019","Mar 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40381319-the-priory-of-the-orange-tree

In the shadow of the War on Terror taking place in Iraq, Tapper provides a harrowing testimony of American military presence in a remote part of Afghanistan from 2006 through 2009. Following the 3-71 Cav to the 1-91 Cav and 6-4 Cav, ending with the 3-61 Cav, The Outpost injects a remarkable amount of humanity into events and subject matter that can feel very technical to a civilian audience. The title makes it sound like this book is about one battle. It's not. By nature of the war in Afghanistan, there's an expanding map of locations and evolving roster of people manning them over an ever-extending period of time. Frankly, it can be overwhelming, but Tapper includes many reference points and plenty of backstory to ground yourself in & keep you from getting too lost in Afghanistan village names or military lingo.Still, the immensity isn't just related to the terminology, it's in tandem to the war itself. I had this looming feeling of dread any time a new person was introduced and their life's story was provided. Too many times someone appeared, only to be seriously injured, nearly killed or actually die. Advancements were made in working with local leaders, followed by them being completely undermined chapters later. The state of the war in Afghanistan was such that there felt like no progress was being made, but the only way to guarantee a total collapse of the country was to pull out all forces. The difference between the resources and attention allocated to the two countries is best described by this saying from American troops: ""If you're in Iraq and need something, you ask for it. If you're in Afghanistan and you need something, you learn how to do without it.”I will warn anyone that wants to dive into this book that it's not something you can passively read; it needs your full attention or you'll quickly become lost. Also prepare to become incredibly frustrated. Though it's fairly localized, the struggles of those depicted in this book are indicative of the larger issues of the war in Afghanistan. It's insightful, devastating, aggravating and extremely thorough. Journalism like this is what we need now more than ever--a critical eye with an open mind and an empathetic heart.For those who read this after the movie comes out in 2019, from what I understand, the majority of the plot and characters in it are present only in the third/final part of the book. Orlando Bloom's character, 1LT Ben Keating, is in the first part and Milo Gibson's, CPT Robert Yllescas, is in the second. Scott Eastwood, Caleb Landry Jones & James Jagger are present for the final firefight as SSG Clint Romesha, SPC Ty Carter & PFC Chris Jones. Since there's no overlap of the time when Keating and Yllescas are at the camp with the members of the 3-61 Cav, I'm curious how they'll be incorporated into the movie. Some of the veterans of this outpost and battle along with Tapper were consulted on it, so I'm sure it'll be faithful to actual events.

I was totally onboard during the middle of the novel, but after a slow start and a weirdly neat, but somehow still incomplete ending, I still feel somewhat unsatisfied.Amy Lee's older sister, Sylvie, is accomplished, brilliant & stunning, but is still struggling personally and professionally. I totally get that, and I think a lot of people can identify with both sisters feeling like they're treading water. The story focuses on two parts of an extended Chinese family, one living in the US and one in the Netherlands. There's flashbacks and perspectives from multiple generations, and some interestingly translated phrases (in English). I liked seeing a part of Europe I haven't really read much about, and I appreciate that Jean Kwok didn't shy away from the way minorities are treated in both the US & Europe. From the country that brought you Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), it's crazy that some of the most 'progressive' countries in the world could be in such denial about their own racism and prejudices.That said, I don't know why I felt so detached reading a lot of it. I think it might have been that I only really related to the Lee sisters. The other characters seemed almost like stereotypes of Dutch and Chinese people, which is weird because the author was born in Hong Kong, grew up in the US and currently lives in the Netherlands. The Nordic people were all distant and cold, the Chinese were extremely traditional and secretive. Sylvie and Amy, both American, were drowning in student loan debt and searching for their 'purpose'--which actually is completely spot on. 😔He first half reads like Where'd You Go, Bernadette, but less whimsy & more weight. (view spoiler)[The second half has a lot of parallels with Everything I Never Told You: drowning, sister searching for sister, parental/marital strife, secret gay crush...actually there's even more than I thought. But the ending doesn't carry the emotional weight that Celeste Ng provides in her books. The suicide doesn't really make a lot of sense, even in something as nonsensical as suicide. Also, the abusive and predatory husband/workplace are just....never addressed? And after decades of resentment in the family, everything is worked out in one conversation? They're all good now? It just felt flimsy, which is a bummer because I was starting to get into the Whodunnit of it all.

I saw it described as a thriller, romance, crime, coming of age story, and it's not really any of those things on the whole. There's elements of all of those and more, but I hesitate to put any single label on it.Some parts are a real slow burn and others are incredibly fast-paced. The first three-quarters seemed to be all preamble and a set-up for the last quarter; I wish it was a little more consistent throughout. Truthfully I was completely lost at times, not debilitatingly so, but in a way that had me counting pages remaining in the chapter. Additionally there's both fantastical and touchingly beautiful portions fragmented throughout. I'd press anyone who's read it to say they weren't moved during the reflections on trauma and the failure of adults responding to it in children. It's not difficult to discern what's taken directly from Trent Dalton's life and what's fiction. The author is similar to Eli Bell in this way: he's a ""'colour writer'...'You like all the little details...You paint pretty pictures.'"" I felt like Dalton was constantly adjusting our view from trees to forest, back and forth again and again. The book is about tiny details shaping a boy's life. The book is about the entirety of the universe doing so. The book is about people. The book is about grand ideas. I have no idea what this book was about.I found a lot of scenes playing out in August and Eli's lives familiar to the world we're currently in, but also in stark contrast that feels like it's from a far-off era. There's something surreal about reading material set in the recent past. People live in the suburbs, but women can't open their own bank accounts. Everyone watches tv and drives cars, but you can be openly discriminated against for being a minority. This isn't a land of corsets or flappers in speakeasies, it's the period my parents grew up in, the 60s, 70s & 80s. Some of the typical experiences of people during those decades seem obscene to hear about now.This is the type of novel I think I would revisit at some point in the future. Things I've missed out on the first time around may appear pronounced later on. If HBO is on the look-out for something else to adapt after Big Little Lies & Sharp Objects, I think it would be an excellent candidate.*Thanks to HarperCollins & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 07, 2019","Apr 15, 2019","Mar 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40696776-boy-swallows-universe

She's so different from the hundreds of others. None of them were quite like her. I just hate when books do this. A woman isn't interesting only at the expense of other women. I just think their romance is completely ridiculous. She's supposedly furious for being kidnapped but has butterflies for him within 24 hours of her snatching. She just gives in too easily. He's also one of the least charming princes I've encountered in YA fantasy. Like, come on, it should not be that hard to resist him.At one point he says ""There is no greater crime than rape.""

After finishing I'm left not empty or ravenous, but satisfied with that conclusion of the first in a trilogy. Yes, the door is left open for more story, but it's set to the side, nearly out of sight. While some series rely on dangling a precarious cliff-hanger in front of greedy readers, Katherine Arden's characters, descriptions and story-telling will keep us involved until the bitter end.And yes, I expect the ending to be bitter. It's a harsh world, fourteenth century Russia. I'm surprised I was able to find a precise time period (around the mid 1350's) to place these events in. The princes of Moscow, though, were real people who lived during that era. I obviously didn't find anything about Vasya, since the princesses barely had their first names mentioned on Wikipedia. Even girls born into influential families were barely a footnote of history, as seems to always be the case.Perhaps that's part of what makes Vasya such an enthralling heroine. She exists believably within her own historical confines while occasionally moving outside the lines of what was expected of women and girls. Every injustice just solidifies her resolve and makes you that much more invested in her endeavors. Maybe just as much as it was a darker fairy tale, The Bear and the Nightingale is a stiff rebuke of religious fanaticism and the rectitude of 'divine' rulers. The weaponization of vulnerable persons fears in order to serve a hidden agenda seems to be a thread that runs throughout both literature and history. How easy it is for one charismatic individual to turn an entire local population into frenzied, craven monsters, scarier than even those they initially feared.I can't wait to delve further into this world and see what else Arden has to offer....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Mar 30, 2019",Apr 2019,"Feb 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25489134-the-bear-and-the-nightingale

I was totally caught off guard when I found out it was the same person! Though it feels like every celebrity has 'written' a book of some kind, usually nonfiction about their own lives, I did not expect him to be a fiction writer as well. Celebrity authors garner a lot of attention, and it feels like their efforts don't usually work out as often as they do, but I was pleasantly surprised with Mr. Norton's sophomore novel.Told as flashbacks between mother and daughter, we follow Elizabeth in present day as she returns to the place she was born for answers about her origins. Patricia, her mother, has died and Elizabeth's responsible for her home and apparently appeasing her terrible family. Intercutting the issues she has with them, her son and ex-husband, we're given background on Patricia and what happened to her around the time Elizabeth was born. While not action-packed, the story is creeping and tense. Every answer found raises new questions as you work your way through the mystery of it all.I really liked it, and I'll be sure to check out Graham Norton's other novel.

Buuuut this one had a shorter wait time than Crown of Midnight, so I shuffled the batting order a bit. Looking at all 5 stories individually I can see what each one was meant to accomplish. Pirate Lord sets up the conflict for the other 4 novellas as well as give insight into the relationship between Celaena and Sam, who was mentioned in the first novel. I peaked enough ahead to see that Healer was meant to give background on a character that will show up in later sequels. Desert also introduces a future character as well as provides some world building.Underworld is like the running start before the vault, Empire, where we stick the landing, perfectly positioned to lead directly into the events of ToG.But taking a step back and looking at them as a whole, I think Maas gives us just as much character development for Celaena as any world-building she does here. I'm not sure if I just brushed over some of her flaws while reading the first one or if it was more evident here, but maaaan is she stuck-up and selfish. I guess I could chalk some of it up to teenage arrogance, but sometimes she was just really insufferable. And we really get beat over the head with how *~*pReTtY~*~ she is at nearly every opportunity. I just didn't notice she was so vain and materialistic in the original book. Perhaps these events humbled her some? Based off of the ending of the final novella, I can see where she got some of that attitude from. The naïveté I complained about in the first book was also on full display here, but I understand that she hasn't had time to shed that yet.I also kept getting MAJOR Iron Fist vibes every time she mentioned she was Adarlan's Assassin™. Which was approximately every other page. Seriously, it was like I am Celaena Sardothien, the Immortal Adaralan's Assassin, protector of Rifthold, sworn enemy of the King.I wish that these stories were spread over a longer period of time.

This is I think the point that many older generations either don't grasp or don't want to accept. Now after letting gun legislation all but disappear, an entire generation has risen up to demand action from our country that has denied its own complicity in the death of its children.Last year, when the March For Our Lives was taking place across the nation, I watched with foggy eyes as student after student gave speech after speech on behalf of gun safety and as a call against violence. I wasn't at the march, in D.C. or more locally in Chicago, but I was in audience of both. They streamed through Twitter on my computer, from the comfort of my bed. I cried then. And I cried reading this book.This is a brilliant piece of journalism, a personal profile on several March members and a call to action for those reading it. According to Cullen, the adults in the book expressed trouble balancing the young teenaged survivors: how do you give them the deference of adults while protecting them as children? By listening and paying attention.MFOL and the Parkland kids didn't fix everything. We're just starting to take a second look at gun legislation, but their actions have had a crucial impact.

A murder mystery set in 1887 and starring a female lepidopterist with a modern outlook, Veronica Speedwell can be quite charming when she wants to be.

Sometimes it seemed like Stoker only said things to set up a 'smart' retort from Veronica. Honestly, she's also really mean to him at times and I think we're meant to cheer her on for it? I'm not sure. And this is totally not important, but it also got stuck in my head....HOW did Veronica's flask have that much liquor in it?? Like, they're constantly taking pulls from this thing and getting wasted, but it doesn't run out until near the end! Is there some magical South American juju at work that made it actually bottomless?! I have seen no flask that could hold the amount the two of them drank.

I'm hoping after all the character introductions and background information is established there will be more room for other storylines.

I'd never heard of Elly Griffiths before receiving this book in the mail, but it ended up being so much more than your typical boilerplate thriller. Set at a British secondary school, many of the adult characters are members of the English department, so there's several literary references sprinkled throughout. The apparent murder of a faculty member is intercut with passages from a short story, The Stranger, who's author had resided at the school, shrouded in intrigue many years prior. The Victorian gothic style of the story mirrors the events of the novel and does an excellent job of keeping the hair on your arms raised in tension.Told from the perspectives of Clare, Ella's colleague/friend; Georgia, Clare's daughter; and Harbinder, one of the investigators into Ella's death, Griffiths is skilled at switching between three distinct voices. The danger of obsession is played with and throws suspicion onto several possible suspects. Even though every person who becomes obsessed isn't a killer, the threat and excuses we use to dismiss these tendencies are contrasted with the eventual worst-case scenario. There's a lot of story worked into this mystery. I was jumping from conclusion to conclusion before the guilty party was revealed.

I had never heard of Paul Le Roux before jumping into this book, but it turned out to be astounding and at times riveting, bordering on the fantastical. If I wasn't told it was true crime beforehand I would have agreed with Preet Bharara that parts ""were ripped from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel"".The events depicted initially jumped between the early/mid-2000s, when the first crimes were taking place, and a decade after that, when Evan Ratliff embarked on his own investigation. Eventually the years in between are filled in by investigators, law enforcement and a surprising number of people who previously worked for Le Roux. That ended up being one of the most insane parts to me, that the author was able to coax so many former associates (some still avoiding capture by American authorities!) into giving interviews and admitting to being a part of many extremely serious international crimes.The book is divided into three parts and then into chapters depicting different sides of the investigation and entire criminal enterprise at various stages. My favorites were 'The Reporter' and 'The Investigators' chapters. Ratliff is a skilled journalist and his ability to relay his first-hand accounts of the places and people he visited were extremely engaging. The ones with the cooler sounding titles--'The Mercenaries', 'The Mastermind'--were interesting, but at times struggled to keep my attention. When this shady underworld starts unraveling, the pace picks up as those involved start collapsing under the pressure.The unexpected antagonists of the ordeal seemed to be the arresting agency and prosecutors involved. Specifically, the SOD and Linda Marks, who both dropped the ball in big ways, and failed to live up to the work that Kimberly Brill and Kent Bailey put into the pursuit of Paul Le Roux and his organization. The inability to coordinate with both internal and international law enforcement were a huge weak spot that an alleged 'criminal Mastermind' could easily exploit.

I think Young was trying to incorporate his main subjects' full testimony of the conditions in Colombia and perhaps didn't feel right about removing these portions.One thing I appreciated was that the author didn't skim over the women and girls who were caught up in the fighting as well. It might have been easy for a protagonist who's young & male to brush off what happens to his female comrades, but he confronts the sexual exploitation and straight-up assault by commanders and other enlistees towards those in their own ranks. And though not as often, the racism in the country is pointed out by way of Pedro's best friend, Palillo. The ending was as much of a resolution as you could hope for in a no-win situation like this. For anyone who wishes to gain some insight into the other side of the 'War On Drugs', I strongly recommend Colombiano.

I’ve seen him on a couple of media outlets, and it’s clear he’s a smart guy. I also have come to agree with a lot of the stuff he says about economic inequality and how those in power across the political spectrum work to keep the status quo. But this book was still difficult for me to get through, despite clocking in at under 300 pages.I’ll admit I find it harder to read nonfiction that doesn’t have a narrative element running through it. Something like Catch and Kill or nearly any memoir is so much easier for me to get sucked into. The problem with Winners Take All for me was that the gist of his argument was made in the introductory chapter. The following chapters were just collections of examples of what he already said. Like, here’s a woman who wanted to save the world but then got sucked into the capitalism machine, here’s a man that believes he’s helping other people but it really helping himself, etc. It got repetitive pretty quickly. But the topic Giridharadas chose to write about really resonates with me and a lot of people in my generation. He puts into words what many of us feel, even if we haven’t identified it yet. It’s a feeling of unfairness and that the deck’s already stacked against us. That most of the people who purport to be helping are just preforming altruism instead of doing something meaningful. We were told that the best way to change the system is to work from within it, but it’s becoming more and more clear that by working for those institutions we’re just continuing to prop up the powerful.Really, I think I would have loved this as an essay. He could have used these personal examples more concisely to make his points. I know I’m part of the target audience for this work. I’m young(ish), my disillusionment with the state of the country is growing, I’m receptive to these ideas, even if I haven’t fully embraced them yet, and I’ve been fooled in the past by the very tactics that these ‘socially-conscious’ companies have deployed in the book. But still I struggled here. I’ll probably go watch some of his other interviews to build on these ideas more, but as for the book itself, I don't think it was my ideal medium.

Ones that don’t feature the heroes we’re accustomed to focusing on, but the people who occupy the margins, the forgotten. Women have traditionally been relegated to these positions, their accomplishments flattened and swept away. So many of these narratives have been formative in our culture, to a point where we may not even be able to recognize them as anything but expected. It’s important when considering the source material, though, that we don’t take those surviving versions as the ‘original’ ones. It’s simply the one that had been written down and altered along the way, to fit within the storyteller’s own perspectives and worldview.The story of Penelope is not the story of Odysseus. It never really was. If you’re examining texts from thousands of years ago, there’s plenty to find objectionable. In The Penelopiad, Margaret Atwood strikes a smart balance between historical context and modern morality. She doesn’t pontificate for the reader, pointing out how slavery is wrong or forced marriages are detrimental; this much is implied. But she lets us consider a person’s legacy, what is remembered and what is forgotten. Is there an amount of good deeds that can expunge the bad ones? This is applied to all characters, not just the highborn men. Penelope has the luxury of looking back on her own reputation and image long after her death in order to teach something to the reader. What you take away from this tale may be indicative.Though women such as Penelope and her mostly nameless maids are able to express themselves as three-dimensional characters, this is not the case for all women present. Helen is spoken of with disdain for being “puffed up with vanity” and “ambitious”. The men are allowed to trot their accomplishments out, even expected to, but because Helen is beautiful and smart, she must also be calculating and vindictive. For the all of the humanization Atwood grants Penelope, I wish she would extend the same courtesy to Helen. Even if Helen was as callous as she’s made out to be, with “selfishness and her deranged lust”, how is it she who shoulders the blame? What about the men who commodify women to the extent that they only can see themselves as an object to be valued or discarded based on how much those same men want to fuck them? For all the retellings of the The Odyssey, are there any who take up Helen’s cause? If you find one, let me know, because I haven’t stumbled upon it. While Madeline Miller’s The Song of Achilles allows Briseis some agency during the Trojan War, and Penelope gets to narrate her own life in The Penelopiad, there’s little sympathy for her older cousin. Perhaps she’s hard to empathize with, seen as too privileged to have any real problems. Or maybe it feels like we’ve already heard her story through the Odyssey—the face that launched a thousand ships, and all that. But is that actually her story, or is she simply a convenient pawn in the service of the egos of men? There’s nothing like blaming a generational war on a young woman for simply *checks notes* existing while pretty. I enjoyed this book on the whole. The interludes with the maidens made it almost seem like a play. I think those chapters would extend really well to the stage. Atwood writes along familiar plot lines in a more modern and less epic fashion than The Odyssey, but still in a way that doesn’t become too dated over time.

I love a good unreliable narrator, and this book had plenty of those. If I was ever worried that a courtroom drama wouldn't have enough action in it, that fear was quashed in the very first chapter.The Incident, as it's called, is a truly brutal event. It's painstakingly told from numerous points of view and may cause the reader to physically cringe, but it's the center of a complicated blame-game where almost everyone is either holding back or outright lying. These exclusions lead to even more tragedy and conflict, where by the end multiple parties share varying amounts of culpability.We also get a raw and vulnerable look at what it's like to care for a special needs child day-to-day. Even as the characters make mistakes in their parenting, you can't help but feel a great amount of empathy for them. And as much as anything else, this is a story about one family's immigration. Their complicated dynamic after uprooting themselves and having to readjust to a completely new set of social and cultural rules...I can hardly fathom going through something so difficult.Angie Kim really did an exceptional job covering so many distinct perspectives and story lines at once.

The just pure scale of his last book, Dark Matter, and now Recursion, are daunting to consider, let alone be the one to map out and write. At just past the midpoint of each of his books I have stopped, took a breather and had the same thought: ""How the fuck is he going to get himself out of this one?""But he always does, or his characters do. If I was responsible for writing the conclusions for his books I would have probably ended them with 'and then everyone died and everything was terrible byeeeee.' During his latest AMA, Crouch disclosed he was passing off a lot of the creative input for Recursion's upcoming Shonda Rhimes adaptation on Netflix because the book had ""kicked [his] ass"". I can only imagine. Reading the book kicked my ass, but in the best way.What starts as a story about memory quickly evolves into something else entirely. It's a commentary on technology and man's future. It's a story about regrets. It's dense, but digestible. That's one of my favorite things about Crouch as a writer, there's so much actual science built into the foundation of his science-fiction, but you don't have to have much of a grasp on those concepts before diving into the narrative. I never felt like I was missing something important, despite getting a C in high school physics. He writes approachable sci-fi that doesn't skimp on story.This is one of those books that will follow you around. I'm immensely excited to see the adaptation, but I love that we get the opportunity to read it first.

It starts like a lot of her books do: a woman living and minding her own business until BAM a psychotic monster comes barreling into her life and kidnaps (murders/rapes/etc) her. And like a lot of Slaughter’s Grant County or Trent series, poor Sara Linton and Will are just always caught in the middle of the action. I mean, I know they both have baggage, but how have they gone through 7 books together, hostage situations, several totaled BMWs, 3 dogs, a dangerous ex-girlfriend—buuuut he still hasn’t moved in with her?? Communication needs to happen all the time, not just during life and death situations.Anyways, when the “anti-government” assailants were first being introduced, I thought Slaughter was going to just dance around the fact they’re violent nationalists, white supremacists, right-wing extremists, fucking NAZIS, or all of the above. But I was totally off base, and she really didn’t pull any punches, as per usual. There’s so much background information that we’re given, by way of Faith Mitchell as an audience surrogate primarily. We’re walked through exactly what these organizations are, who they are, why they are growing, what the government’s [sometimes lack of] response is and more. The most important piece, both to the storyline and in the real-life mirrors of it, are specifically who is being targeted for recruitment. Military, police, angry young white men. Nothing is left out for the sake of the reader’s comfort level with it . And my god, the story is gripping. The point of view bounces between Will, Faith and Sara, which is good because during most of the events they’re separated from each other. The initial action sequence, though, does have some overlap and I found the rehashing of what just happened kind of tedious. Even with the three perspectives, it was still hard to guess what would happen next. I found it extremely difficult to tear myself away from the book up until literally the last page. There’s so much covered that I am actually in awe of Slaughter’s research and sources for this one story. The ending is high energy, and isn’t really resolved until the end of the last chapter. Even so, I’m sure the ramifications of everything that happened will be echoing into the following installment(s).The radicalized men, weaponization of religion, cult mindset and all the big points of conflict are handled really well. The author understands the scope of these issues. What I’m still bothered by is the smaller, interpersonal conflicts, primarily between the women. Faith will not stop negging herself and comparing her body to other women’s. On one page she shoots down a guy interested in her, but then on the very next page speculates about giving him a blow job. Sara brings up Angie in her internal monologue so many times, and basically creates a pro/con chart of their respective body parts all while being held hostage. Angie isn’t even in the freaking book, Sara. They’re portrayed as these smart, kick-ass, self-assured women only until there’s a ‘threatening’ woman or potential love interest in the room and it just kills me every time. Like wtf is this:“Objectively, Sara could say that she had better breasts than Angie, but that was like saying that two Hershey’s Kisses looked better on an ironing board.”The other issue I was conflicted about was the way we’re meant to interpret Gwen. She’s an adult woman who has been abused since childhood, was used as a walking womb for her entire adulthood, and then eventually ends up being more than complicit in multiple murders, including her own children. Sara describes her as “worse than an abuser”, and I struggle with that. It feels like as a society, especially women, are harder on the women who know about abuse and do nothing than the men who perpetrate it. I think of it as a Serena Joy complex. Slaughter is aware of it too, because she points it out in the Epilogue when newscasters are blaming Michelle for her role in the massacre whilst be tortured. I think Gwen is responsible for her own choices, but why is she more culpable than the men who are making most of the decisions in the first place?

So many people adored it that I ended up putting it off for a bit until I could devote my undivided attention to it.In many ways Daisy Jones & The Six is straightforward plot-wise. Before starting you can surmise that it's going to be a book about a band falling apart. So around halfway through I was afraid I wasn't going to love it the way others have and thought maybe it was too predictable. This was one of those times I'm glad I was very wrong. I knew I was invested in the characters when I started having mini-arguments in my head about which of them was right and wrong in a scene. Yes, the band breaks up, but there's so much else going on that it feels like a secondary concern. Some of the revelations are just so well executed that I had to put the book down for a moment to absorb them. The interviews are quite different from what I'm used to in a novel, but I really enjoyed the structure. Taylor Jenkins Reid able to handle difficult topics with just the right amount of sensitivity and honesty. The characters revealed things about themselves that I don't think would have come across as well in a traditional third or first person perspective. You can tell so much about people by the way they tell the same story. The style makes me want to check out the audiobook after I finish with the print copy. I think I might wait a bit before returning to Daisy Jones, but I will definitely be back. (Additionally, I love that Jenkins Reid was inspired in part by Fleetwood Mac.

Because the plot is focused around 'forged' objects, there's a lot of detail put into their descriptions. Sometimes the objects act as a work-around if the story needs some way to secretly record conversations or replace other tools of modern convenience. The characters are also given complicated back stories that are all very tragic, but somehow still a bit thin? Tristan and Severin's, especially, is bizarre and never quite explained enough for me. But on the characters...there's parts I liked. Zofia's place on the spectrum is never directly named, but it's portrayed pretty well. Hypnos and Enrique's mixed-race ancestry in industrial France is a nice break from the presumed homogenous population. Laila's origins and abilities are really interesting and original to me. You could tell right away there was something up with Tristian, though, since he's the only one of the core five without a POV chapter--even Hypnos has one at the end. But, ugh, Severin. He's the worst. I couldn't stand him. He's arrogant, entitled, controlling and grating. The way he orders around his friends, whom he considers family, talks down to Tristan and Hypnos, smashes things Enrique cares about (??) and acts possessive of Laila just made me root against him even though he's supposed to be the main protagonist. He also is the worst offender of the other two major problems I had with the characters: obnoxious amounts of sarcasm and forcing a romance on characters just for the sake of it. Also nOT TELLING ANYONE ELSE YOUR PLANS WHY DOES EVERYONE DO THIS IN BOOKS?!?!And apparently out of a group of people with Poirot-on-steroids levels of deduction, he's also the one who gets to smirk and smugly say the answer to a puzzle before everyone else. Can you tell he bothers me??? But I refuse to let him ruin the good parts! The concept of forging and artifacts from lost cultures with hidden capabilities is a really cool one. The author also acknowledges the part colonialism played in acquiring them, as well as oppression and theft of culture. I feel like those interested in science and history will like this book. I thought the golden ratio and Fermat/hexagons were worked into the storyline in a really clever way. Some of the expressions and language clearly aren't era-specific, but since it's fantasy I'll give it a pass on that. I read this as a stand alone, but since it seems set up for a sequel, who knows? If there's a follow-up I'll read that one as well and see if it changes any of my critiques. Probably won't make me like Severin any more, though....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 27, 2019","Mar 05, 2019","Jan 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39863498-the-gilded-wolves

There's 4 nerdy guys and a girl who are all friends, with a Big Bang Theory type of dynamic (but without the overt sexism). Each has their own distinct personality trait(s) and feel somewhat one-dimensional. There's also some online communication that feels very reminiscent of You've Got Mail.

There is a bit of exposition in the first few chapters to get you up to speed, but it's somewhat abrupt and there's a lot of plot holdover that you're expected to swallow if you're just jumping in. In hindsight I would have started at book 1, but it didn't make the experience impossible to deal with.More than just past events, there's established character relationships that, for me, didn't really come together. Luc and Ava's relationship makes zero sense to me. She's his boss, but he is incredibly condescending, controlling and at times creepy to her. Some of their interactions are too inappropriate to be believable for even a workplace romance, so as a reader to be asked to believe they're not romantically involved, but just have a really close friendship, is too much. Maybe they earned this in the previous books, but there was no payoff with them as a standalone.Luc isn't the only one who is weirdly territorial about his boss. Apparently another officer and a witness just can't help themselves and immediately have to try to disrupt a working relationship with her and act on their attraction to her. Between the two cops white-knighting for her favor and the doctor hitting on her mid-interview...there's a lot of below the surface misogyny to take in. And Ava chides herself for ""giving off signals"" to these men--No girl! Don't say that!As for the murders and premise itself, I thought it was a really interesting idea. A killer targeting people who had failed suicide attempts like a bitter grim reaper--very intriguing! I liked how there were entire chapters devoted to going into the mindset of the suicidal victims before they died. You really get to see them as people instead of as just bodies waiting to be discovered. And the psychological unravel of the killer is somethingI definitely didn't see coming. I liked it on the whole, but the investigative angle more so than the interpersonal conflict.*Thanks to Avon Books U.K. & Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 02, 2019","Jan 05, 2019","Jan 05, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/43294090-perfect-crime

Also fair warning: this book is fairly gruesome, so watch out if you have a weak stomach! (view spoiler)[I felt like the author gave away the 'mystery' fairly early. You can tell multiple people are involved just by the fact that you're told who the baddie is right off the bat. And oof was Ashley a hot mess of a character. He's a perfect liar, sociopath, but loves his brother and also kind of loves Darby? Seriously? What was ""You could have been my girlfriend, Darby!"" supposed to accomplish? It feels like the trope where an author has to make sure the audience knows the young, female protagonist is desirable. It just felt like too much. And the Darby as the Hero theme was also laid on waaaay too thickly. I mean, she kind of abandoned the kid in a cold car for hours. Since the net result was nearly everyone dying, would it have been worse than her just telling the room all at once initially? And so many of her interactions with Ashley were bizarre. I don't think a sudden burst of adrenaline would help if you're being suffocated like she was in the bathroom. The story would have benefited if the multiple perspectives were dialed down a bit.

Book binding as a way to alter/remove someone's memories is so bizarrely wonderful that only someone submerged in books and familiar with the publishing process would come up with it. I loved the way Collins went beyond the obvious results of this technique's existence to include its commodification, manipulation and the really seedy underbelly of it all. The preface at the beginning by the author explains that she got into book binding and the idea for this story grew from that, and her expertise in the subject matter really shows.It started off a little strangely for me, I'll admit. I found Emmett Farmer's family unnaturally cruel. Cruelty is a theme for a good number of characters introduced later on as well. Some of the allusions to the mystery surrounding his circumstances felt a bit heavy-handed, but it makes more sense later on. Both the reader and the narrator are kept in the dark until the second part of the book. Part III is told from another character's point of view, but is a case of dramatic irony--where the audience knows something the character doesn't. It makes some of the events that happen to or around him even more gut-wrenching.Part II is a departure from the first and third, jumping back to the events predating those we'd been following. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that it reads somewhat like its own story within the story, which fits nicely with the themes of the book. There's no real fantasy or magic in Part II, but there's family discord, betrayal and a love story. As a person who frequently eye-rolls at romance plots, I have to say this one is really well-earned. And it's crucial to the plot, so the extended detour from the other storyline isn't for nothing.Since book binding isn't actually some sort of dark magic (no matter how much I would like it to be), it might be hard to really understand what the characters stand to lose when agreeing to be bound. The part that disturbed me was the lack of ownership over your own memories and life when completely at the mercy of a binder. What of ourselves do we have the right to? If not memories, then what about our life stories? Our images and data? Our DNA? I think there's more modern and practical applications to this idea than one world originally believe.I think of Henrietta Lacks who had her cells used without her knowledge by pharmaceutical companies for major profit and progress. Or Prince who didn't want to be turned into a hologram...then was at the Super Bowl. Facebook collecting user data and selling it. Adaptions and biopics that don't stay true to their subjects. 23&me holding our DNA and family history for their own purposes. There's seemingly no end to the comparisons.Real-life scaries aside, this was a lovely book that surpassed my expectations. I'll be think for a while, and what else can you really want from a good story?On the cover:This is one of the nicest ARCs I've received; it doesn't look like a proof, it looks like an upscale trade paperback. You can tell that the author and publisher put a lot of care and love into the production. I was curious to see what the finished copy would look like, so I checked its hashtag on Instagram. And oh my God--they're BEAUTIFUL. I think there's a few different editions floating around, but they all have the same ornate gilded lettering and overall design both on the dust-jacket AND on the actual hard cover. 10/10 A++ love it!!*Thank you to William Morrow & Goodreads for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Feb 13, 2019","Mar 08, 2019","Jan 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40779786-the-binding

There was a murder mystery wraAfter getting a sneak-peak at the first 5 chapters a few months ago, I was really excited to see how this one unfolded. There was a murder mystery wrapped up in a magical matriarchy--sounds great to me!I think my first issue was with Keralie, the master thief & heroine that gets roped into the royal drama. She is unnaturally flippant about everything and it started to grate on me. She's always smirking and rattling off 'clever' one-liners in a way that I found really annoying. Any point where we're supposed to empathize with her struggles or trauma is immediately undercut by her own attitude. I just don't care for this type of character. I don't think it adds anything of value and it just feels like the author trying to drive home how 'cool' or 'relatable' we're supposed to find her. It happens with male characters too, and I hate it in them as well.The other thing that I didn't care for was what I've come to refer to as The Vibranium Solution. I see it more in pseudo-scientific fantasy stories like this one. Like how in Black Panther Vibranium is used to MacGyver new inconceivable technology with no real coherent explanation, the kingdom of Eonia has nearly magical capabilities, but is explained away as ""science"", while their neighboring kingdoms are still using horses as their main mode of transportation. I think when authors try to retain both old societal and cultural structures that don't really exist anymore, while also taking advantage of new science-fiction possibilities (with a sprinkle of magic), there's a high chance of this occurring. (view spoiler)[The example that most bothered me was when a technology that records memories can suddenly, seemingly for plot reasons, record someone's intentions and plans in vivid imagery as well. This is totally possible, but nobody had ever considered doing it before. And then later it can control your mind for similar ~*pLoT*~ reasons. I don't have a problem buying into new worlds and realities, but I hate when the rules change mid-play. It feels lazy. (hide spoiler)]The murder mystery portion, though, thought was compelling enough. I went into Part 4 (of 4) with vague suspicions, but no real idea who it was. I was wrong in about every possible way, but the ending was so out of left field that I don't know who could have accurately come up with it. I didn't love the conclusion of it all to be honest. It's not bad, it's just kind of weird and nonsensical.It was fine.

The cover was so striking and cool that I was surprised to find out he's an established author of thriller/suspense books. Maybe I'm generalizing too much, but there's a certain 'look' to a lot of the thriller/mystery/suspense genre books that I see perched at the front of bookstores and plastered all over New Releases banners online. The graphic orange & black spiral seemed more artistic than the typical picture of a girl with half her face/body obscured in an ominous fashion that I'm used to. Not to trample all over the cliches about covers, but I just really liked this one for some reason. ANYWAYS--I found this to be a really engaging book. You can tell Coben is a pro; it's one of the best paced suspense books I've read in a while. There's a subtle, but steady urgency throughout that keeps you reading, but you can still take breaks as you need them, then pick back up without preamble. Another thing I appreciated was the lack of gratuitous violence, especially against women. The story may kick off with a missing girl, but the mystery evolves into much more than that. I love Karin Slaughter's books, but my god are they brutal. I always feel like I have to be careful recommending books like hers because of what they could trigger in people. Coben also does an excellent job at juggling a bunch of different plot points while keeping up with some topical issues. It's a fully fleshed out story that doesn't feel overcrowded.I will say that after reading posts in r/menwritingwomen, I've found it easier see passages or phrasing that men are more likely to use. Elena repeatedly describing herself as ""chubby"", ""round middle-aged"", ""pudgy"", ""squat"", etc. is just so unnecessary. Will male brains just EXPLODE if it isn't mentioned how attractive or unattractive a woman is every 30 pages or something? Women aren't constantly contemplating their own fuckability; society does that enough for them. Plus, Elena is a badass ex-fed PI who's entire romantic history is just sprawled out for seemingly no real purpose besides making her...what, tragic?

We're introduced to him as a child who appears to be more certain of who he is than most adults I've met. As Rush recounts his childhood into adolescence and then young adulthood, the environment around him, people he encounters, the era he lives in, all attempt to forge him into a different person. His resilience is just amazing to me. After living what feels like several lifetimes worth in a decade, I'm left completely in awe.The highs and lows reading of this memoir mimic the drug-fueled jaunts of the author. He delivers his testaments with a measured amount of nonchalance, as if they were typical childhood milestones. Though he recalls layered enthusiasm for these substances at the time, with the benefit of hindsight we get to really see the absurdity of the predicaments he found himself in due to drug use. It's euphoric, but devastating. And with a lot of stories of people with fucked up childhoods, there's the adults that failed them. Usually repeatedly, immensely and often. Even though he was able to thrive well enough to write a book in the end, it was not an easy or necessary journey. Honestly, I don't know how he survived. And many in similar positions don't. It feels unfair and despite getting many good stories out of it, it's a gut-punch to think about. One of the most astounding things is that Rush doesn't seem angry much at all, at any point. Maybe he's worked through these feelings or he just doesn't have the rage that others might. I don't think I'd have the same temperament if I had undergone a fraction of what he did.I loved this memoir.

The characters were formidable, but flawed, so nobody was over-powered or cartoonishly sinister. The land of Elfhame as well as the Faerie Court and people that make it up, are lavish and enchanting. The dark undercurrent of their lives of leisure and magic help emphasize that all the splendor laid before us only comes at a significant cost.As much as there's a focus on the mystical and fantastical throughout, I also really enjoyed the complex relationships the characters had with each other. The three Duarte sisters, who had all gone through the same traumatic event, couldn't have been more different from one another. The testing of family bonds between them and their adopted father and brother vs the dynamic between the royal children were interesting to compare. What makes someone a parent? A sibling? Is it blood or does that have anything to do with it? And stemming from these questions is the over-arching one: is who you are as a person pre-determined or is it a result of the environment you were exposed to? Nature vs nurture. At least so far, we haven't been given an answer.I wasn't expecting a YA fantasy novel to be so philosophical, but maybe I'm not giving either genre enough credit. I can't wait to see how these questions are expanded on in the two additional books in the series, as well as the novella that supposedly follows this one in succession (if I can get my library to acquire it!) Though not quite a cliffhanger, the challenge presented by the King at the end is the perfect one to propel us forward into The Wicked King.Now that you got what you wanted, what are you going to do with it?

I really enjoyed how Frances was able to use my own bias as a reader against me and flip any preconceived notions I had on their head.In the entertainment industry especially, perception really is reality. If you act like you're succeeding, people are more likely to believe it. And when you're only as good as your last project, the pressure to keep producing drives the characters to continuously raise the stakes until it all comes crashing down.My heart was racing in the last third of this book and didn't let up until the very end.

ThI was sure I would be just be one of many in the chorus of positive s for Margaret Atwood’s record-breaking follow-up to The Handmaid's Tale. The early critic s seemed glowing and widespread, so I was really surprised to see so many Goodreads users who I follow and think highly of not really connect with the story at all. Some of the most liked s of the novel just totally panned it, which happens, but still made me pause and wonder if my interpretation was unrefined in some way.But after finishing The Testaments and mulling it over some, I think I just disagree. One of the biggest complaints about unplanned sequels are that they’re unnecessary, and that’s shown up a lot in the negative reactions. Maybe from a story-telling perspective, The Handmaid’s Tale works best as a stand-alone. That’s not why Atwood wrote it, though. She wrote it as a reaction to the world around her at the time she was experiencing it. There are countless interviews with her where she’s expressed similar notions about our current day ordeals, and that’s what has pushed her towards writing a follow-up. It’s some of the same reasons why a Handmaid’s Tale TV show found such success in the first place. It’s easy to look at this as a cash grab, but they’re both parallel responses to an alarming shift in authoritarian inclinations and populist reactions.One of the criticisms I didn’t really understand was that it’s very “YA”. I mean, there’s two perspectives from people under 25, so I guess that’s technically correct? But this feels like a dig, as if there’s something less respectable about writing for a young adult audience. I just think that’s bullshit. I’ve seen more risk-taking by YA authors than in nearly every other genre. Historically and in modernity, young people are not just joining revolutions, they’re leading them. If some current YA heroines and plot lines feel similar to Atwood’s, could it be that they’ve simply drawn inspiration from her? I like that she’s expanded beyond June’s viewpoint; there’s more than one way to suffer, to resist.Most have at least appreciated Aunt Lydia’s arc here. And maybe that’s because she’s already an established character that we’ve gotten a lot of face-time with, but not a lot of background on. I think it’s a little more than that, though. We haven’t seen much about women that are beyond “child bearing years” in Gilead. Even Serena Joy isn’t more than mid to early 40s in the novel, despite not being able to have children. How did Lydia climb her way to near the top of a hierarchy that has no discernible use for women her age? We’ve seen Aunts and Marthas, but we haven’t seen as them yet. Similarly to how young girls have been paraded around Gilead, but we have no way of knowing what that life is. We don’t know what it’s like as a child to escape an tyrannical regime. These are valuable insights. If The Handmaid’s Tale is a resource for women 25-40 caught in an oppressive society, then The Testaments can provide for women and girls at different stages of their lives.I also appreciate Atwood for not attempting to “subvert our expectations”. She isn’t trying to compete with the TV show, and she’s not pretending it doesn’t exist. That’s a really difficult balancing act, and she pulls it off. She’s able to write without contradicting or accommodating the show’s narrative, and maybe that’s not what everyone wanted. But I think that she’s got the right idea here to be in tandem with its producers. If there’s an idea that they each want to land with readers/viewers, and it’s the same idea, then their respective audiences will have a lot of overlap. In order to pull off some ‘big plot twists’ she’d have to veer off course, and I think that would take away from her overarching message.Maybe The Handmaid’s Tale was enough for you, and that’s fine. But the world is different from how it was, and some of us need more. The first installment gave us a look at how a society can fall and what the ramifications of that look like. What happens, though, when you’re already in the thick of it? How can you stop it; how can you keep it from getting worse? How can you make it better? That’s what’s at stake here and Atwood understands it, even if it isn’t ~*LiTeRaRy~*~ in the way we’ve come to expect. If this book doesn’t do much for you, maybe you’re not the intended audience. For me it was equal parts harrowing, helpful & hopeful, and the necessary companion piece to The Handmaid’s Tale....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Sep 13, 2019","Sep 16, 2019","Nov 28, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42975172-the-testaments

As someone who loves a non-answer in an ending, I've decided it's both.I'm so enamored by this book, I definitely will be checking out others by this author!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 04, 2019","Jan 07, 2019","Nov 23, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40167483-once-upon-a-river

Even though I haven't read The Wife Between Us, I know it was a popular best seller last year, so I tried to approach An Anonymous Girl without any preconceived ideas. Right off the bat I thought the relationship between Jess and Lydia had a lot of potential. It kind of reminded me of the dynamic between Emma Stone's character and the doctors conducting the study from the Netflix show Maniac. The back and forth between the two of them was at times both subtilely and not-so-subtilely manipulative.I think I was expecting another big reveal near the end. It ended up being less sinister than I was anticipating. It was pretty straightforward from about the halfway point on, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. So while I wanted to find out what happens, I wasn't on the edge of my seat. This was a good, solid psychological thriller. It feels like the type of book that will get some sort of big or small screen adaptation within the next five years or so.

It felt like it was going to be a bunch of stereotypical characters doing the same stereotypical things, but I was pleasantly surprised by the way it turned out.The characters on the whole ended up being much more layered than they appeared to be. The story is told in both present day and flashbacks from two different viewpoints: Diana the Mother-in-Law and Lucy her daughter-in-law. Occasionally I got thrown off because there were time jumps in the middle of chapters not made explicitly clear, but it wasn't too bad.I do think the author gave much more attention to fleshing out the female characters than the male ones. At times the men in the story seem like sitcom versions of men, which kept me from really being invested in them.Also, throughout the book I was having trouble deciding if Lucy was supposed to be a parody of a ""woke"" person or actually socially conscious. I only bring this up because of the many times she declares her self a feminist, but then is completely blown away by her husband doing basic household chores or child rearing. Like, yeah, if you're 8 months pregnant and feeling sick your husband should be doing the laundry...and oh my god referring to him as 'menfolk'! Twice!! I feel like if I ever met Lucy she would drive me crazy.Besides that I enjoyed the pacing and the fact that we're kept in suspense until the very last dozen or so pages.

Greek mythology has always had great adventures and characters and monsters, but I never thought I could be invested in one character so much. Circe is so...not exactly relatable, but while she might be living the eternal life of an actual Goddess, she struggles in such a human way that you almost forget she's the daughter of the literal sun.I think some older works, especially ones written in grand epics and dense language, can be challenging to appreciate the story through the writing. The Gods and mortals that appear in Greek mythology are flawed; they can be bitter or lustful or vain or vengeful, among other things. But some are limited to one or two traits and can lose their nuance. Madeline Miller is able to add shading and depth to the outlines of these characters in a really beautiful way. Her writing is gorgeous and rich, completely living up to the legacy of the source material.“You can teach a viper to eat from your hands, but you cannot take away how much it likes to bite.”I also love how this book redefined the hero's journey by taking a female character, who may typically have been merely scenery or 'thing to be conquered', and made her the center of her own adventure. She does come into contact with men on their own quests, but they are never the focus. Instead, they are the supporting aspects to her personal epic.Circe challenges the ‘official’ versions of their tales as well as the presumed ‘heroes’ that star in them. She is constantly questioning the powerful, from mortal men who prey on those presumed inferior, up to the Gods and Titans themselves.Plus, she's a witch. And witches are super cool.

They grow into strong women that return to destroy your world."" - Kyle StephensI couldn't get that quote out of my head while reading Sadie. Kyle Stephens was one of the over 200 young women to give victim impact statements at the trial of Larry Nassar, their former gymnastics trainer, and ultimately, a depraved sexual predator.Sadie is a girl with nothing left to lose. She’s never fully been able to live her life for herself, having had to care for her sister Mattie from a young age. But even when her sister is gone, she still can’t let go of that instinct to protect her. She’s exactly the person you would want on your side, but is also often the type to be taken for granted.The book alternates between Sadie’s perspective and True Crime podcaster West McCray’s attempt to follow the trail she’s left in her wake. There’s an overwhelming sense of helplessness in being a step or two behind Sadie as she barrels head-first into the search for what happened to her sister. The journey that Courtney Summers takes us on is devastating and enthralling. You, like McCray, won’t be able to pull yourself away until you find out what happened to Sadie?Something I noticed about people when they are presented with cases of sexual violence is that it typically prompts one of two reactions: either they are unable to face it or they are unable to look away from it. I don't know which one is worse, but one is clearly more advantageous for predators. Sure, some of us are drawn to ‘SVU-style’ stories and that might say something about our society’s need to witness gratuitous violence, but I do not accept that the opposite impulse is somehow more inherently ‘acceptable’. Ignoring something because it’s unpleasant just gives more opportunities for it to turn into a problem, and leaves the vulnerable members of your community even more so. Sadie is equal parts engrossing and painful. Courtney Summers has written a character that knows what's on the dark underside of the rock, and flips it over anyways. Then she makes us look it in the eye, acknowledge it. If you're searching for comfort or even peace, you won't find it here. But if you want truth, then Sadie has it for you.**I don't know what the different trigger warnings are, and other s have listed them all out for those interested.

Truly, the delivery he gives in the audiobook version is incredibly delightful and I don't think anyone else could have done it justice. I especially liked the recordings of live readings he'd done for certain chapters that intercut the others. I knew the name Sedaris sounded familiar, though, and in Googling him I found out his sister is Amy Sedaris from Second City. She's been on things like The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt or as a guest & friend of Stephen Colbert's show. David uses his family as a major source in his writings, especially his sisters and father. Their dynamics make for one funny story after another, weaved in with some unexpected melancholy.It helps that the Sedaris family seems easy to laugh with, completely aware of their own shortcomings, but totally unbothered by them. Early on David discloses his sister's untimely death, and that colors the rest of the book, even in stories that don't reference her at all. There's a bit of regretful whimsy that he carries with him throughout, and even parts where he's buying pants the price of a car, he remains easy to connect with.I can see why this book was on all the best sellers lists last year, and I'm glad I waited to pick it up, if only because I probably wouldn't have listened to the audio recording otherwise. Humorous enough to laugh out loud a bunch and never too somber to not be lifted up by a well-placed quip, Sedaris just earned himself a new fan....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 08, 2019","Apr 10, 2019","Oct 29, 2018",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/38509071-calypso

There's a bit of cross-overThe Hate U Give is a tough act to follow, especially as a debut, but Angie Thomas really stepped up to meet the challenge. There's a bit of cross-over between some of the issues both Starr and Bri deal with (assuming the worst of black kids, aggressive law enforcement, etc.), but Bri also struggles against poverty, drug dealers, gangs and sexism in hip-hop, on top of navigating 'normal' teen problems like heartbreak and ACT prep.Reading On the Come Up has just reaffirmed my belief that Thomas has an amazing ability to capture a moment in time in the life of a teenager. It reminds me of S.E. Hinton with The Outsiders in authenticity and honesty. There will be classrooms of kids reading her books decades from now, and hopefully they enjoy them more than I did Catcher in the Rye or The Old Man and the Sea. I think more than anything this author just really shines in crafting her characters. When an injustice happens, you feel Bri's righteous anger with her. You feel the same conflicting feelings for Aunt Pooh as her. You laugh when she jokes with her friends and you cry when she does in her brother's arms. And not to spoil anything, but when she eventually does Come Up, you rise with her. The cleverness and humor breaks up some of the serious moments and helps both readers and subjects of the story handle the heaviness of it all.I loved going through Bri's thought process while coming up with her lyrics. Angie Thomas displays her own talent here and gives insight into the creativity behind the words we end up hearing. It's really impressive.I can hear it now--what's that they're chanting?

This series had such a promising start, there was so much hype and it just kind of...fizzled. This absolutely I don’t really know what happened here. This series had such a promising start, there was so much hype and it just kind of...fizzled. This absolutely breaks my heart to have to write, but three stars is the most generous I can be with Children of Virtue and Vengeance. Maybe there were signs of this outcome all along. The release date was repeatedly pushed back to almost two years after the publication of Children of Blood and Bone. The problem with having such a big gap between books is that you lose momentum; memories fade and people eventually lose interest. The whole thing felt rushed, very much like a first draft. I’m wondering if Tomi Adeyemi got wrapped up in picturing the world she created on the big screen. A lot of the dialogue felt like it was ripped from an amateur screenplay and any ‘action’ was more like stage direction than a narrative. It just pales in comparison to its predecessor.The characters don’t hold up either. They especially fall apart in the third act. Amari and Zélie are like parodies of themselves. Inan prefers to beg people to let him explain instead of actually, oh I don’t know, explaining what his plans are. The entire conflict could have been avoided in a 5 minute conversation, at multiple points in the story. They treat their family & friends like strangers and people they just met like a long-lost twin. I lost track of the amount of times that a person around Amari, Inan, Zélie or Tzain threatened to murder someone they (allegedly) loved only to be met by....*crickets*. Not one word of protest or acknowledgement. The entire thing was so bizarre.And I’m so tired of hearing about this fucking monarchy. It’s all bad—throw the entire royal family in the trash! All of the perspective characters, Amari, Zélie and Inan, have just taken up residence in their respective blind spots and refuse to come out. If I was rich enough to afford a new one, I would have pitched my Kindle at a wall. The romance—I don’t want to even get started on, but I will out of a misplaced sense of duty. I feel like Adeyemi was going for a Kylo-Rey type of relationship between Zélie and Inan. Simply put, it doesn’t land. And Tzain only appears when Amari needs her love interest present; otherwise he might as well not be in it at all.One of the most popular subs on Reddit is called “Am I The Asshole?” Users recount a situation and ask the community if they are the asshole in it. The possible responses are:  - YTA (You’re The Asshole) - NTA (Not The Asshole) - NAH (No Assholes Here) - ESH (Everyone Sucks Here)Basically in regards to just about all of the characters in this book, it’s a big ole’ ESH from me.I don’t want to end on such a negative note. I’m still invested enough in Orïsha to want to read the final installment. The world-building, the magic, all of it is so enchanting that I will trudge through bad character backsliding in order to continue exploring it. In those two years, I forgot how readable and consumable Tomi Adeyemi’s writing is. You rip through the pages desperate to get to the end, just like with her debut. I want to see more of the Tîtáns and Iyika. I want to know what happens to Zélie and her friends. But I also want the story to gain back some of the nuance and craftsmanship it had previously. I’m going to keep hopeful that like divîner magic, eventually it will return to us....more",Notes are private!,0,77,1,"Feb 17, 2020","Feb 26, 2020","Oct 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39122774-children-of-virtue-and-vengeance

Dorian is the typical pompous prick we're supposed to initially dislike but then grow to love inexplicably. So, naturally he is the worst. There's several villains who live through to the end with major potential. Plus ancient magic, which is always fun.Biggest issue was that Celaena was almost unbelievably daft at times. The conclusions she reached after being presented with circumstances and suspects were just...dumb. It kind of suspended believability more than the magic and demons.

The prologue, kingdom descriptions and character backgrounds included in the book were also helpful, and I recommend anyone not immediately reading one after another in this trilogy to take the time to go over them. Reading on my Kindle has been a godsend since it saved me from having to flip back and forth between the glossary and the page. Just highlight the word and the definition comes right up!Once I was able to get my bearings, I fell right back into the dazzling world of Daevabad. While the majority takes place in the city itself, other more rural locations are explored too. Seeing how members of the same tribe spread out from each other physically had radically altered their own core philosophies added another element to the already incredibly intricate political climate in the realm. Ghassan is obviously one of the baddest of the bad guys in the series, but as far as Jobs I Definitely Wouldn't Ever Want go, being the King of Daevas is waaaaay up there on that list. One think I loved about S.A. Chakraborty's characters is that level of complexity runs through all of them. There's opposing views and ideologies between characters, yes, but they also are having the same battles within themselves. From Dara's prejudice against shafit with his feelings for Nahri, to Ali's devoutness verses loyalty to his family, or Nahri wanting to fight oppressors when the people who are oppressed seems to be constantly changing, they experience as much conflict internally as they do externally.Nahri, Ali & Dara also harbor a lot of anger and resentment. There's never any completely clean hands between them. It's hard to be frustrated with those three especially for very long because most of their choices, even when they're certifiably dumb, are simultaneously understandable. Can you be mad at someone for killing you when you killed them first? (Questions like these are part of why I will never give up fantasy) Their personal interactions imitate the larger scale disputes in the city, culminating in a heart-racing climax that drastically changes the future of the daevas.Everything I loved about the city of Daevabad in the first book is present in this one, and its raw brutality is mercifully broken up by moments of levity and humor.

It was easy to see what he was describing to me, especially with structures and buildings. Throughout the book it felt as though I was sitting in the rooms as things were unfolding.What really held back this book for me was the meandering pace it takes through what should be a high stakes mystery. There's just a complete absence of any urgency, despite the main character having several imminent threats throughout the story. Despite the bang the book starts out on, it's a slow burn that really never comes to a full boil. The characters are also very British. I know this because I'm constantly told how British they are. How they Britishly speak and britishly drink and have British moods--seriously, is there a quota for number of times one must explicitly mention Britishness that British authors have to meet by law? I don't mean to just pick on this book, I've noticed it in several others I've read recently, but it's an interesting quirk I haven't seen really from authors of different countries. If you're interested in the location (London) or time period or subject matter (architecture & theatre), I think the story will have an extra enticing element. It was compelling enough for me to want to finish, but not read again. I'll probably pass it on to my cousin who majored in architecture to see what she thinks![I didn't really let this factor into my feelings on the whole with this book, because it could be just that I don't really know what's considered 'normal', but I found some of the terms and attitude towards other cultures, orientations, genders, etc. rather jarring. It's clearly reflective of the time period (early 1900s), but I guess I'm just unaccustomed to it. I think I'll try to read more books set 100+ years ago and see how they compare; I'd like to be able to tell when language of a time period is appropriate or not. For now I'll just assume it was!]*Second ever  of a book, which I won in a giveaway here*...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 28, 2018","Dec 30, 2018","Oct 13, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37827095-the-fallen-architect

I wanted to read it initially after I found out the movie A Beautiful Boy was based off of the memoir of the same name as well as this one, which describe the same period of time from dueling points of view. It's a cool premise around a dark and difficult time in both of their lives. It feels wrong to a lot of us to criticize a testimony of someone's struggle with something like addiction so negatively, but I'm having a hard time finding positives that don't sound pandering. I appreciate Nic's honesty here, and I think the depiction of drug addiction may be useful to those struggling, but I did not get much out of this book. I tried to take a step back to figure out if there was some overarching reason why I didn't like this memoir at all, but I think that's the underlying point. I just don't think I like him that much. The Sheff's are just not a family I can see myself in. I don't have anything against them, but the way they speak and operate in the world is just not compatible with me personally. These feelings are completely divorced from the addiction and all that's associated with it as well. In fact, his struggles as an addict were the only part of him I empathized with. The specific things that rubbed me the wrong way aren't that relevant, but many of them are also part of his father's memoir, so I'm assuming it's part of their family dynamic. I have a feeling of impending dread every time I 'force' myself to start this book up again, so I've just called it quits.

Sometimes I felt completely on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop.Because this is a story about drug addiction, I expected there to be relapses. What I couldn't really prepare for was the frequency of them and just how devastating they are each and every time. Even when I was less than halfway through the book, I still held out hope that Nic would be better each time he promised he would. Until I didn't. Which isn't any less sad, but is just becoming resigned to that sadness. I found myself really empathizing with the Sheff family throughout the years laid out in this book.I also felt myself becoming increasing angry, along with David, at Nic. He had such an extraordinary amount of privilege at every single point of his addiction that others could only dream of. David Sheff does touch on this a couple of times, but it makes me even sadder for those who can't afford to be shipped off to half a dozen luxury rehabs across the country on a moment's notice. Addiction doesn't discriminate, but treatment sure as hell does.I ended up skimming parts, unfortunately. He's very descriptive, but sometimes it's like he's just listing things. There's a lot of time spent going into great detail on the environment or weather or location, which can feel somewhat gratuitous. It's the most obvious when he's discussing movies, bands, books or things of that nature. He wants to make sure that the reader knows how interesting and cultured he and his son both are.

I found Garrard Conley takes a somewhat meandering pace through less relevant portions, while others, especially insights into much of the Love In Action program, were more limited. Chapters sometimes contained multiple time and location jumps, which left it a bit disjointed.But Conley really allowed the reader to empathize with many different people affected by rigid religious fundamentalism. The parts with his mom in particular were rough, man. Bouncing between their loving relationship to listening to her vomit after finding out about his sexuality is hard to reconcile. I kept wondering how she would have reacted if he told her about his rape; would she have been even more upset at the time to know he was a victim as well? I would have been to afraid to ask.The parallels between Smid, the ex-gay counselor, and Garrard's father, a baptist pastor, were really pointed. ""Like my father, Smid was excellent at conversion, justifying whatever sudden mood overtook him."" Both men seek redemption for their past actions by attempting to impact and improve the lives of people around them, possibly hoping to change themselves in the process.I wish we got more from the other LIA members, but if he was only there a week or two, I get why there wasn't more to share.

I can’t help but feel like it does. How many people reading the description for a book would take one look at the word “cheerleaders” and immediately move on? Is there the same level of dismissiveness for books about male athletes, like the hockey players in Beartown or the football players of Friday Night Lights? I don’t think there is. And I wonder how much of that has to do with the status and infamy that cheerleading retains in our popular culture. I wasn’t a cheerleader. I don’t believe I have any negative feelings towards the institution either. But I do fucking love Megan Abbott, even though Goodreads ers do not appreciate her for whatever reason. She writes the absolute best unlikeable characters, particularly unlikeable women. They are some of the most layered characterizations I’ve ever read, and it’s usually hard to root for anybody. There’s no heroes, no villains, no real anti-heroes, even. Perhaps that’s why her books are typically falling on the lower end of 3 stars, because they’re so unbearably human. Dare Me follows a high school cheerleading squad and their new coach, Colette French. The narrator, Addy, and her teammates are immediately drawn into Coach French’s almost gravitational pull. The established hierarchy is turned on it’s head. Friendships are tested. But these aren’t typical female friendships as depicted in most books and movies. These friendships are complicated, uneven and at times deeply uncomfortable. They can be vicious—not in a catty sense, but in an animalistic one. These are not moving relationships, they are ones that make you squirm in your seat.This novel is taut and quietly intense. Despite not knowing what’s going to happen, a wave of overwhelming inevitability hits you at the end. That’s Abbott’s signature, for me: the sense that it couldn’t have ended any other way.

I still ruminate over the first book of his I read, Downsiders, and I remember him visiting my middle school some time around 2004/5 to promote The Schwa Was Here. He’s just an author that I’ve consistently enjoyed from childhood into adulthood, and I know I’m not the only one. The Arc of a Scythe series has been a highlight of my reading over the past several years. From the driving characters to the absolutely fascinating concept and setting, Shusterman crafted a vivid environment for this trilogy to thrive. The success of these books is even more impressive considering the reported “decline” of the YA dystopian novel in the back half of the decade. Burnt out on young heroines and heroes fighting back against a tyrannical government set on controlling them, books like The Hunger Games, Divergent and The Maze Runner have been loved, lauded, adapted and then mocked for that consistent message, depending on the current mood. So what makes these books different? I’m sure the current geopolitical and *literal* climate are contributing factors. You don’t have to stretch the imagination much to see the way humans are progressing scientifically but stagnating or regressing on social policy has become worrisome. I was picking up more on some of these parallels while reading The Toll than I might have been at a different point in time. Some are broader, like authoritarian leaders who give in to their own cult of personality and scapegoat the fringes of society as ‘undesirables’ that don’t deserve to live with the rest of us, if at all. While others can be nothing but specific call outs like, “Greatness is overrated” or “Only idiots built walls.”One of the strengths of the series was how well-plotted they all were. It’s nice to have a great premise, but if it all falls apart once you start world-building beyond that set-up, then it’s not going to be able to carry that momentum to the end. I was blown away by the unfolding of events in Scythe at the outset, torn apart by their development as it all crescendoed in Thunderhead and expertly put back together by deft hands in The Toll. The entire series is thoughtful and cleverly constructed, asking ‘what ifs’ to some of our society’s most looming questions. This is a type of speculative fiction that I don’t think YA gets enough credit for, because it’s typically starring teenagers, but is undeniably smart and compelling. The final installment of the trilogy is just as satisfying as we could hope, and as unflinching as its fans have come to expect. ——————————————————Accidentally returned this to the library before finishing it—OOPSSent back to the end of the holds line..[image]...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Nov 23, 2019","Jan 02, 2020","Oct 02, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43822024-the-toll

It was extremely easy to empathize with her as she confronted some difficult situations.Annika is a really compelling character, which was crucial since I'm not typically into romance books. The intimate scenes in particular were a highlight when paired with her blunt candor and I found myself audibly cackling and snorting at some of the social interactions she tried to maneuver.

Beth Macy has written a meticulous account of the opioid crisis our country has faced over the This book was equal parts devastating and infuriating. Beth Macy has written a meticulous account of the opioid crisis our country has faced over the past two decades. Mostly localized to her native Virginia, Macy uses her investigative skills to trace back this epidemic to its roots and follow it to its inevitable, disastrous end. The casualties, measured in both deaths and lives completely shattered, are almost too large to comprehend. So while relaying important facts and statistics about addiction and overdose, the author weaves in human stories of real people who have struggled and who are still struggling currently in order to give us something more to grasp on to than cold numbers.Though it may be presented as something more academic or anthropological, what Dopesick is over anything else is a call to action. It’s a call for the pharmaceutical companies and their overseers who over-produce and supply these drugs to the general public. It’s a call to doctors in small towns who are overprescribing and letting themselves be influenced by the sales reps who are pretty brazenly offering bribes. It’s a call for police and other law enforcement to change the way they pursue and classify addicts as criminals first and people second. It’s a call to legislators to seem reluctant to enact any programs to help the already addicted find their way back to society. And it’s a call to the communities affected, the ones who believe that by not acknowledging these problems they will simply go away. But unfortunately by the time anyone has really started to listen, it’s usually far too late for far too many.I can hear the weariness in Macy’s writing and her interviews with the families of those affected. Everyone just seems so tired. Hell, I was tired too. But it’s even harder to treat an already difficult problem when everyone is walking around like Sandra Bullock in Birdbox. I guess I, like Macy and the rest of her subjects, are just wondering if and when this will be taken seriously like the absolute crisis it is.(view spoiler)[And that gut-punch in the Epilogue. Oof.

I was all of 5 on April 20th, 1999, so I would have been in kindergarten at the time. It’s weird to have no memory of an event that has impacted every day of my education, from elementary to high school and beyond. We were doing school lockdown drills before we knew what they were for. This was even before they were more streamlined, and my school had been trying out different names: ‘Code Red’ or ‘Code Yellow’. We learned it along with the Tornado Drill, everyone curl into a ball near the bathroom, and the Fire Drill, everyone walk quickly outside and stand on the curb. This ‘Stranger’ Drill was different because we didn’t leave the room, we turned off the lights and hid in a corner. If you were in the bathroom, you had to stay there, pull your legs up on to the seat and try not to make a sound. We didn’t know what we were hiding from, but even then, even at that age, it was clear this was a different sort of danger.I also read Parkland before I picked up Columbine. Out of his two books I feel as though I’ve really only lived through Parkland. Despite alluding to his previous subject quite often in Parkland, this one struck quite a different tone. While much of the 2019 book is focused on the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas repurposing their tragedy into a national movement, the students of Columbine are simply trying to grapple with their grief. Survival is enough of a victory, and even that feels at times out of reach.In Parkland Cullen also discusses his own trauma from spending years painstakingly covering the first shooting and rehashing such a senselessly violent attack. I can see even more now how someone in that position would end up responding that way. Anyone who hasn’t read either book yet needs to, but I would make sure you’re in a proper headspace to do so. Already knowing the story doesn’t make it any easier to consume.One of the most useful purposes of such a chronicling of events is that the myths surrounding this shooting and others like it are able to be addressed and dispelled comprehensively. The “loner” reputation has unfortunately not disappeared, but here Cullen clearly dismisses that idea multiple times. The lack of a motive or targets that we as a society can readily understand is not an easy pill to swallow, but it is a necessary one if we want to prevent more situations like this going forward. Also, the revelation that Columbine was “a bombing that failed” and just the sheer scale of the killers’ plans and goals were news to me. I can’t even imagine what that would have looked like—and I’m glad that imagining it is all we have to do.The author is noticeably moved at several points throughout his research, but maintains an ability to be diplomatic in the face of unfathomable loss. The area that I think his frustration is most evident is in how the Jeffco Sheriff’s department covered-up their own missteps leading up to, during and after the attack. The original mistakes could have been forgiven, but the attempts to cover their own asses after the fact is reprehensible. I don’t know about a legal definition for negligence, but in my view they more than met the moral threshold for it.I’ll wrap up this up with a quote from ‘The Boy in the Window’, Patrick Ireland. In addressing his graduating class as valedictorian he described that infamous moment as such:“When I fell out the window, I knew somebody would catch me.

At the time it was the longest and most expensWhew, this was an exhaustive account of one of the most exhausting criminal trials in American history. At the time it was the longest and most expensive ever undergone, with a level of dramatics and theater that would have been dismissed as too far-fetched if it had been a fictional courtroom drama instead of a real-life proceeding. Hats off to Vincent Bugliosi; he did not leave one stone unturned and hand-held the reader from the horrific crime scene discovery through to the end of the Tate-LaBianca trial and beyond.All that information and the personal overtone Bugliosi initially provided in the book should have clued me in that he was somehow involved with the case as more than a passive observer. I was, in fact, caught completely off guard when he disclosed he was the prosecutor assigned to both the Tate and LaBianca murder investigations. Perhaps in some instances this would mean he wasn’t an unbiased narrator, but Bugliosi more than proved his own credibility time and time again. He also may be the only person who could have accurately and completely recounted this story to the public.Is he a perfect commentator? No, not at all. Some of this is attributed to the time period he lived in, like referring to the Polanski/Tate housekeeper as “a black” and “the negro”. He also repeatedly labeled totally normal and expected emotional reactions by women finding out someone close to them was brutally slain as “hysterical”, where men were described as ‘understandably’ upset. And while the young plaintiffs of both genders were physically scrutinized to some extent, the young women were more likely to get specific remarks disparaging their appearance than the men involved. They’re part of a murder cult, Vince, can’t you find something to drive that point home beyond “ugly” or “unattractive”?I think the most astonishing part of the entire endeavor was the complete ineptitude shown by the LAPD, specifically those investigating the Tate murders. They went beyond incompetence into negligence. As an author Bugliosi was trying to remain neutral, but as the person who had to make up for their many, many mistakes you can tell he was pissed off. I appreciated him most when he gave pitiless indictments (that veered almost sarcastic) of both the initial investigation and the lack of any discernible form of follow-up, basic police work really. During the trial, while Manson and his followers were exactly as ridiculous and disruptive as one would expect, I was taken aback by what his lawyer, Irving Kanarek, was allowed to get away with. Most of his interruptions were mercifully excluded by the author, but even the sampling we were exposed to were excessive to the point of unethical. All together, with the disturbing Manson family, their obstructionist attorney, a ruthless press core and the cast of Police Academy, I am beyond impressed with how the prosecution kept their cool.If you have any questions, any at all, about the Manson trial, family or their numerous crimes, Bugliosi answers them in this (700!!) page book. If you’re interested, I’d recommend getting the print version, as the ebook I got from my library was stripped of all images apparently due to copyright abuse....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Oct 19, 2019","Oct 31, 2019","Aug 21, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6589426-helter-skelter

He’s afraid of his own darkness. His wife just doesn’t understand. He has a connection with a killer that only he is capable of. This book was written in the early 80s, so I don’t know if this was cliche at the time or not, but I don’t think it would garner as much praise if released today.Basically, Will Graham is a throw-away character. Agent Crawford even more so. Molly and her son get very little to do other than filling roles that assist in Will’s character and plot development. They’re potential targets, victims, sources of personal conflict and “anchors” at home. You could copy/paste any of them with other rogue cops or worrying wives and nobody would notice.What I appreciated the most were the antagonists. Freddy Lounds is a skeezy reporter who gets himself in too deep while looking for dirt. Francis Dolarhyde’s descent into deeper and deeper mental illness is incremental and fascinating. He’s a loner that’s harboring mental, emotional and physical scars that result in a very specific manifestation of violence. Harris was said to have consulted with John Edward Douglas on the psychology of serial killers, which he helped pioneer the study and tracking of at the FBI. (Check out Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit for more) This is to say nothing of the eventual star of the series, Hannibal Lector (view spoiler)[who, unfortunately, was the only of these three to survive to the next book. (hide spoiler)]It’s easy to get entrenched in the psychology of these characters, and despite my panning of Graham, he’s an effective audience surrogate.

I waBefore there was an entire genre of murderous children, before even the term “serial killer” was coined, there was The Bad Seed by William March. I want to say it was Gillian Flynn who first put this book on my radar years ago, when I was desperate to find something to fill the place of Sharp Objects after finishing that cruelly brilliant debut. In a premise that might sound familiar nowadays, a typical 1950s mother and housewife, Christine Penmark, has growing concerns about her daughter, Rhoda, as bad things continue to happen around the child. She’s well-mannered and charming to adults but children her own age are spooked by her presence. Though she always seems to know exactly the right thing to say, her parents have noticed a calculating quality to her actions and words, as if she’s learned this behavior and is simply mimicking it. Christine’s husband is away for work for almost the entire novel, and so she must decide how to handle the concerning behavior of their child completely on her own.As an almost 70-year-old book, The Bad Seed does it’s best to pathologize Rhoda as well as it can. March, to his credit, writes the two female characters at its center with more agency than I was expecting. The way Christine acts, dismissing her own thoughts and feelings, reducing feminine traits as inferior to masculine ones, is probably not too far off of how some women of the era would think. I’m sure a modern interpretation of both the psychology of Rhoda and Christine as well as their socialization would be more incisive and accurate, but even outside of the time period the book was set in I think March was very thoughtful in his analysis of both of these characters.I haven’t read many s of this one yet because I didn’t want to spoil it for myself but I loved seeing the starting point of many popular horror tropes of the past several decades. I was afraid there wouldn’t be any surprises in a book that’s been part of the lexicon for so long, but that was not the case here. I was still shocked by the way the story turned out, even if it feels inevitable once you know. Though a lot of what was revealed about Rhoda may be expected by readers, the biggest twists for me centered around Christine. Their relationship is a big answer to the classic ‘nature or nurture’ question that writers have loved to explore in their works. Thanks to Chandra ( @wherethereadergrows ) who sent me this book last Christmas (oops)—I’m sorry it took so long to get to! I’m interested in watching the movie adaptation from 1956 now, and hope it lives up to the source material![image]**For more book talk & s, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Oct 17, 2021","Oct 28, 2021","Aug 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22318501-the-bad-seed

Having Tina Fey narrate her own book really adI had some stuff to paint, so I decided to put on the audiobook version of Bossypants to pass the time. Having Tina Fey narrate her own book really added to the Tina Feyness of it all. I haven't listened to enough books to know what makes a good and bad narrator, but I feel like the author reading it with the proper inflections and rhythm is a plus. This may be even more important in comedic works where timing and tone are crucial.Since I'm getting to it so long after initial publication, I've heard some of the jokes and stories before on various late night shows. That's not really a problem, since there's plenty of other material included. Even if it wasn't literally her voice filling the room, it still reads reliably in her 'voice'. A few jokes might have played better a decade or so ago, but comedy changes with the time period and atmosphere. Nothing is cringey the way other comedians' stand-up sets from years ago posted to YouTube are now. It's aged pretty well all things considered.Maybe I've read too many similar books by comedy-writers-turned-big-celebrities, but I was waiting for a resonating moment to tie it all together. I think I was expecting something a la Trevor Noah's brilliant and at times profound Born A Crime or even the flawed, but authentic The Last Black Unicorn from Tiffany Haddish, but they both had vastly different experiences from comedians like Fey. What holds up best for me was the stories and advice around working in a male dominated field, especially while in the spotlight. It's like a more practical and less patronizing Lean In (I mean this in a good way).She's an incredibly funny lady and this was a great representation of her humor and skill set. Also makes me want to follow it up with Amy Poehler's book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 27, 2019","Mar 29, 2019","Aug 02, 2017",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/10895204-bossypants
