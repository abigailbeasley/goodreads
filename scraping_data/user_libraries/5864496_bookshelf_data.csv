It tells the story of the remarkable Oskar Schindler who managed to establish several factories in Poland where he.saved hundreds of Jews from death in Nazi concentration camps.This book is a fascinating account of how Keneally discovered the story - via a chance visit to a leather goods shop in Beverly Hills where he met Poldek, one of the Jews who had been safeguarded - and was told the story of Schindler, backed up by many documents Poldek had gathered together. The two of them then became colleagues in researching more details and promoting the idea of the book.The intricacies of gathering information and dealing with publication are vividly presented and the book becomes even more interesting when Spielberg signs a contract to make it a movie, set mostly in Krakow in Poland.Keneally writes well and the story behind a famous book and movie is dramatic, intriguing and full of interesting characters.

Noor Naga captures the difference in perspective that two lovers come to have as their relationship develops and then disintegrates, given the contrast in their backgrounds and status. The woman is an American who has come to Egypt because that was where her parents were from while the man comes from a poor village distant from Cairo. The author contrasts their perspectives in a dramatic form with each of them answering a question in alternating segments The result is a thoughtful book on the powerful differences in life experiences with an unexpected and riveting conclusion.

One of the book’s virtues is the way it captures vividly a wide series of settings, from African areas of disease and danger such as Sierra Leone during civil war to the siege of Leningrad to the cities of Alaska. The central figure is Anya, a complex woman with difficult relationships with her two daughters. And the heart of the book is about how those ties deepen and warm in the aftermath of her husband’s death. The three of them end up taking a cruise to Alaska that connects Anya dramatically to her Russian past. This novel will engage you and draw you into the lives of fascinating characters.

Marie is a strong willed daughter of a sugar factory owner who inherits the factory and builds an empire of other factories around it stretching into the U.S. while Sadie becomes a brilliant ribald writer whose books penetrate her society and transform the thinking of young women. This is a book that is about the love affair between the two but also about their impact on Montreal, tracing the huge inequalities between those in the Golden Mile and the many who scrape by in the Squalid Mile. It’s a fable in many ways about the working class rebellion that women lead to challenge such inequalities and the sexual dominance over women that men exercised.

Just as Dennis Lehane writes reviting and intricate novels of working class Boston and its criminal activities this novel captures the texture and complexity of black Harlem in a well plotted format that kept me deeply engaged. Ray Carney is in the middle, trying to build a life as an entrepreneur running a furniture store yet still connected to some of the criminal characters who were linked to his father Mike. His cousin Freddie is even more caught up in risky illegal activities. Ray is pulled back and forth, illustrating the difficult context of black Americans in the sixties.Whitehead builds a fascinating and powerful story around these conflicts that Ray faces and the complicated navigation he must undertake to survive and prosper, dealing with corrupt policemen, dangerous crime bosses and racial inequalities. Harlem comes alive in vivid detail in this excellent book. And Ray and his counterparts emerge in equal depth and variety. Another fine novel by one of America’s best writers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 29, 2021","Dec 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54626223-harlem-shuffle

She believed that Trudeau shared her goals and ran as a Liberal in the 2015 election, winning in Vancouver Granville.

And then there was the SNC affair where the prime minister and his staff tried to pressure Jody to override her public prosecutor and give SNC an escape route from corruption charges.

Not only are they discriminated against, but he suggests they come to doubt themselves and the choices they made in immigrating to America. Yet this is more than a lament for Muslim Americans.

This is a sprawling book with many separate episodes recounted and a wide set of diverse characters. But it holds together overall as a fierce indictment of contemporary America.

ThisHonduras is a complicated Central American country with a difficult history as we discovered when we visited Roatan, one of its offshore islands. This riveting book is based partly on that island, from which an expedition departed to explore a long abandoned large preColumbian city that had been discovered in the remote and mountainous interior. This White City as legends called it was rumored to be a rich and powerful community before it was deserted by its people some 500 years before. This well written and factual book recounts the discovery process with all its immense challenges, from confronting highly poisonous snakes to wading through quicksand. Preston presents a vivid account of how new technology permits archaeological insights previously impossible and how three expeditions allowed experts to verify these findings on the ground. The final stages of the book recount the dangers of disease that the expedition members experienced and draw powerful parallels with the way European diseases wiped out as many as 90% of the Indian population in the American context. There are also some wise comments about the dangers of worldwide pandemics that strike home in the context of COVID-19.

An intricate plot, interesting characters and portrayals of southern small town life create another successful Grisham novel....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 13, 2021","Jan 17, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53529219-a-time-for-mercy

This novel, an addictive western set near Lake Louise in the Rockies, was a deserving part of the list. William Moreland is the ridge runner,moving north and south of the American border as he steals money to assure a safe future for his son Jack Boulton who he has left with a nun, Sister Beatrice, until he can return. Jack, however, cannot abide the sheltered life she tries to force him into and escapes to return to his previous home in the mountains. The book is mostly about his misadventures until his father returns and is a suspenseful account of life in the wilderness. I found the story well constructed and engaging with surprising concluding elements. As a novel I found the book well written and plotted and a worthy Giller nominee. Of the three novels in contention I would likely have chosen The Glass Hotel as more imaginative. But there were also two excellent short story collections nominated and one of them, How to Pronounce Knife, won. Myself I find it difficult to compare novels against short stories. But I was very impressed by the winner and the voice from the outside that it represents. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 11, 2020","Dec 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48572665-ridgerunner

Good but more a three and a half instead of the five stars his books usually deserve. It’s a book that starts out with humour and wit as Blackbird and wife Mimi land in Prague from Toronto and begin exploring the city while coping with jetlag and a small hot hotel room. But then the novel gradually gets darker as each has to deal with illness, they are depressed by the plight of Syrian refugees and Bird confronts memories of the suppression of Indian communities in North America which he covered as a journalist. Aging is another concern for them both though they counter that with some delightful sexual scenes. Prague does not glow as a tourist destination in the book and the couple’s goal of solving the hundred year old mystery of what happened to the medicine bundle taken by their relative when he left to join a Wild West show in Europe never gets resolved. But King does keep us going with interesting characters and his portrait of a complex marital relationship. Overall I enjoyed the book despite the curmudgeonly character of Bird. The concept was intriguing of putting Indian visitors as tourists in Europe and as always King’s writing is sharp and skillful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 05, 2020","Dec 06, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48947326-indians-on-vacation

Religious ties are crucial to the mother and a good part of the novel is about the daughter agonizing about her religious struggles as her life moves forward. But the heart of the book is about addiction, how it comes about and whether it can be countered. As a result this is a grim book, with important insights into a modern reality of American life but without much of the verve and spirit of Homegoing.

It was nominated to the short list of the 2020 Giller Prize. But it is certainly a dark book! The stories are mostly bleak, full of failed love and death.

""Apeirogon"" is also a considerable achievement, bringing alive in all its complexities the relationship between Israel and Palestine.An apeirogon is a shape with an infinite number of sides, and McCann traces the many different perspectives in this region with skill and emotion. His focus is on two fathers, Bassam who spent seven years in prison for protesting against Israeli jeeps in the Occcupied West Bank, and Rami who was in the Israeli Defence Forces invading Egypt. Both men lose their daughters as the ongoing conflicts continue -- Bassam's young Abir is killed by a rubber bullet after visiting a candy store by her school, and Rami's child Smadar is one of a number of girls caught in the downtown explosions from three suicide bombers. Both men are profoundly changed by these tragedies and build a relationship between themselves, committing to work for peace in the region. Combatants for Peace brings both Israelis and Palestinians into ongoing efforts to counter conflict, while The Parents Circle unites those from both sides who have lost children.The partnership of Rami and Bassam is poignant and their personal stories are emotionally powerful.

Set in Dublin it traces the onslaught of the Spanish flu pandemic at the end of World War One, intertwining this tragedy with the wartime devastation and the fight for Irish independence. The book has special force in these days of Covid-19 pandemic since the flu could hit so fast and could be so deadly. It was especially dangerous for expectant mothers and this novel focuses on a nurse, Julia Powers, in charge of a small ward dedicated to such patients. The mothers are all stricken in different ways — and Julia faces major challenges in responding. This all echoes strongly the struggles of frontline medical workers in our present pandemic. At the same time this is a dramatic personal story involving Julia’s war-damaged brother Tim, the young woman Bridie who appears to help Julia and a female doctor with special skills — who was also a rebel fighting against British colonialism. This character, Dr. Lynn, is drawn from the history of the time and stands out in the novel. The depth and contemporary relevance of this book make it a remarkable achievement.

The first two books in the trilogy each won the Man Booker Prize, and this historical novel is just as powerful, wide-ranging and engaging.At 750 pages, you might think that this book might be too detailed and complicated to keep your attention, but the remarkable characters that Mantel portrays, from Cromwell himself, to Henry VIII, to his daughter Mary and many others keep the reader intrigued, as their complex relationships play out. Four facets of the novel stand out for me. One is the power of religious affiliations and beliefs during this period -- Cromwell himself works assiduously to achieve and spread an English bible that ordinary folk can read, Henry sees himself as head of an independent new English church, while Mary reveres her Catholic ties to the Pope. A second is the social conflict that underlies the period, as a new bourgeois class emerges to challenge the nobility; Cromwell with his talents and learning represents that class. A third is the importance of interconnections between England and parts of Europe, with maintaining divisions between France and the Spanish Empire crucial to English freedom of action. Finally, fourth, this novel underlines in stark terms the violence and vicious betrayals that mark this period; the book starts with the beheading of Anne Boleyn and moves on to countless other executions, burning of so-called heretics and suppression of popular revolts.Mantel recounts these realities graphically, giving us a devastating picture of what could often be a grim and heartless time. Cromwell managed to survive and to build achievements for his King, despite this ruthlessness, thanks in part to the able supporters he was able to utilize, in part to the harsh past he endured in his youth, and in part to his abilities to work effectively with the women of the time, so often overlooked.Remarkably, though conflict with the King emerged, the Cromwell family survived -- and the great-great-grandson of Thomas, Oliver Cromwell, eventually established the dominance of Parliament in the country. Perhaps Hilary Mantel will now go on to write his story, having so magnificently traced the life of Thomas Cromwell!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2020","Aug 16, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45992717-the-mirror-the-light

But this book is particularly audacious and fascinating. Set in first century Galilee, it is the imagined story of Ana, a bright and strong willed young woman growing up in a dysfunctional Jewish family where she must challenge her parents who plan to marry her to an elderly widower. Her rebellion eventually connects her to a young Jesus and she becomes his wife. Kidd does a remarkable job creating a life for Ana in Nazareth with Mary and other members of her new family, all against a backdrop of Christ developing his faith, building ties with John the Baptist and beginning his ministry to people. The heart of this story, though, is Ana developing her voice and that of women in a paternalistic society both in Galilee and when she is later forced to flee to Alexandria in Egypt. It is a dramatic story and Kidd recounts it well, with passion and depth. To take on a task like this, rooted in the origins of the Christian faith yet providing a feminist perspective on that period, requires courage as well as literary skill.

This book is also very good, but a complete change in genre and setting.The Hotel Caiette is a grand resort for the rich, set in the north of Vancouver Island, and so remote you have to take a motor boat to get there. Vincent is an adept young bartender working there; and her life changes completely when she meets the wealthy investment dealer, Jonathan Alkaitis, who owns the hotel. The two come together, and Vincent enters the country of money, experiencing the pleasures and tensions that great wealth can bring -- from private jets, to exclusive sailing trips, to expansive shopping trips, though watching all along not to make mistakes in her relationship with Jonathan that would cast her out.Vincent is a remarkable character, and on one level, this book is about her life -- her relationship with her brother Paul who abuses her trust by stealing the videos she makes -- her dramatic decision to go to sea as the cook on a container ship when the break with Jonathan does come -- and the way her best female friend in the country of money ruthlessly abandons her after that break.But on another level, this is also a story of financial dishonesty, based on the Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff in the U.S. As Mandel has written, ""the crime in this novel is essentially Madoff's crime. But the people are completely different."" People lose their savings and their houses when the scheme collapses and Jonathan and his colleagues are jailed. The drama of this combining with the effects on Vincent all make for a powerful and poignant plot.Mandel is an other-worldly writer, and that emerges in this novel as in ""Station Eleven."" This time it is the ghosts of the past that haunt Jonathan as he endures his long prison sentence.The mix of characters in this book and the starkly different environments in which the plot plays out create a deeply engaging novel.

It’s a broad epic of the history of Chile, starting from the remarkable transit organized by poet Pablo Neruda that brought over 2000 Spanish refugees to Chile after they were defeated by Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Roser and Victor were two of these and the book focuses on their lives, developing from difficult circumstances (Roser was originally the lover of Victor’s brother and their marriage was one of convenience) through various affairs to a deep mutual love. The two epitomize the contributions that the Spanish refugees make to Chile, via medical help and cultural achievements. At the same time Allende traces their lives in emotionally powerful terms, making them come vividly alive, connecting them to iconic Chilean figures such as Neruda and Salvador Allende, and portraying this unique country. This is a fine book, complex and multifaceted.

This multi-generational and penetrating This is an intricate and complex novel, difficult to follow at first, but compelling and powerful in the end. This multi-generational and penetrating character of the book led to it winning the 2019 Governor General prize for Canada’s best literary fiction. The story is built on a real life effort by American missionaries to convert a remote group of warlike villagers in Ecuador to Christianity in 1956. The five men involved were killed and the novel probes the aftermath of this event on their wives as well as their children. Thomas creates a thoughtful and compassionate story of their varied reactions, of the consequences for the remote villagers and of the ways the future plays out for further generations. This is a powerful critique of the evangelical certainties of the missionary endeavor and a discerning analysis of gender relationships within such a context. Thomas writes with skill and insight, creating a real world in which villagers and outsider zealots come vividly alive in their misunderstandings and dramatically different world views.

The encounters between two different cultures are emotionally recounted, including how his daughter ends up receiving a hijab. As he carries the replacement door home on the subway, the narrator muses: ""In an immigrant city, a city of innumerable struggles and ambitions, a white man with a car door and a daughter wearing a blue hijab attract less attention than you might expect.""Such subtle insights are everywhere in this fine book, explaining how it received the Giller nomination.

It also spread across Europe under Nazi occupation and far too often included local collaborators. That is the focus of Armando Lucas Correa's new novel, ""The Daughter's Tale,"" a counterpart to his excellent novel, ""The German Girl,"" that traced the tragic voyage of the St. Louis ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees to Cuba, where they were refused permission to land.Amanda Sternberg is the central character in the first part of the book, a mother and bookstore owner in Berlin, whose books are all burned and whose husband is arrested and sent to a concentration camp. She must somehow help her two daughters to survive, hopefully with the help of friends of her husband in France. She also manages to get a ticket for one daughter, Viera, on the St. Louis. Then she and her other daughter (eventually renamed Elise) flee to France.Their life there seems at first to have some security -- until the Germans invade and defeat the French. Correa then traces a complex set of relationships in the small town, with some people helping Amanda and Elise, while others become Nazi collaborators. The human interactions are played out with deep emotion by the author, with a shocking culmination involving the 1944 massacre of most of the village by Nazi armed forces with French supporters (an actual historic event.)The facts of Nazi brutality are well known, but Correa gives a profound human dimension to these tragedies -- moving back and forth in time, tying lives to their symbols of memory and loss, and making us feel deeply these past events.This is a very good book that kept me fully engaged.

This new novel is somewhat different -- there are some courtroom scenes, but the focus is on a returned soldier in Mississippi after World War Two, Pete Banning, a middle-sized cotton farmer who ends up a prisoner of the Japanese on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines.Banning decides, as the book opens, that it is time to kill the preacher who presides over the local Methodist church built years ago by Banning's ancestors, among others. The book then revolves around this act, which Banning refuses to explain even after he is convicted of murder and due to be executed. Why won't he explain his violent deed? Why did he do it? What is its connection to the fact his wife is being cared for in a centre for the mentally ill? And what are the consequences for Pete's family, particularly his children Joel and Stella?These questions drive the book forward, but a large portion of the novel deals with the Bataan ordeal of the American soldiers who surrendered there to the Japanese -- and with the guerrilla operations that Pete became involved in when he escaped his prisoner-of-war camp. This is in many respects the most riveting part of the book.Overall, I enjoyed the novel and certainly found myself engaged by it. But I did find the inexplicable unwillingness of Banning to explain himself somewhat tedious as the book progressed.

His non-fiction books and articles are superbly written and insightful. Now, with this novel, he presents us with a dramatic fictional saga of oppression and redemption in ante-bellum America, focused on slavery on one declining tobacco plantation in Virginia, but ranging widely from there to Philadelphia, to Delaware and to the northern border with Canada.This book is a fascinating mix of historical fiction, suspense adventure, love story and magic realism. It is the story of Hiram Walker, the boy born of the rape by his plantation owner father of his slave mother, Rose; he is eventually taken into the plantation house to serve his hapless, hell-raising half brother, Maynard -- though he is ultimately unable to stop him from misadventures that drown him. Somehow, though, Hiram survives this fatal wagon crash into the river, giving him the first hint of the supernatural powers with which he has been endowed. From there, Coates skillfully spins out the love story that brings Hiram together with Sophia and the adventure that takes the young slave to eventual freedom -- and then to a prominent role in organizing the Underground Railroad that liberates so many other of the ""Tasked,"" as Coates calls them, from across the southern US. The plot is intricate and the settings are finely rendered.

This emerging AI reality, with its profound implications for human life, jobs and incomes, is what makes this fascinating novel timely and insightful.Almost all of McEwan's books have been superb, in my view, from ""Amsterdam"" and ""Sweet Tooth"" to ""Atonement"" and ""Enduring Love."" This novel is just as good, with engaging characters, an intricate plot and an unexpected socio-political background -- built around an alternate reality where Britain and Margaret Thatcher are defeated in the Falkland Island war with Argentina, the famous wartime genius Alan Turing survives his prosecution for homosexuality (and goes on to make intellectual breakthroughs that give the UK supremacy in Internet innovations and AI) and Tony Benn defeats Thatcher to form a left-wing technology-intensive Labour government that withdraws from the European Community (shades of Brexit!)The narrator of the book, Charlie, is a struggling day-trader, making enough money from the stock market and currency trades to survive, but not much more. He receives an inheritance, though, that allows him to spend some 200 thousand dollars for an advanced Artificial Intelligence being called Adam, with capabilities to accomplish many tasks once programmed, and, it turns out, feelings that give him near human characteristics. Charlie is starting an affair with a bright graduate school historian, Miranda, who lives in the upstairs flat -- and the two of them combine to choose the sort of character Adam will have through the programming. ""It's almost like having our own child,"" Charlie enthuses.In a McEwan book, there are always magnificent twists, of course, and that is true of this novel. Two major developments shape the book. The first is that Adam falls in love with Miranda and she, curious to test what this AI creature can do, takes him into her bed -- while Charlie listens to their passionate love-making; all three agree this can never happen again, but Adam continues to pour his love into thousands of haiku-form poems for Miranda. The second involves Miranda's testimony that sent a man to jail for rape -- he is now nearing release and apparently wants revenge; so Charlie and Adam have to combine to keep Miranda safe from him. Meanwhile, Charlie has intervened in the punishment of a young child, Mark, by his mother, and suddenly finds the boy coming to be with them, adding to the plot's complexities.This may sound like the basis for an amusing domestic comedy, but McEwan takes these twists in dark and intricate directions. Underlying this all are the major questions the author forces us to confront: how can the interaction of human and artificial intelligence be sustained, given the passions and emotions that mark human beings? what can be done to counter the economic damage to jobs and incomes for many that AI may bring? what will happen to children growing up in this unsettled context?As usual, McEwan writes superbly, his plot unfolds in unexpected and surprising ways and his characters engage you -- in this case, particularly the character of Adam as he discovers that other AI beings like him are becoming depressed and self-destructing.I enjoyed this book very much, and recommend it highly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 09, 2019","Nov 11, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42086795-machines-like-me

I woI've read this powerful novel before, but I wanted to re-read it before reading Atwood's latest novel, the sequel to this book, ""The Testaments."" I would recommend doing that since it gave me reminders and clues that helped navigate and fully appreciate the new book.This was the first of Atwood's dystopian novels (followed later by the ""Oryx and Crake"" trilogy which focused more on environmental dangers.) As such, it recounts how the United States government is overthrown and a religious fundamentalist rule established that disempowers women and reduces many of them to breeding machines. The novel is a grim satire, drawing out parallels with anti-abortion crusades of the time -- the book was published in 1985. Some women (the Aunts) even help in this abuse of women's freedom, just as there were women leaders working against equality at the time.Against this backdrop, Atwood writes a fine story of one individual Handmaid, Offred, and her history (including her attempts earlier to escape to Canada and her loss of her young daughter when she and her husband were captured,) her relationships with the Commander's family she is forced to join, her ties to Nick (the family chauffeur,) and her ultimate effort to escape again. Atwood leaves the conclusion ambiguous which provides a bridge to ""The Testaments,"" written years later.This book has, of course, now become a fine TV series and is seen as a major marker in the battle for women's equality in the US and elsewhere. Re-reading it, I am struck even more by the skill with which Atwood traces her dystopia -- and by the depth of the human characters she creates. It is no wonder that the novel has become one of the most popular and striking fiction achievements of its era. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,"Oct 19, 2019not set","Nov 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/941645.The_Handmaid_s_Tale

The lawless nature of Sicily comes through (with kidnappings and ransoms common,) the prominent role of the church and challenges to it, as well as the harsh climate of heat and aridity that shape the island.Donnafugata is the Prince's joy, his country house where he lives in feudal-like relations with the surrounding peasantry. And the heart of the book is the love affair that progresses there between Tancredi (who had been a soldier in Garibaldi's forces) and Angelica, the daughter of the merchant who gradually forms an unlikely friendship with the Prince.What is especially interesting is that the structure of this book has been echoed by Price in his new novel -- complete with the deaths of the principal characters, and then a concluding section called ""Relics"" that ties the final stages of the story together.Don Fabrizio is not necessarily an appealing character, but his story and his relationships are fascinating -- and the history he lives through has shaped modern Italy.

But earlier in his career as a CBC journalist he reported on the violence affecting Lebanon in the early 1980's and this book seems rooted in that experience.Published in 2017, it hearkens back to the massacre of over one thousand Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Shatila camps, carried out by the Phalangist (Christian) militia with the co-operation of the Israeli forces that had invaded the country. Pierre Cormier, now a prominent resource lawyer in Toronto, was implicated in that militia but broke with it over these events and came to Toronto as a refugee (via Cape Breton.) But he has not been able to escape his memories, and finds some relief in visiting a small east end cafe where he trades recollections with Ari, an Israeli who was also, Pierre believes, involved in that tragedy.From these starting points, this book heads in various engaging directions -- exploring the role of Canadian security agencies in tracing Islamic terrorists in Canada, following Pierre's difficulties with an Asian mining project where protestors have been killed and recounting the efforts of Cyril, Pierre's son, who is starting out as a TV journalist, to discover why his father disappeared in an explosion on his small boat.The plot is intricate, the characters are fascinating, the writing (as always with MacIntyre) is excellent -- and the result is a fine if complicated novel.

On sThis superb novel has just been awarded the Booker Prize for the best English-language fiction of the year and it much deserves this recognition. On so many levels, it is a powerful testimony to Margaret Atwood's abilities as a writer and insights as a social critic.The book is a sequel to Atwood's earlier work, ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" but structured much more imaginatively and aimed more broadly at understanding the ways that tyranny can be established -- and at the ways it sows the seeds for such abuse of power to ultimately be challenged and overcome. Like the earlier book, it portrays the ways that patriarchal religious and political norms can be used to diminish and oppress women, but it also presents a hopeful and rebellious paean showing women fighting back against that oppression.The novel is presented in the form of entries in an underground account by one of the more fearsome women characters in ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" Aunt Lydia, outlining how the regime originally undercut the position of women and forced some to become collaborators in organizing ongoing female abuse. This is interspersed with testimonials from witnesses talking about their lives as women -- including a young daughter (Agnes) in the home of one of the powerful male Commanders and another young woman (Daisy) growing up in Canada and dealing with women refugees who had escaped from Gilead.At first, it seems that these ""testaments"" are disconnected, and it is hard to relate them back to ""The Handmaid's Tale."" But skillfully, in a beautifully constructed and intricate plot, Atwood weaves their stories together. In the process, this novel moves from social critique to a driving suspense thriller.I re-read ""The Handmaid's Tale"" just before reading this novel, and that helped me pick up on clues and signals that provide the continuity with the first book that is so finely crafted by Atwood. By the time the plot matures and the main characters have been fully developed, the reader will be deeply engaged.In the age of Trump and other right-wing zealots, this book is a dramatic warning about how liberty can be lost -- with women paying the highest price. But it is also a stirring saga of how fighting back can and will occur.Congratulations to the Booker Prize judges for 2019 for insisting that this novel be one of two to share the award. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 23, 2019","Oct 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42975172-the-testaments

This affected his later relationship with his wife, Alessandra (known as Licy,) a Latvian aristocrat who studied psychiatry with Freud. But far more damaging was World War Two when virtually all his possessions were destroyed by American bombing.This novel finds Lampedusa falling ill with emphysema in 1955, and finally deciding he must leave some legacy behind before he dies -- and that is the motivation for setting to write the vast historical novel based on his great grandfather's support of Garibaldi's unification campaign in the mid-1800s. The changes spurred by this campaign in isolated Sicily become paralleled by Lampedusa's own experiences of change in the twentieth century.This novel provides a beautifully-written and sensitive account of the many stages of Lampedusa's life -- his youth, his wartime capture and imprisonment in Hungary, his longterm love affair with Licy, his adoption of a son and, of course, the complexities of writing a powerful novel -- and then the frustrations of getting it published. As several critics have written, there's not much plot, but there is a multi-layered and magnificent analysis of the life of this writer, of the changes that transformed Sicily and all Italy, and of the challenge of confronting aging and mortality.This novel has now been named to the short-list to win the 2019 Giller Prize for Canada's best writing in English fiction -- the same award won by Steven Price's wife, Esi Edugan, in 2018.

The first long section charts the love affair from the perspective of Mason; then the second section presents some of the same developments from Lena's viewpoint. This makes for a skillful and dramatic novel, particularly as the trends in Lena's changing character become evident.In the end, this is a sad and emotional book.

This is a particularly harrowing addition to her list.Based on actual events that took place inMiriam Toews has written a number of excellent novels. This is a particularly harrowing addition to her list.Based on actual events that took place in a Mennonite farming colony in Bolivia, the book recounts the conversations among eight women as they decide how to respond to evidence that eight men from the community have been raping hundreds of women, including children, after first using an animal anesthetic to make them unconscious. These men have now been arrested and are in jail, but the rest of the men are away seeking to finance bail for the eight. In this brief period, the women are debating whether to leave to protect themselves and their children or to confront the men when they return and try to lead them to change.The varying views expressed with such heat and humour are being recorded by the village school-teacher, a literate man named August, who had originally left the colony when his parents were exiled, but has now returned -- partly because of his feelings for Ona, one of the most thoughtful of the women. Gradually, with gaps and hesitations -- and lots of Bible references -- a consensus is reached.This is a novel with an authentic feel to it and insights into male-female relationships that give it extra force. The dialogue is vigorous, sometimes ribald, and always engaging. Toews comes from a Mennonite community (in Manitoba) and is very much at home probing the intricacies of the religion and its ways of thinking.As always, this author writes superbly, and has crafted a sometimes appalling but fascinating story that will keep you reading right to the end to find out what happens and why....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 09, 2019","Sep 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40046077-women-talking

This novel, from 2004, is no exception.The title of the novel refers to a pack of wild dogs in a nearby forest that stick together and molest farm animals such as lambs -- leading to anger from nearby farmers. But that is not really what the book is about. It is instead a study of human relationships. Six people come together on the edge of the woods each night; each has lost their pet dog to the pack, usually because of a betrayal of someone close to them who underhandedly released their dog to run with the wild pack.The six gradually form close relationships among themselves -- two become lovers, one provides shelter to another, others become dependent on the support of the group as they call out to their dogs, trying to entice them back. The novel builds these ties, section by section, making for a cumulative structure to the book that I found very effective. The first section focuses on Alice, a working class young woman who leaves her partner because he gave away her dog; the second focuses on Jamie, the teenager who Alice eventually has to protect from his mistakes; the third is tied to Lily, a mentally unstable girl who, devastated by the loss of her dog (given away by her parents,) eventually goes into the woods to try to join the dog pack; the fourth covers Spencer, one of the hunters who goes into the woods to try to eliminate the wild dog pack; Malcolm and Walter provide the next two sections; then Rachel is the focus of the last section, tying the plot back to Alice in the end.This is a powerful book, with moments of high suspense and violence, and other moments of love and caring. And as always with Humphreys it is written exquisitely.

An eccentric, hyper-focused genetic scientist, Don Tillman, launches a questionnaire to find a wife -- and collides with Rosie Jarman, who is seeking her genetic father. Both misunderstand each other's goals, leading to much humour and eventual love.This book, ""The Rosie Result,"" is the final volume in the trilogy, as the couple return to Australia after some years in America, bringing with them their young son, Hudson. It is just as engaging as Simsion's first book, but in a different and deeper way. Hudson has many of the eccentricities of his father, and has trouble at school as a result. Meanwhile Rosie is experiencing gender discrimination with her new job at the high-profile research institute that the couple came back to Australia for. And Don is running into social-media attacks for his genetics-based views on racial differences. Simsion intertwines these challenges well and traces sympathetically how the three returnees maintain their relationships and cope with a new environment -- with a lot of help from friends and relatives.Unlike the first volume, there is a good deal of interesting discussion of autism and the high-functioning form of that (Aspergers) that affect both Hudson and Don. This is also a more multi-textured book, with insights into the complexities of family relationships and friendships. The first volume had me laughing out loud; this book is more thoughtful and reflective.Both books are excellent, though (more so than volume 2 in the trilogy.)

This powerful novel, however, is excellent.Based mostly in Mozambique and Tanzania, it is a penetrating story of Po, born an albino African, and her troubled life in the face of hunters of body parts cut from people like her, since these are supposed to overcome illness or other afflictions. Arranged as interviews with a Brazilian journalist, Po recounts her childhood, how she had eventually to flee into exile from her Tanzanian birthplace, her love affair with Ezequiel -- an adopted outsider like herself (who had been kidnapped by an armed band that burned the church community where he lived,) and her work to establish a refuge for other albino Africans in Mozambique.This is an emotionally deep novel, not just because it portrays the grim realities that albino Africans experience in East Africa, but also because it brings alive the conflicted and caring characters within its pages. Po becomes more than a tragic figure with her intelligence and courage portrayed vividly; Ezequiel escapes as a refugee to Toronto but in so many ways can never leave behind his tormented past; the Brazilian journalist also has his challenges as he tries to convey Po's situation yet does not entirely win her trust.I enjoyed this book immensely. It captures realities of Tanzania and Mozambique that I have seen. But at the same time it shows characters grappling bravely with their pasts and trying to build their futures without letting despair overwhelm them.De Sa writes very well, better than I remember in his past books.

This book, however, is an achingly probing, often sad memoir of her parents aging and death -- combined with a painfully honest reflection on her difficult relationship with them throughout her life.Hay's father, Gordon, was a school-teacher and then school-principal in the small towns and cities of southern Ontario, a man with a gift for teaching history but an explosive temper that led to physical punishments of erring students and to outbursts against his own four children. Despite Hay's prize-winning novels, he showed no respect for her. This made even more difficult the reliance he had to place on her as his wife declined into Alzheimer's.Hay's mother, Jean, was a more loving person with a fondness for her -- and a common commitment to creativity, in her mother's case via her work as an artist. But their relationship, too, had its complexities, as Hay resented her mother's not standing up to her father's bullying.Hay portrays in touching and evocative terms the decline of these two striking characters as they age and lose their capacity to care for themselves. She and her husband Mark become the two main stalwarts in caring for Gordon and Jean, shifting them to Ottawa and a seniors' residence close to themselves. Moving back and forth between chapters recounting the past and those describing her parents' decline, the memoir provides a deeply honest and touching story -- tracing how lives develop over time and the love that families build even as conflict and disagreement are taking place.This is an emotionally powerful book, treating aging and death in all its agony.

But I have never read as extraordinary and riveting a political book as ""Love and Courage"" by federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.It took me less than two days to finish and left me staggered by its brutal honesty and audacity. Singh is new to federal politics in Canada, and he has written a personal story of his life that will be searing for those who read it. It is in so many respects not really a political book at all -- there is no discussion of policy, nor of his record as a provincial MPP (and now MP.) It is as if Singh tears his heart out for all to see, saying this is the harsh reality that has formed me and this is the kind of man it has made me.What are the book's major themes?First, family. The book outlines the hard struggles his parents had to get medical credentials recognized after Singh's father immigrated from India to marry his mother. It took moving to Newfoundland then later to Windsor. And perhaps it was this long struggle that later drove his father to alcoholism, from which a young Singh then had to protect his sister, brother and mother. Yet family ties somehow endured through all this and are clearly at the core of Singh as a person.Second, racism. This book is a vivid and unsparing description of the realities of growing up brown in Canada -- from constant insults from white classmates (Windsor is not a gentle city) to regular police stops for no good reason. Again, though, Singh fought back with resolution, becoming a defence lawyer and working on behalf of those experiencing such racism.Third, Sikhism. Many Canadians (including myself) do not have a clear idea of Sikh history in Asia and the tenets of the Sikh religion. This book is excellent in remedying these gaps. Singh has been criticized for defending the Sikh community in India; but this book is unapologetic in outlining the abuses that Sikhs have suffered in that country. Singh also stresses his own religious convictions and what it means to him to leave his hair long and wear a turban, unlike his father.Fourth, love. Singh clearly believes that adoption of an affirmative hopeful approach can bring about positive change. He begins the book by recounting his encounter with a young white woman who was attacking him for supposedly advocating Muslim sharia law in Canada; his response was to echo his campaign slogan, ""Love and Courage,"" to the meeting of supporters and they were soon all shouting this as the response to the hateful anti-Muslim sentiment. This theme pervades the book as a whole.Love is not a new theme in Canadian politics. Jack Layton stressed it too. But Jagmeet Singh ties this sentiment to ""courage."" And this extraordinary book shows the man possesses that attribute in depth. Never have I seen a politician reveal the dimensions of his or her life so courageously.What will happen to Singh politically is hard to predict. The NDP faces major challenges in the 2019 federal election.

As this interesting book shows, however, its beginnings were much more haphazard and fIsrael has become noted for its effective intelligence service. As this interesting book shows, however, its beginnings were much more haphazard and frantic, as the newly declared state tried in 1947 and 1948 to overcome the hostility of Arab populations within the new country and in its neighbouring states.This book recounts the way that young Jews who had grown up in Arab communities were recruited to act as spies in the ""Arab Section,"" a small group that penetrated Lebanon, Jordan and Syria to assess Arab military preparations and sometimes to carry out sabotage missions. Drawing on interviews years later with the people who carried out this dangerous work, as well as archival sources, Friedman provides a vivid account of the challenges faced, the missteps sometimes made and the ultimate integration of the Section into a more mature intelligence service once Israel had survived its early battle with outside Arab armies.Capturing the difficulties that the new Israel had to overcome to survive is one of the strengths of this book. We are used to considering Israel now to be a powerful military presence but that was clearly not the case in 1947-48 as the new country struggled to obtain weapons and had to fight for its right to exist against well-armed Arab armed forces. These ""spies of no country,"" working underground before Israel was even proclaimed as a nation, helped to counter the Arab superiority in numbers and weapons.Of the twelve spies in the Arab Section, five were caught and executed -- so this was clearly not an easy task. Remembering their hazardous work, with all its complications -- and sometimes personality differences -- makes this a valuable book, very much worth reading.Nevertheless, I wish that Friedman had provided a somewhat wider framework, considering whether a more peaceful start to Israel could have taken place. The country has had to battle for its existence for over 70 years now. I wonder if those early years could have been resolved more peacefully, leaving fewer sources of recurring violent conflict in the future.

Bhima throws herself into several part-time servant jobs, but her ultimate escape from sudden insecurity comes via an unexpected partnership that she forms with an elderly and bitterly wry woman, Parvita, who was left homeless by her husband's death and betrayal, but now has a small space in the market from which she sells a few vegetables each day. This is an emotionally powerful novel, even more so than ""The Space Between Us."" Gradually,Parvita and Bhima come to share their secrets and the harsh fates that have hurt them. Illness, the needs of Maya for finances to finish her college degree, and their gradual success in building their market business all interact with Bhima's changing relationship with one of the part-time servant jobs she does, with what turns out to be pair of women in love with each other -- a tie that first appalls Bhima but she then gradually comes to accept and admire.The small-scale business success of Bhima and Parvita, combined with this interaction with Su and Chitra, plus Maya's graduation success from college, all tell us this is a Mumbai and an India undergoing considerable change -- where poverty is not as enduring and social relationships are becoming more fluid.I found the characters in this book even more fascinating than in the earlier novel, and the level of emotional impact even more powerful. Umrigar has become one of my favourite authors, and I shall look forward eagerly to her next book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 10, 2019","Apr 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35959168-the-secrets-between-us

Adam Shoalts has written ten fascinating chapters, If you think that Canadian history is boring and unexciting, this is the book to change your mind. Adam Shoalts has written ten fascinating chapters, each associated with a dramatic historical map from different periods -- from the Viking maps of their first connections with north-eastern parts of North America to the inland explorations of Champlain and other French explorers to the 1828 map of John Franklin tracing parts of the Arctic.Three aspects of these stories stand out for me. First, these people were intrepid, often eccentric, and amazingly determined in their efforts to map new areas and reach almost impossible objectives -- like crossing the Rockies to reach the Pacific Ocean (as Alexander Mackenzie and David Thompson did) or surviving harsh snows and ice to reach and explore the Arctic Ocean (as Franklin did.)Second, this defining of the north of a continent was very much a partnership with indigenous peoples. It is safe to say that almost none of these European explorers would even have survived their travels without the often extraordinary help they received from indigenous counterparts. And many of the insights that led explorers to the places they eventually mapped came from maps traced out by their indigenous partners. None of those maps survived to be in this book, but Shoalts pays tribute to them throughout this volume.Third, this book makes another fundamental point. ""Explorers make the first maps,"" writes Shoalts, ""but the final ones are usually made by armies."" The war of 1812-14 demonstrates this in the case of Canada. Without the fierce resistance of settler militia, their indigenous allies and a few British soldiers, Canada would have been annexed by the United States. A map outlining the grim battle lines that kept US forces contained in Fort Erie after their last invasion effort is one symbol of this struggle and its ultimate success.As history, this is an interesting book, with its remarkable characters and parallel maps -- though I would love to see the maps in larger presentations (perhaps through a cyber-connection to a website associated with the book.) Shoalts concludes with a final chapter that sees the wilderness as crucial to Canada -- and he mourns what he fears may be its passing. I hope he is wrong. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Apr 02, 2019","Apr 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33916288-a-history-of-canada-in-ten-maps

It is essentially a series of vignettes from the author's real life, and a discussion of how the people he meets come to be the inspiration for various characters in his books.These connections make for interesting reading, such as how he was inspired by the reality of Kim Philby (the senior British intelligence officer who betrayed his country and escaped to the Russia which he served;) Philby became the model for some of the traitors in the le Carré novels. Another British exile running a men's clothing enterprise in Panama became the inspiration for ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" -- a particularly fine book. And an intrepid woman he met became the inspiration for ""The Constant Gardener"" -- an excellent story of an aid worker in Kenya who fought against pharmaceutical corporation misdeeds in Africa.The other element that is intriguing about the book is the author's discussion of his own personal involvement as an agent in British intelligence. The author has sometimes claimed in the past that he spent so little time as an agent that it was irrelevant to his novels. But this book provides a much fuller portrayal that suggests his role was greater than previously admitted -- and also gives us insight into his own strong views about some figures such as Philby.My main problem with the book was the wide spread of the 38 vignettes and lack of any central theme in their selection. So lots of interesting anecdotes, but no real assessment of the value of the espionage world on which the author has concentrated over many years.That said, there are still some fine insights and striking incidents in this well-written book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2019","Mar 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29662443-the-pigeon-tunnel

Its political battles continue and the fierce debates rage on in its writing.But now a blunt and brave new generation is beginning to have its say, expressing both aspirations and disappointments with determined energy.Sisonke Msimang is a brilliant example of these trends. The daughter of an ANC guerrilla fighter and his hard-working Swazi wife, Sisonke grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, but then began a world-straddling set of experiences that took her to Kenya, then to Canada, back to Kenya, then to the US, finally to her homeland South Africa after Mandela was freed, and on to Mozambique -- always another country, as she developed her writing skills and deepened her critical analysis.This book is a starkly honest and insightful memoir of her life. It discusses her time as a university student in America, caught up in the black militancy of that period and disdainful of the African students who just want to get their degrees and return home. It probes deeply her relationships with her mother and father, and later with her own husband and children. And above all, it examines the South Africa to which she can finally return from exile -- the exhilaration of voting to elect Mandela President, the bitter frustration of Mbeki's failures over HIV-AIDS, the Rainbow Nation's harsh treatment of refugees from other countries (despite the support given her parents and other ANC activists by other African states during the liberation struggle) and the ongoing poverty that too many South Africans still suffer.This is a sharply political memoir -- but it is much more than that. It is a heart-wrenching story, too, of a young woman growing up in difficult and disconnected circumstances, the racism she encounters in a Canadian school and how her father cows the principal into countering it, the first love she experiences with a mentally ill man in America and its personal costs, and how returning from exile turns her eventually into an articulate voice for a new South Africa. It is a book that will engage you deeply and widen greatly your perspectives on Africa as a whole.Sisonke Msimang will write more in the future.

The latter's poverty and despair over his son's fate are gradually turning his body transparent, a metaphor for the ignoring of the poor by those in power, who are fixated on finding yet more of the oil that has made Angola rich.This novel is highly charged politically, and it is a scathing critique of the Angolan elite. But it also a rollicking sometimes ribald social document, portraying the drama and humour of day-to-day life in this bustling metropolis as people cope with challenges yet also get the most they can out of the zest and diversity of their throbbing city.Biblioasis is the Windsor-based publisher that has won increasing praise for its efforts to translate works from French Canada and from around the world.

It is a gripping anti-war story wrapped together with an idyllic love affair, and reflects Hemingway's own experience as an ambulance driver during the First World War in Italy.What struck me most in revisiting this classic were:a) The excellence of the writing. Later on Hemingway became preoccupied with stripping down his prose to make it as straightforward as possible, but in this book the novelist combines some fine description with believable dialogue to create a beautifully written work, conveying the grit and gore of war and the depth of the love between the two main characters.b) The strength of Hemingway's revulsion against the war. He stresses the damage to ordinary people and the way Italy's rulers exploited and betrayed those hundreds of thousands sent to die.c) The characterization of supporting persons. The dialogue with the Lieutenant's friends, the interplay with other nurses besides Catherine, the vignettes in restaurants and in the trenches -- all of this is played out with depth and atmosphere that make this book (in my view) one of the best that the author ever wrote.This all makes for a long book, especially compared to Hemingway's much later ""Old Man and the Sea."" But there is a raw authenticity to the novel that escaped some of the author's subsequent works.

Jean is a white American biologist studying the growing number of urban foxes in London, after earlier work on urban coyotes moving into the eastern US. Their meeting on a London bridge takes place entirely by chance, and yet their lives gradually become interconnected over the next few weeks -- partly around a search for a lost child who is Attila's nephew (who ran away when his mother was wrongly arrested for an immigration violation, after which her apartment was blocked off from her and the child) -- and partly around threats to Jean as she is following up fox activities in a light-night park.It is a complicated plot, with a number of disparate sub-plots that slow the book down at several points.

At the same time, it traces other parts of the ecology of the city as the spread of newly urbanized foxes and escaped flocks of parakeets engage Jean's attention.At its core, however, this is a book about violence and trauma -- both with respect to people and animals. Attila's experiences in conflict zones form part of this tapestry, and Jean's efforts to protect urban wildlife form another part.We often, Attila eventually concludes, feel that violent conflict will lead to trauma and suffering. But there is also a resilience among people -- and the urban foxes and coyotes that Jean studies. And this resilience can even result in happiness.Attila and Jean come to personify this themselves. Attila's tragic loss of the wife he loved hurts him badly but he carries on. Jean's marriage breaks up over her support for wild animals, leading to her move to London.

It is likely drawn from Leacock's insights into the rich and self-important of Toronto and Montreal (where he taught at McGill University.)While ""Sunshine Sketches"" combines affection with satire in recounting life in small-town Mariposa, this book is much fiercer in its sarcastic rendering of the urban wealthy. The rivalry between churches for prestige is especially harshly handled -- though the best chapter of all is at the end as the rich set themselves to fight for ""clean government,"" based around self-serving innovations to direct contracts and other favours to themselves.I remember finding this book an appealingly angry attack on inequality when I first read it -- but I now find the biting humour a little too heavy-handed to be effective.

Rival churches, treacherous steamboat outings, hotel struggles to keep their right to sell liquor and fierce local election battles all feature in this magnificent rendition of the times and temperament of small-town Ontario.

""Unsheltered"" is yet another fine book.At theBarbara Kingsolver has written many excellent novels (from ""The Poisonwood Bible"" to ""Flight Behavior."") ""Unsheltered"" is yet another fine book.At the heart of it is a single house, and the two families that live in it over a hundred years apart. Willa Knox and her husband Iano are the centre of a complicated contemporary family of two adult children, Iano's ailing and belligerent father Nike, and now suddenly a new baby thrust on them by the postpartum suicide of the wife of Zeke, one of those adult children. Thatcher Greenwood and his wife Rose, in the house over a century before, have no children, but an equally belligerent parent (the mother of Rose) living unhappily with them. What links the two families is that each of them is confronted by damage and building failures that are in the process of destroying the house -- and leaving them unsheltered.Within this basic framework, Kingsolver tells a series of remarkable and ultimately intertwined stories. Both Thatcher and Willa face a series of difficult challenges (the former as a science teacher committed to teaching science in the face of religious fundamentalism, and the latter as the organizer of support for Nike, the new baby and her children.) Both also are married, but one finds his wife failing him so he looks for understanding from an intelligent and scientific woman neighbour -- while the love between Willa and Iano is what helps her surmount her difficulties.Parallel to these themes is an environmental emphasis that pervades the book. Greenwood and his neighbour Mary Treat (a historical figure who was an early biology researcher interacting with Charles Darwin) spend some of their most powerful scenes together in outdoor research sites. Tig,Willa's daughter, influenced by time spent in Cuba, is passionate about the dangers of global warming and the need to adopt an anti-consumption philosophy of living. Some of the most striking scenes involving Willa see her disposing of years of possessions so that she and Iano can move to a small apartment as their house falls down around them.No spoilers, so I won't discuss how Kingsolver's excellent plotting plays out. But with such interesting characters and significant themes, this book kept me entranced right to the end. I recommend it strongly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2018","Nov 19, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/37959904-unsheltered

ThOverall, the 2018 Giller Prize short-list is one of the best, most diverse set of selections that I can remember -- great job, Giller jury members! There is a wide range of genres, a good mix of writers (three women, two men, with differing backgrounds) and a combination of settings both abroad and in Canada.For those of us who read our fiction in English, there is a particular treat -- a translation of one of the most popular Quebec French-language novels of recent years. ""Songs for the Cold of Heart"" by Eric Dupont (originally published in French as ""La Fiancee americaine"") is a sweeping saga that goes from Riviere du Loup in 1919 to New York, then contemporary Berlin and Rome, built around fascinating characters, sharp humour and an intricate and engaging plot. It's a long book (604 pages) and some of its format works better than other parts (I found the letters sent back and forth between two of the characters a little tedious at times.) But it is so sharp-edged and rooted in the cultural milieu of Quebec -- yet also able to capture the ethos of other parts of North America and Europe -- that I found the novel was a surprising delight to read.Who could ever forget ""Louis the Horse,"" Madeleine's father? Or Madeleine herself and her heartfelt partner Solange? And then her two sons, Gabriel and Michel, take this story far afield to Germany and to Italy. The book seems sprawling all out of shape, and then Dupont skillfully pulls it all back together to a more than satisfying if otherworldly ending.Congratulations to QC Fiction, the small Quebec publishing house that arranged this excellent translation and took on the challenge of promoting a Quebec classic in English Canada. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2018","Nov 16, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40120669-songs-for-the-cold-of-heart
