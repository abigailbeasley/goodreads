Richard Tebrick a""Lady Into Fox"" is a novella about a woman who undergoes an instant metamorphosis into a fox while she was walking with her husband. Richard Tebrick and Sylvia Fox Tebrick were newlyweds in love when this supernatural event occurred. To protect the transformed Sylvia from unwanted gossip, Richard fired the staff at his manor house. At first, Sylvia retained some of her human qualities wanting to dress up, play cards, and listen to music. But she became more and more foxlike, running after ducks and wanting to go out into the wild. Richard still loved his vixen wife. He wanted to protect her from the fox hunters in 1880s England, but she resented his control when she wanted her freedom. To find out more about what happened to Sylvia, the book can be read on Project Gutenberg.I enjoyed reading ""Lady Into Fox,"" and felt that it could be looked at in several different ways. The story has beautiful themes of loyalty, love, and marriage. There is also the issue of control of one's life, and a woman's desire for freedom since Sylvia wants her freedom when she became more foxlike. It was written in 1922 around the time of the fight for women's rights.Sylvia loved both her husband and her fox family, and Richard loved her in all her forms. This may be influenced by the author's own life. David Garnett was married to artist Rachel Garnett who did the beautiful woodcut illustrations for the book. But he was bisexual and was part of the Bloomsbury Group who often had open relationships.It's also interesting to compare the story to Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" whose family had a different reaction to Gregor's change into a new form. Is ""Lady Into Fox"" a horror story like Kafka's, an allegorical fantasy about love, or a reflection on the social climate at the time when it was written? It was a delightful story from any of these views. I read this with The Short Story Club from the collection ""Black Water: The Book of Fantastic Literature.""...more",Notes are private!,4,21,1,"Apr 03, 2024","Apr 06, 2024","Apr 03, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17885612-lady-into-fox

It's the last story in a series of interconnected short stories set in the Jewish quarter of Drohobycz.Joseph's family has gone through some hard times, and his father has been dying and reincarnated in other forms several times. His most recent transformation was into a crab or a large scorpion. The crab is constantly running around the house, crawling under doors, climbing the wallpaper, and the family feels on edge. Then someone intervenes in this strange situation.Everything in this story is surreal, and it makes one think about Kafka's ""Metamorphosis."" Does this weird story with absurd situations have a meaning? It could be a reflection on dying from a long illness such as Alzheimer's Disease or cancer with all the ups and downs of a terminal prognosis. The hourglass in the title of the collection also suggests death. The story could also refer to other ways we might transform in our lives, choosing new pathways to explore and reinventing ourselves.

His frienIn 1936, James Agee was sent to Alabama by Fortune magazine to write a story about the plight of tenant farmers during the Great Depression. His friend, photographer Walker Evans, traveled with him to photograph three families of impoverished tenant farmers in a rural area. The magazine article was not published, but the material was turned into a book in 1941.""Let Us Now Praise Famous Men"" opens with sixty-two of Evan's stark black and white photographs in unnumbered pages. Evans documents their gaunt, weary faces, their ragged clothing, and their rundown shelters. There is a feeling of strength and resilience in the eyes of the tenant families who are portrayed with dignity.James Agee, who was also a poet, wrote the text of the book in several styles. There are beautiful lyrical passages, journalistic descriptions, and stream of consciousness chapters where he often goes off topic. Agee was quite experimental and creative in his presentation with some parts of the book working better than others.In addition to writing about the tenant farmers, Agee also wrote about how the experience was making him feel. He struggled with the fact that he and Evans were spying on and possibly exploiting these tenant families for their own personal gain. It may have been good journalism, but Agee was revealing the intimate details of their lives to the general public.The tenant farmer has no land, no house, and sometimes lacks a mule and farming implements. The landlord gives him these in return for his share of cotton and corn. The tenant farmer will also owe the landlord for seed, fertilizer, and ration money that was advanced during the four months of March through June. The ration money usually runs out before the new crops are harvested so they go through some lean, hungry times unless they can find supplemental work at the sawmill or other employment. ""Let Us Now Praise Famous Men"" is an important work documenting both the 1930s and the struggle of the tenant families. ...more",Notes are private!,6,7,1,"Mar 29, 2024","Apr 10, 2024","Mar 21, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/243360.Let_Us_Now_Praise_Famous_Men

Goodness and evil are at the heart of the play, and the characters change over the course of the action. Lady Windermere hears gossip about her husband and another woman which sets up a series of reactions. The morality of the characters is ambiguous, and is handled in a humorous way.The Victorian era was a time of double standards in terms of morality. Women were judged in much harsher terms, and reputations could be lost very easily in an unforgiving society. Maintaining a good appearance was important.There are several mothers in the play. The Dutchess of Berwick is a helicopter parent that never lets her daughter finish a sentence. Mrs Erlynne was not a good mother in her child's early life, but sacrifices herself later. Lady Windermere is upset about a rumor, but Mrs Erlynne keeps her from doing something drastic by reminding her that her son needs her.Lord Darlington is a charming man who has great witty lines that also make us think about society:""It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.""""We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.""Oscar Wilde's writing is superb in this comedy of manners.

Somerset Maugham published the book. The story is about the three months when Niccolo Machiavelli worked as a Florentine diplomat negotiating with Cesare Borgia in Imola, Italy. Machiavelli later based his political book, ""The Prince,"" on the crafty Borgia, the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI. Borgia was fighting to control territory when Italy was a collection of city states and shifting loyalties.Maugham also includes some humorous episodes as Machiavelli manipulates people and makes elaborate plans in his quest to seduce the beautiful wife of his host where he is residing. Maugham took plot elements from Machiavelli's comic farce, ""The Mandrake,"" and wove them into ""Then and Now.""I would encourage readers to print out a map of the regions of Italy to get an idea of which areas are being fought over in 1502. In simple terms, France had influence in Naples, Milan, and some other northern provinces. Spain controlled some southern provinces in what is today's Italy. The Pope had influence in Rome and an alliance with the King of France. With the Pope's help, Cesare Borgia was trying to gain control of the city states in central Italy. He wanted an alliance with Machiavelli's Florence. Machiavelli and Borgia--both smart, devious men--were playing shrewd political games with each other.I found both Borgia and Machiavelli to be fascinating men, although I would not trust either of them.

The farce features two main male characters who adapt fictitious names whenever they want to get out of town to avoid social obligations or just have a good time. Their lies lead to many misunderstandings because both of the men have the same alias, and their new loves are women from each other's families.There's lots of upper-class social humor as the young people are evaluated for their suitability as potential mates by the imposing Lady Brocknell, the mother of Gwendolen. Wilde also plays with words that have a double meaning, the most obvious ones being Ernest and earnest. The three-act play was a delight to read with its clever satirical humor.

She was burdened with overwhelming grief and decided to go away to her inherited childhood home in rural Georgia.

Grief never goes away completely and Delia will never forget her daughters, but her new life has meaning and hope for the future.I've been reading the Goodreads s of author Sara Steger for years since her thoughts are always so perceptive and beautifully written.

Even though Civil Rights legislation had been passed, it did not lead to much advancement in the quality of life for black individuals. I was a little surprised that there was no mention about poor individuals, unable to afford college which gave a deferment, being drafted to serve in Vietnam.Memphis runs a small restaurant which the city wants to buy, but he's unwilling to sell unless he gets a good price. The people coming into Memphis' restaurant are on the edge economically with little opportunity for employment, and many have been exploited by white society. Some turn to Prophet Samuel who is charismatic and may make them feel better psychologically, but he spends their offerings on expensive items for himself. Aunt Ester has been alive since the first Africans were brought to North America by slave traders, and other people seek her advice. When they follow her advice to throw some money in the river so heaven will give them abundant returns, it may be that feeling confident and good about themselves brings good luck. Some people bet on the numbers, hoping for a big payout from the crime family that runs the betting. It's doubtful that any of the three strategies will help, but maybe it's a psychological boost and a reason to hope.They feel like they don't have the same access to the American Dream as white society. West's advice to Sterling about walking around with a small cup of dreams, instead of a ten-gallon bucket of expectations, says it all. A small amount of success will half fill a small cup, but won't be noticeable in a big bucket.An older man, Holloway, was also frustrated by black poverty: ""He give you three dollars a day for six months and he got him a railroad for the next hundred years. All you got is six month' worth of three dollars a day.""I found that there was more repetition in this play compared to others in August Wilson's Century Cycle, especially about Hambone wanting the ham for payment of his work painting a fence. While I enjoyed some of Wilson's other plays more, there is a lot to think about in this play--urban renewal, making changes, unemployment, injustice, lack of opportunity, death, and black leadership. 3.5, rounded up....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Feb 14, 2024","Feb 18, 2024","Jan 20, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1296122.Two_Trains_Running

It was a ramshackle neighborhood of African Americans who had migrated from the South, and Jewish immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe. They were all holding on to dreams of prosperity and equality.The book opens in 1972 when a skeleton and a mezuza were found in an old well. Then, the Depression-era characters of Chicken Hill and their activities are introduced--which were entertaining, but I wondered where the story was going. The threads all came together in saving a deaf boy from the horrors of the Pennhurst sanitarium. The book had wonderful characters such as Moshe, a Jewish theater and dance hall owner, and his wife, Chona, who ran the Heaven and Earth Grocery Store and always extended credit to anyone short of cash. African American Nate helped Moshe run his theater business while his wife, Annie, worked in the store. Nate's orphaned nephew, Dodo, had lost his hearing when a stove exploded. The state was trying to incarcerate Dodo in Pennhurst, a state school for people with disabilities where residents were abused and neglected.Even though the characters came from diverse backgrounds, there was a group in the Chicken Hill community who had good, kind hearts. Their friendships transcended racial or religious differences. The story is told with a big dose of honesty about racial prejudice and antisemitism, but it is also full of humor and hope for a better future. The book is worth reading if only to meet Dodo and his sweet friend, Monkey Pants. 4+ stars....more",Notes are private!,2,17,1,"Mar 13, 2024","Mar 18, 2024","Jan 17, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65678550-the-heaven-earth-grocery-store

While the first book was a YA story, this sequel is directed to adult readers. Gretel, the narrator, was twelve years old when her father was the commandant of Auschwitz, one of Hitler's death camps. At the present time, she is 91 years old and living in a luxury flat in London. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of the guilt she is carrying for the disappearance of her nine-year-old brother, and her family's association with the atrocities at Auschwitz. Gretel spent years on the move after the war ended--going to France and Australia before settling in London. Psychologically her past was always with her, and it affected her own relationships.The book raised lots of questions about guilt, complicity, moral obligation, and evil. Should anyone think that a twelve-year-old child had a real knowledge of what was happening in the camp, or any kind of power to change things? Are children guilty for the sins of their parents? Should people who lost loved ones in World War II or the Holocaust take vengeance into their own hands and hurt the families of the Nazis? Should Gretel have reported what she saw and identify the Nazis that worked at the death camp during the trials after the war--at a terrible cost to her own security?John Boyne is a good storyteller as the book alternates between her past and her present situation where 91-year-old Gretel suspects that a neighbor's son is a victim of abuse.

The book is a historical novel about Medieval times and the divisions in the Church. The author was a professor of semiotics as well as being an expert on the Medieval era. There is a puzzling labyrinth in the design of the library with signs and symbols that William and Aldo must follow to access a secret room. William is a scholar who recognizes the treasures that the library holds. He's also very observant as he tries to identify the murderer.While I was drawn first to the mystery, I found that the historical, philosophical, and religious aspects of the story were also fascinating. This was the time of the Inquisition with a search for heretics. Both the State and the Church had great power and enormous wealth, and the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV and Pope John XXII were rivals.While most of the book held my interest, there were parts with long descriptions or extended philosophical musings that dragged. There are also many religious Latin phrases in the text so the reader may want to consult an online site that has the translations for the book. I also found that my reading was enhanced by reading a few online articles of analysis since the erudite author includes details from many fields.

Each box contains a string whose length indicates the length of their life.The recipients have to decide if they want to open the box. Would they live differently if they found a short string instead of a long string? Would they or their partner choose to marry and have children if the string was short? Would long-stringers choose to live recklessly and spend their last years alive, but in a wheelchair or coma? Would the military and private companies be unwilling to invest in training short-stringers? Since short-stringers have nothing to lose, they might commit crimes. The public might want candidates for an important office to reveal their string status.The book follows a group of people who have to make decisions about how to live their lives. Sometimes the short string prompted people to live their life to the fullest, but others became depressed. Some religious groups believe in reincarnation or a heavenly afterlife so a short life might not upset some people.

That they have memories and secrets to tell.""On a hot Christmas Eve, Isabel Turner took her four children on a picnic by a swimming hole in the Adelaide Hills of South Australia. When a delivery man stopped by to water his horse, he found four of the family members dead and the baby was missing. The events of this tragic day in 1959 would have a profound effect on the lives of the Turners' relatives and the townspeople for several generations.In this dual timeline story, the book moves to 2018 when Jess Turner-Bridges gets a call that her grandmother, Nora, is seriously ill in a Sidney hospital. Nora had been upset recently, and had been spending time reading a true crime book about the Turner murders of 1959. Jess and her mother, Polly, had been kept in the dark about their extended family's tragic history. Excerpts from the book and Isabel Turner's diary give clues about the Turner deaths, and the connections between the members of the Turner family. Polly and Jess became closer as they worked together to unravel their family's secrets.The book had many possible culprits that might have either purposely or accidentally murdered the Turners. Although the book was a chunkster at 547 pages, the interesting characters, beautiful Australian locations, and suspenseful plot kept my interest.

After the death of her father and an abusive marriage, Mary Sen decided she had to leave Charleston with her two children. She headed for the Caney Valley to meet her father's cousins and find The Birches, her father's family home.It's a new way of life for Mary Sen, and she loves the simple joys of living close to nature, the physical work, and meeting her relatives. But there are also painful events that occur. Although Appalachia has its challenges, Mary Sen has found her refuge.The book is narrated by Mary Sen with humor and lots of heart. The author includes lovely descriptions of the Appalachian landscapes with its beautiful flora and fauna.

During the Black migration to the industrial North, former slaves/sharecroppers came looking for jobs and a new identity. The play incorporates African mysticism and spirituality. It would be very powerful on stage, especially the scene with the Juba song and African drumming.The titular Joe Turner is based on Joe Turney, a plantation owner who illegally enslaved Blacks in the early 20th Century. He was the brother of the governor of Tennessee, and rounded up Blacks for his chain gangs on minor charges like loitering or gambling. He lured Black men to crap games, then arrested them. Turner kept the men enslaved for seven year terms. A wife asking about her missing husband might be told, ""Haven't you heard about Joe Turner? He's been here and gone."" Black women originally sang the song about their missing men, and it was recorded by the blues singer, W C Handy.This is an excellent play with themes of identity, trauma, religion, inequality, and migration. Everyone has been looking for something--a home, a mate, a job, their missing family, religious faith--since Emancipation freed the slaves without a good plan for their future.

The main character is ""Fences"" is the August Wilson play set in the 1950s in his ten-part ""Century Cycle"" about the experiences of African-Americans. The main character is Troy, an illiterate but very hard working trash collector in Pittsburgh. Troy was an excellent baseball player when he was younger, but he never realized his dream of making it to Major League Baseball because he was too old when he was released after a fifteen-year prison sentence. Racial discrimination was also prevalent in MLB, although the color barrier was starting to be broken. The play revolves around Troy's relationships with his wife, his two sons, his best friend, and his brother.Conversations give us Troy's past history as the son of a stern, abusive father. Troy is a flawed man with a severe parenting style with no room for listening to his children's dreams - although he loved them in his own way. The epigraph of the play, poetry written by Wilson, is about the influence of fathers:""When the sins of our fathers visit usWe do not have to play host.We can banish them with forgivenessAs God, in His Largeness and Laws.""""Fences"" was a good choice as a title for the play. A fence can keep people out or enclose people in, emotionally and physically. That symbol is used many times in the play regarding relationships, Troy's time in prison, the baseball field, as a barrier from the Grim Reaper, and representing racial discrimination. I saw the 2016 movie years ago featuring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis which has excellent dramatic acting. Even just reading the play is a fine experience because Wilson's writing is so good.

It is a love story, but its focus is domestic violence.Lily, a florist, fell in love with Ryle, a neurosurgeon in Boston. Ryle was talented and charming in some ways, but there were red flags from the start that he might have an inability to control his anger. Lily grew up in a household where her mother stayed with her physically violent father. She did not want to repeat the cycle of abuse and make excuses for Ryle's behavior.A subplot (written as diary entries) goes back to Lily's teen years when she helps a homeless high school boy, Atlas. He didn't get along with his stepfather, so he was thrown out of the house. Atlas was Lily's first love and a man she can trust. When Ryle makes assumptions about Atlas and Lily, it provokes a confrontation.The story shows why many women stay with their abuser and keep giving them second chances. The women may be financially dependent, especially if they have children. They may also genuinely love the abuser when he is calm and happy, and believe him when he says the violence won't happen again.

The title comes from Dante's Inferno - ""Let us descend and enter this blind world"" - and the story tells about a hell on earth.Teenager Annis is the daughter of a North Carolina plantation owner father and a slave mother. Her grandmother was a warrior in Africa, and her mother passed down her knowledge of fighting and resilience to Annis. Their enslaver sells her mother first, and Annis later, to be marched on a long journey to the slave markets of New Orleans. The grief of separation, and the physical pain of the journey with the slaves roped together are overwhelming. Annis turns to the spirits of her ancestors and the spirits in nature. It is a way of coping to create another reality. Annis uses her own strength and the help of the spirits in her struggles.The first person narration by Annis adds to the intensity of the story. The descriptions involve all the senses so the reader gets a vivid picture. The connection with the spirit world worked well in this story, but I would have preferred less magical realism. The spirits gave Annis encouragement when it seemed like she had no one in the real world. The spirits in nature - the earth, the rain, the wind, and the water - lead Annis to a more hopeful place.

Enoch Soames was an unsuccessful writer, full of self-importance, who thought he was a great poet who hadn't been discovered.

Author Laurence Sterne was writing in the 18th Century, but he was using the technique of stream of consciousness that we usually associate with the modernists and postmodernists. The book has lots of bawdy humor so it's difficult to imagine that Sterne was an Anglican clergyman. Sterne was well-educated, and there are many references to the great minds of the time and to other literary works. The novel contains unusual visual techniques such as marbled and blank pages. Sterne loves to play with time, and the novel is full of digressions. The author's humor was influenced by Cervantes, Swift, Rabelias, and other earlier writers.The characters in the book have obsessions (called ""hobby-horses""). Tristram's father loves to quote philosophers, but often exhibits little common sense. His Uncle Toby is a military veteran who reenacts battles on his lawn with the help of his servant. Tristram is trying to outrun Death in the later chapters, battling the same tubercular disease as Sterne. He's using humor and fun so he can avoid thinking about his declining health. Tristram is an author who is writing the story of his life, including his European travels.This is not a book for everyone because it's filled with double entendres and digressions -- and digressions from the digressions! I feel that it would be most appreciated in an academic class, or in a group led by someone knowledgeable about Sterne's writing. I was fortunate to have read it with a group led by Erich, an 18th Century specialist, in The Dickensians.

Eugene had double diagnoses of autism and mosaic Angelman syndrome, a genetic disorder, and was nonverbal. Where was Adam, and should his family call the police?""Happiness Falls"" is a riveting read because it is much more than a mystery/thriller. Narrated by college-aged Mia, it's also a family story about her twin, John, and her parents who must consider Eugene's needs in every decision they make. The mother, Hannah, is Korean so the book also has themes about race and how people perceive those who have trouble communicating when they are learning a second language. The brainy Mia also gets access to her father's notebooks and finds that he has been doing a study on happiness--and using their family in the study. That's not the only secret that Adam is hiding.While this was a good mystery/thriller, it was the sections about neurodiversity and communication that were especially interesting. I was very impressed with the deep research that Angie Kim must have done to write this fascinating book. Readers that are just interested in reading a mystery might find that the tangents slow down the pace of the story too much. But on the positive side, all the medical, communication, and psychological tangents make a reader think about the challenges a nonverbal person faces with law enforcement officials as well as in their everyday lives. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Mar 05, 2024","Mar 09, 2024","Aug 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/175740783-happiness-falls

The privileged duo cling to the past, going through the same routine every day with the narrator enjoying French literature and the sister knitting. Noisy unknown intruders scare them, and they eventually feel so threatened that they eventually leave the house. It's a spooky situation since they kept hearing strange noises, and moved into smaller and smaller parts of the home before exiting.The story can be interpreted in several ways, including a political allegory. Author Julio Cortazar, a Professor of French Literature, was removed from his job at the National University of Cuyo by the Peron administration in Argentina in 1946, the same year that the story was written. A parallel can be drawn to the situation of the narrator, a lover of French literature, fleeing from unknown forces in the house. So while the story could refer to any mysterious intruders who want to remove the middle or upper class occupants, it can be interpreted in political terms. The brother and sister are choosing to avoid the unknown intruders since confrontation would be too dangerous.Other readers might see the story in a non-political way as a horror story, or psychological fiction about anything fearful. The brother and sister could even be ghosts of upper class people since their days seem so non-productive. It's interesting to see how many different ways you can look at this strange, but intriguing, story from Cortazar.The Short Story Club is reading this and the other tales in Black Water: The Book of Fantastic Literature....more",Notes are private!,2,23,1,"Aug 27, 2023","Sep 06, 2023","Jul 24, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/36430391-house-taken-over

The two sisters were sent away to the countryside around Oxford in 1939 to keep them safe during the bombing of London. This was part of Operation Pied Piper, and the girls were lucky to stay with Bridie Aberdeen and her son in a beautiful pastoral location. Then Flora disappeared by a river, but she was never found.Hazel had been living with grief and guilt, and had tried to find Flora for twenty years. A package came into the bookstore where Hazel worked that contained a fairy tale book composed of variations on the Whisperwood stories that Hazel created. This led to connections to important people in Hazel's childhood, and clues about Flora's disappearance.""The Secret Book of Flora Lea"" is a charming combination of fairy tales, mystery, romance, and historical fiction.

The personalities of the generals and the tactical reasons for their success or defeat in battle are all part of the narrative. Lack of information and compromised health of some of the leaders contributed to some bad decisions.Confederate General Lee was hoping to end the American Civil War with this battle, but the Union soldiers had seized the high ground. The book has excellent maps showing the positions of the various regiments over four days. The casualties during the three days of fighting were 23,000 for the Union and 28,000 for the Confederacy. The Battle of Gettysburg was fought on July 1-3, 1863 before the Confederate forces retreated. It's ironic that the conflict was just prior to July 4th, Independence Day, an American holiday which celebrates the independence of the United States from Great Britain. The American Civil War would continue for another two years.Even people who do not usually read military stories will enjoy this book since it's so character-driven.

She grew up in a traditionAnna May Wong was infatuated with silent movies as a young teen, and skipped her Chinese school to sneak off to the cinema. She grew up in a traditional Chinese-American family in California where her family ran a laundry. Her father disapproved of Anna May's dream of becoming a film star since he felt that she would be unable to find a good Chinese husband if she was an actress. But Anna May was as stubborn as her father, and she started by taking part in crowd scenes as a Chinese extra. It was difficult for Chinese women to find a leading part in a movie since California banned interracial marriage, and the Hays Code prevented an Asian woman from kissing a white actor in a film. She was cast mostly in roles like a murderous dragon lady, or a prostitute, or someone in an opium den in her early films. Non-Chinese actresses in ""yellowface"" played the leading roles.Anna May was beautiful with a sense of style, and she was photographed with outfits combining Western and Asian fashions. She also spent part of her career in Europe--Berlin, Paris, and London--where attitudes were more liberal. As she progressed in her career, she helped pave the way for better roles for Chinese actresses.The book is told in two timelines. In 1960, Anna May was traveling East to New York by train, and was reading her diaries as she travels. Her diaries and letters remind her of her younger years told in the second timeline.Anna May Wong had an interesting life story. But I was disappointed with Gail Tsukiyama's writing in this book as compared to her ""Color of Air"" and ""Samurai's Garden"" that are more lyrical. She may have been trying for historical accuracy, but it felt like every event in her life had to be mentioned instead of going into more depth during fewer events. However, I'm still glad I read the book for an upcoming book discussion since it gave insight into the challenges that Asians faced in the movie industry. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 29, 2024",Feb 2024,"Jul 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60792400-the-brightest-star

He lives by himself in a cottage at the town's cemetery where he is the caretaker. Blackburn has a good friend in town, Jacob Hampton, the only son of a prosperous family. Jacob was disinherited when he eloped with Naomi, a marriage that his parents considered to be under their social status.When Jacob is drafted to serve in the Korean War, he asks Blackburn to help the pregnant Naomi until he returns from the military. After Jacob is discharged with war injuries, his cruel parents cook up a plan to destroy their son's marriage.This is a story about friendship, love, loyalty, and small town living in the 1950s. Ron Rash's writing is superb, and the book's opening pages on the ice of a Korean river are unforgettable. Blackburn Gant is a wonderful character -- a dependable, capable loner that carries on despite the challenges life throws at him.

The sound of the bell came into the house but did not disturb it; it was quite used to death, and birth, and life.""Five generations of the Quin family have lived in China Court. Their home was named for the white clay in the English countryside which was used in making fine porcelain. The home seems like a character--an observer of both the happy and unhappy events in the family for over a century.The book starts with the death of Mrs Quin (from the middle generation) who has lived a long life. She leaves China Court, an old house with beautiful gardens, and her relatives wonder who will inherit the property.The novel takes us day by day from Mrs Quin's death through the reading of the will which has some surprising bequests, the funeral, the inventory of the house which holds some secrets, and ending when the heirs take possession of China Court. Through it all, the history of the family is also told. The stories about the servants are as fascinating as those about the family.Each chapter begins with a quotation from the Book of Hours of Robert Bonnefoy, an antique book loved by Mrs Quin. This book of prayers is going to prove to be important late in the story.I loved Rumer Godden's descriptions of the house, the gardens, and the characters. The book begins in the mid-19th Century when the daughters had very different lives and expectations compared to the sons in the family.

The descriptions in the book of this mountainous area in the northern Indian subcontinent are beautiful, and the misunderstandings between the British family and the locals seem authentic.In the story Sophie is widowed, and has very little money left after paying off her deceased husband's debts. She rents a house in Kashmir and plans to live a simple life. The locals assume she is a rich woman, and take advantage of her ignorance by overcharging her for everything and stealing from her home. Sophie misjudges situations, including the animosity between the Hindus and the Muslims. Although the book starts slowly, the second half picks up when Sophie and her daughter each find themselves in dangerous situations.I loved the other three Rumer Godden novels I have read, but it took me longer to warm to this story. Most of the characters were unreliable or dishonest, partly due to extreme poverty. Sophie created many of the unfortunate situations because she was idealistic, would not listen to advice, and didn't use good judgment. Her daughter, Teresa, seemed to understand their precarious situation but her mother did not take her seriously. So even though Godden's writing was lovely, it was frustrating to read about a woman who made one questionable decision after another. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,3,19,1,Nov 2023,"Nov 17, 2023","May 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17248721-kingfishers-catch-fire

It's similar t""A Fugue in Time"" is an experimental novel where Rumer Godden interweaves the lives of three generations of a family in a London house. It's similar to the way that themes in a fugue repeat and intertwine. The author pretends that she is in an airplane over the house watching everything that has happened during a 99-year lease of the home. The book is mostly written in the present tense, but it's not confusing after the reader knows when the various characters were born and died.The characters are very well-written, especially the smart, talented female characters restrained by society's expectations. Griselda is presented in depth as a Victorian woman trapped by her role of the wife and the mother of a large family, but wanting to see the world beyond her family. Many of the servants are the young relatives of the older servants so there is continuity there too. The large house is an important character - a solid shelter that has seen it all and knows everyone's memories and secrets. There is a garden with a plane tree whose roots run under the house. The youngest son, Rolls, thinks of himself as part of the plane tree with his roots also attached to the house. He's haunted by memories of what could have been, and wondering what will come next when the 99-year lease ends.I enjoyed reading a book that plays with time in an experimental way. I've loved Rumer Godden's characterizations in her other books, and this was no exception.

Teofilo is part of that cycle, and the Pueblo have a traditional prayer asking the spirits of the deceased to send rain clouds to their dry land.

Norma Jean has been becoming more independent, exercises, and is learning new skills. The Women's Movement is gaining importance in the 1960s and 1970s. Leroy is having difficulty realizing how many changes have been taking place in their town while he's been on the road during the last fifteen years. He wants to build a log cabin home, a return to the past, but Norma Jean has no interest in that. The story has an ambiguous ending as the couple visits Shiloh, the site of an 1862 Civil War battle with many casualties, but no victor. Author Bobbie Ann Mason includes many references to pop culture in this story, giving it a strong sense of time and place. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jun 05, 2023","Jun 09, 2023","Apr 22, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/42417084-shiloh

Story A is a typical romance with no problems and a ""happy ending."" In stories B and C, there are variations of unrequited love and a woman with low self-esteem, typical of a soap opera. Story D has a natural disaster in the plot. In version E, the couple is challenged by illness.

Their parents are grateful for their help picking the cherries since their work force is small during the pandemic. Lara feels happy surrounded by her daughters and kind husband, and is experiencing a much more peaceful summer than the one she spent acting in summer stock on Tom Lake.As Lara and her daughters pick cherries, she tells them the story about dating an actor, Peter Duke, who was also in the cast of ""Our Town"" when she played the female lead actress. Duke was handsome and charismatic, but he used and manipulated people as he climbed his way to being a Hollywood star. The summer on Tom Lake was painful in some ways, but Lara also made some wonderful connections that changed her life.Author Ann Patchett skillfully wove together the past and present stories of Lara's life. The characters in the cast of ""Our Town"" are wonderfully created, and there are some surprises in the life of young Lara as she experiences the fire of a first love. However, some things are too hurtful to reveal to her family, and will always remain a secret in Lara's heart.The three daughters each have their own unique personalities and their own imagined ideas of what might have happened during their mother's coming-of-age years. While the cherry farm along the shore of Lake Michigan sounded beautiful, the cherry picking was presented in a more idyllic way than I would regard the hard work of bringing in a harvest. There is a quiet tenderness in the way Lara relates to her husband and daughters, and a deep appreciation for the family history surrounding the cherry farm. Lara is a woman who loves the serenity of her present life.

African-""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is a play in August Wilson's ten-play Century Cycle with each work representing a decade of African-American life. African-Americans were migrating to Northern cities such as Chicago and New York in the 1920s. This play is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927, and the historic Blues singer, Ma Rainey, is planning to record an album with her band members. The producer and agent are white, and Ma Rainey knows she has to get what she wants before signing any release forms. The title comes from a real Blues song, ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" about a popular dance of the era, the Black Bottom dance.While the band members wait for Ma Rainey, they tell stories of their lives. Some of the older African-American men do what they can to survive. But a younger member, Levee, is restless and wants to play a newer style of music - a jazzy improvisatory version of the song. Levee also has more anger because of how his family was treated by some prejudiced white men. The play starts off slowly, but builds into a tragic moment of rage.""White folks don't understand about the blues. They hear it come out, but they don't know how it got there. They don't understand that's life's way of talking. You don't sing to feel better.

The third book of the Harold Fry trilogy revolves around Maureen, Harold's wife. The trilogy started when Harold went on a pilgrimage to visit his friend, Queenie, in a hospice. Years earlier, Queenie had made a memorial garden by the sea using found objects washed up by the ocean in combination with greenery and flowers. One part of the garden was dedicated to David Fry because Queenie regretted that she was unable to help the young man who committed suicide.Maureen has never forgiven herself that she did not see how deeply troubled David was before he took his own life. She makes a journey by car to northern England to visit Queenie's garden which is now maintained by volunteers, and has no idea of how she will react emotionally. Maureen is a difficult woman who always found it challenging to relate to other people, but her journey is one of forgiveness and hope for the future.While I did not enjoy this book as much as ""The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry"" or ""The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy,"" I'm glad I read it.

Their fellow officers were commanded by Emperor Hirohito to execute the rebellious officers. Shinji was good friends with some of the rebels so it would be against his personal moral integrity to execute his friends in the Imperial Army. He also feels loyalty to the Emperor.

The story is told in alternating chapters by two women who are both pregnant, but very different in other ways. Meg is married to a TV journalist, has two beautiful children, and writes a mommy blog about her idealized life. Agatha reads Meg's blog, but she comes from different circumstances. She's working stocking shelves at a grocery story, and her boyfriend was deployed by the Royal Navy.The author introduces us to the backgrounds of the two women in the first 50 pages or so. Then, the story gets progressively more sinister. Meg is hiding a secret, and Agatha does not have a good grasp on reality. Even though the author is a man writing in the voices of two women, Michael Robotham does a great job of getting into their heads. Although crimes are being committed, Agatha's traumatized life makes the reader have some sympathy for her.

The book goes back and forth in time as it tells the tales of seven generations of women from 1836 to 2086. Afong Moy was the first Chinese woman who came to the United States. She was brought by merchants to entertain with her singing, and be stared at by people who had never seen bound feet. The book also features Lai who lived during the San Francisco plague in 1892; Zoe, a student at an experimental English school in 1927; Faye, a nurse during World War II; and Greta, an executive who invented a dating app in 2014 Seattle. There were two woman living in the future: Dorothy, a poet with severe depression in 2045 Seattle, and her daughter, artistic Annabel in 2086.Ford has taken the field of epigenetics--where environment and behaviors can affect gene expression--and added speculative fiction to the idea. While I don't totally understand epigenetics, it basically means that while our DNA remains unchanged, certain genes can be turned on and off to produce proteins (gene expression). These proteins can change our predisposition to diseases, and affect learning, memory, emotions, social behavior, etc.The first part of the book was wonderful with interesting characters and fascinating moments in history. But the reader has to suspend disbelief in the end of the book about an experimental epigenetic treatment. It's all done very creatively with little science and lots of Zen.

The operators had to manually connect the callers with cables and plugs on large switchboards. The women had to translate messages as General Pershing's American Army communicated with the French Army. They also had to translate so the Army could obtain supplies from French merchants. This was a demanding detail-oriented job that was performed much faster by the women switchboard soldiers than the men they had replaced.The book focuses on three women and their friends. Grace Bankers, who kept a wartime diary, was an actual telephone operator and a recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal. Marie Miossec, a talented vocalist, and Valerie DeSmedt were fictional main characters. The women were often in danger -- from German U boats as they crossed the Atlantic, from shelling, and from the Spanish Flu. The book alternates chapters devoted to Grace, Marie, and Valerie.The book was heavy on historical detail, and picked up after a slow start. Some of the women were moved near the front lines, and were very involved in translating during important military battles. The camaraderie among the operators was important since they were working under pressure and living in primitive housing.After the war, the telephone operators were denied the benefits that the men in the Signal Corps received. In 1977 President Jimmy Carter signed a bill officially recognizing them as military veterans, but the majority of the women were no longer alive.

The narrator, Antonio Yammara, was walking with an acquaintance, Ricardo Laverde, when he was caught in the crossfire that targeted Laverde. After Yammara's long recovery from his wounds, he was left with symptoms of PTSD and found it difficult to leave his home to teach at a law school. He feels the need to learn all he can about Laverde's life. Through conversations with Laverde's daughter, examining correspondence, and listening to a secret recording, Yammara unearths why Laverde walked away from a life of promise.Author Juan Gabriel Vasquez skillfully weaves in Colombia's history as Yammara and Laverde's daughter untangle their family histories. Air crashes, political candidates gunned down, and drive-by shootings were everyday news for the generation born in the 1970s. The drug trade was an enticing way to make some quick money.

Albert Camus considered himself to be a French Algerian. He could see the point of view of the native population who were struggling against the violence of French colonialism. But he also worried about the lower-class French settlers, the pieds-noirs (black foot), if Algeria became totally independent of France. He found he could not totally support either group.There are similarities between Camus and his kind character, Daru, regarding choice and trying to remain neutral. An Arab prisoner was left in the charge of the schoolteacher, Daru, who decided to let the prisoner make a choice about his outcome. With either choice, some group was going to be angry and retaliate against Daru. The Arab prisoner might be living under a different code of honor in his village compared to the laws set up by the French court, but would be sentenced according to French law. The Arab might also feel an obligation for Daru's hospitality. The story showed the difficulty of making moral choices, the concept of honor, and how the world is often an absurd place where one cannot be neutral. ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jan 30, 2023","Jan 30, 2023","Jan 21, 2023",,Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/205984.The_Guest

Dearest to her heart, she was also the mother of three daughters. Marital happiness evaded her in four marriages, sometimes because she married too quickly after meeting the men.Her father, C. W. Post, believed in girls getting a good education, and that women had a place in the business world. After he died, Marjorie continued to take an active role in the cereal company and expanded it by buying Birdseye frozen vegetables and many other convenience foods so that women did not have to spend most of the day in the kitchen.The two things I found most fascinating were her extensive philanthropy, and her collection of art which is now part of the Smithsonian at her Hillwood Estate.

The characters had no names or descriptions other than the old man, the older waiter, and the younger waiter. The Spanish cafe had tables under a shadowing tree, but no other descriptions. The old man had tried to commit suicide the previous week, and spending his evening at the cafe may be easing his suffering. The younger waiter had a full life, but the older waiter did not want to go home to his lonely room.It's a bleak story about emotional darkness, loneliness, and the lack of meaning in life. The older waiter rejects any religious faith and says, ""Our nada who art in nada, nada be thy name. . . "" (nada=nothing in Spanish) The only way to keep the depression and darkness away, and to bring some meaning into a meaningless life was to spend time in a clean, well-lighted cafe.Hemingway had seen destruction and carnage during World War I, and was wounded when he was an ambulance driver. Hemingway's father killed himself with a gun in 1928. Depression and mood swings ran in the family, and Hemingway himself committed suicide in 1961. The Great Depression with the stock market crash of 1929 was the cause of depression and suicide of many who lost all their savings. It's no wonder that emotional darkness, despair, and the meaningless of life were themes of this story published in 1933.

Elizabeth Zott is a research chemist in the early 1960s when it was groundbreaking for women to work in the sciences. She has a boss who steals her work, and treats her like a lab tech.Eventually Elizabeth finds she's a single mother without a job, and needs to put food on the table. She takes a job on a TV cooking show, but presents it on her terms, encouraging women to pursue their interests and teaching them about the chemistry in meal preparation. The show is an amazing success, but Elizabeth knows that she is not following her own advice about women following their dreams.The book does have some male characters that underestimate women or are sexual predators. But the story is not anti-male, and has some very caring, supportive men as well. It has a cross-section of people just like real life. Love and caring are important themes - Elizabeth's love for her soulmate and fellow chemist, the love of a parent for a child, and the love of an amazingly smart dog for his family. The dog, named ""Six-Thirty,"" won my heart with his emotional intelligence and loyalty.The hot pink American cover of the book has a bit of a Barbie vibe.

He's so upset that he wants to set down on paper his story about driving two young giraffes across the United States.Woody had survived the dust storms in 1938 in the Texas Panhandle. The orphaned 17-year-old boy went to New York City to see if his surviving relative could help him. He was on the docks when a boat, battered by the Hurricane of '38, docked with two young giraffes. They had been rescued in Africa after a trapper left them to starve. Their herd was gone and the small giraffes would have been lunch for the lions soon. The San Diego Zoo had sent a special padded truck to transport the animals.Woody was fascinated by both the giraffes and a pretty young photographer who dreamed of selling her work to Life magazine. When the driver was fired, Woody stepped in to help the old man, Riley Jones, who was supervising the delivery.This is a coming-of-age book as well as an appreciation of the animals which grace our planet. The trip across the country was fraught with difficulties such as windy mountain roads, low bridges, a flash flood, and an evil director of a circus. However, with the help of strangers who were enchanted with the giraffes, Woody and Mr Jones arrived in San Diego. Both of the men were ""giraffe whisperers"" who knew how to calm down the animals.

The book tells the story of the Mayfair family of witches through the centuries starting in Scotland, moving to Haiti, and finally spending most of the book in New Orleans. Suzanne Mayfair called up a demon, Lasher, when she was burned at the stake in the 1600s. The supernatural Lasher is devious and seductive. He has an important wish that he wants Rowan Mayfair, the thirteenth witch, to fulfill. Rowan is a brilliant neurosurgeon who has used her special powers for healing, but under Lasher's influence, she wonders if she is also capable of evil.Rowan and her lover, Michael, move into the Mayfair's decaying haunted house in New Orleans when she inherits the Mayfair legacy. Michael is a contractor who wants to bring the old mansion back to its former beauty. The house has a history of unexplained accidents, dead bodies, and sightings of the supernatural spirit.""He didn't want to confess to Rowan that he couldn't shake an underlying apprehensiveness, an underlying certainty that they were being watched. That the house itself was something alive. Maybe it was only the lingering impression of the images in the attic . . . But the place had absorbed the personalities of all the Mayfairs, hadn't it, as old houses are supposed to do.""An organization called the Talamasca studies supernatural phenomena around the world. Aaron has been investigation the Mayfair witches for years, and has shared information about their history with Michael and Rowan. But nothing can really prepare them for their encounters with the demon Lasher.Anne Rice's writing is colorful and sensuous.

Now Annaleise, a neighbor, has disappeared and the police are questioning the same people. The small town gossip is starting again.""I need to talk to you. That girl.

He loves a public house with a Victorian atmosphere, beer mugs with handles, open fires, inexpensive meals, motherly barmaids, drought stout, and no radio so people can converse. As usual, Orwell is very particular about his likes and dislikes in a humorous way! His ideal pub even has a garden so families can enjoy going out together. Orwell gives us a surprise about the location of this wonderful pub. During the pandemic, a pub-style restaurant by a river with outdoor dining became my favorite lunch place. So I really like Orwell's idea of serving pub fare in a garden atmosphere. But I would prefer a glass of wine over Orwell's stout. I also like the name of Orwell's pub - I can picture the reflection of the moon in the river near my favorite pub-style restaurant.The JD Wetherspoon chain of pubs in the UK has named some of its locations ""The Moon Under Water"" in recent years.

It foreshadows Lucrezia's life as the wildest and most willful sister, and later feeling like a caged animal after a forced marriage to Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara. Noble marriages were used to cement 16th Century political alliances. Women were viewed as objects of pleasure and expected to produce male heirs. Although not much is known about Lucrezia, the daughter of Cosimo de' Medici, author Maggie O'Farrell has written an imaginative book about court life in Florence and Ferrara. She has also given Lucrezia a rich inner life as a lover of the natural world and a talented painter. Lucrezia fears for her life when she has not become pregnant after a brief marriage.Robert Browning's dramatic poem, ""My Last Duchess,"" first introduced me to the controlling Duke of Ferrara. O'Farrell has put her own spin on the relationship of the Duke and Duchess of Ferrara, the portrait of the Duchess, and the outcome of Lucrezia's life. While Browning's poem is told from the Duke's point of view, ""The Marriage Portrait"" is Lucrezia's story. The book is a page turner, and the author surprises the reader with a twist at the end.

While she discusses his novels in the context of when they were written, it's Tomalin's wide use of quotes from many poems that gives the book its sparkle.Born in 1840, Hardy had a lower middle-class childhood as the son of a builder in his beloved Dorset. He was a good student and an avid reader who was trained to be an architect, mainly involved in church restoration. He achieved his dream of becoming a novelist and poet, and used the beautiful Dorset countryside as the setting for much of his work. He usually spent the spring and early summer months in London for the social season, or traveled in the Continent.Hardy was often a neglectful husband in both of his marriages, and Tomalin devotes many pages to his first marriage to Emma Gifford. She begins the biography:""In November of 1912 an aging writer lost his wife. He was not expecting her to die, but then he had not been taking much notice of her for some time. . . This is the moment when Thomas Hardy became a great poet.""Hardy felt remorseful after Emma's death and wrote many love poems remembering their happy courtship in northern Cornwall and their early married life. Of course, his second wife, Florence, was offended that the deceased Emma was his Muse.While Hardy had lacked the resources to attend university as a young man, he received honorary degrees from many universities that recognized his genius. He was a man who was caught between two worlds - the simple life in Dorset and the intellectual life of London. His poetry often reflected his experiences in both places, his love of nature, his social awareness of the plight of women, his ambivalence about religion, and a world shaken by wars. This is a very readable biography that gives insight into Thomas Hardy, the man, as well as Thomas Hardy, the writer.

She feels likeLaura, a young reserved teacher, is an American who is working for the socialist revolutionary cause soon after the Mexican Revolution. She feels like she does not really belong anywhere. She's lost her belief in her Catholic faith, and feels a distance from the revolutionaries. She's cut ties with America, but does not feel a part of Mexican culture or understand their language well. She refuses any involvement with the men who are romantically interested in her. Unlike her idealistic notion of a good leader, Laura sees that Braggioni is a corrupt revolutionary leader whose constant visiting makes her uncomfortable and anxious when she goes back to her own apartment. Although she is working for the revolutionary cause, she has no real connection to the strangers to whom she delivers messages. Laura is living in a state of alienation. There is a contrast between her original idealism and the reality of the political cause.The Judas tree is named for Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus Christ, and may have later hung himself from the branches of the tree in repentance. The flowers of this tree are religiously symbolic in a dream where Laura refuses to follow the ghost of a suicidal political prisoner.The author, Katherine Anne Porter, met a group of young Mexican artists and revolutionaries in New York City.

The farming community has undergone many changes over the years with industrialization bringing problems as well as conveniences. Most of the stories are told from the perspective of Andy Catlett as a child, an adult, and as an aging man.The stories have a sense of community, a love of family, and an appreciation of the land, but also a regret that the simpler rural way of life is now passing us by. There is humor in many of the stories, but there is a slightly different tone compared to Berry's earlier works. Author Wendell Berry has aged along with his character, Andy Catlett, and they are both idealizing the early 20th Century and feeling some trepidation of what the future will bring. Other important themes that run through the book are taking pride in doing a job well, and being aware of others that may need help due to age, injuries, or financial reasons.A new reader of Wendell Berry's fictional books should start with his earlier novels and short stories since this book is a nostalgic look back.

Doerr has combined historical fiction, fantasy, and science fiction in a story about books and libraries, the environment, and the importance of home.A fictional fable written by Antonius Diogenes in ancient Greece is a unifying factor that connects the characters. The various characters find the ancient book, translate it, tell the story to children or the sick, and transform it into a play. Libraries lose and find the papyrus manuscript, and it is also partially destroyed by water and mold. But somehow, Diogenes' fable about the utopia of Cloud Cuckoo Land lives on.There's lots of excitement and adventure in the book. The stories of Anna and Omeir intersect at the Siege of Constantinople in the 15th Century. Zeno learns ancient Greek from another prisoner-of-war in Korea. Zeno's story intersects with Seymour's tale in Idaho. Seymour is a troubled teenager who takes drastic measures to promote environmentalism in contemporary times. Konstance is in a futuristic timeline on a long voyage on the Argos interstellar spaceship operated by AI.Author Anthony Doerr writes with imagination, warmth, and an understanding of the challenges that these characters and Planet Earth face. The book has short chapters which alternate among characters. There are some readers who would not be comfortable with so many timelines and locations. While I had no trouble following the story, some of the tension was lost by so many changes in the timelines. It's best to just go with the flow and see where the book takes you.

As time passes she gets angry, thinking that he has stopped at the pub after work. As the evening darkens into night, she starts to worry and enlists her neighbor to search for Walter.The imagery of chrysanthemums runs through the story.

Happy interactions among the family and friendsGabriel and Gretta are attending a holiday dinner dance at the Dublin home of his aging musical aunts. Happy interactions among the family and friends lead to stories about the dearly departed relatives. Anxieties are shared with one story about the hold of the Catholic Church over the people of Ireland. Political undercurrents are present about Ireland being in paralysis under British rule, and the Irish Cultural Revival. Gabriel tells the story of his deceased grandfather's mill horse who kept circling a statue of King William III in a Dublin park. Like the horse, Ireland cannot move on after years of debate over Irish independence versus British rule. However, most of the evening is spent socializing, dining, and appreciating the musical talents of the guests. Gabriel feels anxious about the health of his frail aunts, and appreciates their effort in continuing their holiday tradition. Just before leaving, Gretta stands enraptured by a beautiful song that reminds her of Michael Furey, a young man who had died young. Michael was a man who had loved her, and lived life with a passion. Later, Gabriel realizes that he has not lived his life fully, but wants to take control of every situation. He thinks about his own mortality:""One by one, they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age.""Themes of isolation, miscommunication, paralysis, and mortality are beautifully explored in this story. ""The Dead"" also captured the feelings in Ireland about its identity in the early 20th Century. There is a melancholy connection between the living and the dead.""A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and dead.""...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Sep 30, 2022","Oct 03, 2022","Aug 03, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23289.The_Dead

A few works are more nostalCharles Dickens was a talented journalist, and most of the eight essays in this collection are works of social journalism. A few works are more nostalgic in nature. The essays were originally published in the journals, ""Household Words,"" or ""All the Year Round."" The themes of walking and observing run through the collection.The title work, ""Night Walks,"" is a semi-autobiographical essay about a man who walked the streets of London when he suffered from insomnia. The walker was very observant, noticing the poor, the homeless, the mentally ill, and the dangerous people that he passed during the night. Many of these experiences were later incorporated into other literary works. Using beautiful imagery, Dickens wrote an excellent essay of nostalgic thoughts and social concerns. This five-star work is imaginative and sensual, and my favorite essay in this volume.""Gone Astray"" tells about an eight-year-old boy who got separated from a family friend when they were out walking. The lost boy had a series of adventures in London, ending in a humorous visit to the theater.""Chatham Dockyard"" is an account of meeting a young boy, called ""The Spirit of the Fort,"" who knows the identity of the various vessels on the river. Since Dickens had happy childhood memories of living in Chatham for five years, perhaps the boy is the younger Dickens. In the nearby dockyard, there is a huge iron armor-plated ship being constructed for the Royal Navy.Dickens walked to visit the women's area of the ""Wapping Workhouse."" It housed dying women in dark garrets, rooms for inmates that had fits, areas for mothers and babies, refractory wards where younger girls were working, and wards for the old and infirm. Dickens felt that the workhouse was clean and well-managed. However, he also wrote that rich people should be contributing more to caring for the poor in England.""A Small Star in the East"" has Dickens traveling to Ratcliff and Stepney, eastward of London. He visits some rented rooms of impoverished families of laborers out of work where the women of the families brought in a pittance by sewing. One home had an infirm woman who had been poisoned by lead from working at the lead mill. A bright spot in this journey was visiting the East London Children's Hospital run by a married doctor and nurse. Malnourishment seemed to be the most common problem of these poor children.In ""On an Amateur Beat,"" Dickens comes across some homeless children, dressed in rags, begging. He wonders why such a great prosperous empire as Great Britain neglects its starving children. He also walks to the East London Children's Hospital where the friendly resident dog makes the rounds with him as he visits the children. A stop at the lead mill ends his walk. Dickens hopes that more of the work with lead will be eventually mechanized so the women workers have less exposure.In ""Betting Shops,"" Dickens tells a story about the owner of a new betting shop who ran off with all the betting money and did not pay the winners. The general tone of the essay was that low-wage earners were gambling away money that their families could not afford to lose.Dickens complains about the profuse waste and high cost of elaborate funerals in ""Trading in Death."" Lower and middle class people spend more than they can afford to honor their dead, and the debt can ruin them. State funerals are terribly costly, and Dickens uses the funeral of the Duke of Wellington in 1852 as an example....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Sep 19, 2022","Sep 26, 2022","Jul 31, 2022",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9248677-night-walks

When he and his wife, Dr Steffanie Strathdee, were vacationing in Egypt, Tom was struck with pancreatitis and one of the most dangerous bacteria in the world. Medevac teams took him first to Germany, then later to the hospital at the University of California San Diego.Steff was both a loving, concerned wife and a top scientist - an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at UCSD. Tom was a psychology professor at UCSD. As her husband's condition deteriorated, Steff researched alternative medical therapies. She and the team of doctors collaborated with phage researchers who worked day and night to create a phage cocktail specific for Tom's infection. A bacteriophage is a ""virus that will eat bacteria by injecting their DNA into them and turning them into phage manufacturing plants."" The bacteria die and the phage virus multiplies. Phage therapy has been used in Poland, Russia, and Georgia, mainly by the military, but not in the United States. A history of phage research was also included in the book.The book was a warning against overuse of antibiotics. Emergence of superbugs is a global emergency. For years antibiotics have been used to promote growth in livestock.

Charlie was a down-to-earth, overweight, stubborn man who was holding on to his ranch by a thread. It was a losing proposition when the animals could not graze on the dry, brown fields and the ranchers had to buy the feed. Would the rain come in time for Charlie and the other ranchers to save their beloved ranches?Charlie was an independent thinker with strong principles handed down to him from his father and grandfather. He was self-reliant and refused to take any handouts from the government. The government programs may have been well-meaning, but some of them were so tied up in regulations that they often did as much harm as help.This Western novel showed the different ways Charlie's neighbors dealt with the drought. Most of them were mortgaged up to their eyeballs, and had the threat of foreclosure hanging over them. The story also told about a changing attitude by some Anglos toward those of Mexican descent.

The segregated Dozier School does not deserve to be called a school since little schoolwork was done. It was the staff, not the boys, that committed the crimes at the reform school that was open from 1900-2011. The boys were whipped, sexually abused, put in solitary confinement, and even murdered. Some of their food and supplies, provided by the State of Florida, were sold to people in town with the money kicked back to the directors. The boys worked on a farm, made bricks, and did work out in the community to support the school with some of the funds pocketed by the directors. When anthropology students from the University of South Florida found a graveyard full of murdered youths, the truth about the Dozier School emerged. Parents had been told that their murdered sons had run away from the school or other lies. Author Colson Whitehead's fictional story, set in the 1960s, about the Nickel School is partly based on testimony by formerly incarcerated boys.Elwood Curtis was an intelligent black adolescent in the Jim Crow South who admired the teachings of Martin Luther King. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time when he hitchhiked, and was picked up by a guy in a stolen car. Elwood was sent to Nickel, and was severely whipped within 24 hours for trying to break up a fight. Elwood, who believed in social change, was befriended by Turner whose philosophy was to always stay unnoticed, under the radar, to survive. All the boys were significantly traumatized by their time in Nickel.""The boys could have been many things had they not been ruined by that place. . . .

While everyone was mistreated, the prejudiced staff treated the black residents even worse than the white boys. It was a difficult book to read in some parts since it's troubling to read about violence directed toward children. There needs to be real oversight of both juvenile reform schools and adult prisons.

It's a character study of Judith, an effervescent child of nature who followed her father around the farm helping with chores. She was full of energy, had an artistic talent, and took great joy in observing the outdoor world. Her life changed as the wife of a Kentucky tenant farmer and the mother of three children. She found that the endless cycle of household chores, difficult pregnancies, and constant childcare was a soul-crushing existence. Even though she had a hardworking husband, the weather could wipe out any hope of escaping poverty. Judith went through times of anger and depression dealing with her unrelenting duties.Uncle Jabez, an old man and the neighborhood fiddler, seemed to be the only one who understood the young woman. Joy in the beauty of the world, laughter, and contemplation were qualities they shared. He took the time to watch the beauty of a sunset, and compared life to the vivid changing colors which gradually muted to gray:""It's a heap like a man's life, hain't it. . . . It begins happy an' simple, like them innocent pinks an' blues; then turns flame colored when he grows to be a man an' learns to know the love o' wimmin. But it don't stay that color long. First thing you know it's gray, like his hair, what he has left of it. Yaas, Judy, the young time's the on'y time.""This naturalist novel about the hard life of a farming family is notable because it's told from the point of view of a woman. Both a farmer and his wife did backbreaking work, but often had little more than corncakes to feed their families by mid-winter.

It's written partly in a stream of consciousness in lyrical prose. Ellen is the only surviving child of parents who had lost five children. The young girl has to figure out life, adjusting to new circumstances as her father moves from farm to farm in the Kentucky hills.The story tells of the beauty of the natural world, the bounty of the crops in a good year, the desperation in a bad year, and the back-breaking relentless labor. Ellen is resilient and helps her parents, but also takes time to experience the wonder of love. Although Ellen is dirt poor, she has a special radiance and a strong sense of loyalty to her family. Her powers of observation are useful when dealing with people, and bring joy when she is outdoors in nature. My book was illustrated with beautiful wood engravings by Clare Leighton, an artist known for her art depicting workers. The engravings reinforced the feeling that a tenant farmer had to be strong and extremely hard working to survive in the early 20th Century.This book is not for everyone since Ellen's interior thoughts comprise a large part of the book.

When she disappeared, leaving her passport in her room, the police would not make the effort to search for her since they considered migrant workers to be expendable. Her employer, Petra, realizes that Nisha was the heart of their household raising Petra's daughter while being separated for years from her own child back in Sri Lanka. The migrant workers were in desperate circumstances back home, but the agency fees in Cyprus kept them so much in debt that it was almost impossible to return home.Nisha's lover, Yiannis, had also been in economic trouble when an acquaintance involved him in illegally poaching songbirds as they fly between Europe and Africa. But Yiannis finds that the organization does not allow anyone to leave.Christy Lefteri tells about Nisha's life from the points of view of Petra and Yiannis as they talk to the neighbors and Nisha's maid friends during their search. The book shows the reality of a migrant worker's life, and the slaughter of the migrating songbirds. It's heartbreaking that the songbirds are more protected than the migrating maids and nannies.The story also touched on mothering in person and at a distance, and the emotional sacrifices some people must make to send money back home.

The violent man is cursed with a prophecy that he will murder his parents, but he moves far away from them to prevent it from happening.

Nella, with her great knowledge of herbs and poisons, helps women who have been wronged by men. She feels for these other women because of her own experiences. Woman had little power or choices in that time so murder by undetectable poison was an option they might consider. Things were going smoothly in Nella's secret apothecary shop until twelve-year-old Eliza Tanning appeared on a mission from her employer. Not only were Nella and Eliza in peril, but also scores of women who had used Nella's services.In a present day timeline, Caroline is visiting London in what was supposed to be a tenth anniversary celebration. She's come alone since she had just discovered her husband's infidelity. Caroline goes mudlarking along the banks of the Thames and finds an apothecary vial etched with a symbol. Using the resources of the British Library, she makes the historical connection to Nella's apothecary shop. Caroline had once wanted her life to go in a different direction, and this might be the time to follow her interest in historical research.Both of the timelines were interesting, although the historical look into the 1790s was the more fascinating. While poisoning is obviously illegal and gruesome, there is an understanding why the damaged women feel like they are using their last option and take justice into their own hands. There are some mentions of magic, which could also be luck or fate smiling down on them.

William has rented a home on Maine's rocky coast. It was lockdown for them, punctuated with walks along the shore. Lucy and William had a complicated history, both together and apart. Now they were together 24/7, and their past connection helped them get through the stress of the pandemic and their worries about their daughters' health and marriages.""Almost always, there was that sense of being underwater; of things not being real.""Much of the book takes place in Lucy's thoughts, and her insecurities from her damaged childhood are still with her.

Lucy is especially kind to people who are experiencing poverty or living alone, such as a woman she meets while volunteering at the food pantry.This is a thoughtful novel about relationships, resilience, and understanding other people in challenging times.

This""Our Last Days in Barcelona"" is the fifth book in the series about the Perez family who escaped to Florida after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba. This book has two timelines set mostly in Spain in 1936 and 1964.In 1936, Alicia Perez takes her young daughter, Isabel, to Barcelona to visit with her parents after she discovers that her husband had been unfaithful. Spain is in a state of unrest as fascism is rising, and the Spanish Civil War erupts. Alicia witnesses the bombing of Guernica by the Germans before making her way back to Cuba. Meanwhile, her cousin Rosa is dealing with family problems in Cuba.In the 1964 timeline, Isabel is worried about her sister Beatriz after she disappears in Barcelona. Beatriz is involved in anti-Castro espionage, although she has a cover job at the American Embassy. Isabel travels to Barcelona to locate Beatriz. Isabel has been feeling weighed down by an unhappy marriage, but finds satisfaction when she uses her artistic talents.In addition to the interesting historical elements, themes of love, duty to their family, and personal fulfillment are important. While it is not necessary to read the entire series before this book, the first book, ""When We Left Cuba,"" is a good introduction to the characters and the political situation as the Perez family flees from Cuba.

Although he uses fictional names for the two towns in these essays, he probably was inspired by Folkestone and Deal along the coast of Kent. Dickens has a talent as a travel writer because he's so observant, and provides descriptions that involve the senses. You can use your imagination to feel the wind blow, hear the waves and the birds, and notice the shadows of the sails and the people on the boats. He flits from image to image without going in depth about what he is observing to give an impression of the coastal town.In the second essay, Dickens is attempting to write but he gets distracted by everything he sees outside his window. He ends up exploring the area, and writing his thoughts about the seacoast in autumn when the crowds have left.

The man, named Leggett, was the chief mate of the Sephora before he accidentally killed a crew member during a violent storm. Leggett was now a fugitive from the law, and wanted to hide on the Captain's ship. ""The Secret Sharer"" is narrated by the Captain years later, and one wonders how much of it is true. Is the Captain an unreliable narrator telling a tall tale, embellishing a real story? Why does he risk his position, his ship, and the lives of the crew for a stranger? Did the story only play out in the Captain's mind because he has a mental disorder, and felt under pressure in his new position? Author Joseph Conrad presents the Captain and Leggett as doppelgangers or doubles. The young Captain and Leggett look very much alike physically. They had similar experiences coming in as new officers on ships with a crew that was unknown to them. While the Captain secretly helps Leggett, the experience eventually makes him more self-assured in his command. Perhaps thinking about another person took the Captain's mind out of a state of just worrying about his command of the ship.This is a suspenseful psychological story with the author constantly increasing the tension. There is fear that the Captain and Leggett will be overheard while whispering to each other, fear of discovery when Leggett hides in the cabin, fear that the Captain will lose his command if Leggett is found, and fear of the ship being grounded as it approaches an island. The Captain seems more confident after successfully sailing near the island. While he has good sailing skills, I wonder what the crew is thinking about a Captain that just risked grounding the ship. The crew has never seen Leggett so they don't know the Captain's motivations.

His wife, Laura, feels restless spending her days homemaking and caring for their two children. She starts a course at the Columbia Journalism School. Laura becomes involved with women's suffrage and other feminist causes with a bohemian group of friends in Greenwich Village. When valuable books are stolen at the library, her family falls under suspicion.In 1993, Sadie Donovan has just been appointed head curator at the New York Public Library, and a collection of their priceless books and artifacts is scheduled to be exhibited soon.

He attended college and bought a small furniture store in Harlem. Ray inherited a truck from his father that had a surprise gift in the spare tire well that funded his store. Money was scarce so Ray occasionally fenced some jewelry brought in by his cousin, Freddie, or sold a used TV that ""fell off of a truck.""Ray, his wife, and their children are living in a small apartment near the subway and saving for something better. Life is going well in 1959 when Freddie gets involved in a dangerous plan to rob the safe in the Hotel Theresa, and volunteers Ray to fence the jewels. Freddie is like a brother to Ray so he tries to protect his cousin, and score enough cash to finance a new apartment. Ray also has a dream to move into Harlem's elite Black community.The book follows Ray, his cousin Freddie, and his older friend Pepper through a series of heists. Harlem is populated with crooked cops demanding protection money, bookies, gangsters, and corrupt city workers. There are also civil rights workers and lawyers trying to make it a better place. Race, injustice, inequality, revenge, and gentrification are important themes in the book. Beautiful descriptions of 1960s New York City architecture, and bits of sarcastic humor also fill the pages.

Kovalyov's goals in life are to climb the ranks of bureaucracy, and to marry a pretty wealthy woman. With his appearance ruined, the shallow man can reach neither of these dreams.Meanwhile his nose has assumed a life of its own, and is human sized.

SomeMajor and Mrs Monarch, a couple who had fallen on hard times financially, asked an artist to hire them to model for his commercial illustrations. Some of the artist's illustrations depicted people of the upper class so Major Monarch said they would have the advantage of being ""the real thing; a gentleman, you know, or a lady.""The artist also hired other models - a lower class woman, Miss Churm, and an immigrant street peddler, Oronte. The Monarchs were very stiffly themselves so their illustrations looked like photographs. While the other two models were not noble, they had a natural ability to adapt to the role. The artist was able to interpret reality instead of documenting it like a photograph. It's the artistic interpretation that communicates the meaning to the viewer. So artifice can sometimes be more valuable than the real thing.The story also looked at the changes brought on due to the Industrial Revolution and the greater global economy in the later Victorian era. England was changing to an urban, manufacturing economy which benefited the middle class, the working class, and immigrants. These three classes are represented by the artist, Miss Churm, and Oronte who are all capable and flexible as they work. The landed gentry historically had benefited from agriculture, but workers were leaving the farms. The Monarchs, who are struggling financially, had no real skills and found it difficult to change with the times. The artist and others felt uncomfortable hiring the higher class couple for menial work as servants, even if the Monarchs were willing to do the job.""The Real Thing"" has many layers of meaning concerning art, life experiences, reality, economics, and class tensions.

Like the big sea-turtles when they come paddling up to the surface, stick their noses out and fill their lungs with a great gulp before they sink down again among the seaweed and the octopuses. We're all stifling at the bottom of a dustbin, but I'd found the way to the top. Back to Lower Binfield!George Bowling feels trapped in his marriage and in his job as a traveling insurance salesman. He's humorous, middle-aged, overweight, and fearful of an impending war with Hitler. As the title suggests, he feels like he is drowning in his life in present day England.George thinks back to his carefree boyhood in the village of Lower Binfield. There are long passages about the fun of fishing with his buddies, and the beauty of nature. He also reminisces about his love of reading, his first job, his first love, and his experiences in the Great War. While some of the descriptions of his boyhood are quite lyrical, they could have been edited down.After attending a lecture by an anti-fascist and feeling fearful about another war, George has the need for the peace and happiness he enjoyed as a boy before the Great War. He had some money from betting on the horses, and used it to travel back to Lower Binfield. The rest of the book tells about his experiences going back home.Orwell's love of nature, fishing, and reading comes through in the character he created. George Bowling is humorous, cynical, not always likable, and understandably worried about the future. Except for the overly long musings about George's childhood, ""Coming Up for Air"" is an entertaining and thoughtfully written novel....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Aug 16, 2022","Aug 24, 2022","May 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/509080.Coming_up_for_Air

Ivan Ilyich led a shallow, self-centered life where bureaucratic rank, material success, and social status were important. Even his marriage was one of convenience. His co-workers had the same desires of career and social advancement, and they wondered who would fill Ivan's position when he died.Ivan Ilyich found himself with a painful, lingering illness. The doctors were not forthcoming about his impending death so he could not prepare mentally and spiritually. As Ivan suffered, comfort came from his servant, Gerasim. His servant accepted death as a part of life since he lived close to nature as a peasant. Gerasim offered help and compassion, and Ivan was finally able to face his mortality. A kiss from his innocent young son made Ivan Ilyich think about the importance of love. (view spoiler)[He felt despair as he was being sucked into the dark bag of death. As he felt love for others, Ivan Ilyich was redeemed and saw a light.  (hide spoiler)]Tolstoy had a lifelong interest in the subject of death.

After working a few days, Bartleby replies he would ""prefer not to"" when the lawyer makes a work request of him. The employer tries to be understanding, but Bartleby's answer to any request is passive resistance - ""I prefer not to.""The beginning of the story is humorous as the lawyer/narrator describes his other two clerks who never put in a full day's work. It also establishes how tolerant the lawyer can be. So we are not surprised when the lawyer makes some attempt to understand and show kindness to Bartleby later.Walls, walls, walls! Not only is the law firm on Wall Street, the American center of capitalism, but the windows of the office have a view of nothing but walls. Later in the story, Bartleby faces a wall and does not interact with anyone or anything. Bartleby seems despondent and depressed. He has given up on living, and is closed off from other people. The symbolic walls show Bartleby's lack of engagement with his work, people, and the natural world.Melville has readers asking themselves what causes Bartleby to abandon hope and find life meaningless. A contributing factor might be the monotonous work of copying where the clerks act like machines and have no opportunities for creativity. His prior job was also unfulfilling. But it seems like there's a bigger problem than a dull job. We can only wonder about Bartleby - is he autistic or clinically depressed? Or is this a work of absurdist fiction? Is this partly a reflection of Melville himself since he was under pressure supporting a wife, four children, his mother, and his four sisters? Melville often had to write what his publishers wanted, rather than what he really considered meaningful.The ambiguity makes this short story a fascinating work. How should we deal with a person like Bartleby? We are left with a puzzle, but our hearts have been touched by Bartleby's plight....more",Notes are private!,-1,19,1,Jun 2022,"Jun 04, 2022","Apr 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/114230.Bartleby_the_Scrivener

Georgiana, a beautiful woman, has one tiny imperfection--a birthmark on her face. Her husband, Aylmer focuses so much on Georgiana's birthmark that she loses her sense of self-worth. Georgiana agrees to let Aylmer try to remove her birthmark in his science laboratory. Aylmer's journal shows that he has failed in many of his scientific experiments, bringing Dr Frankenstein to mind. Aylmer is far from perfect himself, but he expects his wife to be perfect. Even scarier, he is so proud of his knowledge of science that he forges ahead using his wife as a science experiment.Georgiana is an obedient, submissive wife which would be considered virtuous at the time. The author writes the story so that the domineering husband/submissive wife roles lead to tragic results. Hawthorn does see the point of view of women in his works.The story was written in 1843 when the Industrial Revolution was showing both the benefits and limitations of science. ""The Birthmark"" shows a conflict between Science and Nature, created by the Divine who made humans imperfect. Aylmer tries to control Nature, but Nature has many mysteries, and he is unable to change what the Divine had created in the way he wants. Today, people are concerned about their imperfections, especially young people who spend a lot of time on social media. Women tend the be judged more harshly for imperfections in their physical beauty. Although Hawthorn's story tends to be a little repetitive, it does have a timeless message.3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"May 06, 2022","May 06, 2022","Apr 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2185529.The_Birthmark

The story has imagery relating to the Garden of Eden with the serpent and temptation. The devil tells Goodman Brown that he was present when Brown's Puritan ancestors whipped Quakers and set fire to an Indian village. Goodman Brown is shocked to see the pious members of his church gather to worship the devil and practice witchcraft. Was it a dream or reality? He was totally changed by the experience with the devil, and suspected everyone of evil.The story raises questions about the nature of evil, and whether the devil is the image of man's natural dark side. Author Nathaniel Hawthorne had an ancestor who was a judge in the famous Salem witch trials, and his works show that this family history upset him. Perhaps if a person is looking for evil in others (as Goodman Brown did for the rest of his life), instead of seeing the good in other people, it sets up an atmosphere where people will be intolerant of someone that's a little ""different."" This will create a social situation where people can be called witches on flimsy, imagined evidence in the name of religion.

At the young age of 20, Charlot opened Les Vraies Richesses (the true wealth) in 1936 in Algiers. It was a small bookstore, lending library, and cultural center where Charlot also published Mediterranean authors. Many of his publications are widely read classics today, especially those written by Albert Camus. Charlot's life is told in brief journal entries from the 1930s to the 1960s, grounded in historical research. The creation of the bookstore and publishing company, a second publishing location in wartime Paris, and Charlot's friendships with the authors are all part of the journal. A second timeline, set in 2017, is devoted to the destruction of the bookstore to transform the space into a beignet shop. Ryad, a student who needs an internship experience performing manual labor, travels from France with orders to destroy all the books and furniture, and paint the walls. Ryad does not enjoy reading, and has no idea of the cultural history of the bookstore. An old Arab man, Abdallah, often stands on the sidewalk outside the bookstore where he formerly worked. He tells Ryad his fond memories of the store. While Ryad will never be a book lover himself, he gains an appreciation of what the books mean to others. Ryad is around the same age as Charlot was when he started his dream of publishing books. It was impossible not to compare and contrast the two young men.The colonial power of France occupied Algeria for 132 years, and Algeria's fight for independence was woven into the story. The author's love for the city of Algiers, with its beautiful Mediterranean location, is sensed throughout the story.
