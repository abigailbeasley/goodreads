The book is wildly inventive, and I found myself anxiously turning pages to see if I could ever reach the limits of A.J. Hartley's imagination. (I'm pretty sure I didn't - anyone who could come up with a book like this clearly has vast, untapped stores of fresh ideas constantly bubbling up inside of them.) He starts with a series of original questions: What if someone really, really hated Shakespeare? And what if that person found a way to exploit a demonic pact to erase Shakespeare from the Western canon? And what if the only way to stop this from happening was to recruit a team of newly-dead souls to travel back in time and interfere? This alone would have been enough to catch my interest, but Hartley doesn't stop there. The ""what-ifs"" keep coming: What if the good guys were led by an angel named Gladys, and what if she wasn't exactly authorized to carry out this mission? What if a case of mistaken identity meant that one of the time-traveling souls wasn't who they were counting on him to be? The secret to pulling off outrageous, in my opinion, is to take your story to the absolute limit, and then go one step further. Hartley definitely does that in Burning Shakespeare, and the result is a fresh, original take on an author who's been at the center of so much writing over the past four and a half centuries that it's hard to believe there are still new ways to approach him. Not only is the plot inventive, but it's also smart. Hartley is clearly intelligent and well-educated, not only possessing the deep familiarity with Shakespeare and his works necessary to pull off a book such as this, but also demonstrating proficiency in fields such as theology, sociology, and moral philosophy. Yet the book never feels like an excuse for Hartley to put his erudition on display; rather, he uses his breadth of knowledge to add texture to the narrative. Perhaps the book's greatest success is its ability to work on multiple levels. Those who are simply looking for an entertaining read will no doubt find it. But for those who want more from the books they read, Burning Shakespeare does not disappoint. Woven into the wild plot are several deep, nuanced questions about themes such as the power and purpose of literature, the ethics of representation, cultural relativism vs. universalism, and the like. In short, I cannot recommend Burning Shakespeare highly enough. Smart, witty, original, and fun, there's enough between the covers to keep anyone occupied—and happy—for hours on end! This was my first time reading A.J. Hartley, but it definitely will not be my last. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 08, 2023","Aug 13, 2023","Aug 08, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60726219-burning-shakespeare
