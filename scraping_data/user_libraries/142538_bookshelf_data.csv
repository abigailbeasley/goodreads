Ends With a ??This story follows all the rules of good storytelling and I was riveted from the first page. Told from the perspective of a 24 year-old woman, she copes with the aftermath of her twin sister's very public and quite spectacular suicide. Margaret (Maggie) and Michelle (Shell) were identical, mirror-image twins who shared a life and a language, and even though they had been apart physically as young adults (one in NY and one in LA), in spirit they were inseparable. The surviving twin, Maggie, is a Juilliard-trained violinist. She uses lyrical reference to disclose her feelings about her sister, an accomplished artist, and the suicide. The author writes in present tense to follow Maggie from LA, where her sister lived, to Moon, Alaska, where she intends to spread her sister's ashes. Connected so closely with her sister, Maggie appears to believe that her own suicide is now in order and she plans it. The author switches to past tense throughout Maggie's journey to tell a series of anecdotal stories about the twins' life together growing up. We come to know the twins intimately and they are fascinating. With each page I fell more in love with them and wondered and worried, would Maggie follow suit and commit her own suicide? I turned pages at rapid rate to find out.Unfortunately, the version I read had an inordinate number of typos; however, I must say, the writing was so good and the story so powerful that I wasn't distracted by them. I mention it only because material this good demands a decent copy editor prior to its next printing.Very well done and I highly recommend this book to readers looking for strong storytelling and character development....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 10, 2013","Sep 11, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13337605-twin-pact

Set during World War II amid the Japanese occupation ofTransportingThis is a beautifully written story about love and loyalty, friendship and family. Set during World War II amid the Japanese occupation of Malaya, there is a rich blend of cultures and conflicts, personal and global. The narrator, Philip, is a child of dual heritage (British and Chinese) who recounts his struggle to find his place in a chaotic world. From a vantage point some 50 years after the War, he explains his past actions leading to his decisions to work with the Japanese to a friend of his former sensei, Endo-san. Philip exhibits such detailed and vivid descriptions—sights, sounds, smells, feelings—that the reader forgets he is relating from memory.Ultimately Philip learns to “accept that there are things in this world we can never explain and life will be understandable. That is the irony of life. It is also the beauty of it.” He also learns to understand why, at an early age, a fortune-teller said he was born with the “gift of rain.” The rains (monsoons) figure prominently throughout the landscape of the story.I highly recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Sep 04, 2013","Sep 05, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1219949.The_Gift_of_Rain

Best Kept Secret reveals the secret oThe Human Condition: One Woman’s StoryThis story covers a relatively short period of time in a woman’s life. Best Kept Secret reveals the secret of alcoholism and illustrates the sneaky spiral, the dire consequences and hopeful path to recovery. It is well written and brave; however, I felt it lacked a certain edge that for me made it stand out as unique and groundbreaking.But that may be the point. The main character, Cadence, is every woman. She’s bright, beautiful, educated, witty, likeable and sympathetic. She marries a man who seems to be her equal at first, but is ultimately portrayed as a selfish and harshly judgmental mama’s boy. The birth of their son, naturally, changes the dynamic of their relationship. And as Cadence’s fear of not-being-good-enough (what new mother doesn’t feel this?) ultimately leads to gaining comfort from ever increasing glasses of red wine, her world falls apart. I found Cadence to be the only really likable character. The others--husband, mother-in-law, sister, son, counselor, partners in recovery--are either self-serving jerks or too underdeveloped to matter. The story focuses everything on Cadence and keeps one reading only to find out whether or not she triumphs in the end.I recommend this book to young mothers struggling with mommy-n-me groups who drink wine rather than coffee or tea while their children play, or anyone who drinks in secret and thinks she doesn’t really have a problem. Reading about the fate of Cadence may help the reader come to terms with alcohol addiction and hopefully choose the path to recovery.If, however, you’re looking for a more brutally honest depiction of the alcoholic spiral that truly helps one to understand the nature and experience of this disease, I recommend Drinking, A Love Story by Carolyn Knapp....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2013","Mar 25, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10113312-best-kept-secret

We mothers often complain to one another that no one really prepared us for the job in store, particularly as those sweet babies grow up. But I dare say, this book lays it right out there.For example, from Chapter 16: "" There are a million things I wish I'd done before I had children. I wish I'd slept in until noon on the weekends, lazily eating breakfast in bed and relishing the fact that I had nowhere to be all day. I wish I'd taken adult classes that really interested me, not just the ones I had to take in order to graduate years before. I wish I'd seen more midday movies, had more spontaneous sex, and read more books, back when I actually had the spare time to do all of that stuff. And I wish I'd appreciated the little things, like the ability to grocery shop or shower when I felt like it.""Smokler begins each chapter with quotes gathered from mothers across a vast mom community. She helps us understand--and this is what we really need to know while living in our vacuums--that we are NOT alone.Well done.

If you find the quick wit and at times foul mouth of this self-made star entertaining, you--like me--won't be able to put down this book.Bethenny as a writer, along with her writing partner Eve Adamson, use her personal experiences during her rise to fame to create an alter ego named Faith Brightstone. The story about a young New Yorker moving to L.A. to try to make it as an actress, only to return to New York to find fame in reality television is a thinly veiled fun romp into her past. She has license to pick and choose facts and fiction and mix them into a cocktail named the ""pink lemonade mojito"" rather than the Skinnygirl margarita. It's a refreshing summer beach read, and the juicy stuff is not left out.She serves up a tasty platter of what can only be called just desserts by creating highly unlikeable characters based on Martha Stewart and Jill Zarin, and she even adds a zesty little barb aimed at Kelly Bensimon (with a ""I'm up here, you're down there"" type comment). Her creativity in rewriting the past, including making up new challenges for the television contest named ""Domestic Goddess,"" and her knack for witty/truly funny dialog prove once again why this woman is a star.I had to deduct a  star, however, due to a critical fiction-writing error at the beginning of Part II, when she lapses into a classic tell rather than show technique, and what I felt was an anti-climactic and cliché conclusion of having the whole thing culminate in the life-lesson of ""there are no certainties in life.""But that conclusion was NOT what I took away from this reading experience.

This is the first person account of a young girl in a post-Apocalyptic world who volunteers as ""tribute"" from her district to participate in what is essentially a reality TV show, The Hunger Games. Twenty-four kids, ranging in age from 12-18, representing 12 districts in what was once North America, are primped and prepared to fight to the death in a wilderness arena. They must find their own food and water, shelter, weaponry and companionship. Only one will survive and return home a hero.Reading The Hunger Games was like watching a gorier version of the television show Survivor. It included both loathsome and likeable players, alliances, back-stabbing, solid friendships and even a love story.Katniss and Peeta are the girl and boy from District 12, who their mentors and stylists present to the viewing audience as star-crossed lovers. Peeta is actually in love with Katniss; however, she is a hard-nosed, focused hunter and only believes she's playing a role through the Games. For example, she has been instructed that every kiss she gives Peeta may result in a reward, or some kind of treat or necessity from her mentor/sponsors. That the reader is aware of Peeta's true feelings and Katniss is not, is part of what makes it a simplistic and even silly love story. But I think that's testimony to the genius of the author. It magnifies how reality TV can be both inane and riveting at the same time. I believe it was the good writing and the author's technique/story-telling ability that made me turn the pages non-stop until I finished. As for the subject matter?

Because May believed she was unjustly committed (for coupling with a man beneath her social status and being sexually promiscuous), she jumps at the chance to be a part of a cultural/social experiment offered by the U.S. Government in a controversial, secret pact between President Ulysses S. Grant and Chief Little Wolf of the Cheyenne Nation. The deal was to trade 1000 white women for 1000 horses. The women were to marry and bear children and thereby assist the Cheyenne people assimilate into the inevitable changing culture due to the expansion and westward movement of the white people. Presented in journal format, May narrates an extremely well written and believable accounts of every detail of her predicament and adventure. She tells of many colorful characters--not only the Cheyenne people, but also the women who accompany her--and it's easy to get lost in the story. I live adjacent to an Indian Reservation (Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, an Ojibwa Native American tribe) and often contemplate the history of whites and Indians living side-by-side.

In her new collection, Waltz of the Asparagus People (you’ll have to read it for yourself to find out the reason for this unusual title), she draws in the reader at once by telling of her experience meeting former President Clinton while at the studios of NPR. The encounter was so charming and told in such a funny way, that I have no doubt Bill Clinton could recount every word as well.Goldsby, a professional pianist, is as talented a writer as she is a musician. I am an unabashed fan, and am the lucky owner of all three of her books as well as her CDs. Her first book, a memoir called Piano Girl: A Memoir, is very funny and quite unique in being the only book out there written by someone who plays piano in cocktail lounges and hotel lobbies. After reading it, I immediately wanted to know her—to have her as a girlfriend. And then I listened to her music. Robin Goldsby’s music showed me a completely different aspect of her character and FUNNY is not a word I would use to describe it. RICH—POIGNANT—MOVING—MELODIC—BEAUTIFUL. These are words that instantly came to mind the first time I listened to the songs she’d written on her CD called Twilight.In spite of the chuckles during “Mr. President,” and a running gag throughout the book about performers asking one another whether or not they looked fat, I found Asparagus People to hold far more poignant and moving movements than I expected.This book, to me, is more like her music than her memoir. And it truly reflects how she’s grown and matured as a writer and an artist. The story titled “The Girl That Got Away” brings out the mother in her (and ultimately brought it out in me) and yet manages to also remind us “what it’s like to be a twelve years old.” She follows this with “Little Big Soul,” and it simply moved me to tears.Waltz of the Asparagus People is a tribute to and reflection of Robin Goldsby’s musical life, but more than anything, it’s a love story from her to her husband and children, as it documents their life as Americans living, working, growing and loving one another in Germany.Beautifully written—I didn’t want it to end and I highly recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,May 2011,"May 09, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11333684-waltz-of-the-asparagus-people

AND GaryI can't think of anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book, From Grief to Celebration: How One Family Learned to Embrace the Gift of Down Syndrome. It is extraordinarily well written from the heart of a mother with three children, including one who happens to have an extra chromosome. The child--who is actually now a young woman--is named Alex. And through the pages of this book you'll fall in love with her. But I think even more, you'll fall in love with the author, Margaret ""Gary"" Bender. In these pages, Gary bares her soul. She shares every painful, joyful and revolutionary moment of her experience as a parent, and she does so not only out of love for Alex--and her family--but also out of what appears to be a need to advocate for all parents who have children with special needs. This book must be added to the bibliography Gary provides in the chapter titled ""Research,"" which includes a list of books she sought and read when Alex was born in 1993. If you indeed have a baby with Down syndrome, please put Gary's book at the top of your list. You will learn many things, but you will especially know that you are not alone; you will learn how to advocate; and you will learn to embrace and celebrate your child/situation. And as any parent will tell you, just like kids without special needs, our babies grow up very quickly. You will learn your Down syndrome child might not do everything like walk and talk and potty train according to what you thought was normal, but she/he will learn. And she/he will also teach YOU things you never imagined. What makes this book additionally noteworthy for parents with and without children of special needs, is that Gary allows us to see how universal the experience of parenting truly is. In other words, I found Gary to be not only an advocate for parents of children with Down syndrome; but also, she helps us recognize and remember the individual needs of all children. In a particularly moving segment of the book, she shares the feelings of Alex's sister and brother. Her sister's college essay is well written and very moving. The book--a quick read--is organized according to a list of verbs that Gary believes has defined their experience. As the title suggests, the verbs begin with ""Grief"" and culminate in ""Celebration."" The verbs she uses to from 1-10, plus the bonus, are relatable to parenting and, frankly, life in general.

The story is based on the lives of eleven characters on the day in 1974 when French funambulist, Philippe Petit, danced across a wire (tightrope) secured between the new twin towers at the World Trade Center in New York. It is a well-written, literary masterpiece with highly believable, three-dimensional (complicated) characters. The characters are extremely diverse, and include an Irish immigrant “monk” with a heart of gold, a Park Avenue wife of a judge/mother of a son who was killed in Vietnam, a Guatemalan nurse, a young artist trying to kick a cocaine habit and living a 1920s lifestyle, a heroin-addicted street-walking prostitute and her daughter and two young children. There is also a chapter where seemingly unrelated characters in Palo Alto, CA—a group of pioneering computer hackers—find a way to contact payphones in Manhattan on the day of Petit’s performance, and try to get a live blow-by-blow account of the event from eye-witnesses. It’s a reminder to the reader of the state of technology at the time, and how different the world of 1974 was from today, when the event, no doubt, would have been broadcast on every television station and the Internet.This prompted our group to discuss our own “day-in-the-life” experiences we had on Sept. 11, when we first heard of the attacks on the twin towers. Not surprisingly, everyone in the room watched the horrendous events unfold on television.The high wire event loosely connects all the characters and it feels as though the lives are spinning and folding atop one another in unexpected ways. In spite of the darkness and at times, overwhelming grief associated with these character’s lives, the reader is left satisfied and reminded how different (and important) each life and each character’s personal story is.I give this book my highest recommendation....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,Dec 2010,"Dec 05, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

Performed beautifully by Octavia Spencer as Minny (who will also play her in the film), Jenna Lamia, who is the author of The Secret Life of Bees and Bahni Turpin, this book provided solid and poignant entertainment for about 18 hours. This story of a white southern woman, a recent graduate of Ole Miss with aspirations to become a writer--or do something meaningful with her life other than become another southern genteel woman who marries well. Her name is Eugenia, but she's called ""Skeeter."" Skeeter, gangly tall with unruly hair and socially awkward, was raised by a black maid by the name of Constantine. Constantine inexplicably disappears from her life while she is away at school and this leaves a big hole. Skeeter fills it by observing how white women (particularly her closest friends) treat their hired help--their black maids--and decides to write an exposé in the form of a book. She enlists the help of her friends' maids, the sensible and loving Aibileen, and the more outspoken and quick witted Minny. They work in secret, all tremendously fearing the consequences not only of their pending exposé, but also due to their mere ""inappropriate"" conversations/associations. This book explores the great racial divide between blacks and whites in Jackson, Mississippi prior to the height of the Civil Rights Movement. I didn't find the ultimate focus; however, to be negative or hateful--although there's an awful lot of material that had me shaking my head in shame and sorrow. There's no doubt that the white character Hilly, for example, is meant to be the villain and illustrative of the terrible prejudices that existed at this time. I finished this book focusing on the deep love that existed between the domestic help and the people whom they served, and applauded Skeeter, Aibileen and Minny for finding their voices and developing the courage to break molds and cross barriers.

You may be tempted to cast it aside and dive into another book on your long reading list, as was the case with more than one reader in my book group. Please don’t do that. It’s VERY much worth reading.This is a collection of short stories, all set in a small town in Maine. And it truly has a small town feel. There are a variety of characters, each in different places in their lives, and they all have one person in common: Olive Kitteridge. Olive is a retired schoolteacher, a large woman—at times larger than life. She’s domineering, outspoken and unapologetic. Some of the stories focus on her and her husband, Henry and their son, Christopher. And in many she plays just a small role, or her name is merely mentioned. She, however, never fails to have a profound affect on the lives of the characters and the gist of the story. She's one of those characters that you'll either love or hate--but I thought she was a brilliantly flawed creation and a unique string pulling me through the pages.These stories all explore the human condition, which makes the material highly relatable. As the characters reflect upon their lives, I couldn’t help but reflect upon my own and felt the author portrayed a deep understanding of what it means to raise children, be raised, age and continue to find meaning in one’s existence.Lest one think all the material is serious, a story called “Security,” had me laughing out loud at the God-fearing, “praise the Lord” spouting parrot.Overall, I felt it was an unusual format, but it worked for me and I highly recommend reading Olive Kitteridge.

And I recommend Liberty Rising to all intelligent Americans interested in the history of the political movement(s) in this country over the past 100 years. This is a well-researched, informative account of how the author believes our liberties have been eroded little by little since the Forefathers wrote the Constitution. His goal is, without a doubt, to help oust the current administration and members of congress due to an abuse of power (particularly citing the Health Care Reform Act) and promote tea party candidates; however, after reading the book cover-to-cover, one can’t help but be impressed with the strong evidence he cites to support his claims.I was asked to read Liberty Rising by someone I respect—even though we don’t necessarily share the same political beliefs. After reading the promotional blurbs on the covers and even the first chapter, I thought it was going to be just another right-wing, democrat-hating conservative on a rant to take back the country from the current ‘socialists’ or progressives in charge. I thought, do we really need another Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh or Laura Ingraham? Isn’t Robert Bonelli just preaching to the choir? I’m glad I stayed with it. It was a thorough history lesson often quoting the Bill of Rights, the Amendments to the Constitution and a variety of historical political writings and speeches. In addition, Bonelli taught me more about the tea party movement than anything I’d learned from the mainstream media. I don’t think I’m going to change my independent political affiliation anytime soon, and I’ll never be happy about or support extreme partisan politics; however, I think this book gives free-thinking intellectuals the chance to learn about the tea party movement without stirring up a lot of non-productive, vitriolic, partisan rhetoric.I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the political history of the United States....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Aug 2010,"Sep 04, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8976323-liberty-rising

It’s been sitting on my nightstand for . . . years! What finally motivated me to pick it up and dive in? Very simply, it was next on my long “to-read” list.Pope Joan relates the fascinating story of the little known female Pope, who reigned as Pope John VIII in the ninth century between Popes Leo IV and Benedict III. It was sometime around 853. The author calls this period the “darkest of the dark ages,” a time of widespread illiteracy. Record-keeping was not only incomplete, but also, her rise to the papacy was ultimately so scandalous, that the Catholic Church took great strides to expunge any account of her existence.And her existence continues to be controversial. Some consider it myth or legend . . . but the author makes a strong argument, citing an impressive slate of historical evidence—and especially because she writes such a riveting story of Joan’s life.Pope Joan is extremely well written. It’s full of history and color. It’s brutal, it’s romantic, it’s shocking, it’s triumphant. How Joan manages to survive each stage of her life—until her ultimate demise—will keep you turning pages.

It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me angry. Anything that can evoke this much emotion is, to me, WORTH the read. Broken For You is about Margaret, a woman near the end of her life in Seattle, Washington, who comes to terms with the circumstances that enabled her to inherit a fortune and preside over a precarious collection of artifacts. When she is diagnosed with a brain tumor, she finds a way to solve her personal puzzles and her lifelong dilemma of housing glass/ceramic/porcelain objects that were confiscated from European Jews during the Nazi regime. The first thing Margaret does is take-in a boarder, a young woman named Wanda. They are both in a sense, “broken,” and together they find a way to resolve their personal issues. Through art and the creation of a surrogate family, they bond and their stories unfold.That’s just a brief summation . . . but it’s worth reading every page to understand how they get to resolution—the unusual and even aggravating way they do it—and to meet the unique characters that play a role along the way.Well written, original and I highly recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Apr 2010,"Apr 20, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96702.Broken_for_You

First and foremost, it is extremely well written and very well crafted. Author, Nancy Horan, a resident of Oak Park, Illinois, spent seven years researching the material and it shows through her storytelling. Piecing together recorded history with her imagination and clear love-of-the-subject, this is one of the best books I've experienced in a long time. My initial interest in Frank Lloyd Wright, the man, was sparked by a childhood spent in the western suburbs of Chicago, including a stint in Oak Park, where Wright's studio remains. I can therefore appreciate the author's fascination with the reason for Wright's departure from Oak Park. She does not sugarcoat the subjects. Both Frank Lloyd Wright and his lover/mistress, Mamah Borthwick Cheney, are not entirely likeable characters. On the contrary. They are, nevertheless, as fascinating today as they were as the subjects of the sensational newspaper articles that appeared about them in the early Twentieth Century when they abandoned their spouses and children in order to pursue a life together. Highly recommended for those interested in historical fiction, architecture, the women's suffrage movement, and, of course, anything about Frank Lloyd Wright.

Very fast, with snappy dialogue and colorful characters. I admit I felt obligated to read it because not only do I belong to a bunco group, but also it just so happens I, too, wrote a novel about a group of women that play bunco. The novels share a ""borrowed interest"" on the popular dice game and also depict the strength of women's friendships. Reading it was (almost) as fun as a night out with the girls.Where the novels differ is how this talented storyteller, Maria Geraci, took the smart (commercial) approach of focusing primarily on one of the twelve women comprising the bunco group, and she brings in two others as significant satellite characters. It (again) makes for a fast read when you really only care about what's going on with one woman. However, I couldn't help but feel the others were left out, and it didn't truly give me a feel for the group.

I think Palin quit her job as governor of Alaska to cash-in on her celebrity and I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with that--even though it doesn't make me respect her. It will certainly never make me believe she's qualified to hold public office. That said:This is a readable, well-written memoir of an extraordinary woman. Chapter one paints the picture of an ordinary woman--a mother strolling around a state fair with a baby in her arms, and a small child at her side. Then she admires a photograph of a beautiful young baby, a poster in the RIGHT TO LIFE booth at the fair. ""That's YOU,"" she whispers to her daughter. This is no ordinary woman. This is a woman who has a child model for a highly charged political topic. This is a woman who is the governor of Alaska. As the model child begs her for more cotton candy and a ride on the roller coaster, this extraordinary woman longs to be ordinary again. She longs for a time when politics was not a part of her world. Her phone rings. It's the republican Presidential candidate asking her to consider joining his ticket as Vice President of the United States. She goes for it. Love her or hate her, this book is simply about her. Sarah Palin tells the story of her life from birth through school, through her introduction to politics and through her experience in the white, hot light of the big stage. The first half (schooling, sports, stint as mayor, etc.) is a bit dull. The juicier stuff--the more controversial stuff about the campaign--doesn't come up until the second half. Regardless, the entire missive is dedicated to telling her version of the truth. And she's entitled to do so. So, if you're interested in learning everything there is to know about this woman, you'll learn far more by reading this book than you did when you were trying to learn about her during the campaign.

And there’s noShrugging It OffI have the overwhelming desire to turn a cartwheel, to celebrate the completion of the chore of reading Atlas Shrugged. And there’s no mistaking it. Reading this 1168 page tome was a CHORE.Why did I take it on? Number one: It was the October selection for my book club, a group of women I cherish. Number two: It’s been on my bookshelf gathering dust since 1992. (Do the math. That’s 17 years).So, it took me 17 years to think about reading this monumental piece of literature, and six weeks to plow through it. Until yesterday, it took over my life. Perhaps slightly changed by reading this rich story of American industrialists in a capitalism vs. communism struggle, regardless, I want my life back—my productive, happy life. Because I had both the hardbound version and the audio version, the story and the characters rarely left me. The good news is that I didn’t just sit on my arse and read. While listening, I was a productive member of society and created an entire jewelry line using precious metals and copper. I’m not sure, however, if it would have earned me an invitation to “Galt’s Gulch” (Rand’s version of Atlantis). In fact, I had a hard time sorting through all the larger-than-life characters to find someone to whom I could relate.The heroes are all, perhaps, too perfect and the “looters” are all too pathetic. Dagny Taggert is a brilliant and beautiful engineer who runs a railroad. One of her many lovers is Hank Rearden, who creates a new, industry-changing metal. Another is Francisco d’Anconia, of the d’Anconia Copper family. And then, of course, there’s the most significant character of all, about whom we are asked from beginning and throughout the story, “Who is John Galt?” The king of the pathetic looters is James Taggert, Dagny’s moronic brother, who is one among a host of government-directed 'officials' who systematically take steps to destroy the country by imposing and acting upon a series of directives/acts.The story is fascinating and the characters are incredibly well drawn, albeit highly unlikeable. First published in 1959, some aspects are dated, and yet, current political and governmental activities, particularly relating to corporate bailouts and economic stimulus plans, make Atlas Shrugged eerily prophetic and certainly worth discussing in intellectual circles.Its biggest detriment is the length. Characters don’t dialog. Instead, they engage in proselytizing speeches that go on and on and on and on and on to the point of mind-numbing repetition. I think Rand could have easily gotten the same message/information/story across in half the number of pages. Now that I’m finished I don’t regret the reading experience. As a writer, I can’t help but admire Rand’s accomplishment and her amazing focus. I could take a page from her book—so-to-speak—and get back to writing my own novel. So, I will therefore close Atlas Shrugged once and for all (I don’t anticipate reading it again) and before I get back to work, I will contemplate my role in society and what I have to offer.First things first: Should I name the new jewelry line “Rearden Metals?” How about “Michele Shrugged?”Whatever....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Oct 08, 2009","Aug 26, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/662.Atlas_Shrugged

Per the title, the author, Barack “BarrGetting to Know Obama, the ManThere is no way around expressing that this is a remarkably well-written memoir. Per the title, the author, Barack “Barrry” Obama, tells not only his life story, but also focuses on the subject of race in America. He tells his personal history as well as the history of American’s race relations and understanding through the eyes of a biracial boy-turned man, coming of age in the late 20th Century. Throughout his life, it’s apparent Obama has commanded attention through his intelligence, good nature, handsome being, and strong family background. This tale is as much about his Midwestern-born white mother and grandparents, “Gramps” and “Toot,” as it is about his biological Kenyan-born father. It’s still remarkable to comprehend that this narrator, given his roots, eventually becomes the elected 44th President of the United States.I enjoyed listening to the narration of this story by the author. He unabashedly recalls both events and conversations of his youth, and without fear or tiresome, guarded political motivations. He expresses true accounts of his coming of age and the understanding of his heritage. And I particularly enjoyed Obama’s recollection of his journey to “Home Squared,” when he visited Kenya for the first time and related my own first visit to this fascinating country. Every American, black or white, can’t help but learn about the role of race plays in a community when traveling the streets of Nairobi or the red dirt roads of the Western Provence.Please read (or listen to) this book.

Too Many KidsI can honestly say I’ve never read anything quite like the life story of Irene Spencer in her memoir Shattered Dreams: My Life as a Polygamist’s Wife. Stories like this are seldom told. Either the subject doesn’t live to tell the tale, or more specifically, her lack of formal education, interaction with the outside world OR her religion would forbid it.My first thought upon finishing this long story of poverty, grief and heartache was, thank GOD she escaped this lifestyle and found a way to help the world to better understand plural marriage. To most of us, it’s a mystery. In spite of the current HBO television drama “Big Love,” which focuses on a polygamist family functioning in the outside world and fundamentalists living in a Utah colony, and last summer’s news story about the raid of a Texas colony practicing polygamy, I don’t think many outside of the Mormon church know much about the practice or the history of it. The author lays it all bare and particularly helps the reader understand the rationalizations and belief system behind the practice of polygamy. From growing up in a polygamist household and her struggle through the decision making process of staying faithful to her religion, she becomes the second wife of a man named Verlan LeBaron. What follows is a life of constant pregnancies, constant moving and constant disappointment.Spencer’s writing style is simple and charming. You can’t help but like her and stay with her through page after page of her complaints and heartbreaks. Above all else, it’s a fascinating story. I found myself constantly turning to the center photo spread to help keep track of what ultimately became a family of ten wives and over forty children. As I said, it’s amazing she lived to tell the tale.It’s one of those books that will remind you how important it is to count your blessings, and I recommend it for those who enjoy reading memoirs of unique characters....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Mar 2009,"Mar 30, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/275893.Shattered_Dreams

This is the story of an obsessed man, who with the all-or-nothing mentality in his makeup becomes the first undercover law enforcement agent to penetrate this notorious group. The story is conveyed with brutal honesty. Jay Dobyns, using the alias ""Bird"" relies not only on his memories of the two year ATF case known as ""Black Biscuit,"" but also on surveillance tapes and transcripts. They help provide detailed dialog between the operatives and their suspects. He puts you in the dark rooms, smoke-filled clubhouses, beer-soaked bars and inky tattoo parlors as you witness his transformation from a sandy-haired football star and all-American dad to a scary looking dude with a braided goatee. He becomes Bird. He also becomes a patched Hells Angel, sacrificing everything dear to him in the process: his family, his friends, and nearly his soul. In a moment, however, just before the case shuts down, he experiences a revelation. It's not merely about the good and evil among the Hells Angels or in himself, it was the basic understanding this ""brotherhood"" was ""nothing more than a support group for misunderstood loners held together by hate and money."" Immersed in this HATE for so long, he ultimately casts it aside for everything he LOVES, and expresses this personal epiphany with tremendous humility. In spite of a disappointing outcome for Black Biscuit and his exposure as an undercover agent, this makes Jay a hero, and makes No Angel a story worth reading. There are many characters on both sides of the law and a slew of unfamiliar terminology and acronyms, but photos, glossaries maps and lists are provided to guide the reader.

The stories are character-rich and are set in both India and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Regardless of the setting, Lahiri’s description is filled with minute, sensory-oriented detail. The characters become three dimensional as they share what humors and ails them. All are quite memorable, making each story stand out as an individual accomplishment.I enjoyed all nine, but among my favorites was “Blessed House,” about a young Indian couple in a new home. They find what seems to be an endless stash of Christian artifacts and these statues, icons and effigies tickle the wife, Twinkle, and horrify the husband, Sanjeev. I also loved the final story, “The Third and Final Continent,” told by a Bengali man who left India (Asia) in 1964, went first to London (Europe) and then Boston (North America) where he began is new life and faced his ultimate destination. What stands out most about this story is his experience with the 103 year-old landlady, Mrs. Croft, with whom he lived for several weeks prior to his wife’s arrival. It teaches him a lot about relationships, particularly the relationship that becomes most important to him.

Born Curtis Dall, then Curtis Boettinger after his stepfather, and finally Curtis Roosevelt, he is the son of Franklin and Eleanor’s oldest child (and only daughter), Anna. Anna divorced her husband Curtis Dall and moved to the White House when her two children were only six and three years old. Known as “Buzzie and Sistie,” the First Grandchildren immediately became the darlings of the press.Curtis writes that his life in the White House offered “immense and wonderful privilege,” yet admits it had a double edge. “Life outside the protection and isolated White House cocoon became hugely distorted, especially for an impressionable youngster like me . . . Intoxicated by the exhilarating environments . . . I created a dream world that protected me and it became a form of addiction.”This is an interesting take on what it was like to grow up in front of the press and in the White House, and it’s especially interesting on the verge of the new administration, when once again, young children will be involved. Will the impact be overwhelming as it was for this author? Or will it be like more recent children of Presidents (carefully shielded from the press) and merely be a unique phase of childhood? One can’t help but be fascinated by the offspring of our Presidents.This is a fascinating inside look at the Roosevelt family with an impressive collection of photos.

It’s just that during the course of this tale, their paths lead to the same place: home. It’s similar to the novel In Her Shoes by Jennifer Weiner, however, this is a new pair of sisters with a different set of challenges. The writing is very good and the characters well developed.The pretty one, Lauren, moves back to her childhood home in LA after a stint in New York for two reasons: She’s fired from her job and she learns her mother has breast cancer. Meanwhile, Ava, the smart sister, is still in LA busy with her job as an attorney. They are both beautiful in a Julianna Margulies kind of way, but Lauren has learned to flaunt her beauty with stylish fashions, while Ava hides it by wearing bad shoes and skirts that are too long. It’s very clear that they hold their labels closely. This is annoying. BUT, to counter these characteristics, they both have a wonderful sense of humor, a great rapport with one another, and are both very much like their extremely likeable mother, Nancy, who undergoes chemotherapy throughout the story.We see them deal not only with their mother’s cancer treatment, but also with their love lives (or potential love lives), and each learns more about herself and her sister by the last page. Very well done and my favorite of LeZabnik’s three novels....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 13, 2008","Nov 13, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3137694-the-smart-one-and-the-pretty-one

Overall, it wasDoes it All Come Down to Muscle Spasms?This was the choice for our December book club and, as it turns out, the only reason I read it. Overall, it was a highly unpleasant reading experience because I had little interest in the subject matter. That’s not to say the writing wasn’t good and the characters weren’t well drawn . . . it is to say, that the core of the story was completely outside of my comfort zone.This is the story of a male college professor, Dana, who falls in love with an adult female student named Allie, just prior to his gender reassignment surgery. Set in a small Vermont town, when Allie decides to stand by Dana during and after the surgery, she becomes the town pariah. As a sixth grade teacher, Allie faces an unsupportive school administration and parents who pull their kids from her classroom. Meanwhile, her ex-husband, Will, and their daughter, Carly, are featured prominently through chapters of first person narration (interspersed with accounts from both Dana and Allie), and we learn about the evolution of their acceptance (and lack of acceptance) of the situation facing their family. Will works for the local public radio station and gets to the core of the story of the male to female transsexual and his female lover’s decision to standby him/her for broadcast, and ultimately it’s Carly who brings the story to NPR’s All Things Considered.I’m willing to bet it’s the NPR angle that led my book club to this choice. Trans-Sister Radio succeeds at indirectly showing how the seeds of an extraordinary story comes to fruition on a respected show like All Things Considered; however, as for the story itself: Descriptive details of either male or female genitalia and the intimate act of coupling, for me made this book distasteful at best. Regardless of whether the sex acts were about male/female or female/female, throw a transsexual into the mix, too often it made me want to throw the book aside. It was an odd feeling to juggle the concept of people wanting their private lives to remain private, and yet readers are given a magnifying glass to look inside AND know that the entire story was broadcast over the airwaves not once but twice.Unless you have a strong interest in the subject of gender reassignment or you know a transsexual and would like to understand the mindset of this individual, I don’t see any reason to spend time reading this book. If you’re a public radio fan and want to know more about the inner workings of a radio operation, perhaps All I Did Was Ask by Terry Gross would be a better choice....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 04, 2008","Nov 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/126814.Trans_Sister_Radio

Yes, this is another diet book, but it caters to an area that is particularly sensitive to women. NO MORE MUFFIN TOPS over the jeans may be a goal of many a post-pregnancy, premenopausal woman. The claim is to get a better or flatter belly in 32 days and the plan is designed to inspire. The diet is made up of two parts: ""the four-day anti-bloat jumpstart,"" and the ""four-week Eating Plan."" So, I guess the true  will come after using these methods. Perhaps an addendum will be forthcoming. Meanwhile, the mantra of this book is ""A MUFA at Every Meal."" Apparently this term has been around for a while, but it means: Monounsaturated Fatty Acid. It's the ""good fat,"" and includes things like avocado, almonds and, thank God, dark chocolate. Having a MUFA at every meal will help you feel satisfied rather than deprived. Intake will reduce belly fat and LDL cholesterol, i.e. the BAD cholesterol. There are 84, 400-calorie MUFA quick meals and 28, 400-calorie snack options to guide you on your way. Stay tuned.

Married to an aggressive war-focused President, who she finds both “undeniably handsome” and “some sort of dimwit,” Alice comes to realize she’s given up her values by being the good wife, marrying into a family where loyalty is everything.

She has a knack for storytelling in a way that makes reading like listening to a funny girlfriend go on and on about her trials and tribulations. As in her first novel with these characters, Scot On The Rocks (Red Dress Ink Novels), she takes time out to have her narrator address the reader with regular comments like, ""oh come on now . . . like you wouldn't do the same thing in my situation."" Well, in most cases I probably wouldn't, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment of Brooke Miller's farcical tale of a neurotic New York attorney planning her wedding, while at the same time preparing a super-secret, tabloid-worthy partner dissolution case with her fiancé, Jack Solomon, as opposing counsel. I recommend reading Scot on the Rocks prior to this sequel because the main characters, Brooke, Jack and Brooke's best friend, Vanessa--all likeable characters--will definitely feel more developed through this next phase of their lives together. The secondary characters in Jack With a Twist are necessary, but borderline cliché--the mother who never met a glass of champagne she didn't drink; Brooke's loving, kosher butcher father; the snobby, lobster-loving mother-in-law-to-be and her equally-snobby daughters with their matching husbands; the big-to-do Judge father-in-law-to-be; the southern belle villain attorney assisting Jack on the case . . . even the French fashion designer, all fell a little flat for me. Much of the story was predictable; however, the writing style and the voice of Brooke overcame these weaknesses and made this an overall fun, light, and quick reading experience. Brenda Janowitz has a fan here and will, I'm sure, develop many additional fans with this style and these characters. I won't be surprised to see the third book in this series . . . first comes love--then comes marriage--then comes . . . ?

This is good YA literature, which crosses over with both juvenile AND more sophisticated humor to appeal to adult readers as well. It’s also reflective of the human condition, where a very grown-up-for-her-age character named Lily, 13, has been abandoned by her father and faces a gypsy lifestyle with her free-spirited mother, Arden. Lily and Arden move into their newest home in Cape May, which is a summer tourist town on the coast. Only it’s not summer. Instead of tourists roaming the beaches and the Victorian homes, there are ghosts. Plenty of them.Lily is left home alone in her Uncle Wes’s huge home while her mother goes off to work at a jewelry and gift store in town. This is Arden’s version of “home schooling.” What Lily learns about is actually the home—and the ghosts that haunt it. With help from her new friend “Vaz,” (who her mother calls a HOT TACO (!) and then punishes her for kissing him), Lily learns the history of her notorious family.Some challenging vocabulary words for young readers and probably better suited for ages 13+.

The characters are rich, unique, and memorable in a way that has worked into my own personal history of the love of reading.We begin by getting to know “the oldest man in the world,” Leopold Gursky. There’s an ironic aspect to “Leo” as he attempts to make himself known to the world everyday. He’s afraid he’ll die and no one will know he’s missing. This is, perhaps, the result of having to make himself invisible during the years of Nazi occupation . . . and for becoming non-existent in the life of his one true love, Alma, (who moves to America before him and marries someone else), and his son, who is a famous writer. Leo does this by making little scenes like knocking over displays in stores and interacting with his best friend “Bruno.” Meanwhile, he believes his first manuscript, ""The History of Love,” has perished in a flood. It hasn’t. It’s been published in another language and under another name. His second manuscript has a similar fate and it’s amazing that author Nicole Krauss enables this plot twist to both break your heart and make it burst with love at the same time.The History of Love inspires the naming of the other main character, Alma Singer, who at the age of 14, takes us on her journey to find not only the author, but the person requesting her mother’s translation, and the real life Alma. She’s primarily concerned with making her widowed mother happy, but also becomes wrapped up in the mystery that is The History of Love, and she ties everything together.This is one of the best books I’ve read in a very long time for the exquisite writing, the unique characters, and the creative plot.

Having first read an excerpt from this work during the Amazon Shorts contest earlier this year, I knew it was something I would eagerly read in its entirety. Unwilling to put it down from the minute I opened it, this book not only didn’t disappoint, but it also exceeded my expectations for three distinct reasons: Lyrical prose, extremely well-drawn characters—both primary and secondary—and a captivating story.This is the story of Jane—“Jane Bowman, drums.” We meet her at an early age and find her instantly loveable and sympathetic. She is the daughter of a famous percussionist, Helen Bowman, (a “heavy-hitting, Latin-jazz ‘congera’ ”) and a notorious grandmother, Isabella, known as the “Mistress of Mambo.” Drums are in Jane’s blood. Appropriately titled, “Rhythm,” the beat of this story is instantly apparent: It’s the beat of Jane’s heart as she makes her way through life after tragically losing her mother in a nightclub fire.Goldsby, an accomplished pianist and recording artist, has done her research. You’ll have a front row seat for the jazzy undertones in the language--so much that you may even be able to hear the tunes as you read. Comical background characters like Mary One and Mary Two, along with Jane’s best friend Leo, keep Jane real. Her father and Grandpa Jack offer loving support and then there’s also Olivia Blue. When her story comes to the forefront it brought me to tears.Well done, well done, well done.

It's incredibly rich in scenic description, character nuances and, most importantly, mood setting tone. Wallace Stegner lives on through his writing and we shall all be richer for this reading experience. This novel, while focused on a socially turbulent era (late 1960s), is timeless. Generational and political conflict, as well as the matters of preservation and development, life and death, and the persistence of human crisis will always be relevant topics. And so we have the characters portrayed in All the Little Live Things. Joe Allston, the narrator, is much like a diarist recording his keen and colorful observations from his five-acre hideout in glorious California. With his wife Ruth at this side, together they grieve the loss of their 37-year-old son, and try to fit in as key players in their new community. Meanwhile, a freethinking, anti-establishment sort named Jim Peck squats on Allston's property--first with permission--however, Peck takes extreme liberties. Joe's distain for him (and his beard!) is the focus of much of the novel, and it leads him to come to terms with his feelings toward his son. Meanwhile, there's another neighbor, a young woman named Marian, who helps enable Joe to come to terms with his feelings about both life and death. This is the most beautifully written novel I've read all year.

There's a laugh on every page of Dear Neighbor Drop Dead. From page one, I felt I had to fasten my seatbelt, as the quick pace and over-the-top characters just cracked me up. It was quite a ride through this Long Island neighborhood full of twists and turns and page-turning gusto. Although primarily Mindy's story, this is the tale of Mindy and Beth. Beth is THE neighbor from hell, a first-class beyotch, who puts on the perfect routine and is so mean to everyone--particularly the big-hearted Mindy--she's easy to loathe. Mindy and Beth are thrown together through a variety of circumstances and their relationship as frenemies develops in unexpected and amusing ways. Every secondary character no matter how important or trivial to the story is beautifully developed and makes this quick read highly enjoyable. Be prepared to experience the culture of modern Jewish families. You'll hunger for a New York bagel and smile at the expressions: ""It's never the stuff you worry about that happens, it's the stuff you don't see coming that incapacitates you like a Taser. And nothing like five-thousand volts of electricity to get your undivided attention."" I had to agree with Mindy's stepson, Aaron, when he proclaims: ""I like being Jewish. You guys really know how to party."" To which Mindy, ever the wit, replies: ""Next to suffering, it's what we do best."" Very well done.

Three of the four meet for the first time in the garden, and their relationship/s become tied with an intriguing subplot about Edgar Allan Poe. I'd say this story is primarily character-driven and I found it hard to put down. Mary is the tragic, beaten wife of the evil Dean Havemeyer. On faculty at Manhattan U (a fictionalized version of NYU), she has made a name for herself as a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, however, she's stressed and preoccupied with the personality changes in her husband, her daughter's upcoming wedding and her plan to move to San Francisco. Hannah is a former model whose husband, a professor of computer science, is obsessed with her looks. When we meet her she's steeped in guilt over her recent affair with one of her professors in the MFA program. She claims her husband is a sweet, wonderful man, but as his character develops there's all evidence to the contrary. Sophia is a feisty former Hollywood agent to the stars. She married her movie star client's brother, an egghead expert on Edgar Allan Poe, and gave it all up to have babies. Ashleigh is an in-the-closet lesbian, afraid to admit her sexual preference to her parents, particularly her right-wing conservative father the senator. She works as an attorney for the family law firm and is the only member of the ""club"" who isn't married to a Manhattan U professor. Each character is given equal time to develop her role within the plot and her relationship/s with the other women. This well written story doesn't lapse into gossipy accounts of lifestyles and decisions, but instead progresses through believable dialogue and very real characters. It left me satisfied and reassured that when women get together, they can accomplish amazing things. Well done. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Sep 2008,"Sep 15, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2774907-the-professors-wives-club

Anyriendship Through Scrap BookingThis story centers on a group of women living outside of Atlanta, who gather each week to make scrapbook creations. Any woman who is part of a scrap booking group, or women's group of any kind (like a book club, bunko group, or knitting circle) will easily relate to these women and understand the strength and bonds of friendship that go along with meeting regularly. There are eight women in the group, but only three, Ashley, Libby and Tara are prominently featured, beautifully fleshed out, and have intriguing story lines. Ashley is the mother of four with a louse of a husband. I cringed when at one point he actually calls her a ""fat pig."" She is the daughter of a super model, ""Marrie,"" who is as famous as ""Twiggy."" Tara is a beautiful doctoral student, who is preparing her art history thesis on the Spanish artist Miró and is in love with her louse of an advisor. Libby, the ""mother"" of the group who takes care of everyone, deals with a public scandal brought on by her son's corporate greed. This plot line, along with a surprising twist involving Tara and Ashley are the most enjoyable aspects of the book and what kept me reading. Scrap booking is merely a device to bring them together and I only grew impatient when the subject or action of scrap booking came up. Regardless, it all works and author, Kathleen Reid, couldn't have picked a better title for this novel. The most powerful aspect of this tale is the positive nature of friendships between women, and the support the group members give one another through difficult times. One aspect of the plot regarding Tara's Miró thesis was NOT resolved, however, and this left me wondering . . . .

Her selection came as a surprise and I had to try and understand why John McCain chose her, other than because she brings excitement and intrigue to the ticket. This brief book, a character sketch, is written in a straightforward style. It holds Sarah Palin in a very positive light. (Initially published before her selection as the GOP running mate, this version has been renamed and scooped up by people like me as an attempt to get to know her.) She is portrayed as an ordinary mom (a hockey mom) who, according to her father, has had an impenetrable stubborn streak since childhood. The family came to Alaska from Idaho in 1969. She is the daughter of a teacher (and part time hunting/fishing guide) and a school secretary. They lived modestly. Her highlight real in public life includes a captain's position on the high school JV basketball team, the beauty queen title ""Miss Wasilla,"" and stint on the city council. This was her introduction to the good old boys network, which she has spent the rest of her career pushing aside. She was elected president of the Alaska Council of Mayors, chaired the gas and oil conservation commission and gained a reputation as a reformer. Next step: the Governor's office, which she's held for two years. Does this brief introduction to this head-turning politician enable the reader to decide whether or not she's qualified to be a heartbeat away from the highest elected office in the land? No. Is it an interesting read? Yes. All party politics aside, she's a fascinating woman. And right now, this slim book provided more information than I could get anywhere else. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Sep 2008,"Sep 08, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3212481-sarah

When Pausch's diagnosis became terminal, this otherwise upbeat, dream-driven man dedicated his remaining months to recording everything he deemed important his children know about him. It's deeply affecting, and often brought tears to my eyes--not only because of his sad fate, but also because of his clear passion for living. One doesn't feel like an intruder while reading this highly personal memoir and collection of anecdotal essays about lessons learned. Instead, it's more like being a student in a class called ""How to Life Your Life.""The Last Lecture is a beautiful gift to those who knew him, and those who will never have the opportunity to meet him.

The main thing this book has going for it is the strong writing skills of the author, Ellen Meister. She has a knack for believable, natural dialog and good timing when it comes to humor. It's a quick, easy read--a great way to pass time on an airplane, which is where I got through most of this novel.This is the story of Bev, the ""smart one"" of three sisters. Her older sister, Clare is the pretty one and her younger sister, Joey, is the wild one. If anything, Meister nails the common stereotypes of sibling labeling and relationships, and it's easy to believe these characters act the way they do in this story. Additionally there's the boy next door, Kenny, who is the funny one, I suppose--the angry youth turned studly romantic interest. He uses hackneyed humor to cope with his anger over a no-good father, whose past actions are central to the plot. Kenny's strings of jokes about little people and his behavior toward Bev really take his character over the top, making him highly unlikable. One wonders how ""the smart one"" can continue to want him.Overall the story is predictable. I was able to predict nearly every plot point and would have preferred to be surprised. But I stuck with it because I enjoyed Meister's first book, Secret Confessions of the Applewood PTA.

With a generous number of characters to wrap one's mind around, the author lures you into the world of Hollywood wealth, fame, debauchery, (BJ parties anyone?) D-cups, and Botox. With for-publicity fundraising as the primary redeeming quality to these otherwise shallow, status-and-money-conscious self-proclaimed ""trophies,"" this is a sometimes amusing, sometimes painfully dull and slow-moving, sometimes juicy beach read page-turner. Containing several distracting typos, it's about 200 pages too long, and these pages (or short chapters) fail to move forward the plot of the systematic dethroning of TOP trophy Marion Zane by her so-called well-defined friend and sister trophy, Lyndy. Most of the other secondary trophies are a bit stereotypical and aren't as colorful or interesting as Marion or Lyndy. Claire, the Midwestern beauty queen who marries a big shot Hollywood producer and becomes stepmother to three spoiled children is, however, the exception. Claire enters this arena as a trophy newbie, and shows rather than tells how seemingly ""normal"" girls with big princess dreams find themselves living these surreal lives. But what the heck? I didn't buy this book expecting a great work of literature. I just wanted to trash around in the world of what passes these days as popular women's fiction. I definitely got what asked for, which was a few laughs and some unforgettable characters. Good for you Heather Thomas. Write another one.

This book seems to me a gift of sorts, the sharing of a story or a dream, rather than a philosophy or even a lesson in alternative theology. It's one of those tales, controversial now because of its tremendous popularity and success, which allows you to draw your own conclusions and relate the characters and circumstances to your own life. In other words: take from it what you will and hopefully that will be the overwhelmingly positive message contained within. And that is a message of LOVE and forgiveness. This is about a man named Mack who loses his daughter, Missy, in a brutal and seemingly unforgiveable manner. In the aftermath, the grieving years--or The Great Sadness--he receives a mysterious note asking him to return to the scene of the crime. Mack's friend Willie tells the story of Mack's journey to The Shack where his daughter was killed, and the personal spiritual awakening Mack undergoes while there. The writing is a bit unsophisticated and at times, repetitive. When it failed to move the story forward (and I was so interested in having it unfold), I grew impatient. But then, the overall content, which is the message the main character, Mack, receives and his storyteller, Willie, conveys, allowed me to relate to much of it on a very personal level. There is value in this story for me not because it showed me a different way to look at God, but instead, it showed me a different way to look at my RELATIONSHIPS.

It portrays the vast differences in lifestyles and the feelings these two racial groups have toward one another as they coexist and attempt to survive day-to-day life. Full of surprises and an unending string of bad luck, their lives are intertwined in such a way that it makes the reader consider their commonalities as much as their differences.

Her LaMummy DearestReading this book, the story of Susanna's upbringing and early years of marriage and motherhood, was like reading someone's diary. Her Last Death is the intimate purging of an extraordinary life with Mummy--perhaps one of the most unfit and reckless characters ever to raise children. What's remarkable is that Susanna not only lived to tell the tale, but also ultimately seems to have turned out to be quite ""normal."" She has certainly realized her potential as an educated and talented writer. It's the good writing that got me through this quick read. It certainly wasn't the subject matter. I kept asking myself, uh--WHY am I reading this? It had a definite Mommie Dearest revenge factor thing going for it, but the author's love for her mother came through as well, as she struggled to find herself while standing in an overwhelming shadow. I think it made me appreciate my own childhood, and marvel at the power we have over our children in mapping out the world for them. The mother she names ""Daphne,"" (the author makes it clear in the front notes that all names but her own have been changed), is in a word, outrageous. Living a sexy, single-girl life with two baby girls in tow, she consistently puts herself, along with her drug and sex addictions, ahead of the responsibilities of motherhood. From a daughter's eyes, the reader senses Susanna's conflict of love and betrayal as she bestows the horrendous details of her childhood. Namely, her mother's constant offerings of cocaine and alcohol to the adolescent Susanna, parading an endless line of lovers through their apartments and hotel rooms, her need to seduce each and every one of Susanna's friends (particularly the boyfriends), and explaining orgasm and introducing birth control when her daughter was hardly beyond puberty. It made me feel both sick and very sad. Susanna divulges several of her own poor choices on the way to her life, as well as her initial struggles with motherhood. She may not be the most likable character walking the roads of Montana; however, due to the way she was raised, she has evoked this reader's sympathy.

It's a long one, especially when you devour each little word contained in the many footnotes, but worth every hour spent. Reading this thorough, well-researched, and respectful biography of three notorious singer-songwriters, Carole King, Joni Mitchell and Carly Simon, from their days as young, aspiring artists to current days as grandmothers, was like listening to their music for the first time again. I couldn't help but break out my vinyl, stored in a moving box in the attic. Sheila Weller clearly spent years gathering facts, information and quotes from those closest to these icons, (and in some cases from the women themselves), and braids the three stories together to paint a historical account of modern folk/rock/pop music. She doesn't merely regurgitate already published material from music s and Rolling Stone articles, but instead offers similarities and differences that made this reader appreciate the subjects as individuals as well as their contributions and reflections on the women's movement in general. A surprising ribbon running through this braid is James Taylor, who had profound yet differing relationships with all three. What also ultimately struck me about the book was how deeply interested I was at the beginning and how it merely passed the time toward the end. I think it's a direct reflection on the careers of these women: exciting, fresh, ultra-talented in the beginning. . .but in the end, it becomes a biography of ordinary--albeit ambitious--women who've led extraordinary lives while looking for love and fulfillment, and endured tremendous public scrutiny. One thing the critics in our society can't take from them is their recorded music--their true biographies--and I, for one, will listen to them sing for the rest of my life. Very well written, very well done and I certainly recommend this book to fans of these musicians (as well as James Taylor, and others like Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young), and to those interested in the music scene as it developed and evolved through the 1960s-1980s. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 10, 2008","May 12, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2319322.Girls_Like_Us

Well . . . I'm sorry to report these front and back cover comparisons are just good copywriting. I'm not saying this author isn't talented. She is. She's funny, smart, quirky, writes well, and has a few 20-something stories to relate to, perhaps, essay-readers of her generation and fellow Manhattan-ites who may never tire of telling or hearing the same stories again and again and again. (Boss from hell, moving, etc.)I'm afraid there's nothing new here--a few chuckles and clever witticisms, but mostly I found this to be a monotonous collection of tales from a young woman shaking off the selfishness of youth and coming of age. Of varying length and format, these essays aren't polished and there are attempts to give a last-line/full-circle zinger in several cases; however, for me they didn't work. Further, I knew there was a generation gap when she started waxing nostalgic about video games in the excerpt entitled ""Bring Your Machete To Work Day."" And I didn't quite know how to take the proclamation: [I] ""find people who publicly strive to make the world a better place to be moderately annoying."" I feel I should have been more on board with her sense of humor by 117 pages into the book where this appears. Nevertheless, I can't blame the author for these particular criticisms--which means this book had more of an audience problem for me, rather than a talent problem. I'd love to read more of Crosley's work, say in another decade or two. My guess is that she's going to get better and better.Bottom line: Good writing, mildly humorous, nothing new for baby-boomers, but probably great for Gen X'ers and those who follow . . . what are they called?

I simply wasn't motivated to get to the end of the story, most likely because of the structure. The plot is predictable by design, and I found it very sad--neither uplifting nor particularly moving. The writing starts out strong, with great use of mood and description, but soon lapses into the annoying habit of relying on italicized internal dialog for the main character. She is a young woman named Kathy, who escapes her sad life in Louisiana, boards a bus for the unknown, and winds up in southern California. A second character, Lacey, (Kathy's co-worker at a construction company) has an occasional chapter, where she primarily obsesses over finding out more about Kathy, but this is very much Kathy's story and Lacey is tragically short-changed.Kathy goes back in time from her arrival on ""Pacific Avenue"" in SoCal, to the years just prior and her complicated, young-adult life, her bi-racial relationship with a troubled Viet Nam vet named Richard, their child, Jamie, and her racist parents--particularly her hateful mother--and her relationship/s with a group known as the ""Motleys,"" who put on puppet shows for a living. Skimming over anything to do with the puppets and the shows, I kept looking to the pages that moved the story forward and played out the details as to why she felt the need to escape.Ultimately, one feels great sympathy for Kathy. She's innocent and likeable; however, that internal italicized dialog kept getting in the way. On each page I wanted to tell her to SPEAK UP!

Forced into an arranged marriage and then divorced when she produces a daughter (Latifa) rather than a son, she's taken in by one of her kind brothers and manages to get an education and a position with Iraq's government-controlled newspaper, Babel. As a professional journalist she writes about the plight of her fellow countrymen, doing her best to infiltrate the work with both genuine praise to Allah and false praise of Hussein's regime. And even though she manages to keep her revealing, personal poetry a secret, she's soon discovered as a threat and an enemy, tortured and marked for death because of her writing and because of information that is revealed to her. Meanwhile back in New York, Charles Sherman, a hard-working, hotshot attorney and 9/11 survivor, is asked to take the case of her potential asylum pro-bono. He's in the midst of a career make-or-break contract negotiation and has a rather rocky romance to deal with as well. Because of his inordinate number of appropriate worldwide contacts and his highly likeable and heroic nature, he's the perfect man for the job.Thoroughly taken in by the story, I found it hard to put down this book. At times, however, I felt the minute-to-minute details burdensome and wished the story moved more quickly. Other times I felt the urge to get out my editor's red pen and turn five words into one, and cut blocks of copy where it bogged down. Also, I'm all for word wealth, but this reading experience sent me to my dictionary a few times when lofty vocabulary words were used in place of simpler (more readable) selections, particularly in the beginning. Fortunately, this technique subsided after the first few chapters and I was pleased to learn some basics regarding the Sunni and Shiite differences and conflicts, and consider the differences between American and Muslim cultures. They, by the way are better illustrated through simple character development than Fatima's preaching, but at least it made Charles all the more likeable--and believable--particularly as he's taken in by Fatima's obsidian eyes and her sometimes strong, sometimes wavering resolve. She, nevertheless, is a classic tragic heroine--hence the romanticism of this modern story.D.J. Murphy is clearly a writing talent and I appreciate time spent reading A Thousand Veils.

It doesn't mean, however, that this isn't a valuable book and another reminder of the dangers American children face, particularly when they're left unsupervised. Alcohol and drug addiction, an equal-opportunity disease, remains a menace in this society, and I think the true purpose of this book is to alert parents of adolescents and teens to what's beyond their suburban fences and to PAY ATTENTION.When an addict lives to tell the tale, it's always cause for celebration. Jennifer Storm writes with a simple, disarming style, wears it all on her sleeve, and bares little if any residual shame--just the ugly truth of her life as an addict. She illustrates the three distinct paths ahead for anyone drinking and drugging to that degree: jail, death, or recovery. And in spite of spending a good portion of her teen years experiencing blackout, she remembers and relates quite a bit about being raped (more than once) and her foray into intoxication to escape ""the pain,"" from simply stealing sips of her mother's green liquor to becoming a suicidal crack addict.There's room for these stories outside of AA meetings and in commercial fiction, with the hope that anyone who stumbles upon this book will find information, solace, and perhaps, steps toward recovery for themselves or someone they love. Storm also touches on why recovering addicts feel the need to share, when she relates a scene during the ride to rehab in ""a druggie delivery car with a stoned crackhead"" to her right, who acknowledges her in a way that shows he understands. It puts her at ease.I recommend this book for parents of at risk children. If you know someone who fits this description, hand him or her a copy of Blackout Girl and suggest they read it cover to cover. Given the generally selfish and disengaged nature of these types of parents, you might have to read it out loud. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Apr 09, 2008","Mar 29, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2034321.Blackout_Girl

Highly readable and very funny, turning pages of this slim paperback is as easy as watching a feature film about your funniest friend getting in over her head in situation after situation--all the while checking to make sure you're still there, letting her know everything's going to be okay.This is the story of Brooke Miller, a bumbling attorney at one of NYC's high-power big firms, and her quest to survive her ex-boyfriend's wedding, which takes place in LA. Dumped by her Scottish boyfriend, Douglas, just before the Hollywood A-list event, she manages to talk her best friend, Jack, another attorney (a partner in the making at the firm) into donning a kilt and posing as Douglas at the wedding. And this is where the fun begins as her scheme unravels bit by bit, from lost luggage to stylistic sabotage and a surprising, funny twist around every corner.Author, Brenda Janowitz, has given this zany character a true likeability and her technique of ""talking to the reader"" at any given time is refreshing and delightful. It's not the first time I've seen this style, but I have to say, it's the first I've read when each time she (the main character) predicts what I (the reader) am thinking, she's spot on!

I heard Scott Spencer on my car’s radio the other day when tuned to NPR with Terry Gross, and even though I arrived at my destination, I stayed seated (with my seatbelt in place) just to hear him read more excerpts from this unusual story, Willing.

A writer’s writer, Spencer is a master of description and has a keen wit filled with gritty, streetwise originality. From the initial description of his narrator, Avery Jankowsky, to every curious character leading up to and embarking upon an around the world sex tour, which is the heart of this dark tale, possibly the only thing short-changed is the answer to the question, who was the man doing pushups in the hotel room? Other than that, this story holds nothing back. StreetwiseAvery is a freelance writer in his late 30s, who has just discovered his young girlfriend has been unfaithful. Already damaged by being raised by four fathers and a self-centered mother, he accepts an opportunity presented by his Uncle Ezra to sleep with beautiful women in a series of Nordic countries. It’s a $135,000 gift, which leads to a book opportunity that will have enormous financial benefits—thus solving his previous fate of being poor. As if that were the basis of all his problems.As the trip unfolds, Avery learns there is a very high price to pay for the decisions he’s made. “Even the milk from our mother’s breast comes with a bill that we are eventually meant to pay.” And his mother, Naomi, makes this all very clear. Avery tries to justify his lapse into debauchery by telling himself things like (the headline of this ), “you can’t always care about what you do and how you behave;” however, it’s Naomi who shows him the exact opposite is true.This is excellent work and I give it my highest recommendation....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Mar 25, 2008","Mar 22, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1704737.Willing

If, however, you seek out this book to read about bunko or the women who play the game of bunko, take a pass. A sweet and unsophisticated storytelling style, which might better be titled ""Becca and Her Babes,"" or even ""The Real Christian Housewives of Oklahoma,"" this is the first-person musings of a woman in her mid-30s. She is a wife and mother of twin teens, who is suffering from (at first) an unspecified illness, which leads to moodiness, guilt over the moodiness, minor misunderstandings with her friends, ""the babes,"" and childish--amazingly immature--behavior regarding her mother's pending marriage. So, she's flawed, and that's a good thing, but in spite of her soon-diagnosed life threatening illness, do we champion her?Becca is first and foremost a Christian. There are Biblical passages peppered throughout the pages, and her faith is what gets her through each hour of the day, particularly when she talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk. Instead of giving us reasons to love her and her equally childish friend, Jessica, however, Becca slips in and out of her selfish behavior especially where her mother's pending marriage is concerned. ""I hate to admit it but it gives me a perverse pleasure to think of embarrassing her in front of her new love. Maybe, he'll decide we're `white trash' and change his mind about marrying her."" Becca admits her attitude is ""hardly Christian,"" but this confession doesn't necessarily make her likeable. When her mother comes to visit, her husband is miffed because Becca refuses to exercise her ""good breeding"" to prepare for the visit. White trash? Good breeding? It's really hard to tell. What bothered me most about the characters is their lack of honesty with one another. When her mother's fiancé, to cite one example, tells Becca he wants to meet her friends (""if they're anything like you, it will be a joy,"") I couldn't believe it, particularly because Becca makes a point to be especially sullen in his presence.Overall I'd say this is a decent first-novel, with a first-novel feel . . . adult night school writing and autobiographical material.

Well done About My Sisters deserves my highest recommendation. It is well written, funny, insightful and truthful. Mostly, however, it is relatable. Anyone with sisters--make that siblings--will relate to the feelings expressed and the stories told by this gifted author. While her focus is on the relationship(s) between four sisters who have a fifteen-year age spread, it is also about their sole brother, their unique parents and the author's son. It reads a lot like a novel, but I found it so much more enjoyable knowing these are real characters existing in a loving and tight-knit family. I became so interested in them that half way through the book I contacted the author through her website and asked her to identify each character as pictured on book cover of the hardback edition.The reason I was so interested in them? The author writes with deep respect and a fearless honesty. Every story--even those about arguments--is awash with love. Debra Ginsberg allows the reader into her family and makes it a comfortable place to be. What's truly interesting about that is I don't think I'd be comfortable actually sitting with them during one of their many raucous family gatherings . . . but being the fly on wall was a fun place for me.I purchased this book because of having similar family dynamics. I, too, am one of four girls in a family with a lone brother--making us five with a ten year spread. Unlike the author, however, I'm not the eldest of the tribe and don't possess her wisdom and knowledge of every phase of the family's changing traits.

Facing her 30th birthday without a job (or a boyfriend), and a best friend who is so engrossed with her new boyfriend and a spiritual teacher known as ""Ma,"" Michelle allows herself to be talked into attending a lecture in Boulder. Something clicks for Michelle when she enters this seemingly welcoming community and she ends up moving to Boulder and investing an enormous amount of money she doesn't have to a lecture series. Further, she volunteers her time to create a web site for Ma, a project she'd normally charge $5000 to complete.The style Lena Phoenix presents feels more like memoir than fiction, and this makes it easy for the reader to not only believe everything that happens, but also to understand it. Instead of getting upset with Michelle for handing over more cash and more hours, and for rationalizing so many of the inconsistencies in Ma's teachings, I found myself saying, ""yes, I can see how easy it is for a person in this situation to behave like this and believe these things.""The writing is easy to read, several typos notwithstanding, and I recommend for readers who enjoy reading first novels and for anyone interested in learning more about how and why people get involved with cults or alternative spiritual quests....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Oct 2006,"Mar 10, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1531115.The_Heart_of_a_Cult

The Secret Between Us, a novel by Barbara Delinsky, defines ""a fast read."" The writing is clearly the effort of a pro and flows from page to page with lots of dialog and little description or prolonged prose. The storytelling is first rate. I was riveted.The main character, a woman named Barbara, is likeable and believable. She's a divorced mother of two, a small-town doctor. In the opening pages, she and her daughter, Grace, have a terrible accident, when their car hits a pedestrian on a dark, rainy night. The story unfolds from there, when Deborah takes the blame, even though her 15-year-old daughter was behind the wheel. Throughout the police report/investigation, this is the ""secret"" between them and it causes a myriad of complications. Probably the strongest message coming from these pages is about parent and child relationships, and how expectations can both help and hinder. It certainly made me think about my relevant relationships.Deborah's sister, Jill, an independent bakery owner and somewhat of family black sheep, is likeable too. As for most of the other characters, I'm afraid I found them not only unlikable, but also contrived. The selfish ex-husband; the patriarchal--even cruel--father; the loopy, grieving widow; the kind-hearted chief of police; the philandering high-powered attorney and his pathetic wife/best friend of the protagonist; the brother of the accident victim, Tom McKenna, walking the tightrope between both sides of the issue; the accident victim himself, Grace's history teacher at the local high school; the visually impaired younger brother; and especially the teenaged daughter, Grace, all seemed to me like paper cutout dolls, with unsurprising words and actions.All these characters notwithstanding, the story was compelling, truly outlining how a seemingly normal life can change in an instant. Overall I'd say it was worth the read, reminding me of authors like Anita Shreve and Jodi Picoult. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Feb 29, 2008","Feb 28, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1268348.The_Secret_Between_Us

There's nothing really new here, however, in terms of teaching truth seekers or those at a spiritual crossroads. Most of the time I found myself nodding and saying things like, ""yes, that's true;"" or ""good for you for finding enlightenment."" On the other hand, I particular liked the way she consistently acknowledges of the difficult work of self-discovery, in spite of making light of much of it. The author's likable nature and good sense of humor comes through quite strongly and I found her fairly brave for exposing her feelings in this manner. ""Forgiveness is hard work,"" she writes. ""But we need to do it to move on."" Simple but wise words of advice.

This novel haOutstanding Debut NovelI stumbled upon this title and after savoring the final chapters, not wanting it to end, I feel incredibly lucky. This novel has everything I crave: Plot, mystery, well-drawn, eccentric characters, RIDDLES, history, art, lyrical and descriptive prose. I was transported to New England while following the unfolding story of Caroline Wharton as discovered by the somewhat reluctant biographer, Michelle Trutor.Through her main character, Debbie Lee Wesselmann paints Trutor's subject as an ""intellectual enigma"" and the owner of souls. As she unravels the ""sticky web"" left behind by Caroline, a woman who committed suicide and virtually imprisoned her family (the ""Balloonist,"" Arthur, and his twin brother, Proctor, and their niece, Roberta) in a former mortuary, she offers riddles that one can't help but try to solve before reading further. The clever riddles pull you through this fascinating story of complicated relationships.Because of a convoluted will and a watchful attorney, Trutor was the only one who had access to the clues Caroline had left behind, which included her personal journals. I particularly enjoyed the journal entries, which intimately portray the creative and multifarious soul that was Caroline Wharton. My favorite entry: ""I spent hours reading today here in the Botanical Gardens before I felt the need to write myself: the small leap from someone else's words to my own like a garden shading from lavender to deep purple.""Deep purple indeed.

You want a well told and well-researched story with unique and fully drawn characters on a road filled with wonder, intrigue and surprising twists? Voila! This is a book for you.Captivity is the story of Dana Armstrong, a middle-aged, divorced primatologist famous in academic circles for her portrayal in early psychological studies comparing human and chimpanzee behavior. She heads the South Carolina Primate Project (SCPP), a sanctuary for chimps born into captivity and used for medical experiments and research—chimps incapable of living in the wild. When the sanctuary is broken into and the chimps set free, her whole world begins to unravel. Deep rooted traumas stemming from her childhood come to the surface as she tries to save not only her job, but also the SCPP.Dana, as well as the secondary characters, including her assistant and best friend, Mary, her troubled brother, Zack, a freelance journalist named Sam, the nefarious nemesis, Dick Lamier, (I found that name choice appropriate and funny!), even a host of chimps, are fully realized and interesting, adding color and dimension to the highly literary, beautiful writing.

Well-written and highly readable, the structure pulls you from cover to cover so quickly, it's readable in one sitting. My one sitting happened to be on a long plane ride, however, the time I spent getting to know Kelly Corrigan and her father, ""Greenie,"" along with the rest of Kelly's family, made the plane not only bearable, but also enjoyable. She moved me from tears to laughter to a place of profound contentment. In the Prologue Kelly tells her readers that the one thing we need to know about her is that she's ""George Corrigan's daughter."" Ultimately, the one thing I believe this survival story is about is how love of family will see you through anything. Even cancer.The Middle Place, according to Kelly, is the place between childhood and adulthood. This takes place for her between August, 2004 and August, 2005, which is the essential duration of the story. By alternating chapters between present and past, this young mother moves the reader from the middle place, a place where she learns she has breast cancer, to her past with stories of her life as her parents' child and her brothers' sister. Because Kelly, aka ""Lovey,"" shares the cancer experience with her high-spirited and utterly lovable father, it makes the middle place that much more complicated and rich. She holds back little and seems keenly aware of her reader. Writing outside herself, she keeps readers in the loop in spite of very personal revelations. She is indeed her father's daughter.A big fan of memoirs, this is one of the best I've read in a long time and I give it my highest recommendation....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Feb 2008,"Feb 06, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1779929.The_Middle_Place

He's good looking, clearly talented, but frankly, has never done much for me in a heartthrob or...gotta-go-see-the-latest-Tom Cruise movie kind of way. He's only two years younger than I, so as a film fan, I've been subjected to his career for most of my adult life. This book portrays the rise to celebrity of this public man, and further, provides an expose of the cult of Scientology.Andrew Morton, a good writer who I suspect has researched his subject/s to the best of his ability (Tom Cruise, his associates, and Scientology), has put together an entertaining and discussion-worthy product with this book. One has to ask, however, whenever a biography is ""unauthorized,"" is this all the truth or the assumed truth? Morton must occasionally jump to conclusions. For example, on page 71, when referring to the subject's relationship with his father, Morton writes: ""His father did not want any recriminations, any talk of the past. For a young man becoming used to making his own rules, this must have been an irritating imposition, especially coming from a man he at once despised, feared, and still loved."" How much is fact and how much is based on assumption or either disgruntled or jealous accounts--or, since I felt the tone was respectful on behalf of the author, were as many accounts based on the admiration of fans? I believe many of the more controversial topics grabbed onto by the mainstream media (paternity of his daughter to name one) are mere mention of suspicion surrounding this Hollywood celebrity.Overall, I think the book portrays Tom Cruise as an egotistical buffoon and it's no wonder the actor and his camp are trashing this account. But ever since the blockbuster hit Top Gun, which made him a ""genuine star,"" as Morton says, ""his life would never be his own again."" I suspect many already figured out that Cruise was terribly ambitious and, particularly after his scene with Oprah and her couch and the interview with Matt Lauer where he called the respected morning show host, ""glib,"" too eccentric to take seriously. I don't think we needed to read all of the details of his rise to celebrity to get a clearer picture of him. What this book does break ground with is with the history and exposé of the Church of Scientology. This subject is both fascinating and repulsive ... and downright creepy.I don't regret spending a couple days reading this book, but I don't recommend it as it's not the usual sort of thing I like to spend my time reading or suggesting others read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 06, 2008","Jan 22, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2178963.Tom_Cruise

The Senator's Wife is a gray tale of two couples, neighbors sharing an east coast duplex in an upscale neighborhood. In the story, Miller brings in the focus so tightly, that it feels a little voyeuristic prying into the everyday thoughts, feelings and actions of these characters. Said characters are ordinary, but at the same time fascinating because of their mundane circumstances. Given this, one may wonder how the author manages to keep the reader interested for 306 pages. Again, I attribute it to the brilliant writing.Alternating chapters from the perspectives of Delia, a grandmother who is the ""Senator's Wife,"" and Meri, a woman in her mid-30s who is fascinated by the quiet glamour of Delia, move the story from 1993 to present day. Meri and her husband Nathan, a college professor, move to the split house. The decision to purchase their portion of the dwelling is based on his fascination with Delia's husband, a notorious senator, now retired. The senator is mysterious and although he is rarely seen, he is very much a part of the story. Delia's excerpts explain their complicated relationship in detail. But the thrust of the story centers on Meri's fascination with Delia, hence the title, and how the relationship between the women leads to the climax.The Senator's Wife is a fundamental look at life. It's a look at young marriage and an aged marriage lived side-by-side. It's a look at long process of raising children from birth to middle age, and at finding one's place as a caregiver. It's not action-packed or even very exciting, but for fans of Sue Miller and for those readers who appreciate strong character development, I do recommend reading this novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,not set,"Feb 06, 2008","Jan 22, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1306127.The_Senator_s_Wife

The main character, Helen, who reveals in the first sentence that she has just killed her mother, remains highly unlikable and unsympathetic on nearly every page. Upon reading the last sentence, I asked myself, ""What was the point?"" Author, Alice Sebold, succeeds at painting three-dimensional characters and presents an interesting storyline, but this effort is no match to her first novel, The Lovely Bones.This first person account includes the details of her mother's murder, and the aftermath, which is filled with wildly inappropriate and rather insane behavior. Helen goes back and forth in time, illustrating memories from her childhood as the daughter of mentally unstable parents--an agoraphobic mother and a long-suffering, suicidal father. It did, at times, lead me to examine my own relationships with my parents and my children, and one thought loomed large, which comes to Helen as she's posing nude for an art class the morning after she commits murder: ""The idea that my mother was eternal like the moon. I wanted to laugh in my awkward pose at the inescapable nature of it. Dead or alive, a mother or the lack of a mother shaped one's whole life.""

The storA Discussion Americans Need to HaveThis is a long 350-pages, which I feel can be summed up very briefly: Education is the key to world peace. The story of Greg Mortenson is worth reading, as it certainly educates on many fronts. He's a unique, larger-than-life character, who comes across to all those who know him well as ""not one of us. He is his own species.""Having made a promise to build a school in the high altitudes of Pakistan shortly after his failed attempt to climb K-2 to spread the ashes of his youngest sister, Mortenson lives for this goal. He's single-minded, determined, and fearless. His efforts to raise funds give new meaning to the term grassroots. But he does succeed in spite of mountainous obstacles put before him. Three Cups of Tea provides every detail of this struggle.The writing is excellent, although mid-way through I felt as though I were reading a Time magazine article (or perhaps Parade Magazine article is the better choice) that wouldn't end. By mid-book, I found Mortenson--and reading about his outgoing while in Pakistan, yet reclusive while in the States personality frustrating. Although his wife, Tara Bishop, fell in love with him for his passion regarding the school/s project, once they were married (six days after meeting) and she was carrying his child, I resented his apparent recklessness regarding his personal safety in volatile and hostile terrain. My attitude changed after 9-11, however, and how he pleaded with the world to try and see that not all Muslims are terrorists. Learning he received hate mail from many, many Americans after this proclamation, illustrated how much ignorance is out there. It led me to champion his cause in spite of the hardships it brought to his family. His accomplishments are amazing and truly admirable. I was left with the impression that this was not a man merely in search of an extraordinary life, but rather, this is an extraordinary man, who genuinely believed in a noble and worthy cause, and stopped at nothing to see it through.His meeting with Donald Rumsfeld, then Secretary of Defense--particularly the way he compares and contrasts his meeting/s with Taliban leaders--was especially interesting. Mortenson tries to make the case for Afghanistan civilians, victims of the war (deemed collateral damage), who were forgotten when the American army switched its focus to Iraq. If you want to try and understand how and why the reputation of the United States has suffered around the globe since 9-11, Three Cups of Tea certainly makes its case....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Oct 17, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49436.Three_Cups_of_Tea

Caroline Knapp, an Ivy-League educated columnist and editor, shares the story of her slide into alcoholism and her road to recovery with brutal honesty. Her down-to-earth, conversational tone pulls you in, and paints a very credible picture of someone who goes beyond the singular, self-serving notion of merely writing a memoir. Recovery has brought out the best in her, and her writing is filled with gratitude and a deep sense of caring for the health of all those around her with or without addiction issues.The love story metaphor plays all the way through and works well. I particularly liked the way she continues the analogy through her recovery and labels her relationship with alcohol ""a divorce."" She not only divorced alcohol, for the first year she ""took out a restraining order,"" and avoided ""alcohol the way you'd avoid running into an ex-lover at a restaurant.""Some of us have a difficult time understanding the disease of alcoholism and, more to the point, what goes on in the mind of an alcoholic or addict that keeps him/her on this self-destructive path. Knapp lays it bare. She comes across as someone you would want to know.I recommend this book for anyone interested in understanding the nature of both the active alcoholic and the recovering alcoholic. These pages are like a 280+ AA meeting, offering insight, understanding--even comfort--and most importantly, honesty.Well done. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Sep 15, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/73965.Drinking

I use the term “read” rather than “story,” because there wasn’t much of one. A lot happens.

But in spite of this, there wasn’t a clear story I could sink my teeth into. It was fully character-driven, with Lauren the newspaper columnist heading each first-person, character-focused chapter, but the characters weren’t entirely likeable. And in spite of their bi-annual meetings and history together at Boston College—even their professed love for one another—I didn’t buy it. I didn’t believe they liked one another all that much.As for their men? One had to read very closely to find a likeable man. The individual relationships with men were focused upon more than the Suisas' relationships with one another.Luckily I read Spanish fairly well and many of the passages/communications/slang/flavor of the characters were not lost on me. (Translations don’t accompany each sentence or phrase en Español.) Still, I don’t think knowledge of Spanish is an absolute requirement to read or enjoy this book.

Nina experiences adolescence scarred from the death of her young brother. He was only four years old when he drowns in the backyard pond while under her watch, and she, at the age of 11, becomes the only child of damaged parents. In their grief, her mother—a painter—turns inward, while her father turns to the whiskey bottle. We learn the marriage was rocky before their son’s death, and we also learn that Nina tries to bring her mother out of her depression by posing nude for a series of paintings. The posing and painting process works to bring mother and daughter together, although it alienates the father.The paintings are shown at a Boston gallery and are breakthrough work for her mother’s art career. And once the paintings are displayed and admired, a “creep factor” seeps into their world and into the story. It’s one thing to read about typical, self-loathing body image of a teenager as she develops, it’s another still to imagine it on display for the world to see, and to purchase. I refer to the keynote painting of the exhibit, “Nina: Adolescence.” Minor characters are few but also well developed. Raissa, Nina’s only friend, who she meets in dance class, brings a spark to Nina’s life. And then there’s Leo—an absolute predator—who takes the story in such a repelling and sad direction, it almost became unbearable to read. If it weren’t for the truly excellent writing and the power to bring out such strong emotion in me, I might not have finished this book.

The author has a remarkable gift for storytelling, and even though the story is not pretty--in fact it's VERY upsetting--it's a tale that will keep you turning pages. I can't believe there's anything else in print--fiction or non-fiction--that illustrates the lives endured by the Afghani people in a more graphic, poignant manner.The recent history of Afghanistan, with a focus on the western city of Heart and then its largest city, Kabul, is played out through the eyes of two characters.

By tragic, contrived and unforgivable circumstances, their lives come together. Hardships brought on by the Soviet invasion, the Taliban takeover, and then the events after 9-11 (also a severe drought) are one aspect to the tale; however, what's most compelling is how these women were utterly degraded by men in a variety of ways--by a father, a husband, the Taliban, society at large. (This is not to say that every man in the story is a despicable character. Laila's father and best friend, Tariq, are not.)Overall, the story shows how the effect of 30 years of brutal conflict and upheaval have torn apart this society.

The bPieced Together in a Lovely PatternThis book, Circle of Quilters, is a collection of several stories, sewn together to create a satisfying tale. The book is divided into character portraits of five people, all job applicants for a teaching position at the prestigious Elm Creek Quilter's camp in rural Pennsylvania. Some of their paths cross on interview day, but there is lengthy back-story and development for each, which elicits sympathy from the reader. I found myself rooting for each to do well during the interview for this highly desirable position. Each back-story leads to the interview experience, and not one candidate believes the interview went well.The characters are as diverse as the blocks of a sampler quilt. Maggie is humble, hardworking, smart and capable. Karen is an overwhelmed mother of two small children, whose lack of childcare (at the last minute) makes you ache with sympathy. Anna, an underappreciated chef, tolerates her boyfriend's mistreatment and has an annoying lack of self-confidence--but anyone would want to taste her homemade cookies (!) Russ, a rare male participant in the quilting world, takes up the hobby after his wife's death and perseveres to become a renowned author and teacher of the art. And finally, there's Gretchen, who spends her entire life dealing with an evil neighbor and so-called friend named Heidi. I kept hoping Gretchen would at last go off on her with a sharp seam-ripper! But Gretchen had far too much class for that.All of the candidates face the Elm Creek Quilters staff for an extensive and, due to a blonde named Diane, grueling interview. Each is also tested by a white-haired lady acting has a baffled camper in need of help with her appliqué piece. The way Jennifer Chiaverini pieces together the characters is clever and enjoyable, particularly if you have an appreciation for quilts and quilting. It was fun trying to guess which characters would receive offers for the two positions available.A very fast read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Jul 2007,"Jul 27, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49703.Circle_of_Quilters

Reading it while surrounded by the settings she so colorfully and accurately describes added to my enjoyment of the experience. It’s a themed murder mystery that anyone with a remote interest in fishing—particularly fly-fishing—will savor for the knowledgeable references to the sport and those who participate in it.The main characters are very well drawn and highly likable. Osborne, aka “Doc,” is a retired dentist-made deputy on the case of the ‘dead angler,’ Meredith Marshall. Doc discovers the body while fishing with his friend, Lewellyn Ferris. “Lew” is the Loon Lake chief of police, the first woman to hold the job. She’s smart and sexy, and an expert fisherman. (Doc is more attracted to her than he realizes.) Doc’s neighbor, Ray Pradt, is probably best described as a local-yokel, a celebrated fishing guide who wears a trout on his head in the form of hat and has a side-job digging graves. Together, this trio falls into several precarious situations as they solve the case. Each stays true to character throughout the story and the dialog is so good, I could ‘hear’ them talking—Northwoods dialect and all. Meanwhile, Meredith’s sister, Alicia, is juicy, detestable villainess throughout the story; however, other suspects in the case are not given equal time to make uncovering the mystery in the plot the reason to keep turning pages.I simply liked spending time in this region with these characters, and I look forwarding to reading more of Houston’s series....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jul 2007,"Jul 16, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/861561.Dead_Angler

Read further to see if you may be as well.Reason #1: It's very well written. Debra Ginsberg has an easy way with words, moves the plot forward with each page, and develops her characters, such as they are, beautifully.Reason #2: Like the protagonist, Angel Robinson--a bookstore employee-turned assistant to a high-powered literary agent--I'm a voracious reader, I appreciate books and am sympathetic to authors.Reason #3: I have experienced the submission process established by a multitude of literary agents (and their assistants), and this story offers an in-the-bowels look at how the business of book selling/publishing works. It may be extreme in terms of characterization and plot, but that's what makes ""Blind Submission"" a page-turner. And what voracious reader doesn't enjoy a book that she can read in one-to-two sit-down sessions?All that said, this story bothered me. The agent, Lucy Fiamma, (the literary world equivalent to the fashion industry's Miranda Priestly in the novel known as ""The Devil Wears Prada"") didn't have one likeable or redeeming quality. Everything about Lucy Fiamma is loathsome. It made me wonder why the sweet and innocent, and obviously intelligent Angel Robinson put up with her outrageous demands, her rude demeanor, and her entirely inappropriate behavior. Having experienced a boss from hell myself when I was in my late 20s and trying to get ahead, I remember putting up with a degree of humiliation, but in this story, it's so over the top that it makes Angel seem too wimpy to be a heroine I could champion. Of course it's easy to guess that she ""wins"" in the end, and I'm afraid, it was obvious to me who was the anonymous author submitting poorly written (almost painful to read) excerpts of a novel called Blind Submission,"" which Lucy was hot to have published. I feel I ultimately kept reading because I wanted to see exactly how Angel would break free from Lucy AND I wanted to see how the ""love story"" would be resolved. Ginsberg does leave her reader with a satisfying ending, with all loose ends wrapped up neatly.I'm a fan of Debra Ginsberg's writing. Her memoir, About My Sisters had me completely riveted.

Great Gift BookI picked up this book because of the title. I have daughters. There are 'things' I want them to know. Upon reading the Foreword, I grew a little nervous. The tone seemed rather patronizing, and I felt like I was about to get a lesson in what a rotten mother I am. The author writes: ""No mother can have a relationship with her children without some heartaches and significant differences of opinion. With my own daughters I embrace our differences as well as the things we share in common."" Well, yes, that WOULD be the ideal.What follows beyond the Forword, where the author more or less introduces her qualifications for writing a book filed with advice, is just that. Lots of useful advice for getting through life. The conversational and rational writing style immediately allowed me to GET OVER MYSELF, and just enjoy the various topics. I found it hard to disagree with anything she wrote. Everything is based on the author's experience, and much of it is universal. The suggestions, ""It's Easier to Get into Things Than It Is to Get Out of Them,"" or ""In Really Tough Times, Regularly Take Time Off,"" for example, are pearls of wisdom for mothers to not only pass onto their daughters, but also to remind themselves of every now and again.This is a well written collection, with a mature and rational sensitivity.

It clearly establishes a sense of time and place (modern day Madison, Wisconsin) and offers the ""promise"" of an intimate look at daily life during the last stages of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) from the perspective of a personal caregiver. While we learn to understand the struggles of the patient, Kate, this is more about the struggles of a college student known as ""Bec,"" as she travels an emotional path of coming into her own. Author, Michelle Wildgen, fulfills the promise.This story is character-driven, and what made me turn the pages wasn't the story, which was, at times, a bit slow and uninspiring. With the exception of the ""blue butterfly,"" the additional sex scenes felt extraneous. Further, one can guess from the beginning that in terms of Kate's condition, there wouldn't be a `happy' ending. Regardless, Wildgen paints a very realistic picture of ALS, and definitely puts you in the room. What made me turn the pages was Wildgen's ability to make each of her characters come alive. I cared about them and wanted to see how they'd handle Kate's progressive and ultimate demise.Bec is the narrator who learns as she goes (both how to take care of Kate and how to cook for her guests/staff/family). We see everything through her eyes, particularly as she becomes Kate's voice. The title, You're Not You, comes from Kate, as she asks Bec to speak for her in a manner beyond mere translation. The secondary characters are also well developed, including Kate's husband, Evan, Bec's roommate, Jill, and to a lesser degree, Bec's lover, Liam. Liam, a married faculty member, represents another dimension of Bec's floundering, and her search to, in a sense, pick a major. Ultimately, the story becomes a vehicle for Bec's eventual direction of career choice.I recommend as a thought provoking read, and for the strong writing and character development. Additionally, if you know (or have known) someone with ALS, I believe you'll appreciate the author's knowledge and sensitivity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Dec 2006,"Jul 01, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/167350.You_re_Not_You

For President I'm a fan of Maureen Dowd, primarily because she's a good writer and she's not afraid to speak her mind. In fact, that's her job . . . as a columnist for The New York Times . . . And that's what this book was to me: One long--338 page--column. That said, it's still a swift read, and essentially stays on subject; however, I didn't find the title to convey the true topic sentence of the book. ""Are Men Necessary?"" This is more of an attention grabbing, headline-like title, which I must admit, got me to buy the book. The question is rhetorical. These pages contain not so much a study of male/female relationships as they put forth a study of today's politics in general. Further, I found it to be primarily an expose on the state of feminism in the post-Anita Hill and Monica Lewinsky United States.Are Men Necessary, is a cross between Naomi Wolf's ""The Beauty Myth,"" Susan Faludi's ""Backlash,"" and is sprinkled with a little bit of ""Prozac Nation"" by Elizabeth Wurtzel. In the end, it reads like a pre-campaign assessment of Hillary Rodham Clinton's chances of being the next President of the United States.The most provocative aspect of the book was when Dowd indicated that during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, there were other witnesses available to corroborate Anita Hill's allegations, and had they actually come forth, and if Biden and Kennedy hadn't ""folded,"" he most likely would have been rejected for the Supreme Court. This would have had a domino effect on the state of American politics. Specifically, in the case of Bush v. Gore in the 2000 election, which resulted in a 5 to 4 vote in favor ""of stopping the vote and handing over the White House to the son of the president who appointed Thomas."" She cites a whole string of current events that may have turned out differently if Thomas had not made it to the Supreme Court.This is a good book to open up discussion on the growing pains of the women's movement in this country.

The title, Caught Stealing, at first suggested a crime storyThis Cat Has Nine Lives I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked up this book. The title, Caught Stealing, at first suggested a crime story; however, it was immediately clear that the subject of baseball is the string that gets the main character, Hank, through what is an extremely rough ten days in late September, 2000. And yes, there is crime involved. A lot of crime.This story is VERY well written. The writing is straightforward, conversational and quick. Even without the use of quotation marks or dialog attributions, I had no trouble following it. The writing is what got me to sit through seemingly endless gratuitous violence and the prolific use of the ""f-word,"" (which actually doesn't bother me). I believed this is indeed how each of the characters, Hank, his shaky neighbor, the rotten cop, all the thugs, and Hank's co-horts at the bar where he worked until the first beating got the best of him, spoke this way. In other words, the use of voice is dead-on. Audible. Further, it made me glad I don't hang around in such circles. I don't think Hank ever expected to find himself in this situation either, which makes him all the more likable. We sympathize with him from the start because of his lost dream of being a major league baseball player and then, because of the death of his friend, who died in a car accident when Hank was behind the wheel. It also doesn't hurt that he continually checks in with his parents. In spite of the reeking, bleeding, killing character he becomes, Charlie Huston has the reader rooting for him until the end.The baseball theme--and a fan's addiction to `his' team--is a clever ploy. (It ties in nicely with Hank's addiction to alcohol.) Bottom line: I simply had to keep turning pages to find out Hank's next move and whether or not his ""adopted"" cat, Bud, would make it through the ordeal as well.

Jessica Darling, a self-proclaimed brainiac, deals with her best friend moving away, and trying to fit in with a group of girls she dislikes.

I'm not sure I'd let my daughters read this, due to the frank outlay of sex and drugs in the plot; however, for more mature readers, it's a bit of a romp into a juvenile, chick-lit world that made me think, ""been-there/done that."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2006,"Jun 27, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/138202.Sloppy_Firsts

It wasn't necessarily about the story, although I was riveted, and compelled to turn pages to learn the outcome. Plain and simple, it was about the writing. Lisa Unger's style is refreshing and original. I felt like she, through the voice of her protagonist, was in the room with me, telling me this story.Beautiful Lies is a first-person account of a young woman named Ridley Jones, who contemplates a single act, and the events leading up to this act, that change her life forever. She became a momentary celebrity after saving a child from being hit by a car. Because her heroic and selfless deed was inadvertently videotaped, the world witnessed it on local and even national television, and her exposure enabled the truth of her identity to be exposed as well.Throughout the tale, Unger/Jones ""talks"" to her reader. ""I know what you're thinking,"" she often writes. At first I found this a little annoying, but ultimately, I had to admit in each case, she did know what I was thinking. She had me that hooked. Throughout the story, she interjects little gems of wisdom regarding family dynamics where her parents and brother (her biological parents and biological brother???) are concerned, which had me nodding my head and saying ""yes!"" One of my favorite lines in the book is: ""It's strange how memory gets twisted and pulled like taffy in its retelling, how a single event can mean something different to everyone present."" Ultimately, the mysteries are revealed and all the characters--particularly the parents, the mysterious uncle, drug-addict brother, sexy man upstairs, ex-boyfriend and his mother, and the mob-linked laywer--are relevant and satisfying.This is a great, fast read and I recommend it for readers who appreciate good story telling and down to earth characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2006,"Jun 27, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/171109.Beautiful_Lies

The writing is conversational, easy to read and very descriptive. She takes you by the hand and leads you through the early years growing up as a child of Ukrainian immigrants who settled in Alberta, Canada. Dirt poor and sheltered, Irene was shy primarily because she didn't speak or understand English and her primary exposure to the outside world prior to going to public school was what her mother, grieving over the loss of her first baby, and a few bullying cousins had to teach her. For example, for the longest time she believed women found their babies under trees.

It hasn't been for fame, money or glory. It has been to get to the bottom of how and why the terrorist attacks on 9/11 happened and how to prevent them from happening again. Through raw pain and unspeakable grief caused by the murder of her husband, she shares her love story and her motives. One can't help but admire her for her courage, strength, intelligence, endurance, and most importantly, her honesty.This book is extremely informative about the steps leading to the formation of the 9/11 Commission and the mire of political red tape Breitweiser and her partners, ""the Jersey Girls,"" a group of 9/11 widows, faced when dealing with Washington insiders. This account is refreshing because it's clear from the beginning that Breitweiser had no political agenda. She addresses conservative criticism labeling her a ""Democratic Operative,"" by indicating that (with a few exceptions) it was mostly the White House and the Republicans stonewalling her efforts to have the Commission formed. She only began campaigning for Kerry after she came to believe that the current administration did not seem to agree or act upon her number one priority: Forming the Commission and then instigating its recommendations. Prior to her husband's death, aside from voting, she wasn't the least bit politically active. She, like many complacent housewives, voted the way her husband voted. Her introduction to Washington politics and the ensuing education she attained helped assuage her grief and fight for a higher cause--the cause of keeping not only her young daughter, but ALL Americans safe(r) from terrorist attacks. I believe the citizens of this country, especially all the comfortable wives and mothers out there who believe they are insulated and secure, owe her a debt of gratitude for her efforts. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Sep 2006,"Jun 27, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/635360.Wake_Up_Call

Hanauer expertly details the emotions brought on by this disease on behalf of each of the family members: Billie's fear for her sister, her parents' denial and debate over treatment, and Cassie's deterioration. But this is not Cassie's story. This is Billie's story and it's about so much more than her sister's anorexia. Billie is a rather typical suburban teenager, coping not only with her sister's illness, but also with pressure from her parents to do well on the SAT test, learning how to drive, dealing with a popular boyfriend who wants more from her than she's willing to give, and a best friend with a colorful family who simply disappears one day . . .One can't help but fall in love with Billie.

I think Cathi Hanauer is a very talented writer with a keen eye for detail and a conversational tone that allows you to know her characters and feel like you're chatting with them over a cup of coffee (or pitcher of margaritas). BUT . . . I had a hard time sinking my teeth into this story. The main character, Elayna Leopold, is an educated New Jersey housewife and mother of a precocious six-year-old. She is on the threshold of middle age, and struggles with her attraction to the boy-next-door-type character, who turns her head and seduces her with a potter's wheel. (I had a hard time NOT envisioning Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze in ""Ghost,"" during this scene).There's a lot to this book--primarily a story premise that made me buy it. (That and because I loved her first novel, ""My Sister's Bones."") At once, there's sympathy for Elayna because we learn her baby boy has died and she's just coming into the acceptance stage of her grief. The problem is, we never get to truly feel her pain, and hence forgive her for her pathetic actions in pursuing the young hunk across the street----not to mention her stereotypical feelings of abandonment due to her lawyer husband's preoccupation with a death row case. Her character is shaped somewhat by the appearances of her sister----who suggests they were maltreated by their philandering, photographer father----and her best friend and former college roommate, Celeste, the I-Am-Independent-New York-Woman-just-let-me-prove-I-don't-need-to-be-married-but-sleep-with-a-married-man kind of character. But there's not enough of these characters, in my opinion, and instead we spend far too much time in Elayna's head as she struggles with her moral decisions and everyday routines.Read it for Hanauer's descriptive and, at times, lyrical prose, and occasional pearls of wisdom regarding mundane, suburban life.

I enjoyed reading Sara Rath's descriptions of Star Lake, the broken down lodge and cabins, the look of the lake, the smell of the pines. She captures the essence of Northern Wisconsin beautifully. What troubled me about this story, however, is that I never felt a strong sense of empathy for the main character, Hannah Swann. To me, she wants to be a confident take-charge woman, spokesperson for an important cause, but nearly everything she does, she does reluctantly. It was hard to get behind her and cheer her on.Hannah is a poetry instructor from Madison, Wisconsin, who also writes documentary films. Apparently educated and sophisticated, she is nevertheless having an odd affair with a married man, a ""malacologist,"" which, I learned, is someone involved in the ""scientific study of mollusks."" His name is Tyler and while his occupation ultimately plays a role in the story, what stands out is his awkward sexual dysfunction, and a couple of sex scenes that almost made me throw the book aside. Most of the other secondary characters are flat and predictable. They include Hannah's daughter, Chloe, a vegetarian with a pierced nose, who is a political activist, and her trusty, but never fleshed-out boyfriend, Eric. Dan Kerry, Hannah's rugged, fishing guide/flannel shirt wearing love interest, and a sleazy lawyer, the villain named Denny. Hannah's mother, Lily, is nosy, self-centered and highly critical of her daughter. On the other hand, the one character who does stand out is the feisty Ginger, saloon barkeep, who is a tell-it-like-it is kind of gal, who not only puts Hannah in her place, but offers a true and entertaining Northwoods vernacular. Whenever Ginger is in the room, it's a guaranteed entertaining read.There is little mystery involved with the plot of the underhanded mining company supporters trying to take over her newly inherited land and much of what happens is highly predictable and contrived. It's a quick read, the writing is average and I recommend this book to readers who want to get a taste of the great Northwoods. Three and a half stars.Oh, and by the way, GREAT cover art.

It starts out very stronA Mixed BagI believe Jonathan Franzen fans will be both delighted and disappointed with this collection, The Discomfort Zone. It starts out very strong, showing off Franzen's remarkable vocabulary, storytelling ability, and his disregard for political-correctness. In a piece called, ""House for Sale,"" Franzen tells what it feels like to take on the chore of emptying and selling what was his childhood home. Anyone who has faced the death of a parent and has undergone this emotional task will relate to his musings, admissions, and actions. We get to know his mother in this opening tale and soon learn she is a central figure throughout the collection. At first her controlling nature seems relatively benign, when we learn she's written the classified ad meant to showoff her home--her most successful investment--in the best light. Having done extensive research on her St. Louis-area neighborhood prior to her death, she even suggests an asking price. Franzen uses this story to kick-off a theme, where he comes off as a continual disappointment to his strict, provincial parents and shows how his mother's ""strong opinions"" have deeply affected his life.The second entry, ""Two Ponies,"" focuses on ""Peanuts"" cartoon creator Charles Schulz, and how Franzen related (or didn't relate) to the characters. He also relates to Schulz himself, particularly because of Schulz's feelings as an outsider while growing up. Additionally, I believe he admired Schulz for holding a grudge regarding his disdain for the label ""Peanuts"" placed upon his life's work. What I liked about ""Two Ponies,"" is that I grew up reading this comic strip and could therefore relate to Franzen's story, and I liked the way the writing comes full circle.Unfortunately, for me the collection goes downhill from there. Long passages about a Fellowship church camp and its youth minister, ""Mutton"" . . . a tale about his high school ""gang"" attempting acts of vandalism, and too much German (translations included) during a semester abroad, seem to be written more for himself and the characters he portrays than the general public.Finally, with ""My Bird Problem,"" Franzen is back on track. He offers political and personal takes on global warming, our country's energy policy, along with intimate revelations about his marriage and an ensuing relationship, and ultimately his passion for birding and what it has taught him about himself . . . and his mother.Readable in one day. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,Sep 2006,"Jun 27, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24920.The_Discomfort_Zone

I found the voice of the narrator captivating and consistent, so pure in spirit--dripping with innocence--that I was completely engrossed in her story of the summer Freeda and Winnalee showed up in their small Wisconsin town.The characters and the relationships are complicated and intriguing. Winnalee, a gypsy of a girl obsessed with fairies, dress-up clothes, and the urn holding the ashes of her ""Ma,"" carries around a display book of blank pages with the title ""Great Expectations,"" in which she records bright ideas as they come to her. She numbers them and has a goal to reach 100 bright ideas, believing this magical number will allow her to know all the secrets of life. When she moves into Button's dead grandmother's house, Winnalee becomes Button's best friend and allows Button to add ideas to the book as they come to her. The ideas are never random, but always based on a personal experience and refreshingly down to earth and amusing. For example, ""Bright Idea #90: After you play beauty shop, your husband might say you look like a beauty queen, or he might just ask you where the Phillips screwdriver is. Either way, it doesn't matter, as long as your new hair makes you think nice things about yourself."" I found myself devouring each chapter and particularly looking forward to the next bright idea.I loved this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,Sep 2006,"Jun 27, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/232251.The_Book_of_Bright_Ideas

All the Numbers, a well-written novel by author Judy Merrill Larsen, should be read with a note of caution. The author evokes such a sense of pure grief that one cannot help but experience the death of an 11-year old boy named James. I truly felt his mother's pain.I bought this book after reading a  in the Lakeland Times newspaper, a twice weekly paper serving northern Wisconsin, where local lakes are enjoyed by vacationers, including swimmers and jet-skiers. Because my two young children swim in front of our dock (in shallow water) on a daily basis, I believed this story would hold some relevance. It certainly did. This novel is many things, but for me, it's primarily a cautionary tale.All the Numbers is indeed well written and a very quick read, even though much of the plot is driven by the mundane day-to-day musings of Ellen Banks, the mother. Every excruciating detail of each character's actions and each of her thoughts is laid bare. If you've ever wondered what it feels like to lose a child, or want to try to understand the anger and sadness of a mother going through such a loss, the all-encompassing grief expressed in these pages captures these emotions. I felt much of the story was predictable and at times, a bit like a steady ""heart line"" monitor that Ellen, a high school writing teacher, ironically uses as a metaphor about creating fiction without rising action; however, I cried real tears on the last page.The story will stay with me for a long time.

That's definitely what this book is. But is it a riveting story? Did I fall in love with the characters and turn pages with eager anticipation to see how the story would play out? No and no. I struggled turning pages of this book as much as I'd probably struggle trying to knit a sweater. This was like the waste of expensive yarn, a piece crafted with a big idea and little talent.The writing isn't bad, but I wouldn't describe this effort as ""well-written."" It's average at best, lacking originality or memorable prose, and I felt it was littered with clichés and contrived dialog. As for story, it's primarily character-driven with focus on the main character, Georgia Walker, a single mother who owns a yarn shop/knitting business on the upper west side of Manhattan. The club consists of her daughter Dakota, a bi-racial 12-year-old, who flits in and out of the club with baked goods and entrepreneurial ambitions, and is as charming and annoying as any 12-year old; a widow named Anita who is Georgia's ""mentor;"" an ""academic"" named Darwin (who annoys everyone in the club as well as this reader); a 40-year-old single woman (who I believe works on a documentary about the knitting club) who fools a date into getting her pregnant; an aspiring purse designer and part-time worker in the shop; a woman in her mid-40s hoping to get into law school; and probably the most entertaining character, Georgia's childhood friend Cat (nee Cathy) who is an uptown socialite on the verge of divorce. When she's on the page, at least there's some conflict you can sink your teeth into.Dakota's father, James, returns to Georgia's life in this tale, and is a cardboard character who fails to charm the reader as much as he seemingly charms everyone else. And Georgia's grandmother, a 90-something Scottish sage comes into play as a touchstone to...something. I think Georgia's visit abroad is supposed to be really important but it wasn't until page 260 when Georgia receives some life changing news that the question, ""What IS this book ABOUT?"" had an answer.The Friday Night Knitting Club is a debut novel and I believe it has a first novel feel. It made me think, ""nice effort and good for the author for getting it published;"" however, I cannot recommend it. There was, however, one quote from the book I thought was rich, and this was in regard to mother-daughter relationships: "". . . what these daughters really wanted was to be able to bare their souls to the one person in the world who would love them without restraint, whose approval was priceless, who would find them and their myriad life issues endlessly fascinating.""

Knitting is far more than just a device in this well-crafted tale. It provides the warmth and the intimacy, and is the central focus for a group of people (mostly women) who are in various stages of emotional distress.The writing is straightforward and easy to read, and I can't offer enough praise about the expert craftsmanship used to propel the story. It's as though the author follows a pattern as simple as Knit One, Purl One (K-1, P-1) as she weaves together this unlikely group of people who form the Wednesday night knitting circle at Big Alice's shop, the ""Sit and Knit.""The main character is Mary, and we follow her as she grieves over the sudden death of her five-year-old daughter, Stella. In addition, there is a relatively large cast of characters. Hood allows the reader to get to know each one as Mary gets to know them. Mary learns not only about a new stitch or a new pattern or project, but she also builds friendships through listening to stories illustrating a vast array of the human condition and various forms of grief. I was riveted to each tale told via memory from the characters, who had credited Big Alice, a knitting mentor to all, and in the case of Mary's mother, Mamie, an AA Sponsor as well, as they engaged in the craft of knitting to get through the difficult days as life goes marching on, indifferent to pain and suffering. They knit to save their lives.The story comes full circle without being the least bit corny as Hood expertly ""casts off."" I was left thoroughly satisfied.

The characters are well drawn, yet quirky and not entirely likeable. There is a mystery that makes the plot compelling; however, at times I found the prose overwritten and the language unnecessarily lofty. (The author either has a remarkable vocabulary, or had a handy thesaurus). Why I stayed with this until the end is ultimately very simple. It was because of the narrator, Rosemary Savage, an affable and sympathetic young woman, who comes of age during a year in New York City.Rosemary is a beautiful redheaded teenager. She leaves the island of Tasmania shortly after her mother passes away and sets out to find herself a life. Virtually penniless and without a formal education, she is a clever girl and has had the benefit of being raised by a strong, single mother as well as training from a loving friend named ""Chaps,"" who owned a bookstore. It's therefore no surprise when Rosemary winds up working in a dark cavern of a bookstore filled with eccentric, erudite misfits. Owned by George Pike, The Arcade specializes in rare books, catering to collectors who will regularly drop as much as $40,000 for a book. Her education is swift and she quickly becomes an integral part of the store's daily life.Soon, Rosemary is pulled into a tangled mystery involving a lost manuscript by Herman Melville. It's known as ""The Isle of the Cross,"" and uncovering its history and pending acquisition is central to the story. If you knew nothing of Melville prior to reading ""The Secret of Lost Things,"" you will certainly learn as much as Rosemary did as she pursues the potential whereabouts of this valuable manuscript. Meanwhile, she falls in love with an aloof coworker named Oscar, and must learn to deal with the advances of the repulsive store manager, Walter Geist, a blind albino on the brink of losing his mind.The story is unique and I ultimately believe it was a successful and worthwhile reading experience. It's not for everyone, but if you love books, I'm sure you will appreciate this effort. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Apr 2007,"Jun 26, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/268370.The_Secret_of_Lost_Things

Gayle Brandeis has a true gift. Her main characters are quiet and introspective, and yet we hear their voices very clearly. We see everything they see, feel everything they feel, and smell everything they smell.The plot is built around a series of dead birds--birds inadvertently killed by the main character, a young woman of mixed heritage (Korean and African American) named Ava Sing Lo.

As Ava attempts to break the spell of the dying birds and her shame and sorrow of being a disappointment to her mother we come face to face with her fragility, pain, and insecurity. We, and all those within the story, root for her to soar.Brandeis weaves together two stories--the daughter, Ava, and the mother, Hye-yang (Helen). She takes us from San Diego to the Saltan Sea and back to Korea in the 1960s, where through Ava's retelling of her mother's song, we learn of Hye-yang's slide into prostitution, Ava's conception and their ultimate flight path to freedom.I highly, highly recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Apr 2004,"Jun 26, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/197999.The_Book_of_Dead_Birds

The storySad Plunge into Mediocrity I have a very strong belief that if this were a first novel by an unknown author, it would have never seen print. The story is all premise, and the promise of a novel about sisters-- one a celebrity morning talk show host the other an obscure social worker--weathering an enormous crisis, doesn't comes to fruition. This so-called crisis (at least the situation that prevails through most of the book), while titillating and tabloid, is ultimately pitiful. And finally, what I have to assume is the climactic moment of crisis for them is both predictable and garbled.I thought the first 60 pages were good and believed the term ""potboiler"" might describe this novel.

The narrator, social worker sister Bridget, lapses into repetitive and dull back-story, along with stale commentary about living in and loving New York City so often, instead of the question she suggests unnamed, provincial characters ask New Yorkers: ""why would you want to live (t)here?"" I found myself asking instead, why do I continue reading this?The answer is, of course, Anna Quindlen. She is a successful product of the publishing world, a name-brand Pulitizer Prize winning journalist who has certainly created some brilliant and entertaining material. Unfortunately, this book suggests a disappointing lapse into mediocrity and a scar on our literary culture. I've read hundreds of books by lesser known (even unknown) authors of much higher quality.

The woman, Rachel, doesn't strike me as physically attractive, she's snobby, depressed, totally irreverent towards just about everyone and everything, and the blunt sexual descriptions of acts performed by not only her but also by the story's secondary characters (who all, by the way, seemed like the same character with different names and different jobs) were a real turn-off.HOWEVER, there was something gut wrenching and real about the writing that kept me turning the pages very quickly. Lisa Glatt gets into the heads of her characters and exposes their deepest secrets and their most profound fears. She ultimately succeeds with this story by putting cancer right out there and shows us what it's like to live with someone you love who is disappearing before your very eyes.Well into the book she uses a metaphor for cancer that I will never forget. She compares it to driving down a one-way street. Brilliant.For anyone who has lost a loved-one, particularly a mother (whether or not to cancer) this book will be difficult.

Vanishing Acts is yet another well told tale by Jodi Picoult, who is a master at character development. Once again telling the story through first person accounts of the main characters, she weaves together a family drama centered on a ""kidnapping"" that had occurred 28 years earlier.Thirty-one year old Delia Hopkins, aka Bethany Matthews, discovers her loving and devoted father, took her away from her alcoholic mother and her childhood in Scottsdale, AZ, created new identities for himself and his daughter, and raised her on lies in New Hampshire. Delia believed her mother was killed in a car accident. When her father is arrested for the crime and put on trial back in Arizona, everything Delia knows to be true about her life and her world unravels.This is a quick and easy read. Through Delia, who for a living works with a bloodhound named ""Greta"" to track and find missing people, we experience the irony of her chosen occupation. Through her fiance, Eric, an alcoholic and the lawyer who defends Delia's father, we get a close up look at how alcoholism can destroy/alter so many families. Through Andrew Hopkins, aka Charlie Matthews, we get an insider's look at life in prison and learn to understand the desperation of a loving father. Other pertinent characters include Fitz, the best friend of both Delia and Eric, Sophie, Delia and Eric's young daughter, and Ruthanne, a Native American woman Delia and Sophie meet in a trailer park, where they temporarily reside in Arizona during the trial.Fans of Picoult will not be disappointed. I recommend this book for readers who look for good writing and interesting, dramatic story lines. ...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,May 2006,"Jun 21, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14865.Vanishing_Acts

Bird by Bird: Attention Writers: Keep This Book on Your ShelfAnne Lamott is an accomplished novelist and essayist, and she is also a writing teacher. Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life contains not only her classroom lessons, but also her whole self. Lamott's witty, honest and at times self-deprecating style is all over these chapters and her empathy for writers of all levels is immediately apparent. When we writers take time off to read what we think are how-to books, often times we're stuck and we're looking for a friend. We find this in Anne Lamott. That said, Bird by Bird is not a How-To book about writing. Instead it's more of a Who-Are-You look into your own writing process. It appeals to a wide audience--those just getting started and those with years of experience and published work. Anecdotal snippets from her life (fans of Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Son's First Year will appreciate stories about her son, Sam) and clever prompting tips from her classroom (Broccoli anyone?) will make you laugh and make you get back to your writing project. We writers owe Anne Lamott a great deal of thanks for this wonderful book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,3,not setnot setnot set,Nov 2008not setnot set,"Jun 21, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird

It is intelligent, thought provoking, funny and highly readable. Anne Lemott, Annie--as it appears her friends call her--lets us into her world and shares a very personal and poignant path of a unique and awkward girl taking off her ""glasses of puberty"" and coming of age. She lays everything bare, from her feelings about her bushy hair and alien eyes, her drug and alcohol additions, to her love for her father and dealing not only with his death, but also with the death of her best friend. We enter the world of a single mother, a struggling and ultimately successful writer, and all her feelings of self-doubt. She seems to have a third eye when it comes to seeing those around her, and through her observations and writing, we too can appreciate people and situations to a greater degree.Writes Lamott of a sick woman from her church in a story named Ashes: ""It must have been too annoying for everyone to be trying to manipulate her into being a better sport than she was capable of being. I always thought that was heroic of her, that it spoke of such integrity to refuse to pretend that you're doing well just to help other people deal with the fact that sometimes we face an impossible loss.""The underlying theme throughout each brutally honest passage is the message of her faith in God and how she came to discover this faith. She LEARNS to pray and uses prayer to get her over the large and the small humps. One can't help but come to love this child of God, and everyone in her life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Nov 2006,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10890.Traveling_Mercies

In other words, the focus is keener on the times than on the life.Finch Hatton, a notorious and romantic character portrayed in Out of Africa, the book of stories by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen) and the in the film played by Robert Redford, didn't keep a journal or, for that matter, write many letters. As a result, a great deal of the exhaustive research on him compiled by dedicated author, Sara Wheeler, is derived from Dinesen's fiction and other contemporary, Beryl Markham's autobiography, West With the Night. Generally well written, a bit on the formal side, the prose wavers between colorful and descriptive and textbook laborious. The subject, Finch Hatton, might have been better left to the material written by his former lovers than the subject of an entire biography.What I enjoyed most about this book was the trip to Kenya and the stunning visuals it provided. Having spent time there, including a visit to the town now known as ""Karen,"" and a tour of Blixen's house, the pages of this book gave it a living history quality. Wheeler also clarifies Finch Hatton's character as more than the uncommitted lover of Karen Blixen (""Tania"")--""They were living in different mental worlds, as unhappy lovers do, coexisting like the twin beaters of a rotary whisk, spinning in time by never touching""-- but also notes he was one of the first to point out the dangers of uncontrolled hunting on safari endangering Africa's wildlife. ""For the first time in his life, he had found something he believed in, a cause that was worth commitment."" Hence, his legacy as ""an eternal wanderer on a perpetual quest for knowledge and experience,"" which is the main thrust of this dissertation. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 28, 2008","Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/873957.Too_Close_to_the_Sun

It was a statement initially prepared for him as a spokesperson on the issue of child soldiers during his rehabilitation period, and one he learned to repeat again and again, as he outlived not only this wartime sufferings, but also all of his family members and most of his friends.“Why does everyone keep dying except me?” is a question that plagues him, and plagues the reader as well upon reading brutal account after brutal account of rebel attacks on otherwise peaceful villages in the West African country of Sierra Leone. It takes a strong stomach to read his gut-wrenching descriptions of the killings. But Beah is a gifted writer with a clear memory and the ability to relate vivid visual descriptions and express his feelings. This book gives new meaning to the phrase: “living to tell the tale.”For example: “Every time people come at us with the intention of killing us, I close my eyes and wait for death. Even though I am still alive, I feel like each time I accept death, part of me dies. Very soon I will completely die and all that will be left is my empty body walking with you. It will be quieter than I am.” These were the words of a friend from a time before Beah and his group of teenage boys became drug-addicted, AK-47-carrying soldiers.This is an important work about learning to understand not only the mind of a child soldier, but also the reasons behind how and why children become soldiers. Beah includes a chronology of events in Sierra Leone from 1462, when written history for the region began, until March, 2006. Very well written with a lot of rap and reggae music undertones, by a charming, educated, lucky, and grateful young man.

It's easy to read and provides an interesting and informative portrayal of life for the women of Afghanistan. I'm not sorry I read it, but it did drag on in the end and I started counting pages wondering when it would be over. There is one heartbreaking and shocking story after the next, and too many ""characters"" to wrap one's mind around. This mélange of stories boils down to: Terrorizing Men and Terrorized Women. I don't believe life for Afghani women has improved because of the Kabul Beauty School, and from what I understand, because of their portrayal in this book, some of the women are in more danger now.Reading Kabul Beauty School did not elicit the feelings I thought it might. I hoped to meet an extraordinary, selfless woman who achieved a major accomplishment. Throughout the reading, I didn't understand or appreciate the author's motivation. It's good journal material, but does it entertain? Absolutely not. Unfortunately, there's a certain lack of credibility from the merely average writing skills of the author. Deborah Rodriguez often comes across as victim of circumstance. She makes a series of foolish choices particularly when it comes to marriage, acts rashly, and irreverently, probably drinks too much and smokes. Not attractive. For example, it doesn't make her the least bit likeable when she verbally assaults a man at an outdoor market when he follows her around and grabs her backside. Embarrassing and endangering her closest friend (and translator) in the process, the friend tells her outright that she will ""never go to the market with her again."" Rodriguez brings her strong, independent and liberated American woman traits with her, wears them on her sleeve, and it does not earn her respect from the people around her, or from this reader. It makes her nickname ""Crazy Debbie"" perfectly understandable. Also, she lets her friends arrange a marriage for her, (and granted the presence of an Afghani husband, ""Sam,"" does help her cause in one dangerous and surprising circumstance after another), but this man already has a wife, and we soon learn, a baby on the way. It's all very bizarre.It feels as though Rodriguez returned to Afghanistan (after her first genuine venture there to provide aid after the ousting of the Taliban) in search of an extraordinary life rather than because she wanted to be the savior of Afghani women. I'm not saying this is true (I don't know this woman), but if the purpose of this book was to tell the world who she is and why she went to Afghanistan at great personal expense to become the director of a beauty school with the hope of making life better for the women there, she has been successful. The book, published by a major house, and the movie deal also deem her ""successful."" As for the school and the cause? A failure. She is not, like the book jacket indicates, living in Afghanistan and still running the school. According to an article on NPR, ""the subjects of her book say Rodriguez and her newfound fame have put their lives in danger. They say they've seen none of the money or help to get them out of Afghanistan that Rodriguez promised them in exchange for having their stories appear in the book."" Rodriguez counters by saying the women misunderstood what she promised them.In spite of this rather negative , I do think Kabul Beauty School is an excellent choice for book clubs as it will no doubt, provoke a very interesting and thoughtful discussion about the lives of women living in Afghanistan, and whether or not the outside world should or shouldn't have something to say or do about this culture and the emancipation of women there. ...more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,not set,Sep 2007,"Jun 20, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/316558.Kabul_Beauty_School

It's essentially a biography of the author, Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian immigrant of Jewish heritage living in France during the Nazi invasion/occupation. Nemirovsky's own story is as interesting as the stories of her fictional characters, a variety of French citizens living through the exodus of Paris and then the German occupation during what has come to be known as World War II. Knowing her background will make the circumstances the characters face all the more poignant. It also explains why what was supposed to be a five part novel stops after two: ""A Storm in June,"" and ""Dolce."" In 1942, Nemirovsky was arrested, deported and killed at Auschwitz.This is beautiful writing with deep, rich observations. The characters aren't entirely likeable; however, Nemirovsky does manage to illicit sympathy for one or two. The reader mourns her demise, knowing the series died with her. But since her young daughter, who survived the occupation, smuggled her mother's notes, had them translated and published along with the two finished stories, they are included as bonus material in the back of the book. It gives the reader some idea where the author planned to take the work, and which characters would reappear.There is reference to her intention to model the work after both Tolstoy's War and Peace and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. One can definitely relate to the movement and design to Beethoven's work.

Before I knew it, I was almost finished, and that's because of Anne Tyler's keen ability to paint vivid characters and vivid scenes. I believed this story would focus on the adoption of Asian babies, but this aspect is only in the background. Digging To America springs forth from the adoption of two Korean girls--one to the Donaldsons, an American family, the other to the Yazdun Family, who are of Iranian heritage, and moves forward in time as the two families come together and share a new tradition: ""Arrival Day."" Each year the families alternate hosting the party marking the August day when they first met their babies as well as each other. The story spans about five or six years. There isn't much of a plot; however, the characters are so well drawn, that I felt I knew them, and grew very interested to see how their lives would play out in relation to one another.The perspective shifts from chapter to chapter, a way to introduce most of the main characters. We primarily get to know the American mother, Bitsy, who is an opinionated, educated woman. She doesn't believe in disposable diapers or preschool, and she keeps her Korean-born daughter's given name, ""Jin-ho,"" scoffing at the Yazdan family for changing their baby's name from ""Sooki"" to ""Susan."" There is also a tremendous amount of focus on Susan's Iranian grandmother, Maryam, a widow, who came to America by way of an arranged marriage. Maryam's experience as an immigrant and her constant struggle to assimilate to the American culture is mostly what this story is about, and when she becomes involved with Bitsy's widowed father, Dave, their awkward romance has tremendous impact, as these two families grow and change together.I found chapter 9, when the perspective switches to young ""Jin-ho,"" now the older sister to a little girl, ""Xiu-mei,"" who was adopted from China, to be at first jarring to the pace of the story. The language and observations are too lofty for an adolescent. But as the story of the ""Binky party"" unfolds--another one of Bitsy's ideas to rid her daughter of the constant need for her pacifier--I grew more comfortable with the perspective, and found the story quite funny. The chapter itself was like a short story within the novel.I recommend this book for Anne Tyler fans, and for those who appreciate character-driven stories and writing that flows....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Mar 2007,"Jun 20, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/698.Digging_to_America

And then what happened?""Dr. Zastro's Sanitarium For the Ailments of Women, a love story between two seemingly mismatched individuals, has a fairytale essence. Set in the 1880s, this is the story of Dr. Phillipe Zastro, founder of a pioneering healing place for women, and Yana, a flamboyant and intelligent gypsy who enters his three-week program. Both strong-willed individuals, they inadvertently fall in love, and the story revolves around their secretive coupling and the complications that arise around them and because of them.Filled with colorful and provocative secondary characters, there's rarely a dull moment during the initial three-week period, when a handful of selected women of varying classes and degrees of education come to the sanitarium for Dr. Zastro's special and famous form/s of electrical healing. The women face a myriad of ailments, from sore limbs due to injury to nymphomania. The author, Ludmilla Bollow, transports the reader to this time and place, through artful prose and excellent storytelling. I don't think I've ever read a more tasteful and sensitive account of a couple experiencing lovemaking for the first time. There are several beautiful moments in this book, particularly when we learn about ""the gypsy maxim"" through Yana.Beyond the three weeks in the Sanitarium, the story takes twists and turns into the future and paints a full portrait of this couple, for better or worse.

Congratulations to John McNally for being a gifted storyteller and for putting this collection together in an interesting and creative manner. He has presented a true time capsule complete with scenery, music, language and costume.Ralph is the boy we all knew--an attention hound dressed in a flannel shirt, who spent a lot of time in the school hallways on his way to the dean's office. Hank, however, who tells his stories from the gray, ""who am I"" world of suburban Chicago in the 70s, is the boy who faded into the woodwork. He's the boy who was up for anything to make his world a little more exciting and often didn't have a choice when it came to dealing with his eccentric father and, of course, Ralph. Each character, including Hank's sister Kelly and even the lady next door, Mrs. Rybecki, who suffers from Tourette's syndrome, are keenly developed and highly entertaining.When we meet Hank in the future, he's like the guy at your 25th class reunion who everyone wants to know. Even though he's down on his luck and must resort to a life in Ralph's domain, he?s interesting, good looking sensitive and . . . funny. Somehow you just know that everything is A-OK with Hank.I loved this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jul 2004,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/607051.The_Book_of_Ralph

The excellent writing is very descriptive, which allowed my mind to be fully transported to the two main settings, an L.L. Bean version of a Maine island in winter and the black-clad gallery world of Manhattan. The rich texture of Shapiro's writing shines through with minute detail. She creates nearly every scene with a 360-degree view. This quality added to my ability to imagine the expensive and much-studied photographs upon which the story revolves: The Clara Series, by Ruth Dunne.Character driven, this is primarily Clara's story. She's a 32-year old mother of a 9-year-old daughter, Sammy, and wife of jewelry artisan, Jonathan. After 14 years of self-imposed exile from her famous mother, the photographer Ruth Dunne, and her older sister, an uptight attorney named Robin, she's called back to Manhattan because of her mother's grave illness. Clara's relationship with her mother and her struggle as she returns is the central plot. From ages 3-14, Clara had served as Ruth's muse and model and grew up with all eyes upon her, judging, assessing and commenting on the black and white nude photographs that made her mother a star. Ruth never asked permission . . . Clara suffered and at 18, just before she obtained her high school diploma, ran away. Her mother's cancer and her sister's request that she return to help, forces her to come of out hiding. This return to the fold exposes her secrets and her fears. She must not only face her mother and her sister, she must face herself.It's a quick read, a satisfying story and has fantastic character development of each character, major and minor. Highly recommend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2007,"Jun 20, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25761.Black_White

In spite of spanning only twenty-five years, it has an epic feel. A lot happens. We first meet Norah and David Henry on the stormy night she gives birth to twins. The boy, Paul, is born healthy. The second, an unexpected daughter, is born with Down's Syndrome. While his wife lay unconscious, David, a doctor who presides over the deliveries because their doctor is unable to get to them due to the snowstorm, makes the decision to tell his wife the second child died. Trying to spare his wife the pain and suffering of having a child who, in his mind would surely die an early death, hands the baby to his nurse, Caroline Gill. He instructs her to take the child to an institution. Caroline finds she cannot leave the baby in this place, moves away and raises ""Phoebe"" on her own. This sets the stage for the terrible secret David must live with and the consequences it has on his family.It's called The Memory Keeper's Daughter because David takes up photography and becomes obsessed with the process. Diving into his hobby, which ultimately brings notoriety to him, he is able to take his mind off his secret, and yet at the same time, focus on the life his lost daughter leads away from him. Photography/snapshots/captured moments are the metaphor for this family and this beautifully written story. There is tremendous detail and one can feel the author using a variety of lenses to provide both wide-angle and tight, intimate views of each scene. Although at times I felt it to be a bit repetitive and wished it were shorter by 50-100 pages, I enjoyed the writing so much, along with the emotion it drew from me, that it didn't matter. I kept turning pages waiting to see how it would all play out. I wasn't disappointed.This book made me ask the question . . . ""what if?"" It also illustrated David's view of the world and Paul's discovery, that ""each person was an isolated universe. Dark trees in the heart, a fistful of bones."" Very well done. ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,not set,Sep 2006,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10441.The_Memory_Keeper_s_Daughter

What a Tale She Weaves This is my favorite kind of book. One to pick up, savor each word and never want to put down. Chevalier has a rich imagination, basing this historical fiction on an existing series of fine tapestries with questionable (undocumented) history, and telling the story through (nearly) all involved in their creation.We begin with the painter, Nicolas des Innocents, who conceptualizes the stories and major symbolisms of the work. A womanizer, he's brash and vain, yet his charm wins the day with the ladies and the reader. He learns much through his experience with the women he depicts as the tapestries take form. One can't help but fall in love with him. He calls the women he wishes to seduce, ""Beauty,"" and offers to tell them the story of the unicorn's horn.Through the words of Nicolas' true object of desire, Claude, the daughter of the nobleman commissioning the work, we learn much about the place of women in Paris society at the end of the fifteenth century. In fact, this is also true about all the ladies featured in the story and ultimately in the tapestry: Claude's long-suffering mother, Genevieve de Nanterre, the blind daughter of the weaver, Alienor, and her mother, Christine, who longs to be a weaver although the Brussel's weaver's guild forbids it.Other unforgettable characters include the lady-in-waiting, Beatrice, and the servant Marie-Celeste.Chevalier has clearly done her research, and in doing so, allows the reader to experience this story with all five senses. In taking admitted liberties with the language, it is an utterly readable tale and I give it my highest recommendation. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Jul 2006,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89788.The_Lady_and_the_Unicorn

This completing engrossing tale of Jeannette Walls and her rise from the ashes of an extremely difficult childhood is on a par with both Smith's classic, and McCourt's Pulitzer Prize winning efforts.""The Glass Castle"" starts out on fire. Literally. Within the first few pages, when Walls recounts one of her earliest memories as a burn victim, I fell in love with this child and quickly turned pages awaiting to see how she'd go from being a neglected and abused child to a clearly well-educated, successful author and, according to the book jacket, a regular contributor to MSNBC.com So many of the incidents she brings to life through a vivid and colorful memory left me with my jaw hanging open. I found myself yelling at her parents, a charming alcoholic father, always with a master plan to bring upon riches, and a selfish (seemingly bipolar) mother, focused on her ""art"" and her need to live life as a constant adventure. ""Sometimes you need a little crisis to get your adrenaline flowing and help you realize your potential,"" said her mother, as she arguably put the words into practice again and again, while her starving children made the best of their impoverished upbringings.Her utterly non-conventional parents taught their children many things, but mostly, it seems, how to fend for themselves. And from the tone of this book, written with great reverence for not only her brother and two sisters, but also for her mom and dad, she indeed took to heart her mother's advice: ""Learn to enjoy the comic episodes."" The story of Jeannette Walls and her search for a home is ultimately filled with more smiles than heartaches.Highly recommend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,Dec 2006,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7445.The_Glass_Castle

The NamesakA String of Accidents The Bengali culture of the Ganguli family and its assimilation to life in the United States is central to this work. The Namesake, through intriguing and well-drawn characters, succeeds at raising questions about what it is truly like to be both a visible immigrant in this country and, more pointedly, a first generation American--offspring of Indian immigrants.The primary focus, and the reason it's called The Namesake, is because of the main character, Gogol, and his obsession with his name. Like the author herself, ""Jhumpa,"" this boy is unwilling to give up his traditional, ""pet"" name, when he becomes school-aged and is suddenly expected to use a ""good name,"" Nikhil. Thus begins the conflict of the generations.Gogol develops into a brooding, selfish character and in spite of his confusing upbringing, this reader found little reason to find him sympathetic. Thankfully, the storytelling alternates perspectives, going beyond the young boy sulking over his odd name, to that of his parents, Ashimi and Ashoke, together by way of arranged marriage, and includes Gogol's various love interests, not the least being his ultimate wife, the very unlikable Moushumi. Each of these characters is fleshed-out, arousing interest and empathy, and make the story absolutely readable. Additionally, there's a lot of focus on food, and the author described the meals and specialties so well, I could almost taste them.To use Gogol's own conclusion (that appears a mere five pages from the end) ""his family's life feels like a string of accidents, unforeseen, unintended, one incident begetting another."" It begins in the 1960s, is written in present tense, and jumps across chunks of time until it comes to its conclusion in the year 2000. This story left me with a feeling of empathy for Indian immigrants and made me truly wonder what it was like to walk in their sandals. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Aug 2006,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33917.The_Namesake

Originally published some 60 years ago, even to jaded readers of modern contemporary fiction, it remains highly readable. Every word. This was my mother's favorite book. I remember watching the movie with her when I was a child and for these two reasons, reading was slow. I couldn't help but reflect on the story as if they were MY memories rather than the main character's, a young girl named ""Francie,"" growing up in poverty in the early twentieth century. It reads like a series of both heartbreaking and entertaining anecdotes about life among first and second-generation immigrants in Brooklyn, New York. And while you can sense the starvation and the continual worry over making ends meet, through the eyes of the children, Francie and her brother, Neely, and also through their Aunt ""Sissy,"" who absolutely takes a bite out of life, it's difficult to feel sorry for them. They are prideful and make the most of all that they have. There's a scene where the children manage to stay standing as the tree vendor chucks a giant Christmas tree at them on Christmas Eve, which I will never forget. What will also stay with me are the feelings Francie discovers while growing up, about the different kinds of love she had for her family. I savored each page and didn't want it to end.

Bel Canto is one of those novels that is good on so many levels, it's taken me days after finishing it to put my thoughts about the story and the characters into words. This work is as lyrical and dramatic as any opera, and the word ""brilliant"" isn't excessive to describe the talent of author, Ann Patchett. I wondered how she came up with such a remarkable and unique story, but then learned she'd been influenced by actual events involving a hostage situation in Peru. Patchett goes far beyond the headlines and enters the minds of the players on both sides. It's a fascinating story and a rewarding and entertaining character study.The first 100+ pages were slow going as the stage is set; however, the ennui I experienced while reading helped me relate to the monotony of daily life experienced by the guests of a party, who'd been taken hostage in a failed attempt to kidnap the President of a South American country. The country, unnamed in the story, is a developing, Spanish-speaking nation. The party, hosted by the Vice President, is a birthday party for a Japanese businessman. It is filled with an International guest list, including the famous and enormously talented opera soprano, Roxanne Coss. Virtually everyone in the room, both hostage and captor, falls in love with her during the four-month siege. The story picks up speed when two distinct love stories begin, one between Roxanne and one of her admirers, and another, which focuses on the second-most sought-after talent possessed by a multi-lingual interpreter, a Japanese named Gen. Each, along with several intriguing subplots, led to the building of a unique story and ultimately satisfying climax.The ending comes quickly and shook me to my core. It was not unexpected and yet it still made me cry. And then there's a surprise, which after a lot of thought, made perfect sense. Brava Ms. Patchett.

Immediately engrossed, I had a hard time putting it down as I read the story of Jacob Jankowski and his reminiscence of days with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth--otherwise known as a train circus in 1930's America.A talented writer and storyteller, Sara Gruen takes readers on a bumpy and tense train ride through history. This tale defines Americana. There is no evidence of author here--simply narrator telling the story from Jacob's perspective (is he 91 or 93 years old?). I liked everything about the book, but primarily it was the crafting I liked best about this reading experience.Seamlessly, Gruen weaves together the modern day voice of this old man, a Cornell-educated veterinarian, abandoned in a nursing home--a.k.a. assisted living facility--and his memories of three months spent as the accidental veterinarian on a traveling circus. Just before his final exams, he learns his parents have been killed in a car accident and this is what sets the story in motion. Once he hops aboard a train, which he soon learns is a circus train, he falls in love with a pink-sequined performer, Marlena, and battles her schizophrenic husband, August, who happens to be his boss. Jacob, a sensitive and innocent soul, is highly likeable and befriends most of the animals aboard. Most unforgettably is a ""Polish"" elephant by the name of Rosie. But he also endears himself to his roommate, a dwarf named Walter, and a stowaway named Camel. One can't help but root for Jacob through the entire story. And to my complete delight, it comes to a surprising and very satisfying conclusion.This is an excellent novel and I give it my highest recommendation.

The detail is both exquisite and annoyingly sharp and pulls you into each scene as though it's happening in the now rather than some 20 years ago. It's personal and revealing and I can't imagine anyone who didn't experience at least some of the same thoughts during high school--no matter what school or what place.Freshman year it's all about roommates and assimilating to what is for Lee a foreign climate. It's also the year where she first develops a crush on a golden boy named Cross Sugarman. Other students, Dede and Martha, for example, use their time at Ault to get the education they were promised; however, Lee--an average to poor student--spends all her time fantasizing about Cross. As the years sail by, Lee learns to deal with all things associated with coming of age, except for what it truly means to fit in.Great storytelling, tremendous character development, extremely well written and I highly recommend this book. I have to say it reminded me a little bit of four years at Hogwarts, without the wizardry, of course, and a heroine who unlike Harry Potter, wasn't popular and had no self-confidence. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,May 2007,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9844.Prep

The narrator is a man who, along with his wife, discovers a homemade videotape at an Auburn, California yard sale, which he thinks is ""The Sound of Music."" It turns out to be the confessional biography of a Japanese man named Mieko and the love story of Mieko and his childhood sweetheart, Tori. The story is at once engrossing, painting the dedicated love between the ill-fated couple while WWII still raged, and their separation shortly before the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings when Mieko is called to serve his country.We experience the first bomb through Tori's eyes, while her love was away in Nagasaki performing research on a highly-desired chemical weapon, which the Japanese hurriedly tried to develop to end the war and claim victory over the United States. They were too late. First came the horrors of Hiroshima, and days later, as Tori, who survived the Hiroshima blast, sets out toward Nagasaki to find her love. Meanwhile, Mieko sets out to find her and misses the second blast at Nagasaki. Tori does not, and yet she survives. From there, their story is a consistent series of missed opportunities. Ultimately they both wind up in Northern California, where Mieko sets his sites on developing a weapon to get revenge against the Americans. He believes Tori is dead, yet Tori never lets her hopes down, and always with a bright, positive, and loving attitude, sets out to find him again.The pages turn quickly as one can't help but hope the couple finds one another again despite the incredible odds. It's a beautiful story, both historically and culturally enlightening. It raises strong ethical questions of forgiveness and draws out the polarizing attitudes toward war.And this is where I wish the story had ended. The twist at the end cheapened the romance and history lesson of the Japanese couple as the story took what I felt was an absurd twist during the chapter entitled, ""Our Story."" It made the overall effort seem too ambitious and more like the outline for a novel or a movie rather than a complete package. Still, I recommend it due to the excellent storytelling of the Japanese couple, and the potential of this talented author. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2007,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1266529.Sunrise_on_Kusatsu_Harbor

The narrator, 80-year-old Lily, who refers to herself as one who has ""yet to die,"" tells the story of her life. She has outlived her family members and relates the story of her formative years--and her relationship with another woman, Snow Flower. This well written tale is related with clarity, sentiment, and most poignantly, remorse. It's through remorse that the reader comes to know the true character of Lily, as she reflects upon a misunderstanding she had with her one true love.Beyond the reflection of Lily's relationship with Snow Flower, a girl she meets at the age of six when they are introduced by the local matchmaker and tied by contract to forever be known as ""laotongs,"" or ""old sames,"" this story provides a lesson in Chinese history and culture. Many have heard of the tradition of feet binding, but through Lisa See's writing, one experiences the excruciating pain and the meaning behind a mother's duty to bind her ""worthless"" daughters' feet. It's all about marriage and, of course, sex. At once I went to the Internet to look for images of bound feet because I had a terribly hard time visualizing a foot only seven centimeters in length.I enjoyed every minute of reading this story and I highly recommend it. I think it would make an excellent selection for book clubs, given the vast number of elements to spark topics of conversation: Chinese culture--past and present; Mother-daughter relationships; Foot-binding; Arranged marriage; Female relationships; Lesbian relationships (?); Chinese history; Chinese foods; Chinese geography, etc. ...more",Notes are private!,0,108,1,not set,Feb 2007,"Jun 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1103.Snow_Flower_and_the_Secret_Fan

An insider's look at a splashy industry like morning television, at least for viewers of the morning shows, is fun reading. This story is well written and one can feel the author's tongue firmly planted in her cheek as she spins the tale of a television producer who gets caught up in the fangs of a snake venom lip gloss product and Homeland Security in a case that comes to be known as ""Glossgate.""The main character, a 30-year-old woman named Annabelle Kapner, ""Annie"" to her friends, manages to be likeable in spite of her unwitting foray into what turns out to be the story of her lifetime. She's funny, but seems to be just on the edge of intelligence. She's a victim of her circumstances, who over-thinks everything--from her career choices to her love life. Often, the progress of the story is stalled, bogged down with too much detail and again, over-thinking by the narrator.Most of the characters are exaggerated stereotypes, including the prima donna anchor, Faith Heide, and the eligible bachelor White House staffer and love interest, Mark Thurber, who works for the corrupt Vice President, as well as Annabelle's jailhouse buddy, a Slavic know-it-all named Galina, who literally tries to slap sense into Annabelle. The plot provides an interesting twist or two, but there's nothing really original or memorable. The author also uses viewer letters to introduce the early chapters, then waivers on the format, quoting journalism notables as chapter heads and from time to time, newspaper clippings from a television critic to propel the story forward. In spite of these criticisms, I had fun with this one and recommend it for a juicy, mindless read. It's kind of like reading a People magazine or the headlines of the tabloids while waiting in line at the grocery store. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2007,"Jun 20, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/917432.Gloss

But Pure Laurie Notaro  Change the names, create an absurd little scenario, and call it fiction. As a fan of Notaro's essay collections, this story, There's a (Slight) Change I Might Be Going to Hell, didn't surprise or disappoint. It doesn't stretch too far from her roots in writing first person vignettes about a funny, irreverent woman, however, the woman in this story happens to be named ""Maye."" Maye is clearly a Laurie alter ego, and it helped to have read her earlier collections to get a full picture of this likeable, humble creature.Maye and her husband, Charlie, move from Phoenix, Arizona to Spaulding, Washington, because of her husband's new job. The plot centers on Maye's insatiable quest to make new friends. She is very unsuccessful--mistaking a coven of witches for a book group, infiltrating a meeting of vegetarians only to be busted eating meat later that night, and making a fool of herself at her first faculty gathering by getting stuck in her sweater and doing a striptease of sorts. She makes an enemy of the town matriarch, Rowena Spaulding, and her postman, who makes it necessary for her to take her dog, Mickey, to obedience training. Ultimately, Maye decides to win friends by attempting to win the annual ""Miss Sewer Pipe"" crown. She obtains a sponsor, the mysterious former Queen, Ruby Spicer, and as their friendship develops, the story grows more interesting. In spite of all the characters bantering back and forth in overly clever repartee and an annoying abundance of similes, I couldn't help but turn the pages just to see how the town pageant would unfold.No great piece of literature, but fans of Laurie Notaro will love this book, and I applaud the author for giving ""fiction"" a crack, even though according to her acknowledgements, she seemed forced into it. Just keep writing Laurie.
