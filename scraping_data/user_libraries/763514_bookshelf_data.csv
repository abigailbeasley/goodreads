This was a solid recommendation because it hits both truths – this book is great literature and it’s a terrific reflection of the bonds between a father and his child. This book is a collection of Smith’s poetry, with the majority of these poems about Smith’s heart and mind as his wife went through pregnancy, as they experienced a complication with their child, and as the child was born and as the child grew. We get to see the full spectrum of parental emotion: joy, fear, wonder, fatigue, more wonder, and more. Not all of the poems are about family. Smith also uses his poetry to speak to being a black man in America, and the fear and anger of his child growing up black in America. Some of the strongest poems are about the latter. Smith’s prose is tight throughout, with every word feeling perfectly intentional. A terrific collection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jun 2023,Jun 2023,"Jul 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61398927-above-ground

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to anything related to Star Wars. This book is a collection of short stories and slices of life told from the imagined vantage points of extraneous characters – all of whom give us a different flavor of Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (ESB). For example, the first story is told from the viewpoint of an Imperial worker who scans the videos sent from probe droids that have been sent all over the galaxy in search of the hidden rebel base. Another story is told from the viewpoint of a Wampa (the creature that captured Luke on Hoth). We also see the perspectives of a Tauntaun, Boba Fett, people who work on Cloud City, and more. And these stories do more than simply re-tell ESB from their eyes; the individual lives of these characters are the focus, and their intersection with the events of ESB are simply the thread that ties these unique lives together. The Star Wars stories have primarily followed the Skywalker storyline, but this book makes it clear that all of the other non-Skywalker inhabitants of this vast Star Wars universe have their own lives, emotions, motivations, struggles, and redemption arcs. These stories aren’t about Star Wars; these stories are about very human experiences. I liked this collection slightly less than I did the first volume which connected to A New Hope (ANH). This collection felt overly weighted on the events of people on Hoth, with several stories feeling repetitive.

At the beginning of this long-form poem, Tessitore sets the scene of him spilling a cup of coffee on papers on which he is scribbling thoughts and memories. He then writes “I scribbled my way through dozens of notebooks, for years, before I started to undo real damage, the violence of defining my character, So much easier to spill today and see what happens later.” And the remainder of the poem is a stream-of-consciousness, poetic meandering of thoughts and impressions. The sections of the poem vary in style and structure and tone and content; so there are parts where Tessitore would swing from a meditation on current events back to a childhood memory and then leap to something else; it was hard to follow in some places.

The dedication gives us a clue as to that theme – it’s dedicated to Harry Partch, a composer and music theorist known for his experimentation within the bounds of classical structure. The poems, then, speak to themes of personal growth and exploration through both new and ancient themes of life. For example, in ""Chromolodeon"", Tessitore writes of fighting off conformity: “The spirit of my rebellion must be . . . adolescent. Its genius is lust, to regain the wonder, the excitement of lawless change, to feel the surge and reject the enormous apparatus of our freedoms – school boards and senatesm pundits and police forces – to remember all the ways we trade the simple for complication.” And yet in ""Prophesy I"", he alludes to the spiritual: “the prophet is not his story not illness sorrow anxiety not the sanctioned murder not the severed finger not the gruesome martyr not the iron fetter not the shrinking tumor not the barren womb the prophet is the word on paper the poison we swallow together the only sound in a quiet room”. There is a spirituality that runs underneath all 5 poems. I continue to appreciate the internal alliteration and cadence of his poetry.

Example of actual travel: “We were typical boys with a typical plan, We set out to see the rest of the country in a rented minivan.

Each slice of life is more impressionistic than descriptive (in a good way). Throughout, there is a consistent voice across each section – particularly in its energetic prose, and internal rhyming and alliteration. For ex: “I used to pick grasses, study seeds, watch the blue sky wash through the trees”. What I loved most about this piece was the juxtaposition of something modern (an Insta feed) with much older allusions (Marcus Aurelius, Saul and David, Leonard Cohen, to name a few). I think Tessitore is making the point that our contemporary stories are the same human stories that have existed throughout time regardless of the platform; and the slices of life reveal this to be true.

The play takes place in 1969 in Pittsburgh. Memphis owns a restaurant in the Hill District. The entirety of the play takes place in this restaurant, with the restaurant itself as a symbol of the play’s larger theme. Various regulars enter each scene: Wolf (a bookie), Risa (a waitress), West (the owner of a funeral parlor), Hambone (a man with some mental/emotional disability causing him to only say the same things over and over), and Sterling (an ex-con who is trying to restart his life). Wilson uses each of these characters to express different struggles of African-American life in the turbulent 1960s. Memphis, for example, has been notified that his diner will be torn down as part of the city’s rebuilding project, and his anger at what he feels is too-low a sale price reflects the anger of the black community continually being undermined while the larger society and culture rebuild and evolve. Sterling’s search for a new life and his to-some-questionable ethics represents a generation of African-Americans willing to do what is needed to be done in order to forge new lives amidst change. Just brilliant framing by Wilson throughout. In comparison to the other works of the Century Cycle, I think this lay works among the better of the plays thematically, but lacks the character connection and big moments of the other plays.

The record is semi-successful, but Floyd hasn’t seen the fruits of that. He is looking to buy his old guitar back from the pawn shop and to bring Vera back to Chicago with him when he records another album. The play follows his struggles to convince Vera to accompany him; to recover his guitar; and to make a better life for himself. Wilson uses Floyd’s confidence in the face of his failures to explore the African-American fight for a better life in the middle of the 20th century. As amazing as the plays are in the Century Cycle, this one for me was the weakest of the first five. My primary issue with it is that I feel like everything in this play is done better in one of the other plays. For example, Floyd is a lesser version of Levee from Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. Floyd’s monologues about trying to make something of himself are lesser versions of Boy Willie’s monologues from The Piano Lesson. And the play lacks the powerful, signature scenes of the other plays.

I found the first book to be better than average (3.5 stars out of 5), but with a shortcoming in the plot advancement. Unfortunately, the same issue carried over to this book. By the end of the first book, the Igiby children (Janner, Tink, and Leeli) find out they are the royal descendants of a defunct kingdom. Unfortunately, their enemies know this about them as well and are after them because of it. The Igiby children, their mother, their grandfather, and a family friend flee their village, attempting to reach the Ice Prairies where they believe they can find a rebel camp, and where they believe the cold weather will keep them safe from Fangs. On the way to the Ice Prairies, however, they run into a gang of thieves (called Stranders). During their flight to the Ice Prairies, the party is forced to split up. At least a third of the book follows Janner’s solo journey as he attempts to rejoin his family. As was true in the first book, Janner and his siblings begin to find out more about their father (who had passed away nine years previously) and their grandfather (who kept the details of his younger days to himself). My big critique of this book is the same critique I had of the first book, which is that Peterson relies on the rash decision-making of the children to advance the plot; and for deus ex machinas to save the family each time. After two books in the tetralogy, I still have no strong personal attachments to the Igiby family (and in many cases, wished they would suffer); and that’s not what I should be feeling. If I hadn’t already purchased the entire tetralogy, I’m not sure I would be finishing it. I rate this book at the same level as the first (3.5 stars out of 5).

For me, the best fantasy fiction does three things well: (1) build out a universe and mythology that seems to live and breathe; (2) tell an sweeping epic that feels as if it is centuries old; and most importantly (3) present me a band of characters that I like and am rooting for. This book – the first in Peterson’s Wingfeather Saga tetralogy – hits on 2 of 3 fairly well, but it misses on the most important one. Janner Igiby lives in a quaint village with his grandfather, mother, younger brother Tink, and younger sister Leeli. They live in the land of Skree, a land which has been oppressed by the lizard-like army (called Fangs) of the villain Gnag the Nameless. Janner and his siblings get on the bad side of a few Fangs one day, setting off a series of events that end up with the Igiby family having to flee their quaint village. As they flee, Janner and his siblings begin to find out more about their father (who had passed away nine years previously), their grandfather (who kept the details of his younger days to himself), and the history and events of Skree. To my earlier point about what good fantasy fiction needs to do, this book does build out a unique universe that feels both medieval and believable. The fangs work as characters, the land has dragons and a Dragon Day Festival, and footnotes in each chapter reference imaginary books and poems making the history feel real. My biggest critique is the way Peterson advances the plot. The plot is fairly linear, with one event leading to the next. But most of the events that occur do so because of the rash actions of the Igiby children. Tink is impetuous, and Leeli wanders off twice; and their actions lead to dire situations for the entire family and their village. Moreover, the main characters only survive these dire situations by several deus ex machinas. This is lazy plotting, and after awhile, the manufactured tension irritated me; in turn, my irritation led me to wishing ill on the Igiby children – not what I ought be feeling towards the protagonists of a tetralogy.

Each play is set in a different decade, August Wilson’s brilliant 10-play Century Cycle captures the black experience in America in the 20th century. Each play is set in a different decade, and muses on different themes of the black experience. Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom is chronologically the third play in the cycle. The play takes place in 1927 in Chicago – the only one of the Century Cycle that doesn’t take place in Pittsburgh. A band is rehearsing in a studio and preparing to record an album together. Most of the band are men in their mid-50’s, but they are joined by a thirty-something, brash trumpeter named Levee who brings a swagger and confidence that rubs the band the wrong way. Ma Rainey is the lead vocals and also the unquestioned leader of the band; it is her album they are recording. The play explores several dynamics as these characters attempt to record the album: the dynamic between Ma and Levee, the dynamic between Ma and her white manager and white record label exec, the dynamic between the younger Levee and the older bandmates. As in the earlier plays in the cycle, Wilson uses the different characters and their perspectives to subtly and overtly explore important questions across multiple angles. In Ma Rainey, Wilson explores the changing power dynamics for blacks during the 1920s. For example, in one scene, Toledo calls for the bandmates to recognize that blacks at this time were considered “leftovers”; and that whites held all the control. Ma Rainey’s ability to dictate the details of the rehearsal on her terms, however, represents how blacks who had power ought to use that power. Levee reflected a position where he was willing to play the power dynamic game in subordination to whites only insofar as it allowed him to build his own power so as to change the dynamic later on. Wilson’s framing of these viewpoints was really well done. Throughout, Wilson’s dialogue and prose sparkle with energy and emotion. More than in Gem of the Ocean or Joe Turner’s Come and Gone, the dialogue in Ma Rainey had more overt anger and stridency of tone. Characters essentially argue through the majority of the scenes. This choice of prose was made due to the primary theme of power struggles, and it serves that theme well. My one critique of this play is its lack of subtlety. In both Gem and Joe Turner, the themes are explored symbolically or beneath the surface of the dialogue. In Ma Rainey, the theme is explored expositorily as characters verbalized their viewpoints.

Each play is set in a different decade, and muses on different themes of the black experience. Joe Turner’s Come and Gone is chronologically the second play in the cycle. The play takes place in 1911 in the Hill District of Pittsburgh. Seth and Bertha Holly run a boardinghouse. Over a three-week period, several people take up lodging, joining a man named Bynum who already lives there. Bynum claims to have the power to “bind people” together through song. He also seems to be able to read each person’s “song”. Essentially, the plot revolves around these various lodgers trying to live their lives and figure out who they are (figure out their song). Wilson uses this as a powerful metaphor to explore different ways black Americans wrestled with their identities during the 1910s. Seth finds his identity in making money and building a better life for him and his wife. A character named Jeremy and two female boarders (Molly and Mattie) find their identities in their relationships. A man named Loomis is seeking the wife that he hasn’t seen in a decade; his identity is less in the relationship itself, and more in the hold that his past has on him. As in Gem of the Ocean, Wilson uses the different characters and their perspectives to subtly and overtly explore important questions across multiple angles. Throughout, Wilson’s dialogue and prose sparkle with energy and emotion. I also appreciated the magical realism in the play that represents black spirituality as a centering and grounding force for the characters (reflected in a scene between Bynum and Loomis discuss a vision Loomis was having).

His books are widely read, especially A Christmas Carol. In this book, Silva tells a fictional account of the writing of A Christmas Carol. It is 1843, and Dickens is at the height of his popularity, making him wealthy. But his wealth makes him prey to friends, family, acquaintances, and businesses that all benefit from his generosity. When his latest work (Martin Chuzzlewit) bombs, Dickens’ publisher requests he write a Christmas novel to rebuild his reputation and wealth. The competing pressures of Dickens trying to satisfy the many people who count on him; writing a new novel on a short deadline; and just living up to being Charles Dickens causes him to lash out at those around him, and to isolate himself from those he loves. But he meets a woman named Eleanor Lovejoy who becomes his muse, and his story merges with her story. Moreover, their story runs somewhat parallel to the plot of A Christmas Carol; just a well-formed construct. The prose is Dickensian and Victorian in its vocabulary and atmosphere, but also with more vibrancy and less dry than most novels of that era. The book isn’t perfect. I found Dickens to be a bit of a creepy philanderer in many parts of the book, making him somewhat unlikable. And the ending is a bit predictable.

Each play is set in a different decade, and muses on different themes of the black experience. Gem of the Ocean is chronologically the first play in the cycle, although one of the last published. The play takes place in 1904 in the Hill District of Pittsburgh. Aunt Ester is the mystical matriarch of this district and runs a boardinghouse. The neighborhood is in turmoil due to the recent death of a millworker accused of stealing a bucket of nails. A man named Citizen Barlow comes to the boardinghouse seeking to have “his soul washed”, and we see how that connects to the mill incident. Each character in the play voices a different perspective on the meaning and implication of the millworker’s death, with each perspective wrestling more broadly with how black people (just four decades post-emancipation) ought to utilize their freedom. Citizen Barlow, for example, reflects the tension of how our pasts (or symbolically, America’s past) shackles the present. Another character named Solly Two Kings utilizes his voice and freedom to try and bring voice and freedom to relatives in the South who lack either; and speaks to the need of using our freedom to impact others. A character named Caesar who is a police officer in the Hill District represents a voice calling for submission to law and order regardless of whether the laws are unfair. Wilson’s use of these different characters to voice different perspectives is such strong framing. Throughout, Wilson’s dialogue and prose capture this tension and just-beneath-the-surface anger.

Again, in the other books, the storytelling was able to overcome the two potential problems. Unfortunately, those reasons are exactly why I found this short story (it’s not long enough to be called a novella) disappointing. An unnamed wealthy man is dying of cancer.

Charlie is a mentally disabled man who undergoes an experimental surgery to increase his intelligence. The surgery is a success, and over a period of about 6-7 months, his IQ increases dramatically. As his IQ changes, however, Charlie’s perspective on his relationships with the people in his life also changes. For example, he finally understands that his co-workers at the bakery he worked at weren’t his friends; they had been making fun of him. Charlie also begins to recall memories of his childhood and the abuse he experienced from his mom who struggled with supporting and raising a disabled child. The prose is told in a series of first-person journal entries describing Charlie’s feelings and the events of his days. This is an effective narrative, as we can see Charlie’s mental development through the development of the prose in these entries. The reader also becomes quickly attached to Charlie through these personal glimpses of his struggles. I had two critiques of the story. First, the pacing felt uneven to me. There were stretches in the middle that felt like we were capturing too much minutiae, and the plot wasn’t advancing quickly enough. And then towards the end, there was a breakneck rush towards the finish line. I wished the pacing had been more consistent. Second, Charlie did too many stupid/terrible things that made him unlikable at certain points in the story, particularly in the story’s last act. On one hand, he experienced and was experiencing much trauma and was not emotionally capable of behaving differently. On the other hand, knowing the reasons for his behavior did not make him feel like any less of a jackass to me. That dynamic impacted my reception of the story’s conclusion. It would have been more impactful for me if I had felt more positively towards Charlie. Still, the fact that the story drew such strong emotions from me speaks to its quality.

My five-star books all fall into the third category; and because I’m a bit of a book snob, writer’s books tend to get 4 stars. Euphoria is a writer’s book that almost crossed over into the great books category. King roughly based this novel on Margaret Mead and a love triangle she had with two other anthropologists. Andrew Bankson is an anthropologist studying a people group in New Guinea along the Sepik River in the 1930s. He runs into two married anthropologists: Nell (an American who had written a popular monograph), and Fen (an ambitious Australian whom he had previously known). Nell and Fen are looking for a new people group to study, and Bankson assists them. Bankson begins falling in love with Nell (and she him) as the three of them continue their studies of local tribal culture. The book gets its title from Nell, who explains that her favorite part of studying new tribes is the feeling about two months into the work where she feels like she really understands the people and the culture. In a bit of foreshadowing, however, Nell notes that the euphoria is quickly replaced by the truth that people and cultures are far more complicated. This is what I mean by how layered the narrative is, as the characters begin learning about their new cultures, Bankson and Nell and Fen are learning about themselves and their intertwined relationships – and everything is complicated; just well-constructed prose and narrative. The book felt very 19th century British romance lit: there is a gentility about the three protagonists, a langourousness in the prose, and Austen-like relationships.

I prefer my books to have more nuanced, less linear storylines, as well as narratives that touch on deeper themes. So I don’t know that I’m the audience for a book like this. In The River, best friends Jack and Wynn embark on an end-of-summer camping and canoeing trip on the Maskwa River in Northern Canada. Their planned idyllic trip is interrupted by a raging wildfire and the appearance of a man who may or may not have killed his wife. Jack and Wynn must contend with the wildfire, the raging rapids, and the uncertainty of the situation. That’s pretty much the frame of the plot: a survival story complicated by the protagonists trying to determine what the right thing to do is. This is definitely a page-turner, with the plot screaming forward about a third of the way through the book all the way to the conclusion. And Heller tries to break up what is largely a linear plot by providing short glimpses into Jack’s and Wynn’s backstories. I don’t know anything about camping, canoeing, hunting, fishing, or outdoor equipment, so some of Heller’s very specific descriptions were lost on me, but I’m sure outdoorsy people will enjoy his prose.

The first century church not only distributed the manuscripts, but also shared them via storytelling. In that storytelling tradition, in this book, Bloom takes a number of stories out of the Bible and fictionalizes them. In some, he takes characters that have been transformed by Jesus and imagines what they might do after their Jesus encounters. For example, Bloom describes an interaction between Zacchaeus and a man that had been defrauded by Zacchaeus. Zacchaeus is returning four-fold what he had taken from him per Scripture, and we get to see both Zacchaeus’ new attitude and heart as well as the ripple impact such repentance might have on others. In another example, we get to see the internal dialogue and mindset of a person processing what God put before them. We see, for example, Joseph processing Mary’s announcement to him that she was pregnant with God’s child. At the end of these fictionalized accounts, Bloom shares his lesson on faith. Bloom’s fictionalized accounts never stray towards heresy; his imaginings of people’s actions and feelings seem to fit within the bounds of Scripture. For me, while I found the accounts very readable, I had two small critiques. One, Bloom’s choices of stories seem to be the obvious choices: Joseph (both from the OT and NT), Peter, Zacchaeus, David, etc. The only obvious choice that was missing was the prodigal son. And my second critique is that not only are the stories the obvious choices, but the insights from those stories are fairly straightforward: that God has a plan even during our suffering, that we no longer need to feel guilt or shame because there is no condemnation in Christ and that we’re forgiven, that Jesus is more valuable than our idols, etc. These are all valuable lessons that Bloom shares, but they also all feel like we’ve heard them all before.

In this book, Park tells the true story of one of these Lost Boys: Salva Dut. Salva was 11 when his school was attacked. Unable to get home, Salva joined other fleeing refugees headed to Ethiopia. Park shares Salva’s struggle with the physical toll of walking hundreds of miles, the toll of hunger, and the emotional toll brought on by the fear of death and the sorrow of not seeing one’s family. Salva eventually made it to a refugee camp in Ethiopia and remained there for some time – until it was shut down by the government, and Salva was forced to once again walk to survive. I won’t spoil the rest of Salva’s journey, but it was as harrowing and as difficult as you can imagine. As engrossing as Salva’s journey is, however, the book doesn’t quite work for me. For one, the prose is fairly basic – I didn’t see any indication that the book was a YA book, but it certainly reads like one. Second, there are several large jumps in time where we don’t hear any details about what Salva’s life was like. For example, once Salva reaches the Ethiopian refugee camp, we are told that he spent nearly six years there; and those six years are merely glossed over without any description of that time.

A female writer falls in love, gets married, has a child, learns how to parent, suffers betrayal, and learns how to continue living – that’s the plot. Seriously, that’s it. Unfortunately, that’s such a common human experience and is told through so many books and TV shows and movies, that a book has to really teach you something new to stand out. This book fails on that count. The tension point in ing this book is that Offill’s prose is terrific. It reads like a third person journal or diary, and each sentence is carefully laid out. And the wife’s observations (we don’t get her name) deftly span a range of emotions: love, anger, hope, joy, frustration, longing, and so on. The prose routinely combined poetry with profundity. But even the best prose couldn’t do more with such a simple story. Beautifully written, but left me wanting more from it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Sep 2020,Sep 2020,"Sep 05, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19635587-dept-of-speculation

The Gentleman’s Agreement of 1907In the late 19th century, large numbers of Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii and the west coast of the US mainland. The Gentleman’s Agreement of 1907 limited the immigration of Japanese males, but did allow for wives and children to come to the US. Out of this arose Japanese “Picture Brides” – arranged marriages between Japanese women looking for new lives in America and settled Japanese immigrants. This book provides a glimpse at the lives of these picture brides. Otsuka’s prose is fantastic, conveying both specific and general impressions of what it felt like to travel to the US, to begin new lives, to give birth to and to raise children, and to socialize with each other and with white Americans. We see the difficulty of adjusting to a new culture; we see the casual and overt racism towards Japanese Americans; we feel their failed expectations; we see their successes; we see their struggle to maintain their culture; and so on. The unique part of Otsuka’s prose is that she uses a first-person plural narrative structure. We don’t get any specific, named protagonists; rather the collective unified voice of picture brides is the protagonist. So what we get is not a glimpse of one life, but rather a poetic, impressionistic look at all of their lives. It works terrifically well. And as powerful as each chapter is, to me the most powerful chapters are the final two that take us to the Japanese internment camps during WWII. We get to see the collective picture bride reaction to internment; and then in the last chapter, Otsuka switches the first-person plural to that of white Americans dealing with the sudden disappearance of Japanese Americans from their communities. Otsuka’s point about both the visibility and invisibility of Asian immigrants is powerfully made. An indelibly heartbreaking read in many ways.

Mabel and Jack are an older married couple who move to the Alaskan wilderness to make a life for themselves, and to escape their grief after Mabel suffers a miscarriage. They are having a hard go of trying to start a homestead — both because of the hardness of the Alaskan wilderness, especially in the winter; and because of their loneliness (no friends, no kids). One winter night, on a lark, they play in the snow and this moment of levity amidst the grimness of their lives leads them to build a little girl out of snow, complete with mittens and coat. The next morning, the mittens and coat are gone, and Mabel and Jack see a little girl flitting about their land. All of this reminds Mabel of a Russian folktale she had been told as a child of a childless couple who build a snow child that comes to life. The rest of the book traces the impact the mysterious appearance of this girl has on their lives. Ivey’s prose is absolutely stunning, with sentences that are spare yet dripping with deep emotion. Throughout the story, we feel this underlying melancholy that undergirds the couple’s growing sense of joy and hope and love. Moreover, her plot has you guessing at every turn. Is this girl real? Did she come to life with the building of the snowman? But then Ivey will throw in a detail that has you believing the girl is more than just the magical realization of Mabel’s and Jack’s desire for a child – until the next turn of plot. It’s masterful storytelling. But Ivey’s real skill is how quickly and how deeply she gets you invested into these characters. I cared about Mabel and Jack and Faina (the snow child) so much I had to keep reading; at the same time, I didn’t want to keep reading because it meant their story would end. The story felt like an adult fairy tale; utterly magical and beautiful. I read it twice in just a few days. One of my favorite reads from the last few years.

He’s self-deprecating, transparent, and down-to-earth. I also like that his jokes are not one-liners, but rather long-form stories. That said, I thought his first book (Sleepwalk With Me) didn’t hit the mark. I found this book better than Sleepwalk With Me, but still not at the level of his comedy specials. In this book, Birbiglia shares about his marriage, and about the pact that he and his wife had not to have children. His wife changes her mind about children, and he reluctantly goes along with that. Very reluctantly, as every other page he reminds you that he didn’t want children. The book covers the stress and anger he feels over how his life has changed because of his newborn; the jealousy he feels about the bond his wife has with their daughter that he doesn’t seem to have; the chaos of being new parents; and the eventual bond he forms with his daughter. Throughout, he is completely transparent with his feelings. There were many moments that I laughed out loud at, but also long stretches where I didn’t. And while I completely respect his level of transparency in this, parts of it read as if he was seeking affirmation for what in some parts amounted to his own selfishness. I mean, he may have reluctantly entered into parenthood because of his wife, but to expect his life not to change at all and to resent having to change – real feelings or otherwise, him being transparent doesn’t make me like him for those moments, nor do I feel any need to provide any absolution simply because of his transparency.

In this non-fiction account of a serial killer in Both as a solo author and as a partner with Lincoln Child, Preston is known for crafting thrillers. In this non-fiction account of a serial killer in and around Florence, Italy, Preston not only describes a crime thriller, but also he participates in one. In 1984, a couple is caught being intimate in a parked car and is murdered. The local press — led by reporter Mario Spezi — tie the murder to a similar murder from 1968. Then over the course of the next 18 months, several more couples are similarly murdered. A serial killer is on the loose, and he’s dubbed the Monster of Florence. Preston follows Spezi’s investigation into all of the major and minor suspects, and the continued incompetence of the Florentine legal system over the years. Preston also digs into the history of Florence and its citizens, and ties how their history and culture impact the investigation. All of that occurs in the first half of the book. The second half of the book revolves around an investigation into Spezi’s and Preston’s involvement in the murders. A local judge and investigator craft a (according to Preston’s accounting) bonkers theory involving a satanic cult responsible for the murders. And because of Spezi’s public reporting disputing the wild theory, he and Preston (because of a book the two were collaborating together on) are targeted for interfering with the investigation — possibly because they were somehow involved. Overall, while it is an engaging read, I had two major problems. First, I found the pacing off. The first half flew by, but the second half was a drag. Way too much time was spent on the contemporary investigation of Spezi and Preston. That should not have been given equal billing with the actual serial killer murder investigation from the first half. Related, I had no interest in Preston’s self-centered reporting of his involvement. It actually took away from the credibility of the rest of the book. Was the first half of the book written to protect Spezi and Preston? When he is criticizing the Florentine legal system, is it because of incompetence or is it to shine a better light on Spezi and Preston? Is this a non-fiction investigation or a public defense of one’s innocence? You get my point.

And my dream vacation isn’t to Europe; it’s to Disney’s Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge attraction. All this to say, I love everything Star Wars, including these books that flesh out the Star Wars Expanded Universe. In this book, Luceno gives us a glimpse into what makes Grand Moff Tarkin tick. Some of you think Tarkin is a minor character – a bad guy that appears in Ep IV: A New Hope. You folks are missing out on all that is good in this world. Tarkin has appeared in Rogue One, Rebels, Clone Wars, and Zahn’s new Thrawn books, among a number of other things; he is a very important character. From A New Hope, we get a sense that he is ruthless and cruel. From Rogue One and the Zahn novels, we get that he is Machiavellian and politically astute. Luceno’s novel gives us the why behind why he is how he is. It isn’t just Grand Moff Tarkin who is like this – all the Tarkins are raised to be strong and fearless; capable and willing to do whatever is necessary to further their own interests. This book takes place between Episodes III and IV – the Death Star is being built, Vader is the Emperor’s right-hand man, and Tarkin is one of the highest-ranking Imperial officials. Vader and Tarkin are sent together to investigate a communications cache. It turns out to be a ruse in order for some rebels to steal Tarkin’s ship. The rest of the novel is a cat-and-mouse hunt as Tarkin seeks both to recover his ship as well as uncover the true purpose of these ship-stealers and their actions against the Empire. The book is largely told from Tarkin’s perspective, so we get a glimpse into the cunningness of his mind as he tries to figure out who stole his ship and why, and where it is going to be. And what Luceno does well is to repeatedly tie the way Tarkin thinks to lessons learned from his upbringing. We learn that Tarkin’s uncle Jova took him into the wilds of his home planet and taught Tarkin hard lessons about survival. And the survivalist instincts Tarkin developed, and the lessons he learned about outwitting prey come to play decades later. The plot itself is fine if not somewhat forgettable, but frankly, the plot was meant to be secondary to the character development. Overall, one of the better SWEU books.

A group of friends and I watched it in the theater, and I still remember the ENTIRE theater openly sobbing at the end. Back then, it seemed like a typical book club read, so I avoided it. Now having read it, I regret having waited so long. The story revolves around four Chinese women who play Mahjong together. One of them passes away, and so her daughter takes her place at the game. But the book is not about the game or even the relationships between these four playing partners. Rather it is about the relationships these four women have with their four daughters. The chapters alternate between flashbacks relating the lives of the four mothers and the lives of the four daughters. All of the mothers led rough lives in China: one had to flee Japanese occupation and left her infant twin daughters for dead; another was the daughter of a mistreated concubine of a wealthy merchant; another was married off young. These rough lives are contrasted with the unhappy lives of their daughters in America decades later (most of them because of failed relationships) By the end of the book, these daughters learn more about their mothers’ lives and characters and reach some level of understanding. The book explores the stereotypical Asian tiger mom relationship with daughters. The prose is very readable, and the narrative structure keeps the pace engaging. The very Asian storytelling and dialogue and prose resonated with me deeply. I am an Asian-American – born overseas, but raised in the states since before I was a year old – and the mothers sound exactly like my mother. And the weaving of Asian proverbs and ancestral history and family dynamics – Tan is writing from a place of authenticity, and it’s terrific. My small critique of the book is that it packs so many emotional themes: from arranged marriages to rape to loss of child to loss of a mother to broken marriages, et al. It makes everything feel emotionally heavy, and in some instances, crosses the line of maudlin sentimentality. But it’s a very small critique.

An Imperial efficiency expert named Count Vidian arrives and begins poorly treating the citizens of this planet (as Imperials are wont to do), as well as recommending serious changes to the mining operations for unclear reasons. Meanwhile, Hera arrives to meet up with a local informant, but begins investigating Vidian’s actions. Their paths cross, and Kanan and Hera must team up (with each other as well as two locals) to figure out and stop Vidian’s plans, and to save the planet. As you can see from the plot description, it’s fairly generic – clearly evil Imperial comes to town, and clearly good-hearted people save the day. And that would be my critique of this book: while fun, especially for fans of Rebels, it’s pretty cookie-cutter. That’s especially true of the prose. There’s very little scene description. The prose consists primarily of dialogue stringing together action scenes. It almost reads like a Young Adult book. And there isn’t a lot of character nuance.

I’m actually writing this  while wearing a T-shirt that I received for Father’s Day this year – a Tshirt with a picture of Han Solo saying “I know” (my wife’s Tshirt is Leia saying “I love you”). This book imagines Star Wars, Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker as a Shakespearean play told in iambic pentameter, complete with acts, scenes, asides, and so forth. Many of the lines of dialogue are simply reinvented lines from the movie told in old English (“Yet fear not, Poe, for we are many more – There are far more of us who still have hope!”). Doescher does more than simply translate every line of the movie into Shakespearean prose, however. He creates scenes and monologues to complement and supplement the movie lines. For example, there’s a major turning point in Kylo Ren’s character about ¾ of the way through the movie – one of my favorite scenes of any Star Wars movie. Doescher gives voice to Kylo’s internal pivot in a monologue that legitimately made the scene better for me and brought me to genuine tears. In addition, Doescher decides to show off and pulls off what might be the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen done in a book – he provides a monologue to a cameo character played by John Williams and constructs the monologue in such a way that it embeds musical notes from one of Williams’ Star Wars themes. Fans of Star Wars will appreciate this; fans of Shakespeare will appreciate this; fans of both will LOVE this. This may end up being my top book of the year.

I found Chiang’s prose and storytelling to be magnificent in Story of Your Life; in this collection, less so. This collection contains nine unique stories: in “Exhalation”, a race of living machines realize the very act of breathing will eventually lead to the end of their existence; in “The Lifecycle of Software Objects”, the protagonists wrestle with existential questions about their virtual creatures; in “The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling”, we get paired narratives that reflect on the nature of stored memory and its relation to our identity, to name just three. And throughout all of the stories in this collection, Chiang reflects on how technology impacts what it means to be human in terrific ways. I continue to be impressed with Chiang’s ability to create unique alternate worlds that still plumb deep questions relevant to our world. The difference for me in quality between Story of Your Life and this collection is that this collection felt a bit less polished. “Exhalation”, for example, felt like it ran on for a few more pages than it should have, as if Chiang didn’t feel like he had made his point (he had), so he continued to emphasize it. Similarly, “The Lifecycle of Software Objects” mines several different existential questions about the nature of humanity and personhood, but it also felt long, as if the thought experiment had run its course and then some. And while “The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling” was one of my favorites in the collection, parts of it felt like an essay on the nature of memory rather than a story. Chiang is an incredibly talented writer; but in this collection, I felt the seams were too visible, if that makes sense. Still, some of this is nitpicky as I very much enjoyed this book.

The plot gives you a whirlwind tour of the Discworld universe and almost serves as a Discworld 101. That is, we learn a little about how magic works, we get the character of both Rincewind and the city of Ankh-Morpork; we get to see how the gods interact with people; and we get to see Pratchett’s sense of dry humor. It’s a quick read, and I think a reader’s reaction to this book is likely a good predictor of whether they’ll enjoy other Pratchett Discworld books. For me, I didn’t find anything necessarily that would drive me to read through all of the Discworld books as fast as I can; I’ll continue to read them occasionally.

In this short book, Keller lays out the challenges the church has in evangelism in the current zeitgeist; but he also provides the underlying principles needed to overcome those challenges. This is definitely not a how-to guide for church outreach programs – that is, Keller doesn’t provide any specific tactical guidance on what programs to implement or how to preach a relevant sermon. Rather, Keller lists the overarching themes that have characterized the church historically, and connects those characteristics to modern challenges. For example, the early church was known for its commitment to social justice causes — clearly something that resonates with modern cultural conversations around justice. For those who have read other essays by Keller or listened to some of his sermons, most of this book will seem repetitious as a lot of the content has appeared throughout his preaching and teaching. This book does a good job of coalescing those thoughts into a concise framework. A must-read for the modern church, especially those in western countries....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Apr 2020,Apr 2020,"Apr 21, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51152276-how-to-reach-the-west-again

I like two things about his writings: (1) He understands the gospel and holds it as central to all things Christianity; and (2) he has engaging, readable prose. These things were true in the other four Wilson books I’ve read, and it’s certainly true in this one. In Imperfect Disciple, Wilson sets out to provide a better, more effective way to grow people spiritually. Most books, sermon series, or ministries about discipleship provide practical and tactical behaviors to drive consistent spiritual disciplines. The logic behind that approach is that mature Christians read their Bibles, pray, serve, attend church, etc; so goal-setting, monitoring, and improving these behaviors will lead to maturity. Wilson notes that this standard approach fails because people are imperfect (losers, actually), and what is needed isn’t better discipline but rather a focus on the gospel. One of my favorite quotes in the book: “The essential message of Christianity isn’t ‘do’ but ‘done.’ The good news is news, not instruction, and it announces to us not ‘get to work’ but ‘it is finished.’” That’s not to say Wilson doesn’t encourage us to partake of important spiritual habits like Bible-reading, prayer, church, and so forth; it’s just that doing so for the sake of doing so is less effective than doing so because the person truly understands the beauty and majesty of Christ and what was accomplished by Him through the gospel. It is essentially the same point made by Tim Keller in Prodigal God. Keller noted: “Religion operates on the principle of “I obey – therefore I am accepted by God.” The basic operating principle of the gospel is “I am accepted by God through the work of Jesus Christ – therefore I obey.” One of the better books on discipleship you will read....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Feb 2020,Feb 2020,"Feb 17, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32510933-the-imperfect-disciple

One can easily make the argument that Rogue One is among the top five best Star Wars movies; Catalyst is the backstory leading up to the events of Rogue One. Catalyst essentially tells the story of three people: Galen Erso, Galen’s wife Lyra, and Orson Krennic. Galen is a brilliant energy scientist who is called into service (manipulated into service) by the Republic, and whose work eventually leads to the successful creation of the Death Star. The manipulation part comes at the hands of Krennic, a former classmate of Galen. Krennic’s career ambitions drive him to bring value to the Republic by building a super weapon. Lyra is the tension point around which Galen and Krennic circle, as Galen’s desire to protect and provide for his wife (and young daughter) is the lever used by Krennic to bring Galen into the Republic’s fold. The book does a tremendous job of building out the lives and motivations of all three people: we see Galen’s scientific brilliance and idealism; we see Krennic’s political savvy and reptilian charm; and we see Lyra’s moxie and integrity. And we see how all of these things lead to Galen becoming an integral part of the construction of the Death Star; but also how they lead to him escaping with Lyra and Jyn into hiding out. Throughout the prose is engaging and easy-to-read. This book is Exhibit A in how to produce content that expands on the events of a movie.

I enjoyed it enough that I picked up this book. I made a mistake in doing so; everything I enjoyed from Salt to the Sea I despised in Out of the Easy. Josie Moraine is a 17-year-old daughter of a prostitute living in 1950’s New Orleans. She splits her time working for a bookstore and the brothel in which her mother works. Josie is all the things her mother is not: smart, virtuous, honest, etc. and dreams of leaving New Orleans to attend a good college. A visitor from out-of-town ends up murdered, and Josie’s life begins to spiral out-of-control at the exact same time she is trying to be in control and escape her life and upbringing. My issues: first, the prose was boring and linear. I don’t need multiple perspectives to liven up prose, but I do need prose that doesn’t feel ordinary. Second, Josie is a walking trope of a character. She’s obviously beautiful and one of the smartest girls around. She treats everyone with kindness. Everyone who meets her loves her. She has no nuance. Even worse, all of the characters that surround her are walking tropes: the devilishly handsome, motorcycle-riding guy who all the girls love but who only has eyes for Josie; the lecherous, rich antagonist; and seriously, haven’t we played out the hookers-with-hearts-of-gold stereotype yet? Yeesh. Lastly, the story is frustrating. It’s predictable, with an ending with several deus ex machinas.

I don’t even know that you can call it a memoir, Slate is a comedian and an actress, and in this book, she puts her creativity to use in memoir form. I don’t even know that you can call it a memoir, though, since memoirs actually share details about events. These chapters read more like impressions of scenes, rather than actual scenes. It’s like describing the colors you see without actually describing what you see. Maybe a diary rather than a memoir? Whatever you call it, it didn’t work for me. The book is filled with short chapters that read like stream of consciousness (often bad) poetry describing various stages of her life. For memoirs or diaries to work for me, though, they must: (a) provide moments that resonate emotionally; and (b) provide insights on the human condition. This book fails on both accounts. A lot of that has to do with Slate’s prose. It’s one thing to have creative prose; it’s another thing to have so much of it, or to use it in such a way that it overwhelms any underlying emotion or point. That is very much the case for this book. The prose is this “Oh look how quirky I am”, different-to-be-different writing style that I would call a poor man’s Etgar Keret. It’s how a high school sophomore writes in a creative writing class after reading David Sedaris. Look at this sentence: “When I imagine my ingredients, I imagine that my muscles are made of plums, that my heart is a giant ruby with a light bulb in it, that my blood is goldenrod yellow, and the bones inside my body are made from lions’ bones and shells, and that my brain is made of steak and silk and Hawaiian Punch.” Or this sentence: “What if a moonbeam gets caught in my soup and I swallow it in a sip and then I always float a little bit off the ground because there is a moonbeam in my stomach?” These sentences try too hard to be quirky or profound and are neither. Part of the problem is that Slate really only tries to convey two points and doesn’t land either. The first point she communicates is that she is quirky and different and independent. But it comes off as disingenuous. Ever meet a girl at a party who has had like three sips of beer and goes around loudly proclaiming “Oh my gosh, I am so wasted right now! And I get so wild and crazy when I’m drunk. I can’t even.” Except they’re not drunk, wild, or crazy? In my experience, the more someone states they are quirky, different, and independent, the less likely they are really those things. And the second point she tries to communicate is that she has had relationship issues. But she doesn’t really provide any relationship particulars; rather, she describes vague heartbreaks and relationship problems in one chapter, but then follows that chapter up with a chapter where she declares things like she is an actual, literal mouse. This makes everything, including her real heartaches, feel like fantasy rather than reality. This is what I mean when I noted that her prose overwhelms her point.

It is a much-read classic (required reading for those in Classical Christian education), and one of the most famous allegories ever written. The first half of the story follows a man named Christian, an Everyman who has recently read a Bible and been convicted of its truth. A man named Evangelist points him to the way to the Celestial City from his hometown (the City of Destruction). The book traces his journey on the King’s Highway to the Celestial City, through such places as the Hill of Difficulty, the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and Vanity Fair. During his journey, Christian meets up with good people with obvious names such as Faithful and Hopeful, and faithless people (also with obvious names like Mr. Worldly Wiseman, Formalist, Hypocrisy, etc). The second half of the story follows Christian’s wife Christiana and their four sons. Christian had left his family as they had not believed at the time he had. The family is now convicted and thus retrace Christian’s journey to the Celestial City, stopping at most of the same places he had. Most of the second part, unsurprisingly, feels repetitive. Bunyan’s writing style consists of prose that is filled with Bible verse after Bible verses expositing whatever lesson he was trying to impart. My two critiques of this classic: (1) It is definitely a book geared towards Christians. It is not a work of apologetics whatsoever. Rather, it’s meant as character lessons for believers to persevere in their faith, to refrain from sin, to stay away from bad company, etc. (2) It has no subtlety whatsoever.

This play is staged as Sugar at home behind a laptop, with players behind her voicing their letters aloud to Sugar. Sugar replies aloud with advice wrapped around pieces of her life story. The letters range from the light-hearted (someone’s girlfriend has a Santa Claus fetish) to the serious (ought a survivor of sexual abuse disclose her trauma to her current partner). Sugar’s responses always convey authenticity, compassion, and strength. My main criticisms of the play are (a) that the range of letters span the topics you would imagine they would cover for a dramatic play seeking to plumb the depths of human emotion (sexual abuse, broken marriages, death of a loved one, gender identity issues, et al) — a grab-bag of every emotional topic possible; and (b) that the advice is the standard advice of the culture (you’re beautiful and strong, forgive, live/laugh/love, savor every moment, etc).

As people approach death, they feel like they have much to share and pass on before they pass on; so, too, do we the audience feel like we ought to listen to whatever final pearls of wisdom might drop from the lips of the dying. Eno tackles this theme head on in his play Wakey, Wakey. In this nearly one-person monologue, a dying man named Guy (or possibly his name isn’t Guy, and he is just referred to as a guy; some Everyman) sits in a wheelchair and shares his final thoughts. Throughout the play, he reads and shuffles through a series of index cards, as if he has tried to record and plan out his last words. And yet, Guy’s thoughts are often confused; his thoughts fading off; his cards making no sense. Instead of profound maxims, Guy tries to get the audience to focus on an image in their heads, or to listen to something played by the sound booth. That is, rather than dropping proverbs, he attempts instead to share his experiences with the collective audience. And as Guy fails to get through his cards, and as he stumbles through what he wants to say, we sense his growing frustration and urgency as his end approaches. Eno’s point comes across clearly: more often than not, our final days are ones of confusion not clarity; ordinary not profound; immemorable not worthy of permanent commemoration.

Welcome to my feelings about this book. To be clear, no one had recommended this book to me, but I had certain expectations for it from its title and Amazon book summary. As someone who loves The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and loves fantasy fiction, I imagined this book would be an exciting tale with a protagonist who jumped to world after world through magical doors, and who experienced adventure after adventure. Instead, I got a standard YA novel that fell far short of the awesome adventure I had in my head. January is a young lady whose father was a relic-chaser who spent 90% of his time on the road, leaving January in the care of her father’s employer (and de facto foster dad) and various nannies. January discovers a book one day that tells about magical doors that lead to different worlds, and about a young lady named Adelaide who meets a young man named Yule Ian. Bad people are shutting these doors down, so Adelaide has to try to find a way back to Yule Ian. Meanwhile, Jenny finds her own mysterious door, but before she can explore the world on the other side, she encounters her own difficulties, primarily her father’s employer who won’t let her live her life. When January’s father goes missing and is presumed dead, January must up-end her life and search for truth. If this summary seems fairly generic, you’ll understand my disappointment on finding that this was what I got instead of the door-jumping adventure in my head. Beyond unmet expectations, though, my disappointments are several. First, how do you title your book “Ten Thousand Doors”, and have your protagonist use like three doors? Second, let us count how many YA tropes Harrow used. Headstrong, young, beautiful female protagonist? Check. Parents missing or dead? Check. Perfect, noble significant other who continues to risk his life to assist protagonist? Check. Obvious villain? Check. Trope after trope. Combine that with a plot line that you could see intertwining from miles away, and you get a frustrating level of predictability. Lastly, January continues to make frustratingly stupid decisions that lead to predictable problems. This construct reminded me of Ceony Twill from The Paper Magician. It’s a trope where the plot advances through the poor decision-making of the protagonist. I hate said trope. There’s a section of readers who love this kind of trope-reliant storytelling. I am not one of them. There are far better door-to-another-world stories.

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to Superman; he is my absolute favorite character across all my nerd fandoms (MCU, DC, Star Wars, LotR, et al). I love stories that approach their storyline from a meta perspective. In this completely original take on Superman, Busiek imagines a world where Superman exists as a comic book character but not an actual superhero. He then imagines a child growing up in Kansas who is named Clark Kent (and is continuously teased and bullied for that as he grows up). But what happens if one day, this normal Clark Kent develops the actual powers of Superman? This is a TERRIFIC set-up to a story. We then see Clark deal with the issues a real Superman would have to deal with: how to live a life of normalcy but also secrecy; how to protect those he loves; how to deal with the US military and its obvious desire to either harness his power or control it; how to save as many people as he can save, knowing he can’t save everybody, etc. The artwork matches the storytelling’s quality, with muted colors and shadows that never mask the emotions seen in each face.

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to Superman; he is my absolute favorite character across all my nerd fandoms (MCU, DC, Star Wars, LotR, et al). In this work, two graphic novel legends – Alan Moore and illustrator Curt Swan – team up to share the story of Superman’s last day. The story begins with a journalist interviewing an older Lois Lane on the decade anniversary of the disappearance of Superman. Lois then relates a story involving Superman taking on a host of his most famous nemeses: Bizarro, Lex Luthor, Brainiac, and others. We see the strain on Superman as he strives to protect the friends he loves most (including both Lois and Lana). At the end of the striving, Superman is forced to make a choice that goes against his deepest core beliefs. The story felt a bit too linear for me, something I didn’t expect from Alan Moore. And as much as I like Swan’s stuff, the artwork looked very dated, though classic – think late 1970s/1980s.

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to Superman; he is my absolute favorite character across all my nerd fandoms (MCU, DC, Star Wars, LotR, et al). Kingdom is the acclaimed work from Waid and Ross that details a future where Superman and the Justice League abandoned their protection of the earth for a decade, after a superhero named Magog becomes popular with the people. Magog killed Joker in this storyline, and his willingness to kill for the sake of “justice” goes against the Justice League ethos, hence their dissolution as a league. In their absence, metahumans arise to battle villains, but their lack of any of the old guard rules/ethics results in wanton destruction and loss of life. In a battle against the villain Parasite, Captain Atom is killed – resulting in a catastrophic explosion that essentially wipes out the Midwest, killing millions. Superman reforms the Justice League (sans Batman) in response to this tragedy. As part of the League’s efforts to prevent future atrocities, they build a prison to house metahumans. The remainder of the plot is essentially the Justice League (primarily Superman) wrestling with how power ought to be used to combat evil; how we respect and protect human life; whether the ends justify the means when attempting to provide security; the fine line between tyranny and benevolent rule – just a host of terrific moral questions. Even better, these questions are framed in the ongoing tension between Superman and Batman and their differing views on power and its usage. Graphically, everything is drawn in a manner that tends towards realism. Everything looks great, but I had two issues with the art. First, there are some shots that involve a large number of villains and heroes on the same page, and in these scenes it is hard to distinguish who is who and what is going on. My second issue is that Ross re-imagines classic costumes for several of the main characters, and I don’t like their look at all (particularly Batman and Green Lantern). Overall, great storyline, but the graphics don’t quite do it for me....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Nov 2019,Nov 2019,"Dec 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/93335.Absolute_Kingdom_Come

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to Superman; he is my absolute favorite character across all my nerd fandoms (MCU, DC, Star Wars, LotR, et al). Despite my rampant Superman fandom, I am still able to objectively rank some Superman story arcs over others. But believe you me, Superman: For All Seasons is as good as comics get. This story arc plays out in four acts, each told from the narrative perspective of different people: Pa Kent, Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and Lana Lang. Spring (Pa) presents a graduating Clark coming to grips with the knowledge that, given his powers, the only way he can maximize the number of people he can positively impact is by moving away from Smallville to Metropolis. And the sadness that accompanies that decision is framed through both Pa’s and Clark’s eyes. I may have shed a tear or hundred in this act. The second act (summer via Lois) introduces us to Clark’s and Superman’s relationship with Lois. But it contrasts Lois’ fascination and growing affection for Superman with the loneliness that Superman feels in the big city. Despite being the most famous man in Metropolis, he might be the loneliest. I may have shed a tear or hundred in this act. Autumn is told through Lex’s eyes, and shows us Superman’s growing power and influence in the city, as well as his growing rivalry with Lex. And yet despite the growing power, Superman must wrestle with weakness, and come to grips with the knowledge that despite his power, he cannot save everyone. I may have shed a tear or hundred in this act. Winter (Lana) provides us with the full character of Superman: the tension between power and weakness, personal desire and responsibility, family vs the world, fear and conviction. I for sure shed many tears in this act. As good as the brilliant writing is the jaw-dropping artwork. Every frame looks like hand-painted watercolor, in a style reminiscent of The Adventures of Tintin, or illustrations from the Saturday Evening Post – beautifully classic. And many of the frames are worth staring at for long periods of time to study all of the details packed into each frame (especially in the Smallville scenes). The colors are generally muted in perfect contrast to the bright blues and reds of Superman. Most impressive in the artwork is the immense emotion in every face, especially Superman (ranging from wistful to sad to loving to heroic). I have read and love many of the graphic novels considered the greatest comics of all time (e.g. The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen, Uncanny X-Men, etc), and yet I would take Superman: For All Seasons over any of them. My favorite comic graphic novel of all time. It’s perfect. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Oct 2019,Oct 2019,"Oct 15, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21532172-superman-for-all-seasons

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to Superman; he is my absolute favorite character across all my nerd fandoms (MCU, DC, Star Wars, LotR, et al). One of the criticisms people level at Superman is that because he is nearly perfectly virtuous and powerful, there is no nuance in his character. These critics don’t know squat about Superman because all of his best storylines explore his struggle with identity, power, and justice. This story arc is really seven separate tales that collectively paint the picture of who Superman is. The first chapter is called “Dove” and shows a young Clark Kent trying to come to grips with his ability to fly (he can’t control it at first). The artwork is suitably adorable for a young Clark. The next chapter (“Hawk”) jumps forward to a high-school-aged Clark wrestling with how to use his developing power to deal with the evil in this world – is violence against the violent justified? A later chapter (“Eagle”) shows Clark in a home-made suit complete with goggles taking his first steps as a superhero vigilante. It also gives us his first antagonistic run-in with Lex Luthor. And what Superman tale would be complete without a heroic chapter wherein he risks his life to save the world (in this case, from Lobo)? Every chapter has a different art styling: several chapters are darker and more gritty visually; one chapter has a very Asian styling. But across the variety of chapters and artwork, there remains the consistency of character.

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to Superman; he is my absolute favorite character across all my nerd fandoms (MCU, DC, Star Wars, LotR, et al). All-Star Superman is widely-considered one of the greatest story arcs for Superman. After saving the crew on a manned flight to the sun, Superman’s cells are supercharged by the yellow sun radiation to such an extent that he is both as powerful as he has ever been but also dying. Knowing his time is nearing its end, Superman must continue to defend the earth (including from classic nemeses Lex Luthor and Bizarro) while at the same time fulfilling his own personal goals (spending time with Lois Lane, preserving his legacy). The storyline isn’t perfectly linear, with gaps between each chapter that made it a bit hard to gauge the timeline. In addition, there were subplots involving time travel and a cosmic underworld that I didn’t enjoy as much as the main storyline. But overall, I (surprise) enjoyed how this storyline juxtaposed a near omnipotent Superman with his own mortality. And like all of the best Superman story arcs do, this one helps us to see the humanity in Superman as his most important element. We get to see Superman angry, jealous (such a funny set of scenes with Superman, Samson, and Atlas), in love, wistful, and so much more. Graphically, there’s a real 1990’s, Rob Liefeld-esque quality to it – that isn’t a compliment in my mind.

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to Superman; he is my absolute favorite character across all my nerd fandoms (MCU, DC, Star Wars, LotR, et al). Though a fairly straightforward and self-contained storyline, Superman: Birthright fleshes out the character of Superman and Clark Kent so well, it feels fresh. The story starts with the familiar sending off of Kal El by his parents before jumping to a young journalist Clark Kent interviewing a West African political activist. We see the roots of his charge to defend people and freedom. When he returns home, we get glimpses of how his newfound charge to do good and protect others impacts his family. We see Clark’s first time in Metropolis, as well as a backstory into his complicated relationship with Lex Luthor. As Lex’s plan to defeat Superman unfolds, we get to see Superman’s heart and willingness to sacrifice self for humanity, even as earth sees him as an alien (in every sense of that word). Waid does a terrific job of crystallizing Superman’s wrestling with his own identity. Again, all these Superman tropes have been explored before, but Birthright does it so well, it makes me giggle with glee. There are so many small moments/scenes that stick out: a panel that shows Clark Kent flying low over an African plain filled with zebras, with this joyous fully-enjoying-life smile on his face; a scene where Superman first sees videos of his parents before Krypton explodes; the climactic scene where Superman decides to risk himself in order to ensure that the Kryptonian S is remembered for what it is. Artistically, there is a brightness to the colors, and a vibrancy in every panel. If I had to recommend one stand-alone story arc that captures the essence of Superman, this is the one I’d recommend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Oct 2019,Oct 2019,"Oct 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8172.Superman

And Superman: Red Son is my second favorite favorite Superman graphic novel. This story arc examines an alternate universe where Kal El doesn’t land in rural Kansas and grow up in Middle America. Instead, he lands in the Soviet Union and is raised believing in communism, and it raises so many interesting questions for the reader. How do we feel about Superman when he is separated from the Red, White & Blue and instead wears a hammer and sickle on his chest? If he is truly a superhero for the world and not just America, what does that look like; and how do we feel if he has to act against American interests in service of world peace? Can communism be successful when a moral, virtuous, and brilliant person like Superman is at the helm? Everything we know and feel about Superman is brilliantly subverted. Even more, we see how this reimagined Superman impacts his relationship and interactions with the people you expect him to interact with: Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Wonder Woman, and Batman. And as good as the narrative work is, the artwork matches the storyline perfectly, with primarily dark colors, but also a real emphasis on Superman/ communist red. A brilliant subversion of tropes that somehow manages to still capture the essence of what makes Superman Superman.

My laptop password is Star Wars-related. And I don’t hate the prequels like everyone else. All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to anything related to Star Wars. For this book in particular, I can’t be impartial because my first crush was on Leia/ Carrie Fisher. Bloodline takes place 28 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. Leia is now a senator in the New Republic. She is bored by the political obligations thrust upon her by her name and post-rebellion fame, but also understands the political capital she wields – especially as the New Republic has become bogged down by two-party squabbles between populist and centrist worlds. When a criminal cartel is discovered, Leia undertakes a mission with a centrist politician named Ransolm Casterfo, who has a seemingly unhealthy fascination with all things Empire. The mission discovers a more powerful criminal organization than originally anticipated, one with ties to a paramilitary organization hinting at something much darker (for SW fans, we see glimpses of the developing First Order). Gray perfectly captures all the things we love about Leia: her moxie, her courage, her doesn’t-take-crap attitude, and her internal desire to do everything she can to ensure galactic peace. Gray especially shines in the dialogue between Leia and Casterfo as they argue relevant political questions: are all authoritarian governments inherently evil; can politics ever solve deep issues when two sides have opposing frameworks; how do we wrestle with the tension of doing something where we might have impact even if we hate that very thing. This book has a perfect mix of fan service, honest wrestling with deep questions, action sequences, and character building.

His prose is a unique blend of poignancy and poetry. Most of his books focus on similar themes – growing up in poverty, alcoholism, abuse, racism, and Native American culture – but each book approaches these themes in different ways with different voices and in different situations. In this book, the main character is a 15-year-old boy named Zits. Zits has spent much of his life bouncing around between foster homes. He runs away from his most recent home, but gets caught by the police. He meets another young kid in jail that over time convinces Zits that violence is the answer. Zits eventually makes his way to a bank and shoots a bunch of people before he himself is shot. But rather than die, Zit is transported back in time to several different instances of violence against Native Americans (e.g. Red River in 1874, Little Bighorn) where he inhabits the bodies of different people as they participate in these atrocities. He experiences and witnesses violence being done both against and by Native Americans. Essentially, the entire book is a thought experiment about the nature of violence; what justifications we make for it; the arbitrary ethics around it. Moreover, Alexie describes many violent acts in detail, as if to shock the reader with the grotesque brutality of violence and murder. Alexie has never been known for subtlety – and he’s not trying to be subtle; in Flight, he makes it clear that nothing justifies violence against other human beings, and that killing is always a human failing. And yet despite the heaviness of the topic, there are several moments of hope in the book that reflect Alexie’s belief that human beings can make distinct and good choices amidst chaos.

Suffice to say, I love Shakespeare. And I love Ian Doescher’s writings that combine Shakespearean prose with pop culture. Doescher’s eight Star Wars Shakespeare books are among my favorite books of all time. This book imagines Dickens’ Christmas classic as a Shakespearean play told in iambic pentameter, complete with acts, scenes, asides, and so forth. Many of the lines of dialogue are reinvented lines from the book told in old English. But more than Doescher’s ability to craft technically-perfect Shakespearean prose, what makes his books so good is his ability to cleverly match pop culture character to Shakespearean character. Here, for example, Doescher makes the Ghost of Christmas present Falstaff, and the Ghost of Christmas Future the ghost of Hamlet’s dad – so good. In another example, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern make a cameo as the two men who ask Scrooge for money for their charity at the beginning of the story. Then at the end, when the newly-reformed Scrooge gives them money, Scrooge notes to them “Lose not your heads o’er this, but do accept as I freely give.” For Shakespeare buffs and for people who like to feel clever and smart because they are in on the joke, there is nothing better than Doescher’s works.

This book gets to the heart of why such books are read by so many in church leadership: because of a desire to find a silver bullet to solve dysfunctions and to propel the church to health and growth. Essentially, Im says such thinking is wrong and that all searches for a silver bullet will be ultimately fruitless. Instead, he recommends not a new approach to ministry, but rather a set of small shifts in thinking and perspective that can be applied to any church with any ministry approach, and that will still lead to the large-scale impact that church leaders desire. An example of such a shift: instead of focusing on spiritual maturity by focusing on the end result, one ought to focus on the direction and journey towards spiritual maturity instead. Another example: instead of focusing on end metrics (outputs), focus on what is being poured into people (inputs). Im’s recommendations aren’t earth-shattering – and they aren’t meant to be – but they are clearly articulated ways to re-think how to do ministry. Throughout, his prose is very readable and very practical, with lots of charts and tactical advice.

And yet, when “real” writers attempt sci-fi in order to validate the genre, what does that say? And what they write, is it truly sci-fi? More broadly, what defines the genre? Who determines what is or is not science fiction? Great questions, to be sure; and I’m not sure this anthology helps answer that question. Authors such as Robert Olen Butler, Junot Diaz, Jonathan Lethem, George Saunders, and W.P. Kinsella craft stories that utilize sci-fi tropes. For example, Butler writes about an alien abduction, and Diaz writes about a zombie plague/monster. And yet, more often than not, the stories to me feel more like non-genre stories with sci-fi details. That is, in some of these stories, the sci-fi details and universe aren’t the focus of the story, nor are they critical to the story. Now this may say more about how narrowly I might be defining the genre, but if you can remove the sci-fi details, and the story functions the same, I don’t think it’s science fiction. At the same time, the breathtaking prose of these writers – many of these stories are worth reading simply for their craft, genre be damned. My favorite stories in this anthology were: “Beautiful Monsters” by Eric Pucner, “LIMBs” by Julia Elliott, “Escape from Spiderhead” by George Saunders, and “Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover” by Butler.

Now, given The Iron Giant is one of my favorite movies, and The Road is one of my favorite books, this is high praise. Borne doesn’t quite get to the level of excellence of either, but the fact that it resembles both is a terrific thing. The book takes place in a broken-down city in some apocalyptic future, which includes a gigantic flying bear that terrorizes the city. One day, our protagonist – a scavenger named Rachel – climbs on this giant bear and comes upon a pod-like organism that she names Borne. Under her care, Borne grows in size and intelligence. It is the scenes where Rachel is teaching Borne language and the things of the world that reminded me of The Iron Giant, especially Borne’s curiosity and kind nature. Borne’s curiosity, however, grows in a him a desire to be out in the dangers of the world, and Rachel must find ways to both protect Borne and herself (reminiscent of The Road). Borne’s life also adds complications to Rachel’s relationship with another scavenger named Wick. This relationship triangle between Rachel, Borne, and Wick is essentially the heart of this story. But it is also my single critique. Vandermeer doesn’t set out to tell a traditional sci-fi tale. He doesn’t share details about this world; the cause of the apocalypse is unimportant. There is no grand plan by Rachel or Wick to escape to a different city or to kill the giant bear. The plot is simply about Rachel trying to survive both the dangers of the world and her relationships with Wick and Borne. This lack of a linear plot is both terrifically unique, but also keeps it from being five stars in my book. It’s a great read, that just falls short of greatness. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Aug 2019,Aug 2019,"Aug 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31451186-borne

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to anything related to Star Wars. Treason is the third of the recent Zahn books focused on the now in-canon character of Thrawn, an admiral in the Imperial army with an unparalleled, Sherlockian brilliance when it comes to military strategy. The events of this book tie into Rogue One: Director Krennic is building a secret new weapon for the Empire and is competing for Imperial funding for his secret project. When his supply lines get disrupted by alien creatures, threatening his ability to complete the weapon on schedule, Krennic is forced to work with Thrawn who is competing for Imperial resources as well. Thrawn is tasked with solving the supply line disruption while at the same time trying to gather more information about a mysterious race of aliens called the Gryssk that are threatening his race (the Chiss). The first two books of the new trilogy covered long periods of time, but this book is focused on the few days it takes for Thrawn to handle the issue. The smaller scope and action-oriented plot made the pages fly by. Every fan will read this book in a single sitting, it is that engrossing. And while we fully see Thrawn’s tactical battle brilliance on display, we also see his political brilliance and leadership brilliance as well.

That is, I can’t enjoy a book just for its story; its prose and construction also have to be high-quality for me to enjoy a book. And there were several red flags staring me in my face when I purchased this book. There’s the fact that Martin has written twelve books, releasing one almost every year. Generally writers that prolific are prolific because they are churning out garbage. And then there’s the “USA Today Bestseller” sticker on the front cover. Sorry, masses, but your judgment about books is terrible (hence the reason Twilight and 50 Shades were bestsellers). So it’s not a surprise that this book is one of the worst books I have ever read. Cooper O’Connor is a musician from Colorado who grew up in the loving care of his father, an open-air preacher. Cooper rebels against his loving father and strikes out on his own to make it as a musician in Nashville. He ends up meeting and falling in love with a musician named Daley before the book’s villain drives them apart. The story picks up years later when Cooper meets up with Daley again, with flashbacks filling in their history. Where do I begin in describing how poorly-written this was? We’ll start with the plot: it’s completely predictable. There was not a single event that occurred in this book that was remotely surprising. There’s a big reveal at the end about a man who rescued Cooper from a fire that could not have been more obvious. This plot was like one of those Hallmark-sponsored movies that appear on LifeTime. Secondly, the characterization of every character is pedestrian, without any nuance whatsoever. Every protagonist is perfect and good-looking and virtuous. Cooper is handsome and is apparently one of the greatest musicians who ever lived. He even volunteers in an old folks home, for crying out loud. Also, he’s secretly rich and loves giving away money. Meanwhile, his love interest is stunningly beautiful, and winsome, with a voice that is apparently one of the greatest voices of all time, and gosh-darn it, she never stopped loving Coop. Cooper’s dad is obviously the father figure everyone wants: forgiving, loving, etc. [Yes, I get that Martin was modeling this story after the Parable of the Prodigal Son, so of course the father is perfect. But that doesn’t explain the other idealized characters.] Meanwhile, the villain is of course slick and deceitful and malicious. He does everything evil, stopping just short of clubbing a baby seal. Good books create characters with depth and nuance. Thirdly, this prose is atrocious. I will often read a book with incredible prose and will read sentences or paragraphs out loud to my wife so she can appreciate the brilliance with me. This is the first book in a long while where I read whole passages out loud because of how laughably bad the prose is. It’s filled with clichés. The dialogue doesn’t sound natural, especially where characters are trying to be profound. The prose was especially bad in scenes where Daley and Cooper were singing together. Martin would list a dozen song titles, as if showing off his knowledge of cool songs that everybody loves. He did this in another scene that was describing a hymn sing. In these scenes, the detailed set list is unnecessary; it’s as if Martin is trying to appeal to his audience so that they read along and say, “I love that song/hymn, too!” Later, a character is stated to have died from a broken heart! Guys, this book! Lastly, the word “saccharine” was made for dreck like this. Good books wring out emotions from the reader organically, without contrived scenes. This book was one contrivance after another. For example, Cooper’s father wrote Cooper two letters. And Martin fully shares both letters to the reader expressing how much the father loved Cooper and was waiting with open arms for his return. These scenes of Cooper reading these emotional letters after his father’s death – come on, man; have you ever heard of subtlety, Charles? In another scene, Cooper is a server at a Nashville restaurant and he sees an old man come in every week and order two meals; but he only ever eats one and throws the other meal out. Cooper finds out that one meal was for the old man, and one was for his deceased wife. So Cooper cheers him up with a song. Ugh. These scenes are Hallmark cards come to life.

Now imagine tapping into that conceit by adding a creative story on top of a smart concept and disguising it as good fiction — that’s this book. Now, this might sound like a criticism; it’s not meant to be. I admire the audacity of it all. I mean, the book combines the Fermi paradox with Kant’s conception of the thing-in-itself with an XFiles storyline. Aliens, metaphysics, and sci-fi — what’s not to like? Two men (Charles and Roy) are living together in an Antarctic science base deciphering radio signals in order to detect alien life. One of them (Roy) believes Kant’s conception of ding an sich solves the Fermi paradox. That leads to him almost killing Charles. The book then jumps forward in time. Charles leads a sad sack life, unable to move beyond his Antarctic trauma. A mysterious group called the Institute asks for his help in communicating with Roy who they believe is the key to breaking free of the constraints of human consciousness and perception, and solving mankind’s problems. Roberts structures the book in layers, with chapters that alternate between moving forward with the plot between Roy, Charles, and the Institute; and revealing seemingly disconnected chapters that jump backwards and forwards in time to random characters. And while there are many discussions of philosophy, metaphysics, and science, Roberts is able to write them well enough to be comprehended without being too reductive. My three critiques that keep this book from five star status. First, there are places that the book is too exposition-heavy, especially in the closing chapters. Where earlier philosophical debates felt somewhat organic, towards the end, these discussions feel forced. Even more, some of these discussions come off like two high college students arguing. (“Dude, what if...what if what keeps us from seeing things in reality is reality itself?” “Dude, whoa!”) Secondly, the book is exceedingly clever — but almost to the point it feels showy; as if the author is saying “See what I did there? Clever, aren’t I?” Lastly, at the end of the day, while I enjoyed the book, I can’t tell if I actually enjoyed the book as a story, or if I enjoyed it more as a thought experiment. I still don’t know.

And when we then associate our personalized conception of what love is to how God loves us in the framework of Christianity, well, no wonder we end up with theological problems and an improper view of God. In this book, Sproul attempts to define what biblical love actually is; and by doing so, attempts to explain how it then resolves such thorny questions as “How can a loving God condemn people to hell?” Sproul covers what the Bible means by stating “God is love”, the different facets of God’s love, and how love existed within the Trinity and what that means for our faith. He even exposits 1 Corinthians 13, and what it actually says about love. This book is typical Sproul, so you know what you’re getting: something well-reasoned, logically sound, and biblically-based.

Eric and Laura Campbell are the parents of two boys: Griff and Justin. Justin is kidnapped at the age of 11, but is found and returned to his family four years later. The book spends little time exploring what happened during those four years, although we get glimpses of the horrors Justin endured. Rather, Johnson explores the emotional impact Justin’s absence and presence have on this family. For example, Eric had entered into an affair because of the brokenness in his family – what does that relationship look like once the family has been restored? Laura had completely withdrawn from the world to cope – how does she handle not only the joy of his return, but also the sorrow of finding out the little ways her young boy (now an older teen) has changed? Johnson plumbs the depths of the entire range of emotions in each character by organically advancing the plot. For example, midway through the book, the alleged kidnapper is set free on bail, and suddenly the joy of Justin’s return is crushed by the new fear that his abductor is loose – just tremendous plot construction.

In The Escape Artists, Bascomb describes the real-life escape of British POWs during WWI.

I found it fascinating how comparatively civilized POW camps were during WWI, especially when comparing the mistreatment of prisoners seen in later wars (I recalled Louie Zamperini’s mistreatment in Unbroken, for example). As one normally finds in detailed nonfiction accounts, there are a few areas where the narrative digresses a bit into too much minutiae.

The prose does a terrific job of conveying a wide range of emotions: anger, desire, sorrow, confusion, angst. Even more, although the prose is entirely first-person, we get a clear understanding of the unique personalities of the other people in Xiomara’s life (particularly her mother and brother). It’s one of those books that once you start reading, you’ll be hard-pressed not to finish it in a sitting.

This book argues that approach ought to be applied to churches; and that churches need to be actively planning the succession of their senior pastors. The book provides a number of examples of pastoral transitions that have gone smoothly, and examples of some that did not. The book also walks through all of the things that are required for pastoral succession to go well (support of outgoing pastor, early and thoughtful planning, managing communication, etc), as well as things to avoid (nepotism, incomplete transfer of power, not involving departing pastor). Overall, the book makes a compelling case for churches to be taking succession planning seriously. But I also felt that the case could have been made in a lengthy article rather than a full-blown book. In addition, because the author runs a firm that works with churches on succession planning, every time the author noted a case study where the Vanderbloemen Group was hired to make the process successful, I rolled my eyes.

Some people like page-turning thrillers regardless of prose. I’m not that kind of reader. I like a good, engaging story, but it must also be told well. That’s the context for my rating for this book. Jason Dessen is a brilliant scientist currently teaching physics at a small college in Chicago. Instead of singlemindedly pursuing a science career, he chose to marry his wife Daniela and raise their son Charlie. But in an alternate universe, Jason does pursue science singlemindedly. And in that universe, singleminded Jason has created the ability to travel across alternate universes. So singleminded Jason travels to the universe of married college professor Jason, kidnaps that Jason, and sends him back into the alternate universe. Now college professor Jason must unravel the mystery of what happened to him, and the mystery of the multiverse, in order to find his way back to his home universe. It’s a terrific plot construction that raises a lot of interesting questions: How do we define a “successful” life – the low-key, happily married life or the prize-winning career? Are we more than the sum parts of the choices we’ve made? What defines our identity? My problems with this book are several. First, I like my books to have subtlety. I can ponder the big themes and questions a plot raises without having the main characters actually dialogue about them. Having college professor Jason argue with singleminded Jason about their lives and choices irritated me. Second, I felt like half of this plot was simply Jason running away from people, as if the writer was writing a book that could easily be turned into an action thriller movie. This book was some combination of John Grisham crossed with Isaac Asimov; that is NOT a compliment in my book. Thirdly, Jason makes terrible choices on a number of occasions; in fact, the plot only advances because of his stupid decisions. That kind of plot construction irritates me in movies, and it irritates me in books. Interesting story, but it’s bogged down by Grisham/Patterson/Koontz type prose.

Gawande is a doctor whose observations about medicine — its triumphs and problems — are always thoughtful and interesting. In this book, Gawande confronts the biggest issue facing every human being: our certain mortality. Moreover, he recognizes that current medical practices do not handle mortality well; that it’s focus has long been on solving problems and prolonging life vs working with a patient to determine what life really means and what it ought to look like as it approaches its end. The first half of the book focuses on the elderly. Gawande talks about nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and the terrible choices families are often forced to make to care for people when they have reached a stage of life where they cannot are for themselves. Gawande discusses the tension between safety and care, and personal independence and will to live. He describes the worst situations, but also provides examples of where elder care is being done well. The second half of the book shifts the same discussion about mortality from the elderly to the terminally ill. Here the tension is between prolonging life with the risk of a lower quality of life, against a shorter duration but with more fulfillment. Gawande contrasts the frames used by hospice workers and palliative care experts with those of typical doctors. Throughout both halves of the book, Gawande urges both individuals and the medical profession to think seriously about our responsibility to ensure that those we love finish their lives the way they want to. In his other books, Gawande is thoughtfully clinical. In this one, he is not only that, but also emotionally poignant — especially as he shares his personal experience with his father’s last years. I legitimately believe everyone should read this book to prepare themselves and their loved ones with the hard conversations that eventually have to be had.

I fall more in the former category than the latter. This book is somewhat of a memoir, but it states in the title that it isn’t one. And that is made abundantly clear as the “plot” unfolds. The narrative switches back and forth between past events from Norm’s life (growing up in rural Canada, learning to do standup, working on SNL, filming his movie Dirty Work, etc.) and the present-day where Norm and his friend Adam Eget are gambling away everything Norm has. Through both narratives, it’s hard to discern what is truth from what is fiction given Norm’s penchant for surreal comedy and non-sequiturs. For example, Norm shares that he was in love with Sarah Silverman when they worked together on SNL. That seems true. Did he also stalk her obsessively and get maced by her? I mean, maybe? But overall, while I enjoy Norm’s comedy in short bursts, it turns out that over the length of a book, his style of rambling storytelling wears thin. Part of the humor of his rambling jokes is that they go nowhere and end somewhere unexpected. But in book form, it gets tedious. In addition, when I read memoirs, I expect to learn something deep about the person; but given the thin line between truth and lie in this book, it’s impossible to get that.

For example, to discuss Chinese economic development over the last decade, Hessler introduces us to his friend Polat, a man who trades currency and sells bootleg merchandise. We also meet several of Hessler’s former English students who are trying to make a living in cities with rapid economic growth. In another chapter, Hessler examines the history of Chinese dissidents by spending time in Tiananmen Square on the anniversary of the 1989 protests. This documentary-style approach works well and provides a much richer and deeper connection to the history because he’s using the lives of real people as the lens.

And Zahn’s Thrawn book from last year was one of my top reads of 2018. So when I found out that Zahn was writing a book with both Thrawn AND Vader in it? Well, take my money. But it pains me to say I was a little disappointed by this book. In Thrawn: Alliances, the Emperor sends his top two lieutenants to investigate a disturbance in the force on some planet in the outer rim. When they arrive, it is immediately clear that: (a) both Thrawn and Vader have a history on this planet; and (b) more interestingly, they seem to have a history with each other there. They uncover a smuggling ring being run by an alien race that is potentially a serious threat to the Empire. At the same time, it calls to their minds events from their previous engagement there. The narrative jumps backwards and forwards in time between the first meeting between Thrawn and (then) Anakin and the present-day conflict. This structure provides a unique way to view both characters’ internal motivations and the tension in their relationship. My first issue with this book is that I didn’t quite enjoy the events from the past, especially as it related to the Anakin/Padme dynamic and relationship. Listen, I’m a bit of a Star Wars prequels apologist and I don’t have anywhere near the level of disgust many folks have with them. At the same time, the Hayden Christiansen/Natalie Portman chemistry was so bad in the prequels that as I read Thrawn: Alliance, I could only imagine those two in the book scenes, and the experience was not a positive one. Is that the book’s fault? Not really, although the dialogue did not help to overcome that bias, so it’s partly the book’s fault. My second issue is that the book tries too hard to provide Vader with internal tension and motivation. In the movies, Vader isn’t conflicted until he meets up with Luke. Before then, he is fairly single-minded and terrifying. But the book replaces that single-mindedness with internal angst, making Vader seem indecisive and wishy-washy. My third issue was that the book had to balance both Vader and Thrawn plot presence. But splitting the plot between them and Padme means neither Thrawn or Vader get the chance to fully shine. It was too ambitious to put them together into one story. To be clear, there are still many great scenes, and the Star Wars fan in me still enjoyed a great deal of this book. But it just fell short of the recent top-notch content quality that I have been spoiled with. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2019,Jan 2019,"Jan 15, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36398855-thrawn

All that to say, I am not remotely objective when it comes to anything related to Star Wars. This book is a collection of short stories and slices of life told from the imagined vantage points of extraneous characters – all of whom give us a different flavor of Episode IV: A New Hope (ANH). For example, the first story is told from the viewpoint of Captain Raymus Antilles, the rebel who gets force-choked by Vader in the opening scene of ANH. Another story is told from the viewpoint of the stormtrooper who captured Leia. We also see the perspectives of a Jawa, several droids, various clientele at the Mos Eisley cantina, Leia’s mom, and so on. We even get the perspectives of more important characters like Yoda, Qui-gon, and Obi-wan. And these stories do more than simply re-tell ANH from their eyes. No, the events of the movies aren’t the focus; the individual lives of these characters are the focus, and their intersection with the events of ANH are simply the thread that ties these unique lives together. The Star Wars stories have primarily followed the Skywalker storyline, but this book makes it clear that all of the other non-Skywalker inhabitants of this vast Star Wars universe have their own lives, emotions, motivations, struggles, and redemption arcs. For example, there is a story that gives us a glimpse of the wanderlust inside the heart of a Jawa. There is another story about friendship and belonging between low-level thieves. These stories aren’t about Star Wars; these stories are about very human experiences. There are a handful of stories that fall flat for me, but the vast majority of them are well-crafted and well-written. Star Wars theme aside, I thought it was a terrific collection of short stories.

The story centers around Evan Hansen, a high school senior who struggles with anxiety and depression. As part of his therapy, he is asked to write letters to himself for encouragement and inspiration (hence the title). On the first day of school of his senior year, Evan has a few interactions with a troubled classmate named Connor Murphy. After the last interaction, Connor finds and takes one of Evan’s therapy letters. That same day, Connor takes his own life, and his family finds the letter addressed “Dear Evan Hansen” with him. His family ends up talking to Evan, and through a mixture of Evan’s own personal issues, his desire to help the Murphy family rather than hurt them, and his crush on Connor’s sister Zoe, Evan pretends to have a closer relationship with Connor than actually existed. The plot unfolds from there, with Evan wrestling with the enormous weight of the lies he has told, and the growing benefits from those lies. The book is filled with these cringeworthy, can’t-believe-this-is-happening scenes that grip you in the way the best scenes from The Office gripped you. The book is told in first-person narrative, and it is a testament to the prose that we can deeply feel the angst and emotion in each of these scenes as the events of Evan’s life spiral out of his control. In addition – as someone who deals with anxiety and depression can attest – Emmich writes Evan’s voice incredibly realistically. His usage of drowning as an analogy of anxiety and depression deeply resonated with me. If I have any critique (and it’s a small one), it’s that the play almost packs too many issues into its core: anxiety, depression, suicide, high school love, family dysfunction, daddy issues, etc. I mean, throw in enough common issues, and you are sure to produce some emotional resonance. At the same time, the story balances all of these issues well; none of these issues feel tacked on. A terrific, hard-to-put-down, and hard-to-read story.

Finally forced to confront her diminished estate, Frances makes plans to liquidate all they have, and head to Paris with her middle-aged son Malcolm, where she also intends to end her life as her money runs out – hence, the book’s title: a play on words of both an escape to France, as well as the concept of leaving a social gathering without proper farewells. Like other DeWitt novels, the seemingly simple plotline gets more complicated as a cast of zany characters and subplots (including a gypsy fortuneteller and a cat that houses the soul of Frances’ deceased husband) are thrown into the mix. DeWitt’s trademark dialogue shines throughout; there may never be a book that is more deserving of the adjectives “arch” and “wry” than this one. And DeWitt certainly captures and critiques the upper crust attitudes of the wealthy. But for me, there is also something missing from this book that his previous two books had: connection and care for the main characters. I cared about Eli and Charlie Sisters; I cared about Lucy Minor; but while I enjoyed Frances and Malcolm, I didn’t care about them in the same way. I think Frances’ emotional distance throughout the book created an emotional distance to me as well. Still a very solid read, and fans of DeWitt will still enjoy this; but it just missed the high expectations I have for DeWitt....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jan 2019,Jan 2019,"Dec 30, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36628516-french-exit

Watermark has grown into a megachurch, primarily for its ability to deeply disciple its members and showcase life transformation (disclaimer: my church licenses its marriage ministry). The church takes Christian community seriously, and in this book, Wagner presents what he believes Christian community ought to look like, and the impact that such a church would have on the surrounding culture. Throughout, Wagner discusses how his beliefs in Christian community plays out at Watermark. This involves things like the language (e.g. there is no such thing as the term “regular attender” that is so commonly used by churches), how often believers fellowship and live life alongside each other (pretty much continuously), Christian accountability, membership vows (at Watermark, members must recommit every year), Christian service, and so on. Basically, members of a church community need to be all in, and when they are, amazing things will happen. As a church leader, I found the exhortation convicting, the examples helpful, and the testimony inspiring. I don’t agree with everything Watermark does as it lives out its belief, but do believe the points raised by Wagner ought to be debated and considered by church leaders everywhere. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Mar 2019,Apr 2019,"Dec 30, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36267806-come-and-see

Denning poses the question: Sherlock’s deductive and mystery-solving abilities are nearly supernatural – what if they were actually supernatural? In this universe, Warlock Holmes is a detective called upon by Scotland Yard to solve mysteries of a more arcane nature. He has no deductive skills whatsoever, but because of his connection to the supernatural dimension, he is able to know things, defeat sorcerers and demons, and solve crimes. Like other Sherlock works, John Watson plays an integral part and it is through his first-person lens that the stories are recounted. And as a parody, this book has many clever and funny winks and nods to the Sherlock universe (e.g. Lestrade is a vampire).

And yet, most folks don’t know anything about his life, career or personal views outside of him being a beloved children’s book author. In this book, Minear collects editorial cartoons created by Dr. Seuss when he drew for the left-wing NY daily PM from 1941-1943. At the time, the world was bracing itself for war, and we see Dr. Seuss’s editorial wit and perspective on WWII issues: US isolationism, Us anti-semitism and racism, Hitler, Russia’s involvement, Mussolini, etc. Minear does more than present the cartoons, however; he lays out the historical context for each and explains them. He does a great job of tying common threads across these disparate cartoons. We get to see the kind of sharp, caustic wit and insight found in the best editorial cartoons. And all of that is done through the familiar Seuss art styling. The unfortunate part of the book was seeing the racist caricatures of Japanese people in many of Seuss’s works (i.e. buck teeth, slanted eyes, etc.). Also, a critique of the Kindle edition: the cartoons followed the commentary; it would have been far more effective for each cartoon to be embedded within the commentary.

In this book, Greear lays out the core aspects of Christianity (a sovereign holy God, His indescribable love for His people) and what that means for how His followers ought to live. More than that, He rightly explains the core flaw in people’s theology that causes them doubt or lack of passion: they believe in a God that is too small. That is, we idolize ourselves and create God in our own image; no wonder that God fails us. But if we accept God for who He says He is and that His power, authority, and wisdom are beyond our ability to comprehend; well, worship of that kind of God is fulfilling, meaningful, and powerful.

For me, I need a book not only to tell a good story, but also to tell it with decent prose. Weir’s writing surprised me in The Martian; I thought it was terrific and my respect for his writing was set at a high level. Well, Artemis knocks that esteem down. Artemis is the name of a colony on the moon set in some future. The protagonist is Jazz, a young woman who lives and works in Artemis as both a porter and a small-time smuggler. Jazz longs for the day when she makes enough money (called “slugs” in Artemis) that she can live comfortably in a nicer place than the tube in which she currently resides. One of Jazz’s regulars for whom she smuggles (Trond Landvik) offers her a way (illegally) to make a million slugs. Jazz takes him up on the offer, but when the mission goes awry, all hell breaks loose. Jazz finds herself trying to survive, rectify the situation, and save Artemis. Like The Martian, Artemis is a page-turner; you’ll finish this in a sitting. Unfortunately, as I noted earlier, that’s not enough for me when the prose fails. First, in The Martian, the science and the explanations of that science felt integral to the plot and story-telling. In Artemis, there were several times I felt the characters were expositing the science to each other in a way that felt forced. We get it Andy, you REALLY love science. Secondly, the plot is fairly predictable: good-hearted small-time crook; mission goes sideways; crook finds himself in over his head; manages to save the day in the end – pretty cliché storyline; the only uniqueness is the moon colony setting. But my biggest issue is in Jazz’s characterization. The Martian’s Mark Watney is a smart, sarcastic wiseass with a penchant for casual swearing and some sophomoric humor. Artemis’ Jazz? A smart, sarcastic wiseass with a penchant for casual swearing and some sophomoric humor (I mean, the running gag throughout the book is Jazz’s perceived promiscuity – terrible). Can Weir not write characters that sound and act differently? The mark of a good writer is the ability to do so. If you don’t hold as high a standard as I do on technical skill, this might be for you. Otherwise, it’s a shallow page-turner....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Oct 2018,Oct 2018,"Oct 05, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35097545-artemis

And throughout church history, Christianity and the church has thrived the most during times of persecution and suffering (Rome, China, Eastern Europe, et al). In Silence, Endo crafts a narrative to meditate on this idea of suffering and faith. Two Jesuit priests (Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe) head to Japan to investigate claims that Rodrigues’ mentor Father Ferreira had abandoned his faith. At the time (the book takes place in the 1600s), Japan was persecuting Christians and Christian missionaries. And in one local village, local authorities were forcing suspected believers to step on a carved image of Christ – in an eastern mindset and context, death was a better choice than defilement or dishonor of Christ. Believers who refused to dishonor God were tortured and slowly bled to death. When both priests come upon this village, they are captured. But rather than torture the two priests, the authorities torture other believers in front of them. All that can stop if they renounce their faith. It’s a wonderful set-up: do you renounce your faith to save others who are not renouncing their faith? Or do you allow others to be martyred for their faith in the same way you would? How do suffering and faith intersect? The pacing of the book is a bit slow, which might be a Japanese style difference (prose and pacing reminded me of the one Haruki Murakami book I read).

But that places a high bar on winners; I read with a certain expectation in quality of prose and quality of story. For me, Less (the 2018 winner) falls just below my expectation. Arthur Less is a mediocre author (he’s published a couple of not-popular books) who recently found out that his former lover is getting married. To escape having to go to his ex’s wedding, Arthur accepts a series of invitations he ordinarily would never have accepted: participation in a panel at a conference in Mexico, attending a little-heard of gathering in Italy where his book is being honored, teaching a literature class in Germany for several weeks, and so on. His travels take him all over the world, but each location brings to mind memories of his two long-lasting prior relationships (including the one whose wedding he’s escaping). Turns out, it’s impossible to escape our relationships because they are not made of events (like a wedding) that are one-and-done, but rather our relationships consist of shared experiences that become memories we carry forever. The plot construction allows for Lee to share memories organically in each place, and the prose is terrific – alternately funny (tragicomically so in many cases) and poignant. While it's a solid story, however, it didn't leave me pondering deep themes long after I finished it like many other winners have. And to be clear, me saying it fell short of my very high bar is not to say this is not a very good book (it very much is); it simply didn’t connect with me in the way that other winners have (the four I mentioned above, for example, were my top reads for the year in the year I read them).

But more than a biography, Eswine explores Spurgeon’s struggle with the twin goals of: (a) explaining how people can better comfort and minister to those suffering from depression; and (b) offering hope to those that suffer. For example, he repeatedly discusses why telling a Christian suffering from depression to “have more faith” or “get over it” isn’t remotely helpful. At the same time, he comforts the sufferer by highlighting the words of Spurgeon and Biblical heroes (like David or Job) in their affliction. Throughout, Eswine draws both from Spurgeon’s writings and from Scripture to illustrate and support his thoughts.

Pastors routinely throw around the world without explicitly explaining its meaning or its implications. In this book, Greear explains what the gospel is (“that Jesus is Lord and that He has won the battle for your salvation” – in other words, the gospel is about the person and work of Christ); and more importantly, he explains what impact a firm grasp of the gospel has on one’s life. The book uses a “Gospel prayer” to frame much of this discussion. This prayer is something Greear recites first thing every morning to center himself on the gospel, and consists of statements focusing on the different aspects of the gospel. So the book expands on each part of this gospel prayer and relates it to all the parts of our lives that ought to be impacted by gospel living – our marriages, our relationships, our giving, our use of time, et al. Greear does an especially great job of explaining how churches teach behavior changes absent the gospel and why that doesn’t work; and then explains why a gospel frame does work and what that looks like. As a whole, this book is one of the best resources for understanding the gospel. The prose is very readable, with a balance of Bible stories and passages, present-day anecdotes, and Greear’s personal life stories.

The story takes place during the evacuation of East Prussia in 1944. Prussians were caught in the crossfire between the Nazi and Russian armies, and the story follows these four characters’ intersecting journeys of survival. The narrative is told in alternating chapters from each of these characters’ perspectives. This construct allows us to see the same situations from different viewpoints. Each chapter is only a page or two long, making this a quick, engaging read. Because this book is historical fiction set in WWII and told through short chapters from different perspectives, it is hard not to make a comparison to Doerr’s excellent All the Light We Cannot See — but the quality difference between the two books is clear (the difference in quality is largely due to the fact that Salt to the Sea is a YA book). Salt to the Sea is a bit more clumsily written, with parts reading a bit like exposition rather than an actual character’s thoughts (e.g. the parts that talked about the Amber Room or the port evacuation). And secondly, where Doerr’s book had no weak character narratives, in this book, I found the early parts of Alfred’s narrative and the later parts of Florian’s narrative a bit lacking.

In this book, the main character is Alvie Brechenmacher, the titular plastic magician (in this world, magicians are bonded to one type of material). Alvie leaves the US to travel to London to apprentice under Magician Marion Praff (readers of the first three books will recognize the name). Alvie and Praff work together to develop a new use for magical plastic that they can showcase at a conference: working prosthetics. However, a rival magician to Praff seems to be behind a series of events trying to prevent them from the showcase. There’s also a secondary plot line of Alvie and a romantic interest (another name fans of the other books will recognize). Overall, this was the worst of the four books in this universe for me. First, the plot is fairly linear with no surprises in store for the reader; everything is so telegraphed as to be insulting. It is clear who the bad guy is from the start, and the book never gives you doubts otherwise. Second, even though the plot is linear, it takes forever to get where it’s going. At points, it’s as if the romantic plot line is used for filler. Third, the characters aren’t anywhere nearly developed as characters from the other three books. The protagonists in The Paper Magician (Ceony and Emery) had personality and layers of backstory. In this book, the characters are given random personality details that are meant to round out the characters but actually only serve to illustrate how shallow these characters really were. For example, we learn in the first few pages that Alvie is good with math and numbers — and then that detail is never used as a key part of the story. Lastly, one of the things I liked about the universe Holmberg has created is the unique magic spells unique to each material. The paper spells in the first two books were imaginative. In this book, plastic magic is a key element of creating a prosthetic, but beyond that, the use of plastic spells doesn’t permeate the story. Why even bother setting this story in a materials-magic universe if you don’t take advantage of the magic? This is a pass for me....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Aug 2018,Aug 2018,"Aug 02, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35697528-the-plastic-magician

I really enjoyed the first two books (The Paper Magician and The Glass Magician); both books were engaging reads set in a unique universe with solid characters. I particularly enjoyed how this trilogy handles magic – the bonding of magician to material, and the creative spells attached to each unique material. In this book, protagonist Ceony Twill prepares to end her apprencticeship with magician Emery Thane (who also happens to be her love interest) and to take the test that will allow her to become a full-fledged paper magician. To prevent accusations of bias because of her relationship with Thane, Twill must take that test with another magician – one who happens to despise Thane. At the same time, Twill receives news that one of the villains from the last book escaped from prison. To protect herself and those she loves, Twill seeks to locate the escaped villain and either re-imprison or kill him. Overall, I think this is the worst book of the trilogy primarily because of one issue – in my  of The Glass Magician, I wrote “My only critique: in both this book and its predecessor, the action is initiated by Ceony's impetuosity; she repeatedly takes risks that place her in unsafe situations. I am hoping that in the third book, the plot can be advanced without her foolhardiness.” Unfortunately, Twill continues her recklessness and chases after a dangerous villain on her own, risking her life for no good reason other than to advance the plot and to provide plot tension. Her impetuosity was entertaining in the first book, a bit irksome in the second, but downright irritating and infuriating in the third. It shows no character growth – especially when in the last book, Twill’s foolhardy choices cost her friend her very life. You want to root for your protagonist, not pray for him/her to die and receive his/her deserved death. In addition to this big issue, I found the book ends rather abruptly (although Twill/Thane shippers get their longed-for payoff); it's sorely lacking an epilogue of some sort.

For me, it is impossible to read a book like Spare Parts from any lens other than my own lens as both an immigrant and a person of color; and it makes the reading even more powerful. This book is the non-fiction account of four high school students of Mexican heritage (three of them illegal immigrants under the law) who – under the tutelage of two amazing high school teachers – competed in a national competition to build a submersible, remote-operated vehicle that could perform specific tasks. Without any privilege and with limited resources, these students went head-to-head vs collegiate teams from places like MIT that embody the exact opposite position of wealth, privilege, and educational opportunity. Davis accomplishes what every good non-fiction author needs to accomplish: (1) present the reader with unique protagonists whose outcome you immediately root for; (2) detail their backstories and lives; (3) provide all relevant historical/cultural contexts; and (4) engage us with a gripping account of the action/conflict. Davis hits on all four: the high school students and teachers are well-described, you root for their success immediately, you understand the historical/cultural context of immigration in America, and the events leading up to and through the robotics competition are engaging. I had to put down the book and weep with joy for five solid minutes at the climactic moment. And then, rather than take the easy way out and end on a happy note, Davis continues the story to tell how American and Arizonian immigration policies continued to impact these students even after their accomplishments – because this story is not just about the opportunity we have in America to overcome our backgrounds by our own individual talents; the story is also the lack of opportunity we sometimes have in America because of its policies; and Davis does not avoid this narrative simply because it makes us uncomfortable and doesn’t give us the fairy tale ending we desire. You will leave this book feeling both joyous and outraged, and the book’s ability to bring you to both emotions without resorting to soapboxing is a testament to its quality.

Ceony has just finished magic school and is assigned to apprentice under Emery Thane, a professional Folder — a magician who specializes in paper magic. In this universe which takes place in a fictional London, magicians are bonded to a material (paper, glass, plastic, or rubber) for life. Ceony doesn’t think much of paper magic, but given her poor upbringing, she has no recourse but to begrudgingly accept her placement. Thane turns out to be a kind, but mysterious teacher. Events unfold that eventually lead to Thane’s life being at stake. Ceony, novice paper magician that she is, must step up to save her mentor’s (and unsurprisingly also her love interest) life. Overall, this was an engaging read. Like most YA books, the prose is short on flowery description and focused more on action and inner emotion. This makes for a quick read; you’ll finish this in a sitting. Holmberg has done an excellent job universe-building. The idea of magicians being tied to a material made for interesting spells. For example, paper magic can be used to animate origami animals or create paper fans that produce strong gusts of air. Holmberg uses this unique framing to good effect. Holmberg has also crafted characters that are easy to root for, and that act consistent to their personalities (especially as we learn more about their pasts over the course of the book). My one critique is that the book follows a lot of YA tropes: plucky, talented female lead; female lead develops feelings for good-hearted, mysterious male lead; female lead is able to overcome primary plot struggle by excelling in her gifts and through learning more about herself, etc. In that vein, This book reminded me a lot of Terry Pratchett’s Tiffany Aching books.

This relationship was allowed to organically grow and breathe, especially given their master-apprentice relationship.

Fee & Stuart believe it’s because folks need to be taught the proper way to do so; this book is their attempt to bring the right framework and tools to properly understand Scripture. The first few chapters provide the grounding – they explain why different translations exist, and why we need both exegesis (understanding a passage in its context) and hermeneutics (how to interpret a passage and apply it to today). The remaining chapters then tackle each of the different genres of Biblical writing (wisdom literature, prophetic books, epistles, gospels, etc), and explain how different each genre are from each other. In addition to explaining the differences between genres, Fee & Stuart explain the differences of types within the genre. For example, they break Psalms into different sub-categories (psalms of lament, thanksgiving, praise, etc) and explain how the structure of each type differs. By the end, the reader does leave with a stronger understanding of how to approach different books of the Bible. A few critiques: first, the title implies that people of any spiritual maturity or any level of literacy can read this book and improve their understanding of Scripture. On one hand, that is true in the sense that this book has much to teach about how to read the Bible accurately. On the other hand, the book’s reading level reads more like a book written for seminary students by two seminary professors. So this is not for everybody. Second, the authors explain how to balance exegesis against hermeneutics, but they seem to give so much weight to exegesis that they potentially limit (too much) the application of Biblical commands and principles to today. Related, they are so focused on only understanding each passage within context, at one point, they make the absolute statement in reference to how to read the Old Testament “no historical narrative is ever intended at the same time to be an allegory.” I disagree. To claim that the story of Abraham’s near sacrifice of Isaac was not intended to be an allegory is limiting, and undersells the role of Spirit-inspired Scripture tying past writings to future understanding (a core part of dispensational theology). This was one of several instances where I struggled with the authors’ pneumatology. It’s a solid read overall, but in their approach to deconstruct the reading of Scripture, at times Fee & Stuart make it a comprehension exercise than an enjoyment of holy Scripture....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jul 2018,Aug 2018,"Jul 14, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24109.How_to_Read_the_Bible_for_All_Its_Worth

This book imagines Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi as a Shakespearean play told in iambic pentameter, complete with acts, scenes, asides, and so forth. Many of the lines of dialogue are simply reinvented lines from the movie told in old English (“Each word thou speakest was entirely false. The good rebellion is reborn today, the war hath just begun, and nay, I shall not be Jedi the last.”). Doescher does more than simply translate every line of the movie into Shakespearean prose, however. He creates scenes and monologues to complement and supplement the movie lines. For example, towards the end of the Last Jedi movie, there is a scene where all hopes seems lost, and Leia resignedly concedes defeat. In the book, she expresses that resignation with a tremendous soliloquy that reflects on her impact throughout the entire rebellion from New Hope on; she even ponders what her legacy will be post death – which is such a sweet tribute to Carrie Fisher’s actual death and impact on the franchise. It’s tremendous. In addition, Doescher adds some fanservice. There is a very clever monologue given to the codebreaker at Canto Bight that plays off of his James Bond-esque look from the movie. I also want to call out Doescher’s brilliant use of Prospero’s closing soliloquy from The Tempest for Luke Skywalker – given both Prospero and Luke were island exiles. Overall, this is my favorite of Doescher’s eight Shakespearean Star Wars books. Fans of Star Wars will appreciate this; fans of Shakespeare will appreciate this; fans of both will LOVE this.

Moore states the obvious: that Christianity in America is at a crossroads. Many thinkpieces have been written as to whether the nation is post-Christian or something else; and whether Christianity can survive in a culture that deems its orthodoxy to be untenable, outdated, and offensive. Instead of lamenting this crossroads, Moore applauds it because that is what Christian orthodoxy has always been and where historically it has been most successful: preaching a gospel that flips the world’s values upside down. As Moore notes, the world doesn’t want and doesn’t need an “almost gospel” – the kind of moral therapeutic deism that is a watered-down gospel and not true orthodoxy. Moore confronts American Christianity’s desires to co-opt culture (i.e. the Religious Right), withdraw from culture (i.e. The Benedict Option), or embrace culture (i.e. nominal Christianity). Then chapter by chapter, Moore lays out what true Christian orthodoxy says about things like its mission, the kingdom of God, culture, human dignity, and the family; why American Christianity by and large misses the boat on these topics; and how the gospel reframes all these things. More than just laying out a cohesive theology and challenging our understanding of the Christian message, Moore lays out how the church and how true Christians ought to move forward in engaging culture while preaching the gospel. Prose-wise, the book reads like a series of meditations/sermons, with so many choice soundbites, I had to read aloud whole pages to people.

Valente imagines a universe filled with alien beings, many of whom were part of a galactic war. In the aftermath of that war, these alien species got together and pledged not to annihilate other civilizations — provided that new civilizations could prove they were sentient. Proof of said sentience? Participation in a galactic singing competition and not finishing last.

He covers similar themes as those covered in his other books: growing up in poverty, alcoholism, abuse, racism, and Native American culture. The bulk of this book is Alexie wrestling with his feelings over the death of his mother; he both loved her and felt she was cruel. He attempts to understand his conflicted feelings by trying to understand her life and why she was how she was. In many ways, this is as much a memoir about his mother as it is about him. Prose-wise, this was different from other Alexie books I’ve read in two ways. One, this was an even mix of prose and poetry (I’d never read any of his poetry before). It works. Second, the balance was clearly tilted more towards poignancy than humor. I appreciated the more serious tone, especially as he wrestled with his conflicted grief.

The cover notes that this book is focused on presenting a balanced view of divine election, but I found it to be less a book about divine election and more a book about moderate Calvinism (typical evangelical theological position). Geisler critiques the extreme Calvinist and Arminian positions on unconditional election and then expands and critiques both positions’ overall theological beliefs around the five points of Calvinism. As is the case when presenting a written argument against another position, Geisler often argues against caricatures of extreme Calvinists and Arminians rather than fully accurate representations of their beliefs. He also debates both sides’ interpretations of individual Bible verses rather than debating the coherency and consistency of their logic and framework. So depending where you fall theologically, you will either agree or wildly disagree with this book; there is no middle ground, really. I found Geisler’s prose in this more readable than the other Geisler books I’ve read (less technical, more analogies). While this book did not change my theological position, it did make me pause and consider his arguments carefully. I think this book would be useful as a resource when debating extreme positions, especially in sections where Geisler notes all of the key Bible verses presents how one side interprets that verse, and then provides counter arguments against those interpretations. Decent read for those interested in theology; probably a pass for the rest....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,May 2018,May 2018,"May 15, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14786.Chosen_But_Free

Can you see the connection I am about to make to Only Human? I really enjoyed Sleeping Giants, the first book in the Themis trilogy. I found the characters unique and interesting; the prose page-turning; and the robot storyline engaging. I also enjoyed Waking Gods, the sequel; I thought the characters, prose, and storyline were as strong as those of the first book. So I was looking forward to finishing the trilogy. Boy, was I sorely disappointed – especially because it falls short in all three strengths of the first two books. At the end of Waking Gods, our main characters (Rose, the scientist who found Themis, an alien robot; Vincent, one of Themis’ pilots; and Eva, Vincent’s daughter) are teleported from earth inside Themis to some non-earth location. Only Human takes place nine years later. The three main characters make their way back to earth after nearly a decade away to find that the world has changed. The United States has utilized another alien robot to essentially bully the rest of the world. Meanwhile, all over the planet, people with alien DNA are being imprisoned in internment camps. The book’s narrative switches back and forth between the present day earth and the main characters’ time on the alien planet over the past nine years. My first problem with the book is that it ditches the fast action from the previous books (especially action involving robots) and focuses instead on the characters’ angst, culture struggles, and relational dynamics. I feel like Neuvel’s bet was that the reader cared enough about the characters after two books that he could remove the robots and the robot action, and that we would just care about the character arcs; he was wrong in that. Previous books balanced action with personal drama; this book tips the scale to the latter and is worse off for it. Second, because of the focus on how the world has changed over the last nine years and what the alien world’s culture was like over nine years, we get a lot more monologuing from characters on themes like democracy, patriotism, the nature of conformity, and a Hobbesian/Lockian debate on human nature. If I wanted political exposition, I’d bore myself with NPR. Lastly, the characters have lost their charm and have become jaded and whiny. At several points in the book, each of the characters is called cynical by someone; but it’s not the characters’ but the author’s cynicism that colors all this debating. And that cynicism makes the characters unlikable for pretty much the entirety of the book for me.

She, her mother, and three brothers face an uncertain future, especially without their father, who has been missing in action for several years because of the war. We get a glimpse of their life before the fall of Saigon, and then immediately after when they join the mass exodus of folks choosing to flee by boat to Thailand. After spending some time in a refugee camp, Hà and her family are sponsored by a man from Alabama, and we get to see the family’s experience adjusting to life in the US. The prose is told through poems from Hà’s perspective, so it is her frame through which we get to experience the fear of leaving your home, the roughness of the flight by boat, the racist taunting from classmates, and the struggle to understand a new culture. I suppose I should add the disclaimer that I am Vietnamese, and my family’s immigration experience mirrored Hà’s almost identically, so my personal identification with her feelings and struggles elevated the book for me. But I think the prose conveys heartbreak and struggle in every word and stanza so well that even without a shared experience, readers will better understand the plight of refugees.

They are in a boat, and the father lays down in the bottom and asks them to imagine a scenario where something has happened and the two young children need to figure out how to survive on their own. “Imagine me gone,” he says. This little scene is the set-up for the rest of the story. John suffers from clinical depression – so much so that within the first quarter of the book, he kills himself. His wife (Margaret) and their three children (Michael, Celia, and Alec) must now go through their lives with him gone. The remainder of the book traces their lives at several different points in the future, and we see the impact of John’s life and death (not just the impact of John’s suicide, but also his previous somewhat-absent parenting because of his bouts of depression). Even more than that, oldest-son Michael suffers from mental health issues as well, so the family’s grappling with John’s issues are being actively lived out through their grappling with Michael’s issue. And the narrative is told from the perspectives of each member of the family, so we get to see how each of them frame their struggles. It’s an extremely well-crafted construct, with many layers. My one big gripe is that other than one chapter, I found all of Michael’s narratives to be too long and uninteresting. For example, he spends one early chapter going on for pages and pages about Donna Summer and her music. I get that he has obsessive issues, but still; imagining Michael’s chapters gone was something I actively did throughout the book. This is a four-star book with more editing of Michael’s storyline, because most of the book’s prose is really well done (especially John’s chapter, and the last few chapters)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Apr 2018,May 2018,"Apr 19, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28333962-imagine-me-gone

Preston spends the first third or so of the book tracing the rumors surrounding the legend, as well as the various failed attempts over the last century to locate the lost city. The story kicks into high gear when a team of folks come up with the idea to use LIDAR – a technological advancement that uses laser-imaging technology to map surfaces (used by NASA on the moon, for example) – to map unexplored jungle territories in Honduras where the fabled city might reside. The middle third of the book is Preston’s first-hand account of that mapping process and the subsequent ground exploration of an area revealed by LIDAR to contain man-made structures. Preston’s descriptions of the many, many dangers of the jungle (particularly snakes and disease-carrying insects) amped up the excitement level of an archaeological exploration.

Christopher editeThe book cover shows JRR as the author, although the finished product is actually a team effort between JRR and his son Christopher. Christopher edited and finished a story JRR had partially developed in The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. In the Tolkien universe, Húrin was the greatest of the heroes of men during the First Age. Húrin sired three children: a daughter Urwen (who passed away young), a son named Túrin, and a second daughter named Niënor. Per the book title, the focus of this story are the two surviving children of Húrin (primarily Túrin). Húrin is captured and imprisoned by Morgoth, leaving his wife and young children alone. Fatherless, Túrin is sent to live with the elves, but an incident with an elf causes Túrin to leave the elves and make his own way in the world. He falls in with a band of outlaws and his legend grows. He eventually runs into the dragon Glaurung whose enchantment and deception leads Túrin down even darker roads. Meanwhile, Niënor and her mom eventually search for Túrin, before an incident with Glaurung splits them up and also leads them down dark journeys. The overall tenor and plot of this story is reminiscent of traditional Shakespearean tragedies, with Túrin as the Lear/Macbeth tragic hero. And like the archetypical Shakespearean tragic hero, Túrin’s moral failings (in this case, severe pride) brings about his eventual ruin. Unlike other Tolkien works that tell larger mythologies juggling many forces of good fighting many forces of evil, Children of Húrin is focused on the smaller universe around Túrin (to some degree that universe exists beneath the larger frame of the forces of good fighting against Morgoth). This smaller scale focus is actually a positive, and allows for a deeper character story. It’s also a negative since one of the things that made the Lord of the Rings trilogy so appealing was the larger mythos of the universe. The one criticism I have, though, lies in its lack of exciting, epic battles. I live for scenes like the Ride of the Rohirrim, or the battle of Helmsdeep. The skirmishes in Children of Húrin tend to be very short and small in scale.

Nimona is a shapeshifter, and her powers prove useful in Blackheart’s fight against the Institution, the security force of the kingdom.

But frankly, I don’t really care about the opinion of any Cline fanboy who disagrees with my , so I’ll get to my point: this book is terrible. It’s not terrible because I don’t get nerd culture (I do), or didn’t catch all of the pop culture allusions (I did); it’s not terrible because I disliked Ready Player One (I thought it was fine) or am a Cline hater; it’s not terrible because I loved RP1 (I didn’t) and this fell short of lofty expectations (I had pretty low expectations) — it’s just not a very good book. Zack Lightman is a HS senior who was raised by a single mother (his father passed away in an accident when he was a baby). Zack is unsure what he wants to do with his life, but he is really, really good at a video game called Armada, a flight simulator where you run missions and take out alien ships to prevent an invasion. It turns out that the game has really been part of a decades-long military program to train and recruit people to pilot drones to fight an actual alien invasion. One morning, Zack and others around the globe are picked up by a global defense force (the Earth Defense Alliance) and informed that an alien horde of ships are en route to destroy mankind. Earth’s last hope are the skills of Zack and other gamers. Where do I begin unpacking how disappointing this book was? I’ll start with the plot: it’s so derivative as to be insulting. It’s one thing to be an homage to Ender’s Game and The Last Starfighter; it’s another to be a watered-down clone. Nothing in this plot is surprising, and everything is both telegraphed and expected. Second, in Ready Player One, the nerd culture allusions are the central plot device, so cramming that book with fan service at least made some sense. There is no point to any of the nerd allusions in Armada. The film dialogue quips the main characters swap are trite and unnecessary. Moreover, the nerd allusions are clumsily included and so forced, they come off as written by a poseur rather than a real fan. For example, two characters early on argue over whether Frodo’s Sting is a cooler weapon than Thor’s Mjolnir. Terrible. Third, everything that happens seems like it was written from the lens of either a nerd who wants to live out his deepest fantasies, or from the lens of a writer trying to appeal to what he thinks are nerds’ deepest fantasies. Examples: the anti-establishment, HS loner is the protagonist; the strong, badass, super hot gamer girl quickly falls in love with the protagonist not because of his looks but because of his pop culture wit, snarky wisecracks, and video game skills; society’s outcasts are really society’s greatest hope, etc. This book is either fanfic or pandering; either way, it irritated me. Lastly, the prose is atrocious. From the overly expository parts to the clunky dialogue to the clumsy plotting, this is just poorly written. Part of me wants to like this more than I do because I’m the intended audience — same feeling I had reading Ready Player One. But at the end of the day, I want well-written pandering more than poorly-written fan fiction.

In this book, Wilson tackles why it seems like early Christians seemed to exhibit more supernatural power than modern Christians. More specifically, Wilson is attempting to explain whether there is a difference in how the Holy Spirit works in today’s Christians compared to earlier believers. Wilson essentially answers these questions in two ways: (1) modern believers don’t understand how the Spirit works; and (2) in actuality, the Spirit works far more supernaturally now than He did in the early church. The first few chapters lay out a proper understanding of the Holy Spirit (e.g. He is a person not a thing). The next few chapters lay out what the believer needs to do to more fully abide in the Spirit (read the Bible and pray). The last few chapters lay out how the Spirit works in believers today. Wilson even includes a chapter explaining his theological position on cessationism vs continuationism. Because of the subject matter, unlike other books by Wilson that are for both Christians and non-Christians alike, this book is very much directed at Christians only.

The Abolition of Man is very different from Lewis’ other writings, however. Rather than a book arguing for faith or discussing faith topics, The Abolition of Man is more like a philosophical essay. Lewis is responding to a (then) recent book that argued that there were no values inherent in objects; that statements of value about objects (e.g. the beauty of a waterfall) are statements about the speaker’s feelings rather than observations about inherent value. Lewis essentially argues that: (a) some things do have inherent value; (b) that the universality of some values across different religions and worldviews (what Lewis calls the Tao) speaks to this point; (c) we have an obligation to cultivate values within children; and (d) that when we reduce everything to reason and logic and give up our values, we lose our humanity (hence the title). Because it’s essay-like, this is a much dryer (and a bit pedantic) than Lewis’ other works; but we do get to see trademark Lewis logical thinking.

In this book, Stevenson brings to light the many systemic problems in the current legal system, particularly those that work against people of color and the poor. He provides real life examples of the cases he has worked on within his organization (Equal Justice Initiative) where dysfunctions (intentional or otherwise) within law enforcement, the judicial system, and communities resulted in death sentences for people (some innocent). He lays out chapters meant to horrify the reader about the plight of the mentally disabled, children, and poor mothers on death row. On top of these chapters, Stevenson tells the story of Walter McMillan, and the gross injustice that led to his death sentence. Throughout, Stevenson’s prose takes on many voices: sad, righteously angry, rationally argumentative, emotionally outraged, etc. He wants to shock the reader, tug on his/her heartstring, and make the case that given the many problems in the American legal system, capital punishment needs to be abolished. Stevenson takes the debate away from moral arguments on whether or not people deserve to die and instead asks the question “Do we deserve to kill?” It’s well-written throughout, although by the end, I was so emotionally numb that the constant heart-wringing wore on me a bit. But overall, a powerful read that may or may not change the reader’s opinion on the death penalty; but for certain it will energize the faithful for the fight....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Feb 2018,Mar 2018,"Feb 22, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20342617-just-mercy

In Radical Candor, Scott shares her experiences as a senior leader in the business world (including her time at Google and Apple) and what she learned about the best ways to manage employees. She frames ongoing dialogue with direct reports along two spectrums: caring personally for them and challenging them directly. In a nutshell, managers should genuinely value their employees, take an interest in their lives and careers, and invest in their success; while also speaking bluntly and candidly about where they need to grow and why. Scott even emphasizes that only by doing the former (caring personally) is the latter (challenging directly) possible. In addition to this radical candor framework for engaging with employees, Scott shares other useful practices for managers (e.g. what good listening is and how to do it, how and why to give employees freedom to debate your decisions, empowering them to execute on decisions, etc.). Throughout, Scott’s prose is easy-to-read and engaging. She includes lots of anecdotes and practical tips.

For sure, I can list some adjectives that come to mind: genius, biting, hysterical, savage, creative, damning. The closest comparison I can think of is Catch-22. Where Heller wrote a tragicomic satire to illuminate the absurd aspects of war, Beatty has written a tragicomic satire to illuminate the absurd aspects of being black in America. The protagonist is BonBon Me, a black man who grew up in an urban/rural neighborhood inside LA. He was raised by a single father (a sociologist) whose idea of parenting was putting his son through social experiments to raise his consciousness to issues of race and racism. After his father is killed, BonBon joins with a man named Hominy Jenkins (the last remaining Little Rascal) in an attempt to reinstate both slavery and segregation. His actions lead him before the US Supreme Court – I’m telling you this plot is bonkers. Beatty is obviously not making the point that slavery and segregation were good things; rather he/BonBon is making the point that the ending of both slavery and segregation has not improved the lives of black people either. The Sellout is part satire and social commentary, tragedy and comedy, condemnation and education, with prose that is some mix of essay, poetry, rap, standup routine, and searing tirade. If you combined the prose DNA of Jonathan Safran Foer, Dave Chapelle and Dennis Miller, you’d get Paul Beatty. I mean, in one section Beatty combines gangsta rap with Tennyson’s Charge of the Light Brigade, for crying out loud. His prose is altogether screamingly brilliant. If I have a criticism – and it’s a small one given the caliber of this satire – is there was a diminishing enjoyment in the prose as the book wore on. For the first fifty pages, I was reading section after section out loud to my wife so she could appreciate the brilliance of the writing. I stopped reading passages out loud after 100 pages, but still smiling to myself in amazement. By page 200, I still appreciated what I was reading, but also looked forward to Beatty wrapping it all up; I needed a bit less punch and more plot resolution.

I loved the original Thrawn trilogy, and like many fans, I was disappointed when Disney/Lucasfilms removed the storyline out of the EU canon. But hoo boy was I excited when they returned him to canon in 2016. In Thrawn, Zahn details the rise of the greatest military strategist to ever live. The book begins with some Imperial forces finding Thrawn on a distant planet. Right away, he demonstrates his superior tactical skills and manages to outwit the Imperial contingent and board the Imperial ship. After Thrawn reveals himself to them, he is taken to meet Emperor Palpatine who takes a liking to Thrawn and places him into military training. The book then describes Thrawn’s quick ascendancy from lieutenant to commander to grand admiral as time after time he demonstrates a Sherlock-ian ability to understand situations, outthink everyone else, and intuit the best routes to victory. Many of these situations are part of a book-long cat-and-mouse/Sherlock-Moriarty game with a smuggler/rebel codenamed Nightswan. Zahn does a great job of describing each unfolding situation and explaining how and why Thrawn was able to come to the decisions he did. At Thrawn’s side is Eli Vanto, a young man who grew up in areas of the universe known as the wild space (the Star Wars version of rural hickville). Eli speaks Thrawn’s native language, so the Imperial army ties his career to Thrawn’s. And yes, I’ll make a third Sherlock allusion, but Vanto is very much Watson to Thrawn’s Sherlock. The book doesn’t just focus on Thrawn’s military rise, however. Zahn spends half the book detailing the career ascendancy of a woman named Arihnda Pryce. Pryce is a hyper-ambitious woman who grew up on an Outer Rim planet called Lothal. When a galactic senator takes over her parents’ mine on behalf of the Empire, Arihnda begins her push to power so that she can be the one controlling things. Zahn perfectly parallels Thrawn’s military strategy skills with Pryce’s political strategy skills, and every one of Pryce’s successful political gambits are as exciting as Thrawn’s military victories. The prose is very readable, especially for fans who will be delighted by the appearance of familiar locales, alien races, and allusions to the Star Wars canon.

I read most of Doyle’s stories when I was younger; I’m a huge fan of the BBC Cumberbatch/Freeman show; I enjoyed the Downey Jr renditions; I even watch the Elementary TV show. Not surprising, then, that I love the character of Moriarty. In Horowitz’s book, we are introduced to Frederick Chase, a Pinkerton agent from NYC who has come to Europe in the days after the events of the Reichenbach Falls where both Sherlock and Moriarty are presumed dead. Chase meets up with Scotland Yard agent Athelney Jones who is investigating Moriarty’s death. Chase tells Jones that an American criminal mastermind named Clarence Devereaux had come to Europe with his henchmen to meet up with Moriarty in order to partner to build a global criminal network. The remainder of the story is Jones and Chase following clues to ferret out the mysterious and dangerous Devereaux. Jones (who appeared in Sign of the Four) plays the role of Holmes with his deductive investigation methods, while Chase takes on the role of Watson sidekick. Horowitz does a terrific job in both the characterizations of Jones and Chase and in building their relationship. Because this is a Sherlock Holmes story, the reader immediately looks for red herrings and questions everything. Is Moriarty really dead? Is that mysterious character in the shadows Sherlock? Horowitz understands this and builds a plot that twists and turns organically to foil the reader’s assumptions. From a prose perspective, Horowitz mimics the Doyle style remarkably well: the dialogue is sufficiently British “stuffy”; he utilizes words like “tincture” and “brougham”; the descriptions of London feel historically accurate. This very much felt like a Sherlock Holmes story, and a good one at that. A solid read for non-Sherlock fans and a definite read for fans. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2018,Jan 2018,"Jan 14, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36342965-moriarty

In fact, at one point, I had seen each episode so many times, I had essentially memorized the first seven seasons. One time in college, a friend challenged me and randomly recited a line from an episode he had just watched and without hesitation I recited back to him the next few lines. So I have a deep love and respect for the show. In addition, I’m a huge math nerd. So any book that combines the two – AND is written by the author of Fermat’s Last Theorem which I really liked – well, you know you are hitting my sweet spot. Singh is a Simpsons fan who began noticing all the math jokes embedded in the show. When he found out the writing staff over the years was essentially composed of brilliant mathematicians, the book was born. Singh interviews many of the show writers and discusses their math backgrounds. He even tries to make a connection as to why there are logical reasons why mathematicians make good comedy writers. Each chapter uses a Simpsons gag as a springboard to discuss unique math topics [e.g. topology, special prime numbers (Marsenne and Germain primes), Erdos numbers (and Erdos-Bacon numbers), and pi to name a few]. After each chapter, we get an understanding of not only why the joke is funny, but also what makes that math topic so special. As he did in Fermat’s Last Theorem, Singh does a great job of explaining complex math in easy (easier) to understand prose.

My brain is hardwired to think about worst-case scenarios and “what if”s all the live long day. In this book, uber-popular pastor Max Lucado takes on the human struggle with anxiety. The book is based on Paul’s words from Philippians 4:6-8, which Lucado cleverly boils down to the acronym CALM (Celebrate Ask Leave and Meditate). Our struggle with anxiety can simply be solved by doing such things as focusing on the blessings in our lives instead of our trials, seeking God in prayer, trusting in God to care for us and handle all situations, and shifting our perspective. If you are reading the underlying tone in this last sentence, then you understand that I find his counsel to be reductive and overly simplistic. I generally have a like/dislike relationship with Lucado’s stuff. On one hand, I like that nearly 50% of every book he writes are Bible verses. But on the other hand, I dislike that he uses every translation under the sun when communicating verses (sorry Christian author, but if you are utilizing the Living Bible or the Message, I’m not going to respect your book). I like that he boils things down to the essentials; I dislike that he tends to be simplistic. I like that his folksy, down-to-earth prose is very readable; I dislike that his prose is very Hallmark-y, as if he were writing each sentence intending them to be shared as a social media meme. Overall, this book is standard Lucado – and depending on whether you are a Lucado fan or not is either good or bad. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Dec 2017,Dec 2017,"Dec 22, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32951877-anxious-for-nothing

I enjoy both types of books, so long as they are told well. News of the World is the latter type, and it accomplishes what it sets out to do, and remarkably so. The protagonist is Captain Jefferson Kidd, a 72-yr-old man who travels from small town to small town reading excerpts from various national and international newspapers to interested citizens (hence the title). At one such stop, an acquaintance asks him to finish a mission: deliver a 10-yr-old girl to her aunt and uncle. The girl’s parents had been killed when she was 6 by members of the Kiowa tribe, and she had spent the past four years living among the Kiowa. Her aunt and uncle placed a bounty for her return. Captain Kidd accepts the mission, and the entirety of the story is simply the description of his journey with this young girl (named Johanna) and the relationship that builds between the two. For a book with such a linear plot to succeed, it must: (a) have sparkling prose; (b) build the characters well; and (c) make us care about the relationship – Jiles goes 3 for 3. Her prose feels so naturally a part of this Civil War era, it reminded me of classics like Uncle Tom’s Cabin. And she develops both Captain Kidd and Johanna so well, you immediately pull for their safety and for them to stay together. No wonder this was a National Book Award finalist.

For non-history buffs, the Battle of Dunkirk occurred over a 7-day period (May 26-June 4 1940). Germany essentially marched through Belgium and the Netherlands, trapping some 400,000 British and French troops in and around Dunkirk. Standing their ground and fighting would have resulted in massive casualties, possibly crippling the British ability to continue fighting and changing the course of the war. But evacuation seemed impossible given they were boxed in by German ground troops and the port situation in Dunkirk was essentially non-existent. The book details how a combination of luck (foggy weather helped ground the Luftwaffe for three days), poor German strategy (Hitler’s halt order on the German ground troops that delayed their attack by several days), and British resourcefulness (Britain commandeered every fishing boat, barge, naval boat, and seaworthy craft possible) resulted in the evacuation of nearly 340,000 troops across the English Channel. The display of courage and pluck became a rallying point for Britain’s war efforts. There are two types of non-fiction history books. One type focuses on a handful of key characters and traces the historical events through these characters, relating the events through fiction-esque prose. The other type takes a very documentary approach and throws in every detail, every historical reporting, every interview and quote available to cover the event. I very much enjoy the former type (Seabiscuit, Unbroken, and Boys in the Boat – my three favorite non-fiction books ever – are told in this vein). The latter type tends to be too dry or disjointed for my tastes. Unfortunately, this book falls under this latter category. Lord includes far too many characters and without any key central figures, the book lacks cohesion. Secondly, Lord’s told different facets of the evacuation across different chapters. But their timelines overlapped. The way Lord laid out these overlapping timelines often confused me. Lastly, the book included a handful of maps but really could have used a whole lot more. As Lord detailed the movement of different troops, I had to keep a map open on my phone in order to follow what was happening. Having more maps in every chapter would have helped the flow.

He mentions in the preface that his intent is not to pick all of the misused stories; just the ones he feels are used incorrectly the most often. For example, his first chapter is on the story of David and Goliath. Bargerhuff notes that many pastors use that story to encourage folks to face their biggest fears (the giants in their lives). But he points out that in that story, David actually showed no fear whatsoever, and that this story is less about facing our fears and more about trusting in the Lord’s strength (like David did). In another example, Bargerhuff discusses how the story of Gideon is not about putting out tests to God (commonly taught) and more about God working His will despite weak faith. Each of these chapters is essentially a mini-sermon or devotional on the actual meaning of the text. Bargerhuff does a great job in explanation and explication in demonstrating why these passages should be seen in a different (and truer) light. I’d rate this book higher but I had two issues. First, there were several chapters where I felt Bargerhuff did not choose the passage because it was frequently misused but rather because he had a point he wanted to make and found a passage to connect it to. For example, in chapter 8, he rants (beautifully, I might add) about the evils of the prosperity gospel. And while a great rant, it feels a bit shoe-horned into the passage he cites; and I can come up with more misused stories than the one he chose. My second issue with the book is that when the title says “most misused stories” I read that to indicate that these chosen stories are Bible passages that are used by pastors and teachers incorrectly or improperly. But some of these stories are simply ones that people have common misperceptions about and aren’t stories that are “misused”. For example, Bargerhuff cites the story of the magi visiting Jesus in the gospel of Matthew and points out that the Bible does not describe three kings presenting presents to baby Jesus in a manger; in actuality, it’s an unstated number of wise men not kings who likely visit Jesus in Nazareth rather than Bethlehem. Thanks for that clarification, but again, that makes the Matthew passage a misunderstanding rather than misused. It’s not as if pastors around the country are preaching on three kings as a key doctrinal point. This book is still a solid and interesting read, but I think I’d enjoy even more a book written about the actual most misused passages in Scripture. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Nov 2017,Nov 2017,"Nov 25, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30259056-the-most-misused-stories-in-the-bible

Schwab is 3 for 3 with A Darker Shade of Magic. We are introduced to a man named Kell who is an Antari. Antari are magic users who can travel between connected worlds that are both similar yet radically different. The entire story takes place in a fictionalized version of London that has different versions of itself: a Black London version (powerful magic world that has been shut off from the other worlds for safety reasons), a Gray London version (no magic in this world), a White London version (magic in this world, but it’s rare) and Red London (magic is common). Kell travels between these connected worlds in service of the different rulers of each. In one of these worlds, he encounters a woman named Delilah Bard. Delilah lives life om the streets as a thief, surviving on her toughness, grit, courage, and desire for adventure. Kell comes into possession of a mysterious and powerful stone, which Delilah steals from him. That single encounter and that powerful stone embroil Kell and Delilah on a mission to both save the world from the rulers of White London. As I said, Schwab hits the mark on everything I look for in a fantasy book. On the character front, Kell and Delilah – and other important characters like Holland (a fellow Antari) and Rhy (the prince of Red London and Kell’s brother/friend) – are each unique and well-developed. The reader immediately connects with Kell and Delilah, and frankly, I shipped them right away. On the world-building front, the universe of connected worlds and magic is also well-developed. And it’s developed organically without the need for exposition that slows down most fantasy world-building. Finally, the action delivers. Once Kell realizes what the stone can do, it is frantic action until the end as Kell and Delilah do everything they can to survive. The best compliment I can give a fantasy fiction book is that it leaves me wanting to read the sequel – this one does.

I read Wool a year ago and thought that it was an interesting concept (a post-apocalyptic world set inside a 144-floor underground silo), but I didn’t connect with any of the characters and found it a bit too long (some unnecessary story elements; inconsistent pacing). I read Shift earlier this year and enjoyed it more than I did Wool. Shift was a prequel and did a great job of providing the details of the people behind the silo situation, their motivation, and the events preceding those of Wool. For me, while I connected more with the characters in Shift, the prequel still suffered from the pacing issues in its predecessor. Dust takes place immediately after Wool (and Shift) and utilizes the main characters of both books to advance the story. Juliette is back as the focal point of the story, and she sets off to seek revenge against those in the main silo controlling everything. She engages in a plan to connect her silo with Solo’s silo, as well as a plan to destroy the main silo. Meanwhile in the main silo, Donald and his sister Charlotte are doing everything they can to break down the main silo’s power as well. Both of their attempts face setbacks, and we follow their attempts to do good for the sake of the future no matter the challenges. For me, the best thing about Dust is that it is half the length of Wool and Shift, because I’ll be honest, I couldn’t wait for this book and series to end. Even three books in, I never connected with any of the characters. In fact, I was actively rooting for everyone to die. And it finally dawned on me why: I don’t enjoy books where the only thing advancing the plot and creating plot tension are the poor decision-making of the characters. Juliette’s decisions lead to disaster after disaster. Little Elise running off after her puppy causes several major inconveniences (including a shoehorned in apocalyptic religious cult that made no sense). Donald’s carelessness leads to his capture, and Charlotte’s foolhardy attempt to get a microphone leads to hers. Time after time I grimaced to myself and had to put the book away, I was so angry. The overarching conspiracy behind the silos should cause enough intrigue and plot tension to advance the story; it shouldn’t need all these “oh no” moments.

This book is essentially an autobiography starting with his middle class upbringing in Minnesota; his start in comedy; his tenure at SNL; the experiences in his life that pulled him into politics (primarily his friendship and respect of MN senator Paul Wellstone); his senatorial campaign against incumbent Norm Coleman; and his career as a senator through the current year and the election of Trump. Throughout, you get plenty of propaganda (“Democrats fight for the little guy and blue collar folks!”) and Republican-bashing. You also get so much self-service it feels like a 400-page stump speech (e.g. He describes in detail meeting people whom he calls by name, and it sounds so much like a soundbite. “I met Sally Smith who was suffering from lupus and that’s why I fight for universal health care!”). In addition, it’s impossible to read this book like I did post-Franken-scandal and not feel like the book is completely hypocritical – especially because there are sections where he is astonished by the behavior of politicians like Gary Hart, and sections where he had to fight to convince women voters he wasn’t misogynistic despite whatever comedy pieces he had written in a past career.

Ahsoka is obviously about Ahsoka Tano, the awesome character from The Clone Wars series (and Rebels, spoiler). And if you haven’t watched either series, this  is meaningless to you and we probably can’t be friends. The book takes place during the years between Clone Wars and Rebels. Ahsoka, disillusioned from her treatment in the Jedi hangar bombing debacle, has left the Jedi order and is trying to make a new life for herself as a mechanic on outer rim planets to escape the galactic war. Unfortunately, the empire’s growing reach catches up to her planet. Ahsoka tries to lay low, but during a botched secret mission, she uses the Force to save her friends. This catches the attention of a bounty hunter of Force-users hired by the Empire, compelling Ahsoka to confront both the impact her very existence has to those she befriends, as well as her obligation to continue to use her skills and talents in the fight for justice. Johnston does a solid job giving us a glimpse into Ahsoka’s conflicted thought processes and emotions and decision-making. This Ahsoka is not the sassy, inexperienced Padawan that earned the nickname Snips; this is a much more mature, battle-hardened, war-weary Ahsoka, which is a solid choice of characterization. Beyond that, the prose is very simplistic – it reads more like a YA title or a movie novelization for teens than an adult read.

It’s clear that this work is deeply personal; and I think it’s a bit of a jerk move to criticize someone’s personal sharing. At the same time, she chose to publish this, and it is possible to rate the technical and craft side of her work, so that’s where I’m coming from. This book is technically classified as poetry, although I found that about a third of the book were actually poems, a third of the book were personal sketches, and a third were simply 2-3 pithy sentences striving for insight. Kaur divides the book into four distinct sections, each with a distinct theme. For example, the first chapter (“the hurting”) was about her pain from sexual abuse and how that pain distorted her relationships and her ability to understand love. The second chapter (“the loving”) was opposite in tone from the first, and Kaur shared how a healthy love relationship made her feel. Throughout, Kaur has a distinct voice – raw, dripping with emotion, and candid. And where she wrote actual poems, I enjoyed her language and voice. Example: i am not a hotel room i am home i am not the whiskey you want i am the water you need don’t come here with expectations and try to make a vacation out of me My problem with this book isn’t with her poems, which I like. My problem is that the actual poems were strung together with snippets of words and phrases that often read like fortune cookies. Just a few pages before the poem I cited above, Kaur wrote “you whisper i love you what you mean is i don’t want you to leave”. And before that “more than anything i want to save you from myself”. These short little things took up their own individual pages, and I’m sorry, but they’re not poems in my book – they’re shallow, emo tweets. Look, I get that you aren’t supposed to read them as separate poems – that the snippets connect to the longer pieces as one larger work. That doesn’t make them any less shallow. Feigned significance is still feigned, whatever its connection to larger things. Maybe this is why I only read poetry books once in a blue moon....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Oct 2017,Oct 2017,"Oct 26, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/26877039-milk-and-honey

Wool tells the story of an apocalyptic future where people have lived for hundreds of years in a 144-story underground silo. Residents that rebel against the careful order of the silo get sent out, where they die due to the external atmosphere’s poisonous conditions. Shift is a prequel and lays out the events that led to the construction of the silo. Donald Keene is a newly-elected congressman who gets handpicked by a powerful senator to partake in a secret project. Keene believes the project to be a contingency in the event of a nuclear event. He learns over time that the purpose is much darker. More than just how and why the silos are built, Shift details the first several hundred years of silo life – both from the perspective of Donald Keene and from the perspective of several residents of other silos (including silo 18). As astute readers can guess, Shift leads straight into Wool, so events and silos do end up connecting. Shift does address the concern I had with Wool, which was that Wool spent way too much time hinting at how the silos came to be without revealing the hidden history; Shift is the hidden history. But one issue I had with both Shift and Wool is that they both felt long. Now I read extremely quickly and don’t mind long books; I mind books that feel long. Shift contains 101 chapters, which seems like a lot except each chapter is only a handful of pages. But by the time I got to chapter 60, I kept looking to see how much further I had to read. In contrast, Doerr’s All the Light We Cannot See is structured the same way 100+ short chapters, and yet that book flew by. Howey’s prose felt tedious in a lot of places, with whole chapters whose inclusion I questioned. (Example: why on earth spend several chapters with Jimmy finding a cat?!) The sci-fi nerd in me wants to like this more than I do. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Oct 2017,Oct 2017,"Oct 20, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17306293-shift

I’ve read two of his books and given both books five star s. I listen to his podcast. I follow him on Twitter. It begs the question whether I give his stuff favorable s because I am a fan, or because he simply deserves it. In my mind, it is squarely the latter. Keller is not the flashiest writer or the most energetic, passionate speaker – and yet his books are best sellers and he is wildly successful planting churches in possibly the toughest city in which to plant churches (NYC). And the reason is because Keller is so intelligent, thoughtful, and balanced in explaining things of and about faith. He never runs away from tough questions. And when he does answer tough questions, his responses are not pithy, canned talking points; no, his responses are thoughtful, smart, and deep. He is a thinker’s pastor. In this book, he takes on the current skeptical zeitgeist and makes the intellectual and philosophical case for faith in God, and specifically, faith in the Christian God. In the first half of the book, Keller addresses topics that skeptics raise as objections to Christianity: the exclusivity of Christianity, the problem of suffering, science and faith, the literal claims of the Bible, and how we reconcile God’s love and the concept of hell. In the second half of the book, Keller lays out the clues God has left us to find about His existence, how we come to know God, the difference between religion and the gospel, and the cross and the resurrection. Throughout, Keller uses logic and Scripture to state his case clearly and coherently. Keller is this generation’s CS Lewis, and this book is his Mere Christianity. A must-read for every believer and every non-believer.
