Crash is hired on to intern for Senator Sanders with a weekend of activities in her hometown. It’s been years, but she settles into her old home, now a B&B her mother runs, along with the town grocery store/restaurant. It’s maple syrup country in Eagle Creek, Vermont. Bernie is a connoisseur, so enjoying the scene. It’s festival time and Bernie is supposed to be a headliner in a parade and several other events. Things get out of skew when the body of the town banker is found floating in the lake. Autopsy reports show that he drowned in Maple syrup. How did he drown from Maple syrup and get in the lake? Much is at play with a big wig buying up the local maple Farms and monopolizing, another local farmer disappearing, and what of the purported Loch Ness kind of creature that the Champs festival is named after that has historically been rumored to live in the lake? As expected with Shaffer’s books, it’s a slapstick read full of innuendo and heroic scenes.

Tho I was disappointed there was little of the usual banter (and more) between Veronica and Stoker in this installment, the intrigue given nearly made up for it.

A promise of vengeance for the death of a comrade some 20 years prior.

I have always believed poetry, like art, is taken in by the beholder as their mindset most feels at that moment. It can change as we do. (For example, Hirsch snuffled at Dickinson in earlier years.)

The scene of the crime residence is the home of a soap-making family, wealthy and very gay… as is every one within, including the staff. It’s a safe place, or was. The only non is the mother of the facade wife, who is married to the son of the deceased, Irene. (Irene arranged their marriage, arranged most everything to keep them all safe, undetected.) This is the early 50’s. Being open got you shut down, quick! But in Lavender House, love blooms.Staying at the house as he sleuths through it puts him in constant danger, given the killer most likely eats at the same table as he does, or serves it. There is flirtation from the men, snark from the women and concern with intent to change him from the sole hetero. It’s fun dynamics with each as plausible the killer as the next. Even the woman who hired him, the deceased wife/widow, can’t be totally ruled out. But eliminations occur and there is a finality.

This was one of them and it was a delightful 3 hours. Jamie Grimm is wheelchair bound, attending a new school, living at a new house. (Reasons are given later, when he’s ready to talk about it.) Jamie strives to make people laugh, hoping it diverts the bullies, makes him more acceptable, changes perceptions. In the new home, being of his aunt & family, is the school bully. His own cousin is his worst enemy and relentless. But Jamie continues to joke and people begin to notice. His other uncle, (father’s brother) owns a diner where Jamie often seeks refuge. They are close, he is supportive. When a contest for funniest kid comic comes around, it’s that uncle that suggests Jamie give it a try, and that sets the stage for some genuine LOL’s, some tender moments, some solo excursions, and some sad memories.This is an enjoyable read. Heart-warming, realistic, and, of course, sad. But in the end, it shows us that laughter can truly heal when nothing else seems possible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 30, 2022","Jun 30, 2022","Jun 30, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/14781201-i-funny

We are brought into her terror aWe meet Baleigh as she succumbs to a terrifying panic attack while in college and away from her single parent mother. We are brought into her terror as she tries to maintain while waiting for her mother to arrive, 11 hours out. Descriptive and enlightening, her narrative explains so much of what happens in this abyss. After such, she returns home where she feels safe, at least at times. Baleigh is talked into a dating app by her bestie and through such, meets Tanner. Tanner soon becomes a calm in her storm. The push and pull of this relationship is something I, along with hundreds of other men and women, I’m sure, can relate to. It seems almost every conflict between them I heard myself saying “I remember.. same.” We’ve all had that wishful thinking in a new relationship, as well as the self-doubt, the worry, the bliss, and the frustrated anger. This is a very honest telling of what has to be a first true love, as nothing hurts as bad as when that one ends. The memoir focuses primarily on the three months of that pivotal affair, exposing all, (but hopefully changing names), along the Cuyahoga River in Kent, Ohio. Being self-published gives much more leeway for honesty and this book, I believe, is extremely honest.It’s a good read for one seeking more perspective into panic attacks, anxiety, and just general angst. Her thoughts during such can help understand and hopefully create better reactions to them. An eye-opener with sweet overtones. I hope she continues her journey and that the roads she travels on have lesser potholes the further she goes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 17, 2022","Apr 19, 2022","Apr 17, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59855477-at-home-with-the-weeds

Bliss!Likened to Jainism (in my mind) he beholds all as sacred, all intricately woven with our own DNA, through time, quantum physics, our back yards. A priority for diversity is also stressed, in all living creatures, great and small, as they all benefit the whole by means.Anthropomorphism (tho why it needs a term when it’s just as natural for them as us) is a chapter on its own. Cases and quotes through time and experience. I often wonder if my cat really has emotional attachment to me beyond food. But then when he runs to greet me when I return home or hides around a corner to “scare” me as I often do him, or even the times he tucked into me when scared .. emotions? Methinks so. But this chapter was difficult to read, in that it mentions the injustice done to helpless beings. I pressed the mute button, skimmed, did a Phoebe. I know it happened (happens) but I read to escape sadness. Quick chapter. There was a heavy focus on wolves: protected, protecting & even providing, and the matriarchal leadership in their packs. Actually, there is a deep bow to the feminine throughout this book. Namaste!My favorite chapter dealt with how nature heals. Being within it can alleviate so much, so quickly, I dare wonder just why there are not natural areas abutting playgrounds at schools, next to gyms, surrounding businesses instead of totally parking lots, and so forth. Imagine the peaceful existence when one could “let off steam” being quiet under a tree instead of on a bar stool tipping 2 too many? Ah.Latitudinarians. Look this up. Become.How nature recovers from catastrophic events is also an awesome chapter. Bigger and better, greater adaptation, and all but a shrug of “been there, done that” ethos. Amazing. Tho given climate change and hotter, bigger forest fires, things are not so ducky. It appears the hotter fires are sterilizing the soil, which hinders regrowth. It doesn’t prevent it, it just takes a much longer time to happen.After the tragic death of his wife in a canoeing accident, he sets off on a nature trek, ironically similar to the wolf he wrote of earlier who lost her mate. How akin we are to our cohabitators here on earth is always evident, were we to merely observe.Much shared of his many nature diving. Living in every moment, steeped in its essence. The people along the way and those back home, who saw him off. It’s a friendly journey. I’m glad I went along. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 09, 2022","Mar 19, 2022","Mar 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43999117-the-eight-master-lessons-of-nature

(Thankfully, none appeared to be dropped after such.) Hearing the muffled noise, the early arriving library director (and author) reaches in and retrieved the cold, hungry and frightened little puff ball. It immediately shows its gratitude and snuggles into her warmth. A warmth bath is suggested and the little gray kitten is found to be an orange tabby. It’s love at first sight and the little fella is dubbed Dewey, after Melville Dewey, and soon becomes a main draw to the library.It’s hard times in Spencer, a farming area fallen into the farm crisis of the early 1980’s. But it’s a community more than just a city. People band and bend together, and they strive. Over and over, they rebound bigger and better.Dewey becomes a beacon to the area. A conversation piece that flows beyond the city limits. Soon, he’s countywide, statewide, nationwide and then internationally known. Magazines, radio, tv & even documentaries take note (and lots of footage) of this gentle cat.More than a story about a lucky cat, it’s a history of place its denizens.

Duke Pendragon is a private investigator/witch hunter. He is also an on-call lackey for the Cleveland mafia don. Being called into service sets up a series of unfortunate events that put him on a quest for Excalibur. Along with Pendragon are his best friends and sidekicks, Two Dogs the shaman, Tom the troll, with additions of his vixen sister, Lana and demon sent elf, Snap. But Pendragon is not the only one seeking the sword, given that whoever can withdraw it from the stone in which it is embedded can rule the world.Many battles ensue, causing Pendragon and his cronies to constantly be looking over their shoulder for the next attack. There are some pretty funny events, as one would expect with this cast, and a little bit of blood and guts. Unfortunately, the only downfall to this read, is the main character himself. If he could lose with the detective noir dialogue, this would be so much more enjoyable. All aside, I did really, really enjoy this book and look forward the next two installments.

Painfully more that it is instrumentally via the man she loves. Tribal police officer, Pollux. Her release eventually places her in the hire of our thinly disguised author at her even thinner bookstore. It also places her in marriage to Pollux. A stoic cast of characters fill in every page, proud of their Native American heritage with unified snark and intent. Some of the early dialogue felt unreal, but that changes.In this, we have the haunting of a long customer. Flora was a wannabe who claimed a kinship, minute, but still worthy. She attaches herself primarily to Tookie. A book is given to her, no valid reason, by her daughter. It’s ancient, hand written, eerie. Upon starting one sentence, Tookie is knocked near trance. She tries to destroy the book, but it defies her methods. It is finally buried. What would have happened were she to finish that sentence? Is this why Flora is lingering? That gets shelved.We go into the onset and dealing with the pandemic…This is when Erdrich’s voice gets the tightest. She becomes a fist.. angry, frustrated, scared. Then the murder of George Floyd. There, around then, within them. They join the protests, suffer the restraints, reconvene, bandaid up and return. Previous atrocities are remembered. But they just seek peace. A chance for justice, tho willful for even an end. The way Erdrich writes emotions, metaphorical tapestries, is worth bowing to. One scene, while Minneapolis is burning rage, Pollux tries to reconcile his years as a police officer, what he witnessed, felt, endured. “Who was doing the beating? The uniforms or those inside them?” The haunting words of his grandmother, the first day he wore his home. “Watch out.” She said. “For when that uniform starts to wear you.”Then Pollux gets Covid. The rest is best left to be read, but the book will seep into you. The characters become ghosts of their own once the final chapter has ended. Tookie, in all her complexities, battles on and, I feel, wins. There were a couple LOL lines, ironically during the pandemic. (Need a mask? Create one with what you may already have.)

Often making fun of her self and talking to us as if we’re sitting with her having coffee, we are taken on her own revelation as to what has been taken away from religion and how to put it back.Pulling translations of biblical texts out for validity, one takes note of how they have been rendered to another’s own benefit. A contention I’ve had for decades! It’s a “version”!!! Written by a man!!! - but Victoria shows us how this has been skewed by greed (for power and wealth) and misogyny. She shows us the meaning of Christ, the difference between a noun and verb dogma, and where we got lost on our way to the caging of church.Every word resonated.

There is also an aside where he admits to the freezing temperatures while filming said video and how when they did the handstand at the end, his hands actually went numb. And oh what a shot that is. Kilted, you know.Giving a bit of background as to his own journey, he tells us how he began as a healing to his own pains from surgery. Wilson readily admits that he was not the best student and had been kicked out more than once for swearing when he couldn’t get a pose right.His own yoga studio, Heart Space Yoga & Bodyworks, in Dundee, holds special for people with disabilities, but not exclusively to. Sectioned off into sequences, we start with Connection onto to Sanctuary Meditation, Serenity, Sensory Meditation, Strength, Breathing Meditation, Power, and Walking Meditation.

It’s very easy to follow, once you quit looking at the pictures, snicker snicker, and the poses shown are very easy to do, as he has primarily focused on beginners or those with a hindrance.

When they both die, while she is only in her early teens, she is taken in by an even more unenvolved uncle. But there is salvation! Summers are spent with relatives living remotely on their farm, working the land and keeping the “old ways” alive. Here is where her Celtic Wisdom is instilled (tho not so much to us) by the townspeople and fellow farmers. Schooling sparks a scientific interest that leads to a college education in biochemistry. Loving the earth and all its offerings, she becomes an eco-warrior, of sorts, and uses her credentials and status to fight for the forests, waterways and inhabitants. Lots of bravo events and one can’t help but admire her dedication. Still, I yearned for some shared Druidic lore.

Ghosts send messages and try to warn, guide and leave our cast of characters who come together at the inheritance of the Abigael Inn by Ben, brought forth by the death of his aunt Clara, whom he had no prior knowledge of.

Sent off to academy, our Flavia fledges through, trying to follow the rules of “no questions” and “trust no one” while also looking into a series of vanished students and staff. Not knowing who she can ask for help, she tackles it mostly on her own. The characters in this book are mostly insignificant, as they don’t last, and it makes for a shallow read. The big reveal seemed rushed and disjointed. As whole, just not the best in this series.

Living with her widowed father and torturous older sisters, she is much alone and the better for it. A family of lost fortune, they retain two servants, who are her only comrades, albeit slightly. Is this edition, she solves several deaths, both new and old, and attempts. A gypsy, traveling through, is center most, but barely plays a part. (Of which was disappointing!)

There is always a prank and retribution at play between her and her two older sisters. A quite mean and possibly dangerous going that is not really given reason.

They wound up buying a Connecticut house where they had carte blanche on what, where and when she did with the yard. She later even opened up her own garden store with a friend. I loved her concept of a perennial border not being a garden any more than a couch is a room. Yes! Her interior design background took front and center in regards to how she designed her own yard and subsequent gardens therein.Dressing the bones - what a fabulous analogy - she likens to runway models. Plant around the obvious with surprises.. There is near step by step to designing the garden, from the house on out, encompassing the neighbors as well as the neighborhood as a whole. (Some thing I refuse to do, more I set an example of what might be if they would only give up the ugliness of plain old grass.)There are plenty of nods given to other gardeners and Gardens, both historically and of today.Tips on designing garden rooms from the “ceiling” and walls down to the ground, including all the tchotchkes to whimsy it up a bit. The laying out of plans, be it by string, hose, flour, to mocking it up with pipe cleaners and cardboard. I also like her idea of using photos with tissue paper over to draw ideas on.Select histories on certain gardens and styles are noted as well as photos from various Gardens she has visited internationally. In fact nearly every other page is a full color photo of a garden or a section there of.Paragraphs on walls, fences, gates, terraces, decks, steps, and walkways as well as every other aspect involved in creating a fabulous garden. Garden rooms and special selections, as in the kitchen garden, (of which her own is super fabulous), are well thought out and explained. Bringing up the end is of course the maintenance of your gorgeous creation and a few winter shots to show how even when the green is gone there is still beauty.A list of US gardens, a plant list that is sectioned off as to use and where best suited and why, container planting schemes, further books suggestions and endnotes close this up as a start to finish, VERY informed and visually appealing book to add to your gardening collection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 09, 2021","Feb 11, 2021","Feb 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58938.On_Garden_Style

A section called Storyville, where mansions and shacks house the “sporting girls” that cater to all walks of life, given the right house. The sweltered living exudes with each word as we walk the streets with Creole PI Valentin St. Cyr as he follows the trail of one dead prostitute after another, trying to catch the scurve procuring them, each laid to rest with a single black rose within their reach. St. Cyr is respected in the darkness, barely tolerated by the badge and a comrade in the lively jaunts that flavor the core of New Orleans. An ex copper himself, he knows what needs to be known and what shouldn’t be. The initial Kerouacian style aside, once past it, this gets to some serious writing. The characters are given life and you easily visualize each, as well as their settings. This is gritty New Orleans, and we’re in the grittiest of it. As the killings continue, St. Cyr continues his way to find them, even down to voodoo enclaves, picking every tidbit apart until it’s either toss or keep. But what of the derby-toting shadow? The secret-holding cop? The priest with a confession to expel before he expires? What of King Bolden and his tranced-out horn playing? The girls talk. They see, they listen, they choose who hears. There are not a lot of hints thrown out, so you are as much on the case as St. Cyr, realizing as he does. There are many surprises, the biggest being the killer, but all are plausible and fit well in this full-bodied story. This book has been on my TBR pile for 18 years.

It’s a heavy cast of characters, each standing on their own, yet connecting. Here, Lucy Barton is the Kevin Bacon common denominator. (Read I Am Lucy Barton either before or after, but read it!)

The calling was powerful, a storm of emotions, and they wonder in astonishment at this union. All 3 having left their familial home, in stages, in hurried escapes. The last, sealing the darkness they endured forever behind them. But is it?Forming their own suffragette union, dubbed The Sisters of Avalon, they seek to be allowed their ancient ways.

(Dan Brown does not hold an exclusive!) Each sister has their trauma, their saving, their revenge. Aiding and abetting are more of their ilk, crossing barriers, creating bonds. Politics be damned! (And what an analogy this timely book makes!) It’s a rather modern story, tho it’s set in the late 1800’s. A fight for many equalities, many acceptances, many lives.

Not in the ghost sense, but in guilt and what he did to her to cause his own demise. But he’s not the only dead body she had to deal with. As Raven tries to be normal, aside from the physical and emotional damage done to her by her now deceased husband, it seems her immediate world has other plans. How is it she is a denominator in the deaths that seem to fall around her? One detective is determined to solve that mystery. (But he’ll have a helluva time cracking the missing husband, as Raven made sure that body will never be found.) Tho the husband is the only one she can be blamed for, the cop certainly tries for the next 2. Given Raven was the last to see them alive or had some involvement, why wouldn’t he consider her a suspect? With her two besties, a brother sister combo, Isaac and Lydia, and her service dog, Millie, she sets out to clear herself, find the culprit, and save who appears to be another victim in the making. Placing herself in harms way is almost her penance as she grapples with what she did and how to keep it an unknown aspect to her existence.Aside from the over zealous attempts to be witty, numerous contradictions, lack of segues, assumptions that the reader knew what had happened previously and annoying knock-off of Count Olaf (Raven’s boss, Kelsey) there were some redeeming elements. Lydia actually was a refreshing southern hoot and Millie is a silent star. The ending was suspensefully written and there were a few other glimmers of good writing spread out within. I assume the first book, “Reclaiming Raven” tells you why her husband shot her and how she managed to kill him having the use of only 1/2 her body due to the shooting. Perhaps a brief prologue could clear that up? And I think Raven needs to see a gastroenterologist if her stomach really bothers her that much. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 16, 2020","Sep 18, 2020","Sep 18, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55268036-cotton-candy-killer

Amputated limbs are being found in local parks, all containing their recently implanted hardware of hips and knees. Why just these parts? Why with the implants still inside?Dr Ben Oris is on the surgical team that supplied the intended relief. He’s the new member to an established select and cloistered group, hand-picked by the head surgeon. He’s also the only one who had not been on a fateful humanitarian plane trip that crashed, leaving the team with PTSD that could factor into the growing number of related murders.Of course, given all the found limbs are from recent surgeries he was involved in, he inevitably becomes suspect.

A creative take on The Wild Swans by Hans Christian Anderson, which I can not compare, having never read it in its original version. Perhaps I should.Laura is a young teen, living in NYC with her old country Italian grandparents after the wartime death of her father, then the accidental of her older brother, then the subsequent breakdown of her mother. Laura is a saucy young thing that was just expelled from school after a bevy of reasons, none of which really her fault. Threats of a convent in Montreal have been laid at her feet, along with a suitcase to take her there. It is near Christmas and her grandparents are preparing an elaborate feast, hoping to persuade Nonna’s sister’s new rich hubby to invest in their faltering high-end grocery store. House repairs at the last minute aren’t enough to contend with, when the addition of a swan-boy crashes into Laura’s attic bedroom ceiling late at night. It has to be from the fairytale she read to the grade school children on her final day. She knows his story, but not why he’s in hers. What ever is she to do?Hiding him in her bedroom, which no one has the strength to trudge up to but her, seems her only choice. She has to figure out how to get him back out and flying away. Mishap after another occur, a somewhat bonding, and a lot of blame being put upon the cat.Life goes on around the two during his short stay, frantic and covert. With the help of two unlikely and unaware competents, they devise the means to return swan-boy to wherever it was he came from. There’s a lot of Italian being conversed, so you may pick up a phrase or two, at least in writing. The old couple are endearing in their devotion to each other and love for Laura. Their hired culinary worker is also a welcome snarky addition to the cast.Other than a few choice words, this could easily be a children’s story again, and that should be no problem substituting. Looking forward to Macguire’s next take. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 11, 2020","Aug 16, 2020","Aug 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50358057-a-wild-winter-swan

Found the paragraphs expounding Gertrude Jekyll quite fascinating. Her intense senses (differentiating the sounds of trees from species to species.)

Working as a psychiatrist, she, along with husband and 3 children, plunge into herbs, vegetables and the bounty of uses for them all.We head into the head.. a garden of its own, if you will. Where blooms flourish, then die, like experiences to memories. Nods to great thinkers in both her fields, as well as homage to Wordsworth’s poetic analysis. Noting the gardens and toilers along the way, how it went from chores of slavery to a (somewhat) gentle therapy when the Benedictines began their therapeutic horticultural realms.There is a lot of mind being explored with the soil. Both are heavily into her forte. Garden therapy is explained, examples and cases given, results in psyche and body noted. It’s in-depth.When comparing early childhood development, as in the acceptance of failure, to that of growing plants from seed, she points out “hubris may be a weed that is not so commonly encountered in the mind of the gardener.”Juxtaposing school and prison horticultural programs with their innumerable benefits to all involved. Talking to some partaking, their pride in being responsible for food, life, beauty. We are taken into several therapeutic gardens, usually adjacent to a hospital. Churches are also known to occasionally have them nearby. (I visited an amazing garden in Phoenix intended for serenity.)That nature is so heavily ingrained in our psyche.. (even genetic make-up?) should not be a revelation. We’ve only been void of its constant for 6 generations. Cities of such density are relatively new to our species. We are slowly evolving (tho more so devolving) from living off the land to driving hours just to find it. Sigh! Loved chapter 6 / Roots. More nature than mind in-depth. Fascinating bit on Limpets. Loved that now ingrained knowledge. As also with prior chapter...I was agog.. how could I, a Master Gardener, been void of the knowing that a coconut is actually a seed?? The seed-planting Fijian ant is incredible!Numerous references to famed mind healers and their connections to gardening, of course. Was pleased to see it’s been do prevalent.In chapter 9 (War And Gardening) we are told of the abundant practice of foxhole gardens. Soldiers maintained their patches of food and beauty, a semblance of normalcy, as war raged about them. So sadly beautiful. Her own grandfather was a POW and she shares a bit of his story and recovery. One of the best take-aways from the book was learning of the Todmorden “Incredible Edibles” movement, whereas townies grow site specific vegetables, herbs, fruits and such where they may most be needed / appreciated, for anyone to take. What a fabulous concept! I have a Little Free Library, and think next year, I’ll plant my devil strip with a little free garden. Hmm.A well researched, heavily quoted, and bountifully resourced book with the later dutifully noted at the end. Interesting how many well-known people in other fields were also such avid gardeners. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jul 23, 2020",Aug 2020,"Jul 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42201448-the-well-gardened-mind

But they can’t all be the apple of his eye, can they? Taking turns to state their case for hierarchy, denoting their vital contribution, land begins, feeling that being first, it should be lived most. Rain, sun, flora and fauna, even children. God was not happy with the bickering and informs them all that while each has their own important reason for being there, it’s the symbiotic connection that gives his garden its glory. Woke, they see how they matter, to God, the garden, themselves. A peaceful calm settles in. As with any garden, serenity can be found by merely inhabiting it. (MY favorite part.) Brightly illustrated with fun characters, it can teach children that all God’s creations, big and small, elemental and physical, are vital to the existence of the next.Noted at the end is Midrash, a rabbinic form of storytelling, for which this book is intended to convey. The story untold, but obvious.
