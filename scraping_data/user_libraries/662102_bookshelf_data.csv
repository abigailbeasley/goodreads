Like so many adolescent girls, she lies to her parents; steals cigarettes; coerces her friends into illicit activiMathilda Savitch wants to be awful. Like so many adolescent girls, she lies to her parents; steals cigarettes; coerces her friends into illicit activity; riffles through her sibling’s belongings; and ponders that great teenaged imponderable: sex. 	What casts her desire to be bad in more uncertain light, however, is the calamity that has produced it: the violent death, a year prior to the novel’s opening, of her older sister, Helene. Emotionally stranded by her parents—torpor-consumed in the wake of Helene’s death—Mathilda’s urgent need to be rescued from her “island of grief” fuels her misdeeds. About the island she wonders, “how large it is and how long it will take me to explore it [and:] how long I’ve been here without even knowing it.” Mathilda Savitch, playwright Victor Lodato’s debut novel, is the log of that exploration, narrated by its namesake in an attempt to navigate and then chart the territory of loss.	Since September 11th, the novel-of-loss-as-experienced-by-precocious-child-narrator has come into particular vogue, from Nicole Krauss’s The History of Love to Jonathan Safran Foer’s Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (which deals explicitly with the World Trade Center attacks) to Marissa Peshl’s blockbuster Special Topics in Calamity Physics. These novels offer the possibility that the unsullied, slightly skewed vision of an innocent will recalibrate the vision of the adult reader—rendering incomprehensibly painful events less painful and more bittersweet via the transformative power of the child’s love and (loss of) innocence. These novels owe almost everything, of course, to Catcher in the Rye, from its originating plot mechanism—it is the death of his little brother, Allie, that is Holden’s undoing—to its supremely voice-driven narrative. And Mathilda Savitch fits neatly into the tradition. 	Lodato has a particular gift for voice. As a dramatist (he’s received both a Guggenheim fellowship and NEA funding for his theater work, among other accolades and awards) this should be his métier—dialogue is the sine qua non of theater. And from moment one, Mathilda’s hungry voice, its rhythm and its logic, is the vital, animating force powering the book. “I want to be awful. I want to do awful things and why not?” she announces, and the reader can’t help but follow along. Whether or not a given reader will find much of thirteen-year-old Mathilda’s insights plausible seems a matter of taste; Lodato indulges with little restraint in observations and ruminations on Mathilda’s behalf—“I wondered why God would open a door only to show you emptiness”—that some may find overly precious, which others will undoubtedly delight in. (Kids do say the darndest things.)	While Mathilda’s ruminations on such diverse subjects as the nature of infinity, why people become terrorists, and the shape and texture of adult desire may grow tiresome, the real difficulty for the novel is not what Mathilda gives voice to but how controlling that voice is, and how little control Lodato has over it. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal about Mathilda, Lodato said that “for a long time I felt more like a secretary than a writer, I just let her babble and I wrote everything down that I heard.” Taking dictation from a character is one way for a writer way to enter a story, and one can see how that would be an especially useful method for a playwright. But Lodato, in writing a novel, is bereft of some of the theater’s other gifts: direction and staging; his infatuation with Mathilda’s voice has allowed it to subsume the other essential fictive elements that constitute a whole work.	The novel makes explicit that its events occur in a post-September 11th world, perhaps a very near future. “In our history book, there’s a picture of the burning towers. I was only a kid when it happened, but they don’t let you forget stuff like that,” Mathilda tells us. But beyond that, the novel’s setting is willfully nebulous and vague, both chronologically and geographically. Instead of universalizing the story, or lending it a timelessness that allows it to escape an expiration date, this vagueness flattens the novel, removes it a from a universe in which we might invest ourselves, without providing a compelling substitute. Lodato has lavished so much attention on Mathilda’s voice that he has forgotten the reader’s need to partake in some sensory experience of the novel—something the set would accomplish in a theater production. In Mathilda Savitch there is little to see, to taste, to hear. 	This troubling flatness is pervasive in the action as well. The events at hand suffer from a quality of lazy melodrama: Helene meets her death under the wheels of a train; whether she’s been pushed or has killed herself is the novel’s central mystery, the solution to which is embarrassingly prosaic, especially given the overt quirkiness the book relishes in its narrator. The flabbiness of the action and the paucity of texture in the novel make the inclusion of a terrorism motif seem especially cheap. Conveniently for the story, a generalized terrorist attack takes place on the first anniversary of Helene’s death. The novel’s gesture toward a parallel between the two incidents of violence, its half-hearted attempt to comment on the intersection of the historical and the personal (or the political and the personal) is not only easy, but half-baked.	If grief and loss are an island, as Mathilda suggests, then it’s not a desert island, uncharted and undiscovered. If anything, it’s more like an Australia—an enormous continent of an island, its perimeter fairly mapped and populated, but its stark interior less easily inhabited or articulated, so expansive that new and updated information is always welcome. Mathilda Savitch, deprived of too many of the working parts that such an undertaking requires, can provide only a rough accounting of the journey....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Sep 2009,"Oct 06, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6417409-mathilda-savitch

Revisionism distorts history; is dangerous ethically, morally, and politicallWhat's so wrong with being a revisionist?Wait (hand up)--I know, I know. Revisionism distorts history; is dangerous ethically, morally, and politically; weakens the structure of the testimonial; subjects fact to well... subjectivity; allows for hateful liars to spread self-replicating viruses of misinformation, seeding them in our culture, spores polluting the transmission of that which we must not forget. Serious business.But... on the small scale? Aren't we all revisionists? At least when it comes to constructing narratives for ourselves about our lives? Put another way: doesn't memory make revisionists of us all?There is the fact that I was born in Los Angeles. There is the fact that I'm Jewish. But these facts are animated by my relationship to them, my interpretation of what they might mean. I didn't grow up in the same Los Angeles as my neighbor, nor do I conceive of my cultural inheritance the same way as say, the other 30 kids in the Valley Beth Shalom confirmation class of 1994, did or do.But, here's the thing: I don't think about these same things the same way I did ten years ago or will ten years from now. If I write about them, I write by artifice and construction, by organization, and by interpretation, and I write and I write and I write, then I revise, until I feel some representational semblance has been reached, until there seems to be some congruency between experience and telling, as I see it. Then I abandon ship.Because there's no end to the story. Memory will continue its revisions.Memory will continue to animate the subject, such that the memory of a thing is part of the relationship to that thing, so that the thing and the memory of the thing, say a love affair, are just one thing. So that say, a novel about a love affair is part of the story of that love affair, so that the end of the story of the love affair becomes a matter of the arbitrary end of the novel, which is part of the story, which is a reconstruction of memory, which is a construction itself, anyway.And I guess I really loved Lydia Davis's The End of the Story.I've heard the book called ""chilly"" or ""clinical"" or even exasperating, but I think these judgments stem from a misreading of the book's project, or a desire for the book to be invested in something other than it is. The book seems to be about a love affair, but it isn't. The book is about writing, and about the operations of memory, about permutations. Davis willfully refuses to engage in the emotional voyeurism that grounds so many other novels that take love as their subject. The tone of the novel is one of reportage: she excises the recreation of emotion in favor of an accounting or an inventory of emotions, so that she has an index from which to chart her revisions of her experience. Her obsession manifests itself in these revisions; it is the obsession of a writer.Okay, yes, the book is cool to the touch; it's disingenuous of me to imply that I found the ""judgments"" I referred to above to be somehow wrong or innacurate--the prevailing sense one has while reading it is of breezes moving through half-lit California coastal winters, of vistas cut short by hills and canyons, of lots of time spent alone in a poorly-lit room--but I suppose what I feel is that they're incorrect as judgments that indicate some sort of failure on the book's part. Because it is exactly the book's singular detachment that allows for it to be so naked. Davis's reporting of her narrator's evasions, revisions, and retrenchments are so precise, so scalpular, so bang-on, that I couldn't help but recognize them. Too often, the book cut close to home, much to my discomfort as a reader. The almost complete lack of heightened emotion laid bare all the fiction in fiction-making, and memory, and writing.I get why the book isn't to everyone's taste, but I would so take down anyone who tries to dismiss it for all those currently acceptable/fashionable reasons to dismiss a piece of literature--it's ""post-modern"" or ""pretentious"" or too ""meta"" (gag) or too ""self-aware"" (reasons that, by the way, are almost always more about a reader's insecurity than about a book, and that are anti-intellectual, conservative, and lazy, to boot). Last time I checked, it wasn't criminal for a book to ask a reader to, you know, do a little work. The End of the Story is a book that asks a lot of its reader--but the work it asks us to do is worthy; it asks us to re-see, see again, see anew how and why we tell stories, how we remember; it crosses the boundaries of passive entertainment/""meaningful"" literature about ""important"" themes to occupy a stranger, less mappable terrain; it stakes out an altogether weirder territory, one where a book or novel is always already unfinished, always already revised....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Mar 2009,"Mar 06, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/113861.The_End_of_the_Story

But our relationship to him as an unreliable narrator is a strange one, an inverted one. I think that it's fairly clear to the reader early on that Banks's memories and perceptions do not align with those of the people with whom he surrounds himself and/or encounters. His school chums and his one-time guardian recount for him their memories of his child self as a lonely, melancholy boy, which contravene his insistent accounting of himself as a sociable, friendly, put-on-a-brave-face type of lad. His insistence, which seems to verge on a quiet, private hysteria, his disproportionate insult, and the confluence of multiple others' POV point us to the fact that the schism between how he sees himself and how the world sees/saw him is not just a matter of opinion. The novel shows us, time and again, that Christopher is unwilling, unable, to reconcile not only his memory but his ongoing lived experience (see the scene at the wedding where he is apparently subjugated to teasing and humiliation, but insists that said teasers are his friends, etc., and note that we never get to see the actual scene) to the lived experience and memory of others. (We also never get to see him work, to uncover anything, to solve anything.)Here's where I'm sort of getting to my (excruciatingly long-winded) point...When We Were Orphans tells us, its readers, that it is a mystery novel. The book offers us one story, the disappearance of Christopher's parents, claiming that this story is its central mystery and suggesting, by form and structure, that this will be the riddle we puzzle out as we read, alongside Christopher. Thus, we enter into a sort of contract with the book in which we agree to be careful, astute readers, who by dint of our diligence and hard work will be treated to the satisfaction of resolution.All along, however, there is a secondary mystery that is actually the primary mystery, and that mystery is twofold: one, when will Christopher realize how deeply, irreparably damaged his perception of the world is, and two, WE THINK when we will learn the truth that his distorted vision has necessarily been hiding from us, despite our best efforts to see through it? Usually, in a novel that relies on an unreliable narrator (ignore the inherent contradiction), part of the reader's pleasure is untangling the skeins of the narrator's logic in order to arrive at some approximation of truth. But Orphans rejects that second possibility completely. (I am in no way suggesting that this novel's project is one of relativism, in which we're meant to see that there is no objective truth, or if there is, we cannot access it.) All along the mystery/mysteries is/are just a diversion, a smokescreen, a trick (that I admire deeply and totally respect) that leads us in a circle back to what we see, finally, is an absent center. There is no mystery in the book. The truth isn't the point. There is only the fact of Christopher's mutilating orphaning, his abandonment. His grievous misapprehension of his parents' abduction/leave-taking, the emotional/psychological violence of it,and his child's need to make sense and order of the insensible strand him in mental time; he is marooned in a make-believe world in which detectives are great heroes and even celebrities, a la Sherlock Holmes--a world that history tells us did not exist as such, especially in twentieth century Britain.When Sarah offers Christopher the chance to reject his false understanding of the world, to ""see clearly,"" and to reject a vision of himself (one that is manufactured by an innocent egotism/narcissism that has sustained him all along) in which he is the savior not only of his parents, but also of an entire city and perhaps nation, he is, finally, unable to do so. To give that up would be to negate himself, to reject his very identity. He would be twice-orphaned.There's a lot going on here vis a vis the orphaning, of course--colonialism and imperialism, the patronizing""helping"" of the east by the west, sexual politics and power, issues of class, et al. But as I read I felt more compelled by what's ""missing"" in this novel than what's there.I'll confess to being somewhat befuddled by and disappointed in the final revelation concerning Christopher's mother, and unsure about the necessity of Jennifer. My only thought about Jennifer's utility (and despite its coldness, that word seems apt) is that perhaps she's meant to enact the cycle of violence that ""orphaning"" perpetuates... she is orphaned twice over, and the novel's end suggests how devastating this has been for her.When I finished the book I found myself returning to its title, over and then over again. First person narratives usually require, despite old Bobby D.'s admonition, a looking back. They are necessarily retrospective. My mind lingers on the titular ""When."" Despite how sad the book is, despite its ambiguous ending, the title left me feeling hopeful for Christopher in that it seems to suggest that the time of his orphaning, of Jennifer's, and even of Sarah's (sigh), is past, is gone and that, no longer orphans, having chosen to look forward, to abandon their isolation and to rely on each other, on other people they might, oh they just might... be happy....more",Notes are private!,1,203,1,not set,"Feb 03, 2009","Jan 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/136763.When_We_Were_Orphans

The book suggests to me that Simmons thought that using a novelist (Wilkie Collins) for a narrator afforded him (Simmons) the luxury of writing about Dickens's work in the style of a literary critic--wrong!--and at that, one working in the 20th century--double wrong! The passage on identity and doubling made me cringe it was so anachronistic in its language and use of theoretical concepts.There are too many poor choices in this book to account for all of them. I really don't understand how the same writer can produce exquisite sci-fi like Hyperion, pretty good historical fiction/horror like The Terror, self-important trash like Carrion Comfort, and then utterly mediocre, structurally unsound work like this. My best guess is that somehow this is an issue of productivity; Simmons pushes out a lot of material, and I suppose much of it is bound to be not-so-great as a result....more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,not set,Feb 2009,"Jan 13, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3222979-drood

I started thinking about why I post s on Goodreads, and what compels me to say such nasty things that I would never, never say in a workshop or to a writer's face. I feel ashamed of myself. In my lame attempt to amuse my friends I've acted like a total lout who feels free to bully people she's never met via the ol' interwebs, but who would be too much of a coward to swing her fists in real life. I mean, I hate Dale Peck! I think hatchet jobs are lame. Yes, I don't think L.A. Rex is the greatest book ever. Yes, I think my issues with it are legitimate ones. But Will Beall has done something I haven't: he's written a novel. And not a bad one, if that matters. Even books I've hated, like  The Thirteenth Tale, are the product of hours, weeks, months, even years of work on the part of someone who does something/did something that I believe wholly, without reservation, betters us as people and makes life worth living: they made art. So, I'm going to finish this thing, and leave what I've written, but with props to the writers who do what I haven't done, and much respect to the fact that no matter how bad, how cheesy, or how irretrievably shitty I find a book, some person out there will disagree with me.So here it is:I am extremely susceptible to blurbs. This may be, in part, a result of my old-school ""smart kid"" training that dictates an almost automatic (and almost always misguided) respect for the ""expert"" opinion. That unfortunate tendency, combined with two other factors--my bottomless love for all things Los Angeles, and my (related) passion for James Ellroy's novels--(mis)led me to have extremely high expectations for this novel, the moment I espied it on my mother's to-read shelf. I mean her ACTUAL, REAL, PHYSICAL to-read shelf in the back office of my childhood home. An awfully long teaching semester, several weeks of inexcusable gluttony, and multiple travels between the frigid Midwest, snowbound Northwest, and soporifically sunny Southland has dulled my never too-sharp wits, so I'll just proceed with the WHY of my discontent vis a vis old L.A. Rex (also, what the hell does that title really mean? It sounds cool, I'll give you that). As a matter of fact, I think that'll be my M.O. from now on: no plot synopses. I hate plot synopses. Plus, there is already a plot synopsis available of almost any book you'd want to read. It's called Amazon, my friends. Why must every other """" on Goodreads (my own very much included) be reducible to a highfalutin plot synopsis? Aargh.Point 1: PSYCHIC DISTANCE. Will Beall either does not know how to control the psychic distance of his narrator from his narrative's events or chooses not to do so in an ill-informed attempt to underscore the psychological/thematic drama of the novel. The book veers without much rhyme or reason between a fairly rigid, traditional omniscient third person in which we have the same level of access to each character's interiority and experience to a very, very, very close third person in which we are right up in Ben's head, experiencing the action from his perspective, as if we were reading a first person narrative. These shifts occur from line to line--sloppy. The effect of these lapses in psychic distance is one of dislocation and disorientation often just when the reader needs to be most grounded in the action.Point 2: GRITTY REALISM VS. OVER THE TOP FABULISM. Dear reader, it is my contention that you cannot have your cake and eat it, too. Yes, that old homily makes no sense. Yes, I know that it most likely has its origins in some esoteric practice that makes perfect sense to say, a denizen of 17th century London. Yes, I am too lazy to perform a Google search on said axiom in order to suss out its etymology. Yes, I am probably exaggerating myself, as well as abusing the English language in my deployment of the term ""fabulism"" (this is not a novel of magical realism, after all, is it? OR is it?). My point is (should I ever reach it in my unquenchable thirst for tangential discourse): this novel is hailed over and over (in said blurbs) as ""authentic,"" ""gritty,"" and ""real."" I'm not sure how any fiction can be REAL, as a matter of metaphysics, but let's dispense with that concern for the moment. Basically, we're supposed to slaver all over Will Beall's spit-shined LAPD-issued jack boots because he is an actual, real-life cop (OMG!!!) who you know, was also an English Major (Double OMG!!!), and so his portrait of life in South Los Angeles, nee South Central, must be a faithful, down and dirty, no holds barred representation of life in the 'hood. You know, one that includes sword fights, blood thirsty pet jaguars, doves (I think there were doves), helicopters felled by shoulder-launched rockets, officers being eaten alive by ravenous pit-bulls, etc. I don't really have any problems with these scenes, many of which are hilarious, except for their juxtaposition with the scenes of grave realism. I guess my feeling is that in order to fully suspend one's disbelief as a reader, you sort of enter into a contract with a book, where the book agrees to sustain an internal logic particular to its universe, no matter how haywire that universe may be. This book has no such contract. The problem, and its result(s), are actually quite similar in effect to the issues with psychic distance.Point 3 (a tricky one): RACE AND RACIAL POLITICS. This is in no way an ad hominem attack. I don't care if Will Beall is the whitest, WASPist, richest motherfucker in the land (not that he is) I would still feel that he's entitled to write about whatever he wants. My problems with the way race works in this book aren't due to my concern (that I don't posses) that somehow this author shouldn't be writing about it, or that his vision is somehow compromised by his (possible)lack of melanin or Semitic genetics. The thing is, all along, this book made me uncomfortable. NOT by depicting harsh truths that my bourgeois ass can't handle, not by implicating ALL readers in the system and infrastructure of economics, justice, and education that affords certain segments of our society opportunities that it withholds from other segments, but by its... apologist tone, for lack of a more precise explanation. The book's four main characters are a black gangster/hip hop mogul, a Mexican (American) cop, the kike-iest lawyer ever, and his half-breed Jewish son (mom was a shiksa starlet). Not one of them rang my ""truth"" bell. This is utterly subjective. But somehow, the writing surrounding these men felt so... condescending. Each dude is a class-A dickhead in some way (you know, murderin', pimpin', cheatin', torturin', stealin'), but each one is also a broken-hearted little boy who just needs a little love to redeem him. Yuck. I couldn't help but compare (unfavorably) this book's central dudes to the characters in The Wire, who come alive on screen in all their complex glory, and whom the writers clearly love as people. Here, I just felt that Beall treated his characters like message boards, directing and manipulating the reader to ""understand""/pity them in a way that struck me as incredibly demeaning. And underneath that all, coursing through the novel's seemingingly even distribution of blame for the fucked up world that comprises its diegesis, was a faint but discernible, and undeniable, second level of condescension, aimed at the left and its efforts re social justice, police accountability, human rights, etc. The secret message of the book seemed to be (despite the novel's abundance of crooked cops) that poor people (usually of color) extort the police for money by using the media and crafty (Jewish) lawyers with questionable ethics to twist incidents of police (non)brutality into crimes of race bias, when really, the police are white knights who do what needs to be done in order to really help people. I'm not anti-police, nor have I ever called a cop a ""pig"", and I kind of think people who do are stupid, but COME ON. Is Will Beall fucking kidding? The book takes place in '98, just six years after the riots, in the post-Darryl Gates LAPD--I couldn't help but feel, at times, that the book was lamenting the earlier, bygone era.I guess Scott Rudin acquired the rights to the book. He's produced some incredible and wonderful movies (The Queen, No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, Wonder Boys) and has a bunch of A-list films coming up or in the can, so I'll be curious to see the movie. At times, the novel read like a script for an action film. I just wonder how they'll handle (if they will) the politics......more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Dec 2008,"Jan 05, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/863148.L_A_Rex

My feeling about said phenomenon is that it stemmed from an overly plot-focused/multiple narrative strands and voices beginning, and as a reader, I was expecting these plot points and narrative strands to speed up and come together in a more dramatic way. I'm not sure why I stopped caring about or needing that to happen. But let me try to unravel it a bit...See, the aspect that I like best about this novel is exactly what I think derailed me at first. That is, its required suspension of disbelief, or put another way, its more ""conceptual"" or ""speculative"" elements. Confused thinking alert! Sorry. More clearly: Doug Dorst takes a big risk here by treating the ghost story in the novel with a very matter of fact pen. At first, I wanted to know more about its component parts--what exactly ""Root"" is, if all cemeteries in the book's diegesis, so to speak, are like the ones in Colma, why certain people reappear as their younger selves while others are fixed as their selves at the moment of death, why Mike is able to see these ghosts, and so forth. I think I had my serious sci-fi glasses on. I took them off. I had to come to terms with the book AIN is, not the book I thought it should be or expected it to be.Fuck it, I thought, Doug Dorst isn't preoccupied with these details, why should I be? And I fully believe that his casual touch with the Colma ghost world is far more effective than any attempts to explain its operations would have been. I mean, there aren't any explanations to strain our credulity, right? The narrator feels solid, grounded, like an accurate and trustworthy observer, so there's no reason not to trust, to not just... go with it.And the funny thing? This trustworthiness? The one that enables me to accept Colma's society of the no-longer-with-us? It stems from Dorst's unerring, humane characterizations, his psychological realism that is so bang-on it's a bit startling. I mean, Mike treats Fiona abhorrently, but as a reader (and a sometime asshole)--despite my empathy for Fiona--I felt sympathy for Mike, because his bullshit thought process, as sketched by Dorst, is so, so, perfectly on the mark. True, I might be a little biased by the whole David Brooks Odyssey years thing that seems to be afflicting Mike (as a one month away from thirty club member myself), but I am, I was, struck by Dorst's agility at lighting the shadier realms of his characters' interior landscapes.In some ways, this novel reminded me of the frankly unreadable  Beautiful Children in both its mood and some of its techniques: the slight air of detachment, the shifting narrative perspectives, the tribes of disaffected teenagers, but  Alive in Necropolis succeeds where BC fails, because it has a core of real human longing and not just an absent center. AIN isn't a showy novel, despite its premise, but it is totally solid and full and good--like, morally, for real--even when some of its more flighty and ephemeral subjects are not....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Aug 2008,"Aug 02, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2439336.Alive_in_Necropolis

My sister is eight years older than myself, and was frequently out of the house, and both my parents worked long hours. During the summers, however, I would go to San Diego and live with my grandparents. I had a best friend there, also a reader, also kind of a lonely kid, and together we shared and traded books over the course of at least 14 summers. One of the many wonderful books that she instructed me to read was this one, which I still remember after all these years. I think I was about ten when I read the first novel in the series,  The President's Daughter, which I checked out from the San Diego Public Library down the street from my Bobe and Zade's house. The book struck such a huge chord with my little pre-adolescent heart. I identified with Meg completely: she was smart, prone to sassiness, often lonely, and she had a powerful, successful mother whom she loved and admired, but about whom she had complicated feelings. My own mother was (is) a righteous bad-ass of an attorney, of whom I was extremely proud, but also resented and would have liked to have seen more of. Furthermore, I was completely enchanted by the novel's premise: Meg's mother becomes the first female president of the United States. I remember feeling thrilled by this, but also thinking it was an obvious fantasy(!)--this was in 1987 or 1988. I wish my ten year old self could have seen just twenty years into the future.I gobbled up the following novel,  White House Autumn, and then finally, this one, for which I was totally unprepared. Where the first two novels were authentic, non-condescending portraits of a complicated young woman struggling to adjust to a bizarre new life, the third novel went to a really dark place. It may sound soap-opera-esque or melodramatic, but in Long Live the Queen, Meg is abducted. I've never forgotten the eerie, disturbing characterization of her captor, whose terrifying ego and sociopathic charm threatened my sleep. But worse, or more terrifying, than that was Meg's escape. If I remember correctly, she broke her own fingers with a large rock in order to extricate her hand from its cuff. The rest of the (incredibly sad) novel was about Meg readjusting to life post-trauma. I think that a large part of this novel's pull for me was the way that, similarly to the horror movies with which I was obsessed, it distracted me from the more more prosaic but equally unhappy-making terrors hovering on the perimeters of my own life, which were mostly adult, and therefore not fully understood, but fully felt nonetheless, by me. It's strange how this one small novel, not a classic in any cannon of childhood literature, recalls so much for me, so quickly: my summers in San Diego, my long lost friend Jessica Koziol, my first awakenings of a political sensibility, the taste of the Rainbow Sherbet from the Thrifty's next door to the library (25 cents a scoop!), the smell of the Eucalyptus trees in the canyon near my Bobe and Zade's house, my child's view of my mother, my nebulous fears of the world, and those dilatory, unretrievable afternoons of reading for hours, and hours, and hours, with nothing to do and nowhere to be....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jul 1987,"Jul 20, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/247963.Long_Live_the_Queen

Since my motor-coordination isn't sufficient enough to allow me to turn the pages of a magazine/book AND pump the pedals on an elliptical trainer, sometime last summer I turned to Audible to solve my problems. Now, what one requires from printed matter may not at all do for the recorded book, and in my case, it turns out that I can only sustain listening interesting in heavily plot-driven novels (or extra dorkified pod-casts of ""Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me""... sigh, Peter Segel). Unfortunately, the intersections of a compelling plot and interesting writing are fairly few and far between, plus the narrator has to be a strong reader whose vocal stylings are not reminiscent of one's old junior high school/high school drama club classmates. This is difficult. The literary writer trying on genre often works well (John Banville as Benjamin Black is pretty good)--forgive my snobbery--but only because the conventions of a straightforward mystery or sci-fi novel can be a little cringe-inducing when you actually hear them recited aloud. But seriously, I love Science-fiction, so no diss.Anyhoo, The Thirteenth Tale seemed as though it would fit the bill perfectly. I mean, premise-wise, it's the kind of book editors slaver over (personal experience alert!) esp. vis-a-vis potential audience, in other words, well heeled women (possibly of a certain age). The whole freaking novel is, in effect, a love letter to Jane Eyre and the other mega-hits of the 19th century. I'm browsing Audible, thinking to myself (o.k., talking out loud to myself) ""Dark family secrets? Check! Wheels within wheels narrative? Check! Gloomy old English estate? Check! Both Victorian and (presumably) post-war setting? Check! Antiquarian bookstore? Check! Lonely main character whose best friends are books? Secondary main character who is a mysterious, isolated writer? Check, and Check!""Unfortunately, I think the voice I was hearing in my head was actually Diane Setterfield's cajoling, coercive, whinging, and not my own. Emphasis on coercive--my main gripe about this mess of a novel is that while reading I couldn't shake the feeling that the author is constantly trying to impress upon the reader--HOODWINK INTO BELIEVING, more like it--that this piece of moribund trash is actually a work of serious literature.Might I illustrate this vexing complaint for you? Let's talk theme for a moment. The central preoccupation of this novel is twinning, or twinness. The two main characters are both twins (not each other's), whose core-identity has been formed by this (as Diane Setterfield would have it) division of one soul, one egg, one person, into two bodies. The concept of the twin is the leitmotif of The Thirteenth Tale. Unfortunately, Setterfield's entire take on the idea of the twin can be fairly summarized in the above italicized line. Over the course of the book, she uses the same metaphor at least four times to describe separated twins or non-twins--the amputee. She has nothing but the most obvious, predictable, easy, pop-psychology thoughts to offer vis-a-vis twins, but these ideas are all delivered in overwrought, hyperbolic, purple prose. Every time the main character, Margaret, catches sight of her reflection (which occurs at least ten times) she swoons into an overheated, almost laughable disquisition about her ""twin"" (her reflection) who waits for her just on the other side of this mortal coil. Every. Single. Time.How about books? Well, could you imagine that some clever minx would have us believe that books are like the ghosts of dead people? I mean, as a committed life long reader I have never encountered nor thought of such a bold notion--author's words outlive their bodies and thus reading might be an act of communion with the dead? Whoa. And also, dead folk might get lonely--it's so lonely being dead--and the act of reading is akin to an act of friendship and/or companionship? Fortunately for my feeble and limited imagination, Setterfield ensures that such concepts are inescapable in her novel's groundbreaking treatise on the delights literature has to offer.Setterfield makes the further mistake of declaring that Margaret's counterpoint, Vida Winter, is the greatest living English author of her day, a point that is crucial to the story's operation. Her books have won legions of awards, and generations of journalists and biographers have been rebuffed in their frenzied attempts to discover her life story. But Setterfield is not capable of convincing us that Winter is a great--one of THE greats--talent. The narratives that Winter spins for Margaret are pale imitations of Atwood/Byatt-esque storylines. Setterfield's insistence that we believe Winter is a cannonized author damages the credibility of the rest of the novel, especially as it relates to the reader's required suspension of disbelief. Of course, the problem is that Setterfield is not (nor should she be) the greatest living English author, nor even close to it, and she's overreaching in trying to depict Winter as such. It's sort of like an unfunny writer trying to write a funny character; the author doesn't possess the tools to show us that the character is funny, but can only tell us she is. Honestly, I could continue on in my screed for quite a while longer, but I think I should save my energies for positive s. Let me just mention that this novel's construction, pacing, and plotting are all askew as well, and that its ultimate resolution is a huge disappointment. Perhaps my take is soured by the fact that I spent fourteen hours listening to this novel, instead of four or so hours reading it. But my feeling is that what could have been a fun homage to the nineteenth century novel became instead a dull trainwreck of a book, derailed by its own inflated sense of literary import. If anyone knows of a better, but similar in texture, novel to accompany me on my upcoming travels/adventures in exercise, I'd love to hear it.

But, I hadn't ever read it, despite my ability to quote its famous first line or my unexplainable knowledge of its Bronte-esque plot. Would that I had read it long ago, say in the seventh or eighth grade, when I was 13. I know that it's the kind of novel I would have loved then, and that it would have stayed with me all these years. Unlike Jane Eyre, however, I'm not sure it would have held up to repeated readings.I thought this would be the perfect novel to bring on our trip to Italy, for what could be a better read on lazy days in an old stone farmhouse than this slightly gothic, neurotic tale of obsession and memory? And I was tickled when, in Siena, I saw a woman lying on the campo reading Rebecca. In the end, although I found the book very interesting from a sort of writerly/intellectual perspective (sorry!), I was disappointed in it overall as a piece of literature.I think what I found most interesting about the novel is how great swathes of it are preoccupied not with anything that's actually happening, but with the narrator's imaginings of what might or what could happen. Du Maurier constantly undermines the unfolding action to dally in the realm of anxiety and cerebration, which is perfect for a book that fixes on a character--Rebecca--who is dead and absent when the novel starts.Fittingly, it's not just Rebecca who is absent, our unnamed narrator is also, in a sense, an absent center. She remains unnamed throughout, and we know far more about Rebecca's history by book's close than we do about hers. It's really fascinating and intriguing how the book echoes and doubles and enacts the idea of obsession by having a living person be the shadow (and let us remember that ghosts are often called 'shades') of a dead person, a present character be absent and an absent character be present. I mean, the book is called ""Rebecca"" after all, not ""Manderley"" or ""Mrs. De Winter"" or what have you. The novel is very opaque; it is willing to let you know only so much, which I liked, actually. The novel begins far in the future of the events it narrates, with our narrator looking back, and so there is a strange passivity about the whole thing--clearly the main characters escape the clutches of the plot relatively unscathed, so again, the book redirects the reader's attention from more traditional concerns about what happens to the murkier realms of atmosphere and ideation. In fact, the biggest surprise is Manderley's destruction at novel's end, which is far more painful than I would have expected, and perfect for a novel that in many ways deals in memory and imagination: Mr. and Mrs. De Winter can never go home again.Anyhoo, like I said, I found all of this interesting intellectually, but I found the book itself to be rather tedious and awkward. The pacing is bulky and skewed nonsensically, the characterizations flat and slight, and the revelations are fairly broadcast from the beginning. Also, the two main characters, our mousy narrator, and the bland, Ashley Oakes sweatin' Mr. De Winter, are insufferable. Even after Rebecca's evil nature has been unmasked, you can't help but root for her and her sociopathic machinations....more",Notes are private!,0,94,1,not set,Jun 2008,"Jul 03, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/594139.Rebecca

QUESO FRIES), and midway through I finished  Alas, Babylon. I took a gander at Ms. Kinney's amply stocked shelves and spied The Little Friend. ""Perfect!""

Laurel graciously let me take the book back to Minneapolis, but alas (Babylon), all was not to end so cheerily.Full disclosure: I did not finish this book. I couldn't bring myself to muster enough interest in its tedious, suffocating, airless prose. Despite the flap copy's promise of what seemed to be a genuinely gripping mystery, and the allure of a southern gothic, I found The Little Friend to be dead on the page.There was some beautiful language here and there, but for the most part, the style was so overwrought and contrived and deadening and so, so... so dull that I put the book down one hundred or so pages in and never picked it back up--and never will.While I understand some readers' assertion that this book is primarily a reading ""experience"" and that those looking for a fulfillment of its promised narrative are missing the point, I think that they do the book undeserved justice. My feeling is that here, the prose is not in harness to ideas, but mostly to description and atmospherics. It's lovely, yes, but not for 500 pages. The book doesn't sustain a reader's interest not because (or only not because) it doesn't resolve ""the mystery"" but because while lovely, it doesn't challenge or provoke or require serious thought--all its florid prose just begins to feel baroque. The novel feels flabby and flaccid as a result....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2008,"May 29, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/775346.The_Little_Friend

There are some intriguing details here that go unresolved, which I think act as a sort of shout out to the previous book, but otherwise the novel works fine on its own, plot-wise and all.I really love Dan Simmons and everything he does, but this book, which I read in two quick nights, feels like something--given his considerable talents--that he just phoned in. The thing he's best at--world building--is completely absent, and the characterization and plotting are awfully thin. The prose isn't really up to snuff either. All of the bits about the protagonist's ill-fated love affair I simply skimmed, and when I did read them, I cringed. I guess there were a few good scares, but their resolution was so... underwhelming.There were moments where this really felt like a Stephen King novel to me, especially in its preoccupation with childhood and the loss of innocence, but mostly in its lack of heft. King is a way better plotter than Simmons is here, but Simmons's plots are usually more imaginative and less derivative than this. Of course, King would never reference  The Jolly Corner, one of my all time favorite Henry James stories, much less use it as a cornerstone metaphor. King would also never write a sentence like ""I seem to exist as something more than memory, something less than life, almost literally a black hole of holistic recollection formed by the collapsing gravity of grief.""I also appreciated Dan Simmons's take on potential: ""It was a burden before it was realized, and a constant specter after it had been failed to be realized."" Ouch. A little too close to home there.After a long semester full of provocative, challenging, intellectually rigorous reading delights, I wanted a big, old fashioned horror/mystery/sci-fi novel to lose myself in, but alas, this wasn't it. I still need a novel to be actually good to enjoy myself, and I guess my standards are higher than I realized or remembered, because it is getting harder and harder to find genre novels that I love without reservation....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2008,"May 13, 2008",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3978.A_Winter_Haunting

I mean, Ms. MiDespite Knopf saddling this novel with an atrocious, obvious-as-hell marketing ploy of a cover, this novel wants to be taken seriously. I mean, Ms. Michiko Kakutani herself gives it her imprimatur (or at least Lauren Fox's writing), as the copy makes ample note of.And, while I was reading this novel (as a much needed speed read break from  W.G. Sebald's  On the Natural History of Destruction) I did it enjoy it enough. But, as soon as I had finished it, and really started thinking about how slight it felt, I realized I didn't really like it at all (I mean, it isn't a reprehensible piece of work or anything, just... thin).I started this book with more than an open mind. Anyone who knows me well has likely heard my rant about the inherent sexism of the ""chick-lit"" label and those who decry novels they believe fall under this heading, and how such criticisms typically embody a lazy, easy way to dismiss the validity of female experience, especially if it--god forbid--pertains to love.Furthermore, the subject of the book lies close to my heart at this moment in time, as it focuses on a young woman who experiences ambivalence about the institution of marriage (or at least I thought that was what the book was about, although I would now argue that it is not about that at all).The plot is straightforward, which is no great crime in its own right, of course. Emily Ross is 30 years old and married to her college sweetheart (they've been together for nine years and married for five). She and her husband Kevin have reached an impasse: he wants to have children and move to the 'burbs; she doesn't want to have children (at least with him), and wants to stay in their urban Milwaukee apartment. One day at the local coffee shop she meets a handsome stranger with whom she feels an instant connection. The rest is history.Lauren Fox has a gift for zippy one liners, and her observations on many subjects--from friendship to family dynamics--are biting and astute. Fox is honest about Emily's choices, which I appreciated. On a personal note, however, Emily reminded me of the many boring Midwesterners I know who go to their local state university, move back to the city or town in which they grew up, and have all the same friends they've had since high school, so I wasn't particularly keen on keeping company with her, but I acknowledge that this is a bias on my part, and doesn't mark a flaw in the writing.The real flaw of the book is that in a novel about cheating and the dissolution of a marriage, we the readers have to believe that there is something real and meaningful at stake, a loss of a certain magnitude, in order to care about what happens, or to believe that the person who has to make said difficult choices is experiencing actual conflict. That does not happen in this novel. I've been trying to figure what missteps Ms. Fox made, and I think that the biggest issue is her choice to not only start us in medias res vis a vis the boredom of E. and K.'s marriage, but to also forgo any real or sizable flashbacks that convincingly illustrate that Emily was ever in love with Kevin. Lauren Fox makes sure that we understand that Emily is a fairly conventional, analytical person who doesn't experience great passions (a possible justification for my above complaint) so that we GET IT when she does experience irrational, unexplainable passion for her dark, tall, and handsome stranger, David Keller. But David and Kevin are not ultimately developed all that differently, which is to say thinly. They're both good guys. They're both good at what they do. They both love Emily. Yawn. Only Emily's best friend, Meg, is as remotely well drawn as Emily, and it is their relationship that seems to be at the core of the book. I can't help but wonder why Lauren Fox didn't write a book primarily about friendship, given that it seems like that is really what this novel inclines toward.Her take on the possible complexities of marriage is predictable and boring; in other words, not complex. This is not a book, in my opinion, in any way really about marriage, about which there are actually interesting, unpredictable, intelligent, complex, nuanced potentialities to explore.Basically, I feel like this book is a bit fraudulent. It wants to be serious literature; it isn't. Knopf wants certain buyers to believe it is a fun, frothy piece of Chick-Lit. It isn't. Instead, it occupies this tepid, non-confrontational middle ground, just like the setting in which it takes place.I can't wait to leave the Midwest.P.s.

I like it, in part, because it isn't a fashionable book; nothing fantastical or weird happens, the characters aren't based on historical figures, the narrator isn't struggling with any sort of identity politics (except for the most basic ontological crisis: living) or sensational problem. I guess the form itself is a little ""fashiony"" in that it is very rigid, structured, and novel, but the work so far seems to earn it and make lovely use of it. The ""it"" being this: our first person narrator, a forty-ish family man, wakes up every morning near 4:00 a.m. and builds a fire. He sits in front of this fire and thinks. What he thinks about constitutes the book's subject. The book lasts as long as it takes the narrator to go through the box of matches (I think; I haven't finished it) he uses to light his fire.The novel is really intimate; one has the sense while reading of sitting in a dark room just before the rest of the world wakes, slowly coming to full consciousness. I haven't figured out how Nicholson Baker achieves this, and I'm not sure that I want to. I think that part of the pleasure I take in this reading experience might be undone if I try to sound the depths of its mysteries too much. One thing I have sort of preliminarily noticed is that the rhythm and movement of the narrator's thoughts mimics the play of fire, or mimics the way that watching a fire induces one to think without thinking. I take issue with people describing the prose style here as ""stream-of-consciousness"" (the language is extremely clear, beautiful, and simple, and the passages follow a highly ordered and logical progression), but I can understand the impulse to do so: Baker seems to effortlessly capture that fleeting limbo upon first awakening where one's mind hovers deliciously between the conscious and the unconscious.*update*I finished this book a few weeks ago (I haven't felt like working on Goodreads; I suppose because with the end of my semester approaching it began to feel like work) and my thoughts on it remain very much the same as above. A few other bits and pieces on why I think the book works so well: Nicholson Baker sets the clock ticking--we can be patient with and appreciate the narrator's ruminations because the author has given them a limited time frame in which to unfold. Smart move. The book earns its possibly gimmicky structure--the narrative, the meaning of the narrative, is of a piece with the structure. It turns out that the impulse for Emmett to wake up every morning and build a fire is a recent New Year's Day trip with his family to watch the sun rise over the coast (the novel opens in January). The act of waking up early becomes a way for Emmett to re-prioritize living, or to feel alert to being alive, in a way that he hadn't before, and the book is very much about the joys of living an ordinary life.This was the first Nicholson Baker book I've read, and I am definitely going to lay my hands on copies of  Mezzanine and  Vox at the very least....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 27, 2008","Apr 27, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28231.A_Box_of_Matches

I didn't like this novel. I still think it's rather amazing.This novel feels dated in its subject matter, and is beset with passages of casual racism and sexual imperialism that are repugnant to me. The story opens in 1962 (or '64?)and concerns itself with the sexual exploits of young Phillip Dean, the archetypical WASP golden boy, who is a Yale dropout drifting through Europe, and Anne-Marie, a provincial French teenager, whose sexuality (gray teeth and all) acts as a sort of lodestar for Dean's peregrinations. I couldn't care less than I do about this story, which so many readers (as evidenced by Goodreads s) seem to think is the meat of the matter.BUT...This story is bookended by and filtered through the first-person narration of our unnamed narrator, a 34 year old American man, who meets Dean at a party in Paris and then hosts Dean at the borrowed country home in which he lives (it is in this town, Autun, that Dean meets Anne-Marie). The novel operates, in a sense, as a reverse  The Great Gatsby: here our effaced narrator is not a young man (Nick) who witnesses the tragedy of heroism as embodied by the older, more storied man (Gatsby), but instead, is an older man, mourning time's inexorable erasure of youth through the creative act of witnessing (fantasizing/creating) the heroic younger man (Dean).The novel is a novel of obsession, which at first seems to fixate on Dean and Anne-Marie's sex. But the novel's true fixation is the power and potentiality (one might say potency) of youth. Our narrator is impotent, and recreates the possibility of virility/vitality through his fantasy of Dean. It's quite sad and moving, actually. The whole book is cast in a sort of half-light, as though the events it recounts are waning even before they begin, or as if, as all things must, they contain the seeds of their own dissolution even in the moment of their brightest shining. Our narrator's fixation on Dean and Anne-Marie is a fixing of time, and a fixing of the timelessness of the sexual moment.The novel's end, its shift from the promise of authenticity (see ""The Real France"") to its descriptive passages of the town gone arid, mark, at last, the impossibility of the narrator's project. Devastating.Salter makes so many other strange, admirable moves in these pages that it would be difficult to enumerate them all (his rejection of constant, linear time; his use of description as tool of narrative authority; his complete rejection of the reader's desire to know more about our narrator).

Call My by Your Name completely gutted I've been roaming around for weeks now, proselytizing to any and all who will listen, on behalf of this novel. Call My by Your Name completely gutted me. I haven't read a novel that so powerfully affected me in a very long time.There are many fine, nuanced, wonderful s of the book up here already, so I'll just touch on one aspect of the novel that I found particularly surprising in its acuity of vision and the precision of its rendering, beyond its portrait of desire: Elio's habit of projecting himself imaginatively into the future. We learn repeatedly that Elio often makes choices that are predicated on how he imagines he'll feel looking back on said choices. I don't mean how he'll feel about those choices in a moral sense, but more, how by making a choice he can simultaneously bring into being the adult he one day wants to be via his present actions while also satisfying that imagined adult. How he imagines providing the imagined adult with the emotional experience befitting that future person who is him. So that the imagining and the realizing of the imagined person are bound together. I think this is one of the great magics of adolescence--that you know that you're going to leave, that you're going to molt, that this little space you're carving out in time is by necessity fleeting, ephemeral, so that maybe for one of the only times you're looking forward almost to the exclusion of anything else. No one needs to warn you don't look back, because you're so intent on trying to see who you're going to be. I remember so well making exactly those maneuvers, doing things to become my imagined future self and also, doing them for my future self, so that she might be able to feel what I imagined she should feel if she turned out to be anything like the person I hoped (results so far are mixed). God, teenagers are supreme time-travelers. And I suppose that whole imagined self/projected self is very much bound to desire (how could it not be, of course, of course) in that by loving someone we tell ourselves what kind of person we are; we choose ourselves by choosing an other in that our projections of that person--what makes them desirous to us--is so much a reflection of how we want to see ourselves, how we want to be seen, of the qualities we tell ourselves are essential to being in the world. And because that imagined self is absent--the future isn't here--and desire requires absence, or at least a premonition of absence, the absent imagined self is pure desire.That's in part what makes reading this novel, even at its happiest, especially at its happiest, so wrenching. The absence. We know, by the fact of its narration, that absence is at its center.My only regret is that I read part of this book on the bus--the number two bus (if anyone from Minneapolis happens to read this, they'll know what I mean), during rush hour. Yes, the book is sexy, and yes, it was a little awkward reading super hot graphic sex scenes while sitting next to a woman in a full length hijab, but mostly it was horrible reading something so devastating in public.

Anyway, I breezed through this book in a couple of days; it is a very quick, smooth read, heavy on plotting, which keeps the pages turning. However, I think its self-seriousness undermines its credibility, oddly. In the end, I found the book awfully pretentious. The pretense in question? Pretending to be ""serious literature.""The novel revolves around grad-student-gone-wild Willie Upton, who has slunk back to her ancestral home, Templeton, disgraced and in shame. Once at home she sets off on a geneaological quest to establish her own paternity. And, oh yeah, on the day she arrives, a giant ""monster"" surfaces, dead, on the lake of her hometown. Groff models Templeton on Cooperstown, NY, and appropriates many of James Fenimore Cooper's characters for her novel--so all us one-time English majors can geek out to our hearts' delight (first sign of a serious work of fiction, right? Intertextuality!). The novel deals with the big themes: family, history, the ""ghosts"" of the past, secrets, shame, what it means to be an adult, mortality, loss, etc. Or at least it tries to.The book is packaged and billed as serious literature, and it's clear that the author sees her work this way, too. The writing is filled with purple adjectives and extreme hyperbole vis a vis the most mundane of emotions and events. The novel wants to explore the meaningfulness of everyday life, and it relies heavily on bloated metaphors (see the title) to convey this. Groff (the author) uses a lot of telescoping, as well--too much, in fact--to underscore the reach of history across time, and it is grating and begins to feel self-conscious. Every other word in this novel seems to be ""glory"" or ""glorious"", and every chapter ends on a suitably ""haunting"" and lyrical note. There are about seven hundred descriptions of Lake Glimmerglass, and these especially indicate the limits of Groff's reach. I feel for the lady; clearly there are only so many ways to describe a lake, right? But here's the thing: when your shit gets repetitive, find a new way or QUIT.The narrative consists of multiple perspectives and voices, almost all of which I found totally unconvincing. (The Running Buds? C'mon.) At novel's end, when the resolution to the plot reveals itself to be highly anticlimactic, I looked back on the various narrative elements and couldn't help but feel that much of it was filler. These aren't human beings populating the pages, but very convincing paper dolls. Yawn.My feeling is that this book offers up a lot of what much contemporary lit. is missing: fun. It has a sexy premise, as well as, as I said, a plot-centric narrative, and because it's written in an (overly) lyrical prose-style, smart people can feel unembarrassed to read it.

I read it several times as a kid, reveling in the March girls' industry, creativity, and joie-de-vivre in the face of what I knew, even in childhood, was unacceptable reality. Sure, Marmee seemed a little too saintly to be believed (especially in light of my own mother's more, ahem, mercurial temperament), but that was part of the novel's endless allure (besides my hero-worship of Jo, the would be writer). So, as soon as I very belatedly heard about March, I picked up a copy and devoured it.I read it too quickly. Geraldine Brook's storytelling is flawless, so much so that the novel, which is economical to begin with, operated as something of a page turner for me. I had a few problems with the chronology she employs to tell the story (she has a lot of work to do juggling past and present, flashbacks and on-going narrative, and she doesn't always pull it off with complete clarity), but I deeply admire her bravery in telling a story that so many other authors would have given the bombastic ""Epic"" treatment as a closely observed, emotionally honest, deeply human narrative that is big precisely because it is unafraid to be small. This is not a 600 page historical novel with a sweeping scope. Instead, it is the story of one man who sets out to do what he believes is right, and whose naive and sometimes prideful world view is subsequently challenged by the grim realities of slavery and war and people unlike himself (I thought several times during my reading that P.M. is a perfect analog for today's lefties who live in comfortably progressive enclaves like Portland, OR, and as a result, are often the most ridiculously provincial people I've ever met), such that, by novel's end, the world and self he thought he knew is irrevocably undone and erased, and the psychic damage permanent.I think what I admire most about this deeply admirable novel (sorry to beat a dead horse, here), beyond its inspiring technical skill, lush imagery, unexpected language, and beautiful prose is its insistence that while there may be just wars there is no such thing as a good war.SPOILER ALERTWhen Brooks allows Marmee herself to enter the narrative and speak, to see the hospitals and the broken men who fill them, to engage with her husband's (understandably) narcissistic polemic, to confront herself in her confrontations with a one-time slave, to ruminate on class, the novel finds its burning heart. It brought me to tears. (When I have a copy of the book in front of me, I will edit this to include one such blistering moment.)Brooks lets her characters be people of their time. March--our hero--believes, truly believes (and Brooks does not redeem him) that is his duty as a husband to control Marmee's unseemly behavior, and to bring her to understand how she should acquiesce to his better judgment. Marmee, as she should, mourns her loss of station. Brooks's Yankees are, as they would have been, not merely or only uniformed abolitionists, but racists and thugs. There were a couple of moments that felt maybe a bit too modern (Grace's goodbye to March at novel's end seems as if it is cribbed directly from The Autobiography of Malcolm X), but over all Brooks gets it right. She isn't afraid to let her characters be ugly--to be real. Perhaps it takes an author who is not an American to treat our national myths, narratives, and histories with such insight and even-handed affection. The novel isn't showy, it doesn't indulge in tricks, it has a fairly straightforward structure, and it doesn't truck with overt intellectualism. It is a fine, satisfying, enormously well wrought piece of art. In reading this over, I see that I've called both the book and Brooks ""brave"" too many times to count. And she is, and it is. This is ethical, beautiful literature at its best....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 27, 2008","Feb 28, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13529.March

The intelligence of the prose: the language is stylish and fun without playing to the lowest common denominator.

First of all, she writes novels that should be gimmicky, but are not. In  The Post-Birthday World she employs a doubled narrative that splits in two at its heroine's defining moment of choice/will/agency, what have you. In  We Have to Talk About Kevin she goes for the epistolary form. But in both cases, the ""device"" is perfectly matched to the content, like an igloo (form follows function y'all). The meaning of the novel is bound to its form. Second of all, her prose is fucking delicious. Her language endlessly delights me; it is crafty, artful, funny, acute, and heartbreaking. Third, she writes with more nuance than almost any other contemporary writer I've read (that's you,  Kazuo Ishiguro) about the nuances and complexities of human psychology, especially in terms of how people relate to/react to each other. Fourth, no easy answers. Lionel Shriver's work is bold and often crushingly sad, because she is brave enough to explore the various unhappinesses of life on earth without offering pat answers as to its causes. Fifth, she writes about women, messy, arrogant, willfull, meek, submissive, brilliant, dim, WOMEN. God, she's so good.As far as  We Need to Talk About Kevin goes, I could not put it down. The premise is straightforward enough: the mother of a Columbine-style teen-aged killer (the titular Kevin) writes a series of letters to her husband in which she attempts to hash out the thorny questions that their son's rampage has raised vis a vis responsibility for his crime. Eva's letters constitute an amazing dissertation on the requirements of motherhood and its attendant mythology (I think I like reading Shriver's work so much in part because I always come away from it feeling more normal about my own gender fueled ambivalencies). The book dares to suggest the possibility that some people are born bad, are, from conception, simply irredeemable. It also doesn't shrink from microscopically dissecting Eva's faults, and by so doing, fingering her as culpable. As to who or what is ultimately to blame for Kevin, suffice it to say Shriver does not provide the reader with a clear answer come novel's end.

I left this in the hills (also known as the glove compartment of my father's old Honda in Encino)... along with an unopened pack of Mad Libs from Pea Soup Andersen's, a map of San Francisco, and some Dutch licorice.NOW:Finally caved and bought this book last week, before my trip home to Los Angeles and San Francisco. I figured that this would make good, or at least passable, airplane reading as well as being entirely apropos of my journeying, as well as taking my mind off the crazy-making wedding I was about to attend. Really? What I was thinking? This book is full of SEX and vacuous people and money, so it must be the awesomeness, correct? Correct? Somehow, I missed the fact that this book is about sex, and vacuous people, and money, and oh yeah, the war in Iraq and that the characters who fill its pages never shut up, especially when they're fucking.So I think it's kind of boring.I'll give it another shot after I finish the so far far more engrossing  Alive in Necropolis.THEN:I'm not a huge Jane Smiley fan, or even a fan at all, but I love The Decameron (duh, I'm a Chaucer nerd) and I love L.A.

After some seven months I finished listening to Bel Canto, and my friends, I am prepared to eat some serious crow. My earlier reservations remain intact, but what can I say, I have seen the light.Somewhere halfway through this ambivalent little dance I'd been doing with Ms. Patchett, I started marveling at how I'd come to believe, wholeheartedly, in a world and in a set of actions, that should have been wholly unbelievable. The captives begin to fall in love with their captors, but the love does not go unrequited, indeed, the captors begin to love their captives. And this love takes many forms beyond that of romance; filial love emerges between the characters, religious love/awakening blooms, the love of one talent for another, the mentor and the mentee dynamic is delineated beautifully, the love of language, and time telling, and chess playing, and opera.AND none of the above love emerges as a form of Stockholm Syndrome. The novel is brave enough to demand that we, the readers, abandon our preconceptions ands step boldly forward into a more complex, more complicated system than the ones we may have previously elaborated for ourselves when it comes to ideas about power and authority. There are almost no ""bad guys"" in this novel or truly unredeemable people.In the end, the terror arrives in the form of the would be rescuers. The climax broke my heart. I had no idea how Patchett would see us through, the task seemed so impossible, but she deftly and piercingly nailed it.I'm really in awe of so much of what she accomplished here, from her time management to her transitions to her world building to her handling of such an unruly ensemble cast, as it were. I finished the book on the plane to Rome, and when I finally did make it to Lucca, I had to remind myself that Roxanne and Gen and Simon and Edith weren't real people, and that I didn't need to share in their sadness, the novel was that persuasive.BEFOREConfession: I am listening to this book, not reading it in the old school sense. I listened to it trekking around the Sepulveda dam/basin with the mountains of the Valley rising up all around me and the herons gliding over the rehabilitated Los Angeles river. I listened to it speeding down the 405 to Newport Beach on Christmas Eve to see a friend I hadn't seen in years. I listened to it on the plane back to this awful frozen city while I crocheted a scarf I'll never finish. And now I listen to it at night in bed in the dark when I can't sleep and don't want to bother Jason. I've listened to it in all those ways and yet my feelings about it remain constant. For no legitimate reason whatsoever I have avoided reading this book ever since it burst on the scene, sealing  Ann Patchett's stature as a leading literary light. I guess, unfairly, I thought of it as one of those literary books, like  Julia Glass's  Three Junes, which I have also never read, that readers who can't do challenging fiction love. Does that make any sense, beyond the snobbery? No!Anyhoo, a good friend of mine from the MFA program, whom I respect greatly, loves this book, so I decided it would be my next Audible download. It is a good listen, which is a whole other category in its own right (not all great reads make great listens): the narrator is skilled and the narrative is compelling, despite the fact that so far, four hours into it, it all takes place in one room (a writing feat unto itself).The premise is this: a group of international dignitaries and businessmen have gathered at the home of the vice president of an unnamed South American-ish country, to celebrate the birthday of a Sony-like Exec, whom the country is hoping to woo into opening a factory within their borders. The country has brought in the famed opera singer Roxanne Kass to sing, the exec's favorite, to seal the deal. In the middle of the party, terrorists storm the house and take everyone hostage.The novel is an object lesson in the potential and power of a third person narrative. Ann Patchett's narrator is sneaky, subtle, unparalled at shifting from character to character and scene to scene. The transitions, the seams, are invisible. It is amazing in that way. Despite the inherent claustrophobia of the setting (one house) the book feels expansive and open, because of the narrative vision and scope.However, I find the writing to be overly mannered (although I always read about Patchett's ""effortless"" and ""gorgeous"" prose). Also, the book feels flat to me, the characters who populate it feel stiff, more like beautiful paper dolls than flesh and blood individuals. Finally, every single man in the novel, from lowly terrorist to hero of capitalism, is in love with Roxanne Kass, which begins to feel a little... predictable? Boring? Patchett certainly hasn't done the work to make her believably singular, or to make us understand the power of her singing. Reading this sometimes feels too much like listening to one's male friends from high school drone on about that one pretty girl they all liked for no discernable reason beyond her great rack and hesitant smile.I'll finish it, but more to out of curiosity to see how Patchett will unfold the next five hours than out of a great love for the book....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2008","Jan 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

Carolyn See is sort of the grand dame of serious California/Los Angeles fiction. This book is one of those writers' writers unheralded classics, and I've been wanting to read it for a long time. It begins in Topanga Canyon in the summer of 1980, and it feels like the late 70s and early 80s. I mean, it is saturated with this uber authentic sunny narcissism that somehow believes itself to be feminism, and is also a bit classist and racist. It's creepy, truth be told. I kind of can't stand the narrator, but the more I read, the more compelled I am to keep reading. The more I read, the more sadness tinges the edges of the pages. Doomsday approaches. I have no idea how I'll feel about this book when I finish it, but I am very curious to find out.Hmmm... it looks like I never returned to complete this . I'm afraid that in the year that has lapsed since I read it, my memory of the novel has faded somewhat, and what I'm left with is this ossified sense of its strangeness. I don't know if this novel was meant to indict the self-indulgent ethos of ""finding yourself"" that underlies the frippery of the New Age movement, but I came away from this book believing that the destruction wrought upon these characters is somehow the byproduct of their self-satisfied ""seeking.""The book feels dated, but in a useful way--it functioned, for me, as a direct portal back in time to the attitudes and postures of affluent, liberal Los Angeles in the early eighties, an era in which I was alive and one that I do remember, but with the fuzziness of a child. Somehow, perhaps inadvertently, this book feels ""right"" or ""true"" to my overall sense of that period.

More on this...Continued: When I was younger I read almost entirely for story and for character, as I think most readers do (which is not a judgment, merely an observation). I did not find interesting, and thus did not think about, novels as art, novels as a product of craft; in other words, it did not even enter my consciousness as a reader to imagine/examine a novel's aim or aims, its project.

In fact, I kind of hate it when my whiny undergraduates complain about how unlikeable a character might be in an assigned text. So, don't get me wrong; it isn't that I don't like these characters and thus reject the book. It's that the book as a whole feels contrived, overly controlled, and self-satisfied.

Post-apocalyptic fiction is one of my major geek-out subjects, to boot. Cormac McCarthy is so strange already that I was thrilled when this book came out. I bought it immediately. And now, almost two years later, I still haven't read it. Why? I don't know.Okay, so it's some weeks later. I brought this book home with me and read it in one night in San Diego. I wasn't enthralled (despite the one night thing). Although I think reading it in one sitting definitely affected my feelings about the book, which are: I thought it was dull.I don't think, as I wrote earlier, that this novel is essentially of a piece with genre fiction, and that it's been elevated out of said ghetto by its author's name. The book is not truly speculative, which I liked. Its concerns center more on what it means to love in the face of no love at all, awful nothingness, a scoured, empty, hateful place. The book's project seems to be tracing out the relationship between a father and his young son, the elemental qualities inherent in that bond. And it was moving. And for Mr. McCarthy, hopeful even.But the novel felt monotonous to me, as featureless and unbroken as the majority of the landscape through which the boy and the man travel. I admire Mr. McCarthy's audacity when it comes to language, but i did tire of reading about ""the autistic dark"" and ""vestibular"" passageways.This is a book I would read again, slowly this time, and in a different setting, just to see if I missed the boat on my first read.

I don't think I ""liked it"" per se, but I could not get it out of my head. I had never read anything quite like it at the time, and still haven't. So I was super excited when his next novel, The Pesthouse came out, dealing as it does with material I'm particularly fond of: post-apocalyptic wasteland America (maybe it's because of growing up watching ""Rollerball"" and ""Logan's Run"" and ""Mad Max"" and ""Escape from New York"" and ""Night of the Comet"" and wait it for it, wait for it all you seventies babies--THE DAY AFTER).The Pesthouse came out around the same time as The Road, unfortunately for Mr. Crace, as the two books are somewhat similar, if not in tone, at least in subject. Both concern themselves with post-apocalyptic America, and both are road novels that center on two characters journeying across the charred remnants of our once great nation. Neither novel cares much for the conventions of speculative fiction, and neither indulges much, if at all, in the details of their brave new worlds. And both Crace and McCarthy are odd, highly cerebral stylists. That's where the similarities end. The Road is a much darker novel, preoccupied with notions of survival and filial love, written in a language that, while often vertiginously bizarre, is overall fairly spare. The Pesthouse takes place in a somewhat gentler, agrarian America, several generations (at least) removed from the initial, unidentified disaster. The two main characters navigate a romantic-love relationship, and their journey isn't so much a matter of survival as it is a sort of reverse frontiering, an eastward migration to a whispered promised land. And Crace pulls out all the punches with his language, which true to Being Dead, is highly lyrical and often loopy and embellished.But where Crace's strange distance and cold intellectualism really worked in Being Dead--you needed a certain emotional separation from the characters and story at hand in order to spend 300 pages thinking in minutest detail about their decomposition--here it did not serve the material at all. The Pesthouse's narrative requires empathy from its readers to animate its pages, but the tone of the book is so neutral, so detached that it is difficult to muster much concern for the fates of its unfortunately dull protagonists. I never really felt in my bones that there was anything real to lose for these people, that there was anything at stake, or that the losses they had already suffered were in fact, losses. Finally, possibly most sadly, I never believed in their love or its necessity. The only moments that shimmered for a blink with a sense of urgency or power centered on the relationship between the lead and her adopted baby--a la The Road....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Jun 2008,"Dec 10, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/92555.The_Pesthouse
