It's a 'mystery' (and I use that term lightly because the real mystery of the story doesn't start until well over halfway through the novel) set in 1919 Kyiv and follows a young man who, on the first page, witnesses his father's murder and loses one of his own ears. That ear comes into play in a sort of surreal/fantastical way that assists him in his new role as inspector for the police, a job he falls into unexpectedly.It's not quite historical fiction focused solely on recreating a time period and examining its impact on the present day (though the tension of this unstable period in Ukrainian history is surely the best part of the novel), and like I said the mystery elements are quite weak.

One of those unexpected, totally immersive books that, while I was reading it, I completely forgot that I was reading. I got fully lost in the narrator's story, in her reflections of her relationship to her twin brother, as she ponders what led him to ultimately take his life. There are no easy answers, perhaps no answers at all. But I found the way that Jente Posthuma wrote these vignettes, usually between 1-3 pages at most, of memories or moments from the unnamed narrator's life, creates a sort of mosaic. Each small tile, either a dark or light moment, when you zoom out, crafts a picture of their life spent together as she tries to piece it all together.There's many layers here around identity, bodies (they are twins, but not identical), family, good vs evil, etc. And she explores this through contemporary and historical examples of trauma and tragedy.

Starnone examines his relationship to his father, a devoted artist and self-centered, toxic abuser. Nevertheless, while the author doesn't hold back on depicting the explicitly horrible nature of his father, he also depicts the complicated reality of growing up under the oppressive and inevitably influential gaze of someone so strong-willed. Admiration and accusation, two sides of the same coin. In the early phases of the novel, Starnone expertly exhibits how fragile the peace in a household can be when run by a lothario such as his father. The hypocritical tyrannism of Federi, Starnone's father, creates an environment where every move can be either lauded or ridiculed; living in a constant state of fear, needing to appease his father, renders Starnone almost stagnant in his own development. How can we become who we are in the vacuum of another, especially such a prominent figure of one's father? I struggled a bit to get into this book. It's dense, heady and very repetitive. Perhaps much like living out these experiences would feel. By no means is it enjoyable or pleasant. However, the power of the narrative builds as you go on. And the end of each section—there are three in total, without chapter breaks—hit hard. Starnone really earns the emotional turns each part takes and by the finale I was surprisingly moved. This might not be for everyone, but those who like the gritty Neapolitan depictions in Ferrante's work and the examination of parent/child relationships found in a vulnerable memoir will find something to appreciate, if not always enjoy, in Starnone's modern epic....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Mar 24, 2024","Mar 28, 2024","Mar 24, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/122089804-the-house-on-via-gemito

We follow them, and the fellow tenant farmers of their neighborhood, over the course of their lives and see the lingering effects that slavery and capitalism has on their people. As they find their voices—in whatever way they can—they must learn to confront the terrible history that their family has endured in order to find their footing in a world that is never acknowledged as their own.

She's in therapy, she has a steady job, and she's settling into life back in Proofrock with her best friend, Letha. But Proofrock isn't quite done with Jade just yet...Another mysterious slew of deaths is haunting the town. And Jade is doing everything in her power NOT to get involved. These can't be the slasher-esque killings she's experienced twice before, right? But if it is, what is she willing to do to protect the ones she loves and end the cycles of violence she's endured her whole life? How far is she willing to go when that means maybe losing the parts of yourself you've worked so hard to fix?After a brief detour into more characters' POVs in Book 2, Book 3 in the Indian Lake Trilogy is fully Jade Daniels' story. And it feels SO good to be back in her mind. The growth she's had from Book 1 to now is astounding, and that growth feels natural because Stephen Graham Jones has done such a good job developing her voice. At her core she's still the same old Jade with the same old knowledge of slasher films and genre conventions; but she's also more mature, wiser, more experienced, more wounded, and striving to make a peaceful life with what little she has left. I felt like this portrayal of someone who has gone through so much trauma was done so well. Because Jade is Jade, she doesn't turn into the villain and seek revenge, but she can't quite see herself, still, as the hero, the final girl. She just wants the film to end and for everyone to get on with their lives.This plot too! It is so full circle. Trust me, you might want to re-read books 1 and 2 before reading this final installment. Because boy are there a LOT of important connections being brought together in this book from what we've learned and experienced before.I will say, as someone who didn't do that before picking this up, I struggled at times and did a lot of Reddit/Wikipedia-ing to remind myself who's who. Jade treats her backstory like she treats the slashers she constantly references: it's up to you to remember and recall the details because she isn't holding your hand. That could be frustrating for some readers, but I found it refreshing that SGJ throws you right in—and if anything it makes me want to re-read the entire series, like immediately.The emotional core of this book is strong; probably the strongest of the 3 books. I was stressed at the end because I felt so emotionally invested in what was happening. And the body count in this book: is it the highest of them all? I'm not sure but it sure felt like it...I think SGJ nailed this ending. I loved it so much, I couldn't put this book down. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. I know the series as a whole has its flaws and definitely isn't for everyone, but I love how unique these stories are, how interesting and strange the writing style is (if you struggle with it at times, you aren't alone—maybe try the audiobooks!) and how special it is to spend 3 books with a character in horror. SGJ is a modern day master of the genre!...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Mar 12, 2024","Mar 16, 2024","Mar 12, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/178019710-the-angel-of-indian-lake

Told through four vignettes into particular relationships in the unnamed narrator's life—past loves, friends and family—we learn less about the main character as a person of action and more as a person of being.""As far as the dead are concerned, chronology has no import and all that matters are the details, the degree of density, this how and what and everything to do with who."" In the vein of Rachel Cusk's  Outline trilogy, the story is less concerned with narrative propulsion—in fact the narrator seems to reject or counter her partner's constant forward movement—and settles more into the seeing, the observing of everyday life. Of years of her life. Decades. Things once forgotten and remembered in a fevered state. What about a book that lingers on your shelf inscribed by a lost love? Or a dress ripped up the side that recalls a New Year's Eve party from the old millennium? This is the detritus, or perhaps treasures, of a normal life—the details that tell the full story, if any story, any life, is really complete.I was engaged, first, by her skilled writing and Kira Josefsson's flawless translation. The prose, each thought, flows so seamlessly into the next you can't help but be compelled forward by an otherwise 'mundane' story. Then, as each chapter unfolds and the narrator brings you into various spheres of her life through these relationships, you get to see a more intimate side of the speaker without every getting the full picture.My only wish was for it to be a bit longer. Selfishly because I was enjoying it so much I wanted more information, more detail; but also because I felt the story a bit choppy and it was just in the final section I started to feel it fully coming together. I did appreciate and enjoy the ending, though perhaps one extra glimpse into her life through another friendship, or lover, or sibling relationship would have made these stronger for me.Nonetheless, there's plenty to enjoy here and if you want an autofiction of a woman pondering life and her past while breathing hope rather than despair, this would be a great addition to your shelves....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Mar 11, 2024","Mar 12, 2024","Mar 11, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62593601-the-details

And at the end of each chapter Hannah is emailing with a friend/fan of her work about her latest novel that we are reading and his name is Leo. Leo often provides feedback or ideas on her manuscript that she will occasionally take into consideration and weave into the following chapters, but sometimes she doesn't. Leo himself appears as a character in the novel that Hannah is writing which is also about an author working on a novel.. it's all quite meta.The ideas of novel writing and inspiration and the relationship between author and reader were interesting, but felt surface-level. The whole story within a story thing felt like it was intentionally going somewhere, and then it just doesn't.I also did find it hard to believe some of the character choices in the main novel we are reading, essentially how quickly these 4 strangers bond over something and then immediately become best friends.

I really enjoyed and was surprised by these linguistic choices! Also considering I read the English translation, I'm impressed by the translator's work and how seamless it was.The story, however, did feel a bit overdone. I'm not sure how this book was received in Brazil and how Brazilian culturally is regarding LGBTQIA+ stories, but this didn't feel like it tread new ground (at least from my limited U.S.-centric mindset). I also couldn't really tell when the story took place. I don't always need those markers but it might have helped to better understand the cultural climate and response from the elder community in regards to the young men's relationship.If you are looking for a short, compelling and uniquely written story, I would recommend this one!

However, the son discovers the town is more like a purgatory filled with ghosts who have not moved on due to unfulfilled hopes and dreams.A precursor to the wave of Latin American magical realism, this is clearly an important and influential piece of short fiction. It's quite unique in its style and voice, and while the reading was challenging—keeping track of the *many* characters, plot lines, and time periods as the narrative constantly jumps around—it was satisfying when the various threads came together.Ultimately though I think that I recognize this style of book isn't to my taste. It relies on you to simply go with things that happen and be content with the inexplicable. It's more of an experience, like a Bergman film, and perhaps on a re-read I would find more to appreciate about Rulfo's skill. But it wouldn't ever be a book I personally love.

I've seen complaints from other s that there is no plot, and that is true to some extent. But I didn't mind because the characters felt so richly imagined and I was invested in their individual journeys that that felt enough like a plot to keep me turning the pages.You can also tell the author did a lot of research for this novel; the settings felt richly imagined (pulled, likely, from her own childhood experiences visiting extended family in Panama) and the historical setting was informational but never bogged down in facts. The time period only serves to give context for the characters she has created, never to be the sole focus of the story.I simply enjoyed spending time in this world and with these characters. Henriquez is adept at introducing you to a lot of characters with ease; I never found it laborious to keep track of who was who or lose focus as we switched perspectives. This is a book I can comfortably recommend to a lot of people and one that will be on my mind for quite some time!...more",Notes are private!,1,37,1,"Mar 06, 2024","Mar 10, 2024","Feb 05, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/181110028-the-great-divide

This book is so far outside of my comfort zone (it was sent to me by the publisher and piqued my interest only because my brother is a Kant scholar who also draws on Arendt's works heavily). But I'm really glad I read it! I won't lie and say that at times I was challenged, but I never felt defeated. It's simply due to my lack of knowledge about Arendt prior to picking this up—which along the way was remedied—and how little I flex the 'muscle' of thinking in this way as a primarily fiction reader. I think the author does a great job of balancing academic writing with personal reflection, explaining things in a way that is more accessible than I anticipated. This book sort of unlocked something in me that hungers for more non-fiction. Once I got to the halfway mark—having previously read about a chapter a day or so—I devoured this book. I was thinking about its concepts while I wasn't reading it: how do we operate in a world that feels so full of contradictions? Is there a way to exist peacefully under capitalistic structures? Do I feel like my votes even really matter? How can I go out and think, act, and reflect on my thoughts & actions in a manner that honors my humanity, as well as the humanity of those I exist with?I also couldn't help but think constantly of Palestine while reading this. I would've loved to know how Arendt would feel about current events, but can only, as the author says, think along side her and imagine what she may have said. And by trying to see the world through someone else's eyes, whether friend or foe, perhaps I can begin to erase some of those distinctions and see instead humanity. And by doing so, create a more just and loving world....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Feb 02, 2024","Feb 07, 2024","Feb 02, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/145625055-we-are-free-to-change-the-world

They have two sons and spend their years in conversation with the earth, moving their herds between what is now Norway and Sweden, with unrestricted access—until the government steps in to begin establishing stronger borders that forces the Samí south off their land and disrupts the natural flow of their lives.Jumping about 50 years, the story then follows Lise and her family, as she raises her own family in the city and reflects on her childhood in which she was forced into a Nomad School and had her Samí identity stripped away. Her own daughter, Sandra, in the 2000s, will go on to become a strong advocate for the Samí people and their rights, but not without struggles of a legacy that is silenced by many around her.This is a powerful and moving story of a people I, admittedly, knew nothing about before reading it. I love literature that not only compels but informs, and this surely did both. I learned a lot about the Samí and saw strong parallels to the stories I've read about indigenous peoples in the Americas, particularly the U.S. and Canada.The writing style, as I mentioned, is in a poetic form. The novel is told in verse and inhabits many voices with special focus on the mothers in this story. The women truly make this story come to life and show the power and force that a mother has in the world around her. The term Ædnan actually means ""the land,"" ""the ground,"" and ""the earth"" and is closely related to the word ædni which means ""the mother."" Motherland.Alongside reading this ARC (thanks to the publisher for an early copy for  from NetGalley) I also listened to the audiobook which helped with some of the pronunciations as well as to hear the cadence of the poetry. I thought the narrator did a fantastic job and would definitely recommend listening along if you are able to while reading this.There's so much more I could say about this story and its themes, but it's quite a quick read (despite the high page count, it moves very quickly due to the format), and I think it's best for the reader to discover it on their own.

While this story is over 60 yearsCassandra Edwards is a singular character; one of those voices that only comes around once in a while in literature. While this story is over 60 years old now, it feels as relevant as ever. And it's delivered in a slim but punchy style that feels so fresh and exciting.The story follows Cassandra, heading home from Berkeley to her family's ranch in the hill country outside Bakersfield, California. She's heading home to see her identical twin sister, Judith, be married to a man Cassandra has never met after 9 months of separation from her sister. This difficult period of separation has led Cassandra to question her very existence, and how the weekend plays out feels fully at her whim. Will she break up the wedding to secure her future with her other half? Or will she overcome her own obstacles to allow her sister her happy ending?Baker is a quick and sharp writer. The dialogue in this is quippy and endearing; the characters speak with an intellectualism that sets them apart, adrift in their own world in a relatively rural area. It's nearly a one setting story, for the most part, and that isolation breeds anxiety like a pressure cooker. We, the readers, are waiting to see how the steam gets let out: either a slow exhale or an explosion.I really enjoyed this reading experience. I was so surprised by the writing and how contemporary it felt, while still maintaining a sense of its time. The mid-century setting is appealing for its nostalgia, and yet the characters break that a bit with their existential dread. If you like the trend of 'messy girl lit,' with characters who you can't help but love despite their poor decision making, this feels like it laid the groundwork for a lot of that. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jan 05, 2024","Jan 07, 2024","Jan 03, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19369433-cassandra-at-the-wedding

How do we make our mark when we are being silenced? And what can a single person do in the face of so much chaos and uncertainty?These are all questions excellently explored in Yoko Ogawa's quiet dystopian novel, The Memory Police: a story of an unnamed author living on an unnamed island where things regular are 'disappeared' by a militant organization called The Memory Police. One day roses are gone, petals flowing away down the river to the sea never to be seen again. Another day, calendars vanish and leave the citizens with no sense of time. Inspired by Anne Frank and her family's story, Ogawa writes into this narrative a man, R, who does not lose his memory as these things fade away. So the narrator helps hide him from the Memory Police in a secret room in her house to preserve his life and his memories of the things taken from their community.In ways this reminded me of a childhood class,  The Giver by Lois Lowry, and blurbs compare it to Orwell's 1984 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 which I think are apt. There's a timeless quality to this story, perhaps because of the characters' and location's anonymity, as well as the parable-like quality to the writing. The story is not heavy-handed in its message, in my eyes; in fact, I think it's quite open at the end, and the 'book within a book' elements leave a lot to be interpreted (and perhaps, desired, if you want a more clear-cut story). I, however, enjoyed the journey and its rumination on these larger themes, while being told in an almost cozy way. This calm atmosphere—you can almost feel the constant presence of snow and how it dampens the characters' world—comes on slowly and pulls you along until you, like the characters, are met with a seemingly inevitable ending.A compelling and creative take on the genre with an excellent translation by Stephen Snyder!...more",Notes are private!,3,56,1,"Jan 15, 2024","Jan 17, 2024","Dec 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37004370-the-memory-police

He is able to tap into the emotional core of his characters, and in turn tap into the reader's very soul, better than many authors I've read from. And while his craft and storytelling isn't always technically perfect, it's that raw, undefined quality that shines through his stories that makes them so memorable and powerful. In Ragged Company we follow five protagonists, four of whom are homeless: One for the Dead (Amelia One Sky), Timber, Digger and Double Dick. During a particularly bitter winter storm the group seeks shelter in a movie theater where they meet soon-to-become fifth member of their ragged company: Granite, a retired journalist. After Digger discovers an unclaimed lottery ticket that ends up winning them $13.5 million, we follow this crew as we see how life off the street brings old memories and troubles to the surface, and how they lean on one another to overcome their past traumas.Within each of the four main parts of this novel are smaller sections that regularly switch between all five protagonists who all have distinct narrative voices. I enjoyed hearing from all of them, even if, compared to other Wagamese novels I've read, it was an adjustment following so many characters. We learn a lot about their presents and their pasts through each section, as Wagamese slowly doles out information.My only minor quip with this story is its tendency to lean into melodrama. Perhaps because of the nostalgic quality and reflective tone of the story, it can tend to come across as cliche or platitudinal, with characters either speaking or narrating in quotes that you imagine printed on a poster about life, love, family and home. Don't get me wrong, I think it's beautifully written, but it does come across occasionally as a bit simplistic.But I'm biased because I love Wagamese and trust that by the end he will weave it all together to make an unforgettable story. I also trust him to handle this material, especially about the homeless experience (and Granite's job as a journalist) because of his personal experience with these things; at least, more trusted than other author's who might try to tackle the same subject matter.I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as someone's first Wagamese—it's a bit longer than his other works, more meandering/meditative and character-driven—but it's a fine addition to his oeuvre and one I'm glad to have read!...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jan 19, 2024","Jan 22, 2024","Dec 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55250580-ragged-company

Kazu is a ghost haunting Ueno Park in Tokyo. After a life devoid of any luck, he’s invisible to the world around him after dying homeless and without his family. Born on the same day as the Emperor in 1933, his life serves as a foil to the privilege of royalty & wealth, asking: what truly separates mankind from one another? Is it luck or something more deliberate?The writing is quite fractured at times. Starting off almost as a poem and then moving through recollections, history lessons, overheard conversations, transit announcements and more, the prose weaves between voices in a sort of dreamy state. Kazu is, after all, a ghost haunted by the past and inhabiting a vague present. I loved certain aspects of this, namely the parts about Kazu’s personal life, his childhood and family life and the effects that his ‘fate’ had on his circumstances. I found those elements incredibly moving and sad. However, at times to give us context or try to establish parallels and make points about larger social issue, Miri gives these sort of history lessons delivered by another homeless man, Shige, and I thought those were a bit dull and took me out of the story. I understand why they were there but I didn’t find them as interesting and it really slowed down the narrative thrust of Kazu’s story. While it was a bit uneven, I enjoyed this story for the most part. I found it sympathetic to an audience that’s almost always overlooked and I feel like if I had a bit more context for modern Japanese history I would’ve enjoyed some of the more didactic bits even more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Dec 24, 2023","Dec 28, 2023","Dec 24, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48890205-tokyo-ueno-station

However, I want to preface this by saying I recognize I am not the intended demographic for this book, so please take my  with a grain of salt. However, I did read the first book in this series last year ( Before I Let Go) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So when I heard this one was coming out I eagerly anticipated it, as I don't read a ton of romance and was happy to have a new book from an author I had previously read and enjoyed. I went to Netgalley and requested an early copy (thanks publishers!) which I have now read, and here are my thoughts.This book follows Soledad who is a wife to Edward and mother to three daughters. Her life is very home-centric. Her role is that of wife and mother, primarily, and has been for going on nearly 20 years. When the plot of this book kicks off, it completely upends that forced dependency her bread-winning husband has created for her and in that journey to caring for her daughters and herself she rediscovers the inner strength she didn't realize she had lost. Along the way, there's also a complicated, sort of forbidden romance with Judah, a divorced father of two boys with autism. Does that sound like a lot? Because, it is. And I think despite there being so much good in this book, there just isn't enough space to explore in depth what Kennedy Ryan tries to, even at over 400 pages!I felt the characters lacked from the start, and since this is a romance, but also a story of a contemporary woman tackling real issues, it made everything seem a bit surface level and not as hard hitting as the issues discussed in Before I Let Go. We don't really get a complete picture of Soledad (as I described her above) before the inciting incident of the novel. So while we are supposed to be rooting for her, we are still getting to know her. I thought the male main character Judah had more depth early on and expected a bit more of that from Soledad. Plus, and I want to avoid any spoilers here since the book isn't even out yet, there is very little on page time between Soledad and Judah for a majority of the book. It's more about their separate storylines, with his story turning from that of a father and his sons to a man who thinks about Soledad all the time. And her journey, which includes becoming a viral social media star (over a vinaigrette recipe?!) felt convenient and personally just not that interesting or believable.This book is very dialogue heavy, too. And unfortunately most of the exposition or character development is done through stilted conversations between the characters where they explain stuff to each other for the reader's edification, which makes the dialogue feel unnatural. I would've much rather the characters speak like normal people, and since the book is written entirely in first person, each character narrating their chapter could have just directly addressed the reader or made comments to themselves about things we needed to find out. Because the dialogue suffered and the book relies so heavily on characters speaking, it definitely brought down my enjoyment of the book.I am hoping some of these issues are resolved in the final edits before the book is published. I can't quote the book here because I read an early copy, but I really don't remember having these issues with Before I Let Go, which made reading this feel like it was from a completely different author.I see a lot of really positive early s, so again, take my  with some pause and if you are still interested in reading this one, go for it. I think between those more technical issues and my disinterest in what type of romance this turned out to be, I didn't have the best time with it. But I am still willing to pick up the next book in the series when it comes out next year following Hendrix's character, when I'm in the mood for something light and romantic. I think her story could be really fun!...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 20, 2024","Feb 22, 2024","Dec 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/182762109-this-could-be-us

The story follows a young Black man in the year or so leading up to the 2008 election as he works for “the Senator“(a.k.a. Obama). I really liked the sound of this premise, however, that’s only a small portion of what the book really is. There’s a lot of meditations on religion and education, as the main character, David, is discovering himself after failing out of college. His work on the campaign takes him to many different places, and he sees wealth And power exploited in the name of politics.However, I can’t help but feel this would have been more interesting as a memoir or collection of essays from the author, as David, the main character is clearly a stand-in for the author himself. I think books, like this can work in terms of auto-fiction, with the author drawing clear parallels between their characters and their own experiences. But I just didn’t feel the form of a novel was being utilized to its full capacity here. There was no deeper character exploration or through-line in terms of plot or themes (at least not by the end of Part 1, nearly a quarter of the way into the novel), that pulled me forward and made me want to read more. The author is clearly a skilled writer at a sentence level, but that wasn’t enough for me to stay engaged.If readers can look past the issues I had with this novel (because I do acknowledge my ‘problems’ with it were just personal preferences), then I think there is a lot to enjoy here. It just wasn’t for me. [Thanks to the publisher for sending me an early copy for .

After Hosam's departure, Khaled begins the long walk back from the station to the apartment he's lived in for three decades, and along this meandering and meditate walk he dives into the history that brought him to London from Libya so many years ago.As a child in Libya, Khaled heard a bizarre but compelling short story on the BBC radio about a man who was slowly eaten by his cat, piece by piece, until finally the man resists with a single word: ""No."" This story, written by Hosam Zowa, would transform Khaled's life, pushing him to go to Edinburgh to study literature where he meets a fellow Libyan young man named Mustafa. Eventually, Mustafa convinces Khaled to go down to London to attend a protest outside the Libyan embassy against Gaddafi's dictatorship in 1984. While attending the protest, the two men are shot; yet their survival renders them static—unable to return to school for fear of exposure as radicals against Gaddafi's regime by fellow Libyan spies or their homeland for being wanted for their purported crimes. With this narrative, Hisham Matar expertly weaves together meditations on what it means to have a home, to be at peace with the world around you, to make a life for oneself after unimaginable tragedy. The title alludes to advice Khaled's father gives him when leaving home, that he only need a few good friends and work to make a life, as he also warns him not to get sucked into 'their world,' to keep a firm grip on his reality and maintain a strong sense of self. This novel is also deeply political—as all books are—and considers the role that writers have in revolution. From Hosam Zowa's powerful short story that so deeply impacts Khaled's life to the many writers he studies in university and whose homes across London (from Virginia Woolf to Robert Louis Stevenson) Mustafa turns into a sort of pilgrimage to visit. Some books get their hooks in you from the very start. Others steadily grow on you, never quite leaving your mind while you aren't reading them. This was the latter; a book I wanted to return to again and again, a book I wanted to speed through but also take my time with to savor the experience. The novel opens:""It is, of course, impossible to be certain of what is contained in anyone's chest, least of all one's own or those we know well, perhaps especially those we know best, but, as I stand here on the upper level of King's Cross Station, from where I can monitor my old friend Hosam Zowa walking across the concourse, I feel I am seeing right into him, perceiving him more accurately than ever before, as though all along, during the two decades that we have known one another, our friendship has been a study and now, ironically, just after we have bid one another farewell, his portrait is finally coming into view."" When I completed the novel last night, I immediately turned to that beginning and revisited the first 20 pages. To my surprise, the ending was there all along; Khaled had detailed so much of what we, much later, come to know—and yet he had taken us, over the course of a single night's walk back, through history as he finally returns home that I'd lost myself along the way only to feel, at the end, like one of his friends.
