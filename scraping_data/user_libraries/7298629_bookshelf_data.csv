Czerski has a poetic writing style that neither becomes too overwrought nor sacrifices accuracy for the sake of poetry. As a fellow science writer, the second one is very important to me. In reading The Blue Machine, I learned a lot about the ocean, including answers to questions I didn't know to ask.Some of the information felt a bit extraneous, and, true, this book could have been shorter. But ultimately those parts were rendered with such delight that I gave in and accepted that I would learn about herring and tuna and the myriad functions of poop in oceanic ecosystems. Everything is connected. I enjoyed seeing those connections through Czerski's expert eyes, because even while she's teaching us, it's obvious that she still views the ocean with wonder. Shouldn't we all?I'd recommend this book for readers who enjoyed Susan Casey's The Underworld: Journeys to the Depths of the Ocean.

Ignore the three-star rating. It's meaningless. Instead, I'll summarize my experience oThis is one of those books, for me, that is difficult to rate. Ignore the three-star rating. It's meaningless. Instead, I'll summarize my experience of reading Demon Copperhead. The first hundred pages were painful. Demon Copperhead is incredibly voice-driven, and if you don't like that voice, which starts out sounding very uneducated, you'll have a rough time. Knowing the David Copperfield story, which is the basis of Demon Copperhead's inspiration, I speed-read the first hundred pages. Suddenly, I found myself gripped, and I had to slow down and linger.Kingsolver's writing shines best in scenes, which she renders in vivid yet economical detail. Unfortunately, I found these scenes to be overshadowed by the narrator. As a person, Demon Copperhead was someone I felt for, someone I could root for. Ultimately, I felt his character got lost in the weeds of the narration. And because I already know the David Copperfield story, there wasn't much to propel me forward to keep reading.At a certain point, I realized that there wasn't anything in the plot that hooked me. The social commentary—about Big Pharma, poverty, and an Appalachia that has been left behind—aren't new. They're things I've read before from authors that made them feel more authentic. These things have been said, so I wanted to see them from a new, astonishing angle. That just wasn't here.I ended up gritting my teeth and speeding back up to finish the book.Now I'm at a bit of a loss to rate Demon Copperhead. It does a lot of things really right. Kingsolver is clearly a master of her craft, and many of the issues I had with the novel come down to personal taste. On the other hand, I was confused why she chose this subject matter. Dickens spoke up for those who could not speak for themselves. But we don't live in Victorian London. There are plenty of Appalachian writers who grew up in poverty who can weave that world with nuance and illuminate its surprises. I'm not sure if Kingsolver has Appalachian roots, but something about the rendering of details—perhaps how at times DC felt like a checklist of Appalachian cliches—made me feel like she was too far removed from the concerns of her subject to render them adequately.All this said, I understand why other people like this book. This is my first Kingsolver book, and it won't be the last....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 18, 2023","Aug 03, 2023","Jul 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead

Google searches for “anxiety symptoms” hit an all-time high in October, according to Google Trends. With the swearing-in of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and news that climate disaster is closer than we thought, hope may be the farthest idea from our minds.It’s easy to assume that the only people who possess cheery thoughts like hope are those willfully not paying attention. But as Anne Lamott shows us in her essay collection, Almost Everything: Notes on Hope, faith can exist side-by-side with uncertainty, as humor can with doom.Almost Everything, as you might expect from the title, includes a little bit of everything, connected by the central threads of humor and resilience against adversity. The essays in the collection are small morsels, offering tastes of Lamott’s wisdom about enduring themes like faith and family.The rest of Lamott’s oeuvre spans decades and genres. Her first novel, Hard Laughter, was published in 1980. Since then, Lamott has published 18 books, including novels and essay collections. While her welcoming style often uses wit, she has covered topics, like alcoholism and cancer, that many other writers find difficult to render on the page, much less joke about.It’s more important than ever to find humor in the darkness. As many of us stand up to resist ingrained systems of oppression, whether in the voting booth or in our daily lives, with each setback, it becomes easier to see the problems of our time as insurmountable. But if we lose hope, we’ll stop fighting, and our struggle will have been for nothing.Almost Everything offers a dose of levity, but it doesn’t stray from the truth. At a time when many of us, myself included, require that kind of irrepressible wit just to get by, I had the privilege of talking to Lamott about her new book, writing, and staying hopeful in these uncertain times....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 24, 2018","Nov 10, 2018","Sep 24, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39203790-almost-everything

Any  of mine could never do this book justice, so here is a quote from the book itself:We are still killing black youth because we have not yet killed white supremacy. As a political program white supremacy avers that white people have a right to rule. That is obviously morally unacceptable, and few of its devotees will speak its name. But that enfeebled faith is not nearly so insidious and lethal as its robust, covert and often unconscious cousin: the assumption that God has created humanity in a hierarchy of moral, cultural and intellectual worth, with lighter-skinned people at the top and darker-skinned people at the bottom...To see beyond the ghosts, all of us must develop the moral vision and political will to crush white supremacy — both the political program and the concealed assumptions. We have to come to grips with our own history — not only genocide, slavery, exploitation and systems of oppression, but also the legacies of those who resisted and fought back and still fight back. We must find what Dr. King called the “strength to love.” New social movements must confront head-on the racial chasm in American life. “Not everything that is faced can be changed,” Baldwin instructs, “but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”You can read a longer excerpt in the Atlanta Journal Constitution: http://specials.myajc.com/emmett-till/...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 06, 2018","Feb 08, 2018","Feb 06, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753852-the-blood-of-emmett-till

Here are some of the big ideas in Big Magic that I 100% agree with: - You have permission to be an artist. No one can tell you otherwise. - You are not responsible for how people feel about your work. Just fulfill your creative desire. - Being a perfectionist sucks, and it'll get in the way of your writing. - The idea that making art should be painful is ridiculous and destructive. Follow wonder. Enjoy making art. If you aren't enjoying it even a little, why are you doing it?There has been a refrain among my cohort in our MFA: ""Make art! Do things!"" It's half joking, half exhortation.

At times, it can seem that grief is monolithic, but not every culture deals with death aFew life events affect us more than the death of a loved one. At times, it can seem that grief is monolithic, but not every culture deals with death and grief in the same way. The death culture of the US endeavors to paint a pleasing facade over what we consider macabre. Embalmers camouflage the reality of the grave with chemicals and adornments. Cemeteries wall off the dead behind stone, concrete, and coffin wood. In her nonfiction book     From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death  ,   Caitlin Doughty delves into death cultures around the globe, thus casting a stark contrast between our national death avoidance and cultures that literally take death into their arms.On her binge of thanotourism, Doughty investigated cultures in Belize, Indonesia, Mexico, Japan, Spain, and Bolivia in addition to small enclaves within the United States. She found two striking commonalities between cultures that don’t deny or try to hide the inevitability of death, in other words, “death positive” cultures. The first is that these cultures live closely with the dead and are not afraid to touch their bodies or their relics. For example, the people of Tana Toraja, Indonesia celebrate   ma’nene, during which they exhume the bodies of their loved ones to clean and commune with the mummies. In Bolivia, many households keep   ñatitas, skulls of the dead believed to possess a sacred link with the divine. The second commonality is that, in death positive cultures, the living feel a sense of purpose in caring for the dead. In Mexico, during the famous   Dia de los Muertos, families bring offerings to the graves of their loved ones to share a night with their returned spirits. Even in Japan, custom dictates that family members pick through the deceased’s ashes with chopsticks and deposit their bones into an urn.[image]Doughty brings the life of these cultures to the page with vivid details, some of which aren’t for the faint of heart. However, Doughty’s appealing, insightful, often sarcastic voice makes this morbid topic approachable. This clear writing prowess in combination with her experience as a Los Angeles mortician allow Doughty to make effective contrasts between American death culture and what she believes are healthier attitudes towards death. “In my practice as a mortician,” says Doughty, “I’ve found that both cleaning the body and spending time with it serves a powerful role in processing grief. It helps mourners see the corpse not as a cursed object, but as a beautiful vessel that once held their loved one.”Despite her Anthony-Bordainesque adventures, Doughty’s message is clear: she wants her American readers to reassess not only how they view death but how they perform grief. She wants Americans to turn away from “business models, upselling families on mahogany caskets and marble headstones” but saving the talk of death until the last minute to a culture that speaks openly about death and honors our dead and our environment instead of building walls to protect ourselves from reality.NOTE: I received a digital arc of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest .

Elvis’s peculiar proclivities stem in part from her mother, a failed naturalist who settled for teaching in community college in Alabama. Mom herself harbors quite a bit of quirk. For one, she always makes her daughters, Elvis and Lizzie, rabbit-shaped cakes complete with raspberry blood for their birthdays. But that isn’t the only weird thing about Mom. Read more…Mom is a sleep-swimmer. Instead of just stumbling around when she sleepwalks, she goes for a dip in the river. This happens so frequently that she goes to bed in her bathing suit, and her husband sleeps in swim trunks.That is, until one night she drowns, and Elvis, Lizzie, and Dad’s worlds are all thrown off-kilter. Elvis doesn’t believe her mother’s death was an accident, and so, amid her research into the sleeping habits of the animal world, Elvis goes on a quest to find out who her mother really was and so to figure out what really happened to her. Of course, family weirdness gets in the way. Lizzie and Dad both deal with their grief differently. Dad adopts a parrot that can mimic his deceased wife’s voice. Sometimes he puts on Mom's favorite shades of lipstick. Meanwhile, Lizzie’s grief has caused her to inherit her mother’s unusual somnambulatory adventures. Except instead of swimming, Lizzie eats or even bakes!Annie Hartnett’s debut novel Rabbit Cake is a quirky, sweet, full-hearted exploration of grief and family, and it is on sale today, March 7th, 2017. Get it while the rabbit cakes are fresh from the oven and the raspberry blood is still warm - from Tin House books or your local indie bookstore.Disclaimer: I received an ARC copy from Tin House's First to Read program in exchange for my honest opinion....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 04, 2017","Feb 24, 2017","Jan 21, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30304223-rabbit-cake

While I think it improved drastically as the story went on, I think it was lacking in several areas, most prominent being world-building and voice.While there were times that I felt absolutely sucked in, every once in a while something about the magic would throw me out of the story. Sometimes it read like a Harry Potter pastiche. Replace the word staves with wands, and I'd believe we'd been sucked into a Victorian Ministry of Magic. That sounds awesome. If only there weren't so many complicating factors. The whole sorcerers versus magicians thing seemed superficial at best. But the thing I didn't like most were the monsters. It was like JK Rowling meets HP Lovecraft - with one important element missing: voice.The narration often read like bland reportage to me. I couldn't get any of the emotions from the character. It might say she felt sad, or it would narrate a physical reaction of sadness, but I couldn't feel that sadness. The main character Henrietta read, until the very end, as unsympathetic and robotic.

MaIn his book The Witch of Lime Street, David Jaher paints a picture of a lesser-known aspect of the Roaring Twenties: its obsession with the occult. Many families lost loved ones in the Great War’s trenches. A growing number of them, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, took solace in Spiritualism, which taught that death was not an end but a new beginning. This interest brought the concept of seances into the public eye. Even Scientific American did a series on occultism, eventually hosting a contest to find a true spirit medium. Their intent was—using scientific means—to either debunk spiritualism as a widespread hoax or to ground it in fact. Unlike Sherlock Holmes’s creator, Harry Houdini was not convinced. A master of smoke and mirrors, Houdini became Scientific American’s go-to fraud spotter. He easily exposed countless charlatans, until he finally met his match: Mina ""Margery"" Crandon, the eponymous Witch of Lime Street.So many of the things I find fascinating intersected in this book: the Roaring Twenties, Spiritualism, science, mystery—and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Please. I was all over it. But ultimately, the book didn’t live up to my expectations. What it came down to was not the subject matter—that was just plain cool—but the way it was related to the reader. To me, the author seemed disinterested. Sure, there is a battle for the fate of our souls going on (the question: is there scientific evidence to support the existence of an afterlife?), but it seems like Jaher has no skin in the game. He doesn’t care if Houdini outsmarts the Crandons; so ultimately, neither does the reader.Jaher’s reportage-like tone comes in part from his attention to detail—too much detail, actually. He has tried to fit too much research into the story, so that this reads like an overview of occultism in the 1920s instead of what would be more compelling: the lives of the characters involved, specifically Mina Crandon and Harry Houdini. If Jaher had fleshed out his narrative with dips into their psyches, using their thoughts from personal correspondence and diaries, the story would have had a greater depth, and it would have been more meaningful. He could have even told the story closer to their perspectives by using more free indirect discourse. (Jaher makes a few attempts at this, like on page 241, but the brunt of the narrative does not make use of this close of a perspective, and it suffers for that lack.) If Jaher had told the story from a narrative perspective closer to the characters, he would have elevated the story from the level of a textbook and grounded it in the realm of biography, drastically improving the story without changing any of the important details, because what really matters here is not the whats but the whos. The people in The Witch of Lime Street had the potential to be more compelling than the events. Their beliefs were at stake, their views of the world, their very existence. But Jaher just didn’t make it happen.That isn’t to say that I didn’t like parts of the story. Many of the descriptions were interesting, and I commend Jaher’s thorough research and attention to detail. If the 1920s and occultism interest you, definitely read this book. But if those aren’t your bag, I’d say skip it.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Dec 18, 2016","Dec 21, 2016","Dec 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24724228-the-witch-of-lime-street

Set in Mill Valley, California, at the real life Tamalpais High School, the story centers on a fledgling teacher, Molly Nicoll, as she discovers and comes to terms with the complex lives of her students and her role (or absence) in their evolution as people. With perspectives that alternate between Molly and the main group of her students, Johnson weaves a series of interconnected life stories that create a portrait not only of the idyllic Mill Valley, with its towering redwoods and foggy views of San Fransisco Bay, she creates a portrait from the inside, from the multifaceted and often breaking hearts of the teenagers who are beginning their lives there.Each student’s story highlights the ups and downs of what it’s like to grow up in privilege. Or course there is money, but there’s also pressure, family strife, and self destruction; and like all teenagers, Miss Nicoll’s students are trying desperately to create the people who they will someday be. The stories bookend with the tragedy of Calista Broderick and how she triggered the bullying of her middle-school admirer, Tristan Bloch. The first major event in the novel is Tristan’s suicide. The rest of the novel pulses with the undercurrent of this tragedy, casting into stark relief the complacency, selfishness, and cruelty in each of his classmates’ narratives. To paraphrase Louis C.K.: Everything is beautiful, and no one is happy.Obviously, Johnson has a great deal to be proud of with this novel. It’s a stellar debut with many accomplishments. The teenagers talk like teenagers, and they have to deal with normal things, like being “dress-coded”. They misspell things in text messages. They eat junk food and wipe their hands on the furniture. The teachers, too, are spot-on. They complain and worry, build up barriers or overstep their boundaries. Johnson handles social media particularly well, as she does with social and digital taboos.Johnson’s most noteworthy accomplishment here lies in her ability to differentiate between the voices of her many characters. Each point of view sounds different and gives depth to the character, because their diction and tone match the characters’ thoughts.Here are two sections for contrast. The first is from the POV of Damon Flintov, the class troublemaker: ""At the bathroom sink he faced his reflection, ran a palm over his buzz cut. He liked to keep it short—liked the shivery feel of the clippers over his scalp and the dents and gleams his skull made in the mirror. He cracked his neck and felt the donut of flesh at the base of his skull. He hated how he always knew it was there. Hated his fleshy belly, his chest like a woman’s tits. As a kid he’d worn a T-shirt in the pool. Now he wore bigass shirts and jeans and he just didn’t fuckin’ swim. He wasn’t into exercise, ever since that asshole JV football coach kicked him off the team for grades. He didn’t care, he said at the time, loud enough so everyone could hear. Football at Tam was bunk anyway. ""His body was what it was, no changing it. But his clothes were bomb and he took care of that shit. The shirt matched the shoes matched the hat. That night, he chose a blazing-purple T-shirt with a neon-yellow swoosh and highlighter-yellow kicks designed to blind. He swabbed alcohol over the silver studs in his eyebrows and trimmed the stray hairs in his nose. Finally, he took out his Swiss army knife that he got for his last birthday, cut his fingernails and scraped the dirt from underneath, jabbed his cuticles with the little plastic stick, snipped his hangnails with the tiny silver scissors. Say what you want about him, he had beautiful fuckin’ hands.""The next is from Emma Fleed, the party-girl dancer:""Emma Fleed danced alone. A vast stage. Shafts of light beamed against her body, warming her face and dazzling her sequined skirt. It was a ballet she did not remember learning, yet her body eased into the movements like it had known them all her life. Oddly, she heard no music, just a steady humming through her body, through the room. The audience was a red-black sea beyond the footlights. She rolled onto the boxes of her toe shoes, rose en pointe. Driving her toes into the floor, she steadied her ankles and flexed her calves and stretched out of her feet, arms above her head, until it felt like floating. Then she stepped and leapt, splitting her legs in the air, and landed with such lightness that only she could hear the soft thud of her slippers on the wood. She set, pirouetted, spotting a point beyond the lights. Rising and spinning, holding her head in perfect stillness before whipping around at the last possible second. Applause shook the room. Her center was holding. Her legs were strong. In this moment, she was exactly where she was meant to be.""Any writer could learn from Johnson by studying how elegantly she differentiates POVs.However, The Most Dangerous Place on Earth isn’t perfect. My first qualm has nothing to do with Johnson’s writing. While this novel is being marketed as YA, it is decidedly an adult literary novel. That isn’t Johnson’s fault. So when you read this novel, I suggest that you come to it in the right frame of mind. Anthony Doerr called it “Less than Zero for the digital age,” and I think that could not be more on point.Another issue expressed in other s is that the novel is very white. There is only one POV character, David Chu, who is not caucasian. Even so, this representation corresponds to the racial makeup of Mill Valley, which is almost 90% white. Johnson is portraying reality, not prejudices. In that, she is representing a true issue in wealth inequality in our country, as referenced toward the beginning of the book with Miss Nicoll’s class discussion on The Great Gatsby and the American Dream.My biggest concern at first was how imbalanced the novel seemed. It begins with a major tragedy, Tristan’s suicide. While the final chapter from Calista’s perspective attempts to balance and bookend the initial tragedy, I felt like it didn’t succeed. But the more I thought about it, the more I started to think that maybe that was the point. In the end, there was no easy answer to how Calista (and everyone else) felt about the tragedy that punctuated the outset of their adolescence. Portraying one would have been a lie, because for some of the students, Tristan’s life was only a blip on the radar, and for others like Calista, the idea of him will linger with them, begging what-ifs ad infinitum. In undergrad, my fiction writing professor Mark Powell always said that the best stories don’t set out to offer answers. They seek to state life’s problems most clearly. In that, Lindsey Lee Johnson’s The Most Dangerous Place on Earth is truly accomplished.Disclaimer: I received a digital ARC from Netgalley in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Dec 17, 2016","Dec 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32737635-the-most-dangerous-place-on-earth

Most aristocrats wield astonishing magical powers in addition to their powers of wealth, governance, and prestige. The common folk are kept down by a law that requires them to complete their “slave days,” ten years of brutal servitude beneath the rule of the Equals. But the commoners can’t cower forever. In Gilded Cage, they begin to realize the strength in their numbers and how oppression steels people who were once soft.Gilded Cage is characterized by layers. In the way of the best works of fantasy literature, the reader comes away with the impression that they have only read the very surface. The characters seem real. They all have hopes, passions, and dreams. Even those who might be villains have a positive side.In all, Gilded Cage left me with the impression that there is so much more that this world has to offer.

However, The Tempest is probably one of Shakespeare's plays that I know the least. That being said, I wasn’t comparing and contrasting the original versus the interpretation; and this version, more than anything, acts as an exegesis, a teaching text, of the original.Set in a Canadian prison, the main character Felix Philips teaches literacy through theater, but his endeavor isn’t completely altruistic. In the beginning of the novel, Felix is the main director at the semi-famous Makeshewig Festival, but he’s going off the deep end. He takes too many directorial risks, and many of the people he works with want him out. This makes it all the easier for Tony, his highest underling in the theater company, to usurp his place as director and have him fired.After being kicked out of the theater company that was his life, Felix retreats to a hermitage in the country. There, he putters around, not doing much except hallucinating his dead daughter. His is Prospero, and his daughter is Miranda. After about fifty pages of this, he decides to take the job at the prison.To be honest, the plot doesn’t progress at the rate I would like. There is a lot of nothing between Felix getting fired and things really picking up at the prison. A chunk of this takes up a third of the book.The plot doesn’t kick into gear until the end. Tony and Sal McNally, the two men who ousted him from Makeshewig and who are now government officials, have the power to decide if the literacy through theater program can keep its funding. It happens that they’re scheduled to visit when the prisoners are putting on their rendition of The Tempest. So Felix makes plans, not only to get revenge on Tony and Sal, but to also save the literacy program.While parts of the book are downright dull, Atwood is undeniably brilliant. Her prose is consistently stellar and astonishing, and her interpretation and explanation of The Tempest are downright genius. I think what it comes down to is that, while I’m a fan of the subject matter, and this wasn't really the book for me, I can still acknowledge its greatness.Disclaimer: I received an ARC copy from Blogging for Books in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 25, 2016","Nov 28, 2016","Oct 25, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28588073-hag-seed

I teach creative writing, and I've tried to make a study of ""what works"" in popular stories. Liza Cron both hits and misses in this book.The strongest section by far is Part II ""Creating the Inside Story."" One of the things I've noticed many of my students do is create short stories that encompass a series of exciting events that don't really matter. Cron says essentially that it's the character's internal struggle that makes the external struggle important. I totally agree with that.For me, there are two major things that make a story work:1. Characters that the reader can feel for, who want something and do things to get it; and 2. A promise is made in the beginning that the story fulfills.Cron says those two things more or less. The major problem with this book is that Cron goes on and on and ON belaboring each and every point as if her reader must be thick in the head. The pretend novel that was being developed throughout the book fueled this fire. Those parts were so boring and useless that by the end of part two, I mostly skipped them. The examples Cron uses from actual books, like The Great Gatsby and A Prayer for Owen Meany (okay, okay, I know I'm being biased here, because those are two of my favorite novels; Cron has good taste) do a much better job of illustrating her point than the crappy in-development stuff she's padding her word count with.Basically, that's what this book read like: a little bit of really stellar advice that was almost eclipsed by the rest of the junk surrounding it.My advice? If you read this, check it out from the library.

That is pretty irThis  was originally posted on my blog: beckyrenner.comThe Ballroom, a novel by Anna Hope, is a book with a split personality. That is pretty ironic considering that it is set in an early 20th century mental hospital on the English moors. Truthfully, I was a bit wary of the subject matter at first. Many authors have a tendency to either romanticize or vilify people with mental illness. Although The Ballroom centers around a romance, the greatest accomplishment of the novel is that it does neither, instead portraying the characters as human being with thoughts, fears, and troubles just like anyone else. Hope also seeks to enlighten her readers with the lesser-known treatment of those who are mentally ill. To do this, Hope writes a doctor character who wishes to take part in the implementation of a eugenics program in England, starting with Sharston, the mental institution where the novel takes place.Except little of this drama comes to pass in the first half of the novel. Frankly, I’m not sure anything happened in the fist half. A main character was institutionalized, we learn a little background of the protagonists and antagonists, and there is a Coronation Day festival with costumes and a tug-of-war. But really, nothing from the main plot takes hold until more than 100 pages pass. I almost bailed on this book several times, because 100 pages is well past my ditch point, but I struggled onward.Past the halfway mark, the story goes from bland to remarkable. There is love and secrecy, there are plans of escape, pregnancy, torture, illness, death! The story has stakes, too: will the doctor succeed in his eugenics plan? Will Ella be forced to abort her baby? Will Ella and John ever be together? Can they escape? Will they get caught? Even the prose blossoms. Check this paragraph out:“At the entrance to the mortuary, the young nurse stepped back, nodding him forward. Charles pushed open the door and stepped inside. The room was filled with a strange aqueous light, almost as though he were standing in a cavern at the bottom of the sea. Miss Church lay on the slab in the middle of the room, and from where he stood she might have been asleep. He made his way over to where she lay. Some careful person had brushed her hair so it coursed over her pillow, and a strange brightness seemed to emanate from her skin. Her position, with her hands folded over her chest and the sheet pulled up to her chin, her hair like that and the submarine light, all added to the impression that she might have been drowned, but the bandages around her wrists gave the lie to that. He touched his finger to her cheek. Its coldness was a shock. He turned to the nurse. ‘How?’”Dark and beautiful, and frankly completely different from the turgid prose that inhabits the first part of the novelThe second half of the novel is a five for me. With beautiful prose, dire stakes, characters I can root for, and excellent research on the history of mental health treatment (that is still a relevant topic), the second half of The Ballroom is a stellar read.Too bad the first half is every part as bad as the second part is good. One star, maybe. If you can make the trudge past the dull first 100 pages, I’d say go for it. But if you’re an impatient reader like me, start in the middle.Disclaimer: A digital arc copy was furnished to me by Net Galley in exchange for my honest opinion....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 13, 2016","Sep 25, 2016","Jul 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26797014-the-ballroom

Goodreads calls it “thrilling novel based on actual events.” They mention gaslights and Tesla, and I was sold.

Click here to follow me on beckyrenner.com.Review of All the Ugly and Wonderful Things by Bryn GreenwoodI’ve been waiting all year for a book to break my heart, and this is it. All the Ugly and Wonderful Things by Bryn Greenwood lives up to its title, showing life in all its light and darkness, all the pain and relief. All the Ugly and Wonderful Things is a love story, but I wouldn’t call it a romance novel. It revolves around a girl named Wavonna Quinn, Wavy for short, and her love for Jesse Joe Kellen. This coming-of-age story spans thirteen years, through which Wavy deals with abuse from her parents and psychological trauma as well as the usual trappings of growing up, like school. Throughout these years, Kellen is her rock, her one constant. Sounds pretty standard, right?The wrench in the works here is that Jesse Joe Kellen is more than ten years Wavy's senior. Jessie Joe fell in love with Wavy when she was eight years old. But don’t worry (I certainly did). It doesn’t get lewd. Greenwood uses her powerful gift with words to give nuance to the narrative, making All the Ugly and Wonderful Things neither a tragedy nor a romance, but a portrayal of life’s hardness and softness that broke my heart and then tried to gather up the pieces.The most wonderful part of All the Ugly and Wonderful Things is how the characters shine through the prose. The narrative shifts deftly between perspectives, using one perspective per chapter. In one chapter, a teenage Wavy describes the suffering and happiness she sees in others:	“During my junior year, a boy in Amy’s class killed himself. He had terrible acne, purple welts like bee stings all over his face, and he went home from school and hung himself. I could have told him there was no sense in rushing toward being dead. It would find you soon enough, and before it did there were pleasures to make your heart hurt less. If I lay very still in bed at night, I remembered how Grandma’s house smelled. The taste of mint ice cream on Kellen’s tongue. Donal jumping on the bed to wake me up.”All the Ugly and Wonderful Things is not a simple novel with a pat ending. There are no easy fixes. Even after the plot wraps up, none of the characters are unbroken, but it does show us that there are stars in even the darkest sky, tiny pinpoints of light to ease the heartache. In that way, All the Ugly and Wonderful Things shows us what life is like, both painful and extraordinary, full of ugly things certainly, but wonderful things, too.Disclaimer: I received an ARC from Netgalley in exchange for my unbiased ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jul 09, 2016","Aug 08, 2016","Jul 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26114135-all-the-ugly-and-wonderful-things

I finished it a few days ago, and since then, I’ve been ruminating on it. In its essence, Cruel Beautiful World is a novel about family and love. But the horrible underside of humanity is afoot as well. Yes, it takes place during the same time as the Manson murders, but that isn’t the true specter that hangs over the characters’ psyches. The true roots of the novel’s conflict lie in the question: How well can we really know the ones we love?The climax and denouement of Cruel Beautiful World answer this question two ways. Without giving you any spoilers, I’ll say that one represents the beautiful and one represents the cruel.Plot-wise, Cruel Beautiful World kept me guessing, but it also made me think. The prose is full of detail and texture. Leavitt uses concrete imagery to convey a strong sense of time period and setting. Check out this section of character description to see how Leavitt deftly weaves history into the narrative:“Not only did he support the antiwar movement, but he’d marched in Boston a few months ago and even got to talk to Abbie Hoffman, who was there giving a speech. William wore a Not-So-Silent Spring button on his jacket lapel, a dot of yellow imprinted with an upraised red fist that held a sprig of greenery. ‘Hey, hey, LBJ. How many kids did you kill today?’ he chanted, and then he told them the answer, writing on the board the Vietnam death toll for 1968—16,899—a number so staggeringly high that the kids shifted uneasily in their seats, because they knew there was a draft. The boys could be called up one day. Their lives could end, just like that. ‘Not if you resist the draft,’ William assured them. He draw a map of Canada on the blackboard and tapped the chalk on it. ‘Or go here,’” (Leavitt).Holy characterization, Batman!Over all, Cruel Beautiful World is not a book of easy answers. There is no good without the bad (and sometimes vice versa?). I recommend this book to readers who enjoy family novels with a tinge of darkness. Cruel Beautiful World is full of emotion. I think I cried at least twice, and my heart is as black as my coffee.Disclaimer: I received a digital ARC copy from Netgalley in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 09, 2016","Oct 29, 2016","Jul 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28110866-cruel-beautiful-world

The only area where you’re free to do just as you like. And even that doesn’t turn out how you wanted,” (Kang 182).On its surface, The Vegetarian by Han Kang is a deeply disturbing story of a woman’s descent into madness. But don’t let the surface fool you. At its core, this novel is about the rules for femininity that confine Korean society.While The Vegetarian is divided into three sections, each section centers on the main character, Yeong-hye. It is absolutely vital to the novel’s message that the story be told from outside points of view. The first two of these perspectives are male: Yeong-hye’s husband and Yeong-hye’s brother in law. From her husband’s perspective, Yeong-hye’s first symptom of insanity is that she stops eating or cooking meat, in direct disobedience to her husband and father. This section comes to a head when her father tries to physically force Yeong-hye to eat meat. Yeong-hye resists, and in an act of defiance, she cuts herself with a knife.The second section, from Yeong-hye’s brother-in-law’s perspective furthers the process of othering Yeong-hye. Yeong-hye’s brother-in-law, an artist, sexualizes her in two pieces of artwork, the first where she is alone, her naked body painted with flowers, the second in which she is part of a sexual act. The second ultimately turns into a pornographic video between Yeong-hye and her brother-in-law. Eventually, Yeong-hye makes it clear that it’s not the artist that turns her on, but the art: she is gratified by the flowers painted on their bodies. This is because Yeong-hye believes she is becoming a plant.In-hye, the third section’s narrator, institutionalizes her sister Yeong-hye for this seemingly insane belief. However, Yeong-hye’s real problem, it seems, is anorexia. By the end of the book, she has refused to eat completely. But is Yeong-hye’s experience entirely mundane? I don’t think so. I believe there is something supernatural at work, especially because of the dreams and visions experienced by several characters throughout the book. Yet no matter how surreal Yeong-hye’s experience is, she is confined, and her free will and the right to make choices for her own body are taken away, reminiscent of treatment for “hysteria” in the Victorian West. Kang ultimately underscores the tragedy of Yeong-hye’s loss of agency with her choice of a female narrator for the book’s final section, in contrast to the men who have voiced the rest of the book, superimposing their own desire and lack over Yeong-hye’s body and mind.I highly recommend The Vegetarian by Han Kang. It’s astonishing (but tight!) prose and highly significant subject matter would make it the perfect book for readers of literary fiction and maybe even for book clubs that want to push the envelope and spark discussion.Disclaimer: A free copy of this book was furnished to me by Blogging for Books in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Sep 16, 2016","Sep 17, 2016","Jul 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25489025-the-vegetarian

The blurbs all touted its portrayal of Hollywood’s golden age. Murder, yoI went into my reading of June by Miranda Beverly-Wittemore with excitement. The blurbs all touted its portrayal of Hollywood’s golden age. Murder, you say? Dark family secrets? All in a beautiful mansion that has fallen into disrepair? That’s totally in my wheelhouse, so I jumped on it as soon as I could. By now, I should know better than to go into a novel with so many expectations. Luckily, I wasn’t totally let down. Although June is far from being perfect, it ultimately delivers on its promises with a very satisfying end.June switches between two years, 1955 and 2015. In 1955, a Hollywood movie crew has come to St. Jude, Ohio (which reminded me of Winesburg, Ohio, *shudder*), and June—the character, not the month in which both time periods stay—falls in love with a dashing Hollywood star, Jack Montgomery. Intrigue, murder, and blackmail all follow. It’s too bad that Beverly-Wittemore saves these until the last 3rd of the book. In the 2015 sections, Cassie Danvers, who has been living in her grandmother June’s decaying mansion since June’s death, receives word that she will inherit millions from Jack Montgomery, this famous Old Hollywood movie star who she has never met. Tate Montgomery, Jack’s starlet daughter, isn’t exactly keen on this idea. So Tate comes to Winesburg—I mean, St. Jude—to get Cassie to take a DNA test.But just for the sake of being contrary, or maybe it’s to string out the plot, Cassie refuses to take the test while she and her limp noodle love interest, Nick, search for solid proof that Jack Montgomery could be her great grandfather. I’m not sure why they needed to do this, because Two Oaks, that beautiful, decaying mansion willed to Cassie by June, gives people sleeping inside it dreams of the past. Heck, Two Oaks sometimes acts as focal “character” for parts of the narration. It’s an if-walls-could-talk kind of thing. The odd surrealism of the house and the bloated intro almost made me bail. Truly, little happened before about page 150. Sections like this chunky-clunky paragraph dragged the narrative down:“Which she then opened, discovering the light was all funny for morning. Too yellow, too flat. The revelation of afternoon made Cassie’s conviction waver; she knew what Nick would think when he saw her: not a grown-up. But why should she care? Did she care? Why did she care? She wished she had time to go back upstairs, change into something better. No, that was caring, wasn’t it? Not caring was standing here, wearing whatever she wanted. Wasn’t it? Should she disappear back into the house, and let them wait by the front door, let them ring? She wasn’t sure she could handle that horrible sound again,” (Beverly-Whittemore 76).This is kind of unlike me, but I urge you to get past them. The narrative certainly has its problems: sometimes dithering prose, a plot that drags its feet, and a few out-of-character moments for Cassie. But the last 3rd of the book, to me, was worth the rest of the slog. It’s interesting enough to feel like I didn’t waste my time. In the end, June lived up to its promises. It was a satisfying read, but it could have used a little pruning.I received this book from Blogging for Books for this . (It’s a beautiful hardback copy that I’m really a fan of.)...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 28, 2016","Jul 30, 2016","Jul 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26236800-june

Or at least it’s trying to be. In Shakespeare’s original version, PAnne Tyler’s novel Vinegar Girl is a modern interpretation of Taming of the Shrew. Or at least it’s trying to be. In Shakespeare’s original version, Petruchio woos Katherine “the shrew” by “taming” her. In other words, Katherine goes from being a strong willed, outspoken woman to more of a mouse who obeys her husband. Obviously, such a subject is in need of a modern facelift. Tyler attempts to put a modern spin on things by reimagining the play’s problem. In Vinegar Girl, Pyotr (Petruchio’s modern counterpart) needs to marry someone before his academic visa runs out. Dr. Battista doesn’t want his brilliant research assistant to leave, so he forces his daughter Kate (Katherine’s modern counterpart) to pretend to date and then marry Pyotr in order to keep him in the country. Cue modern criticism of ingrained patriarchal institutions, right?Don’t hold your breath. While Kate starts out as strong-willed, the veritable Vinegar Girl, she easily acquiesces to her father’s wishes with little to no character development. Missing too is Kate’s agency. Though Tyler tries to make it seem like Kate is going against the grain by developing feelings for Pyotr and deciding to marry him on her own, the characters and the plot both inevitably fall flat.With a plot that is as stilted as the dialogue and characters who often behave like cardboard cutouts, it’s difficult to find something to praise about this novel. However, Tyler’s prose is easy to digest. There is no fluff or filler. Vinegar Girl was a quick read, at least.Over all, I give Anne Tyler’s Vinegar Girl 2.5/5 stars.Follow my blog for more s! :)...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 06, 2016","Jul 12, 2016","Jun 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27070127-vinegar-girl

In it, Jason Dessen, a mediocre college professor, is kidnapped and has his life taken over by—Jason Dessen. Wait, what? It seems this other Jason, “Jason2,” made different choices in his life. While the narrator gave up his research to start a family, Jason2 continued until he created “the box,” a sensory deprivation room that puts occupants into a “cat state,” as in good ol’ Schrödinger's cat. Thus, “the box” allows its occupant to step through the multiverse. This is only the beginning of the problem. Things get more twisted in the best way as the story unfolds.Through everything, Crouch’s masterful prose—simple, quick, and effortless to digest—whisks the reader through the most complex of ideas with ease. Hiding inside this action-packed thriller is an emotional core of familial love. Deeper still, we find the philosophical—the narrative begs this question: What is it that makes us who we are?Dark Matter was a multifaceted novel with such depth of feeling, excitement, and intrigue that I stayed up all night reading it.

On the negative side, the narration left the story feeling disjointed and distant. I only really connected with one of the myriad of unlikeable focal characters, arguably the one I would least like to be around in real life. I liked him because he wanted something.

The Girls is a novel built on promises, many of which do not come to fruition. The most important of these promises is the idea of the murders themselves. While the thought of this oncoming violence voyeuristically goads the reader onward, the actual murders only merit a few paltry pages of description. However, where the novel succeeds is in its portrayal of how past traumas can linger in the psyches of those effected and change the way they interact with and perceive the world.The best thing about The Girls was without a doubt the prose. It was intricate yet readable. I felt like I could read it over and over and always see new things. With short sentences and fragments, the prose often read like thought, not stream of consciousness, but as if the reader is so close to the narrator that she would already know the world and its nuances before she reads. At one point, the narrator speaks of the way they live on the ranch, a disreputable and ramshackle commune-like place in the hills of Southern California, calling it “the shared dream.” This phrase also describes the gauzy “sunstruck” way the words lift and float on the page.Also worthy of note is the novel’s portrayal of women. Early on, the narrator says, “Girls are the only ones who can really give each other close attention, the kind we equate with love.” This tags a major theme of the narrative. The narrator, Evie, constantly looks at girls, describing them, projecting herself upon them, deciphering them, even falling in love, giving a multidimensional view of the female gaze. Far from being reductive of her subjects, Evie imbues them with wonderful, spiritual lives to counterpose the horrors she knows—speaking from a distance in time—that will come.The tragic beauty of this prose is that it lays bare the narrative's more glaring issues. With such deft manipulation of words, Cline brings the reader to expect a deft manipulation of subject, too. By this, the reader really begins to look forward to a considerable payout for the number plot threads that Cline introduces in the first sections of the novel. These include:a more complete description of Evie’s life as a caregivermore description of the intervening years between the murders and the presentimpactful scenes of the murders and their aftermathThe narrative delivers on none of these. In fact, it reads as if Cline has skipped straight from rising action to denouement. The pitiful resolution of events dumps 1969 Evie on the side of the road while the other denizens of the ranch go on the attack. Evie renders the events of the murders themselves second hand. How did she come by this version of the events? I’m not really sure. Evie’s remove from them leaves them less than impactful. The stakes are drained, and then the novel ends abruptly with present-day Evie walking alone on the beach.Overall, The Girls by Emma Cline only partially lives up to the hype. While Cline is clearly a talented prose writer, the narrative makes too many promises that are either weakly executed or unfulfilled. Nonetheless, I’m eager to watch Cline develop as a writer. I look forward to reading more of her work.3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 06, 2016","Jun 19, 2016","Jun 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26893819-the-girls

When I answered, I said, ""If this book was my only foray into the world, the only place from which I could see beyond myself, I would assume that the world was populated by horrible people who could only do wrong."" No, this isn't an opinion on the subject of the book, abortion, but rather the way almost every character treated the others, with the vast exception of Wally, who (let's face it) really got dealt a raw hand.On the subject of abortion, at first I found it hard to understand what Irving's intent was: was he for abortion or against it? I think his position can be best summed up by Homer's opinion, that he thinks they (abortions) should be legal, but he would not perform them...which changes by the end of the book. Irving himself calls the book ""didactic,"" leading me to a new assumption about didacticism in literature, mainly that didactic works function as a mirror: the reader only sees what they believe and nothing else. Therefore, if Irving's point was to sway the reader, I think this failed. If it was to entertain, the didactic message at times got in the way of the entertainment. However, if Irving was seeking to issue points and counterpoints for the same argument (both for and against abortion), thus opening up a dialogue and enticing readers to speak and share their opinions, he may have accomplished something. The Cider House Rules, if nothing else, is a conversation starter....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 15, 2012","May 19, 2012","Feb 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4687.The_Cider_House_Rules
