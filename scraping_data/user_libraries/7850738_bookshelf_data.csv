The only reason I contemplated giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how repetitive he can get throughout a chapter. But other than that, his analysis is very pertinent, the way he describes fetishism, divulges myths of political economy and talks about the equalization of value of all abstract human labor is absolutely fascinating.I read this for a senior economics course given by a staunch communist professor (yes, in 2016 still!), but after reading Capital I am more convinced that Marxism is the first refuge of intellectuals. An undeniably attractive theoretical framework is embedded in the heart of Marxist thought that inevitably enthralls any individual on a quest for amassing knowledge. A quick glance at the history of the 20th century would show you how many heroic individuals devoted their life and died for the ideal of communism, an ideal that revealed itself to be too utopian to work in practice (for the time being). Wealth concentration and rising inequality are following an upward trend to reach unsettling and deeply troubling numbers. After taking this course, and reading Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century in parallel, I think the revolution of the proletariat might have a Second Coming. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 14, 2016","Dec 09, 2016","Oct 14, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20324062-capital

I was born in 1996, the year Israel massacred civilians in the village of Qana. I carry Beirut with meI am a 19 year-old Lebanese university student. I was born in 1996, the year Israel massacred civilians in the village of Qana. I carry Beirut with me on my passport wherever I go. Lebanon is the country I was born and raised in, the country of my father and his ancestors. Yet, like all my peers, I graduated high school with a profound ignorance of my country’s modern history. The events that tore Lebanon apart for decades ever since its independence in 1943 and the evacuation of the last french soldier in 1946 until the day I was born are blackened out from the collective conscience of our society. Upon reading this book, this marvelous piece of historical non-fiction, I was amazed at the horror, the depravity of the Lebanese civil war. The gory battles whose deafening echoes still reverberate in our contemporary society are only smothered by censors terrified of pouring salt on open wounds. It is insane to think about it this way: Have I not had the curiosity of reading this bulky book, I would’ve stayed oblivious of the appalling history of my fatherland. The Beirut streets, which Fisk describes with such vivacity, are the same streets I spent my childhood in, yet this foreigner seems to know them more than I do. How disgraceful it is to learn about your own country’s modern history through the words of a foreign correspondent. How disgraceful it is to trust his version of the story more than your fellow countrymen’s because you’re sure of their biasedness. How shameful it is for me to be oblivious of these important facts when my own father fought on those same frontlines Fisk so ingeniously wrote of. I am personally indebted to Mr. Robert Fisk for his dedicated first-hand reporting of the Lebanese civil war, for risking his life countless times for the sake of honest journalism, especially when all the parties (Israel, Syria, the PLO, the Phalange, the United States) without exception never ceased to distort reality as if the stories of the war were plunged in a deep well of Orwellian purgative waters. It is quite astounding that accounts of the civil war aren’t taught in classrooms, but understandably so, because the same warlords who terrorized, slaughtered, plundered, raped and prevaricated 30 years ago, are still wearing suits and holding an (apparently permanent but definitely illegitimate) seat in our Lebanese parliament today. As if reading about how foreign armies and guerrillas so insolently destroyed my country wasn’t enough, I had to read about how Lebanese people themselves slaughtered each other in cold blood, how Lebanese leaders so worshipped by their followers to THIS DAY antagonized each other and gave military orders which have inevitably ended in human carnage. It is no surprise factious tensions still arise today and the country is constantly on the verge of the outbreak of violence, that’s all because the scars of the civil war are still branded in our society and people are still embittered. My own parents and many people I know still use “east” and “west” Beirut as if the war never really ended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,113,1,"Aug 07, 2015","Aug 29, 2015","Aug 07, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99827.Pity_the_Nation

For Chomsky, it is important for the American A real eye-opener, especially for the American audience bathed in Zionist-sponsored media brainwashing. For Chomsky, it is important for the American taxpayer to know that he is funding the systematic annihilation of a people, a culture, a heritage, any echo of Palestinian nationalism without even being aware of the gravity of the situation, and to protest against the murder of children in Gaza is hypocritical of Americans for that very reason.As long as the U.S. sees in Israel a strategic asset in the Middle East to conduct the ""dirty work"" on its behalf, a fateful triangular relationship will tie the United States, Israel and the Palestinians in the most complex and bloody conflict that ever shook the Middle East.I have many dog-eared pages, so I'm just gonna choose my favorite selections from them in an attempt to capture the gist of the message Chomsky was trying to convey:An Israeli army officer, ""when asked why bulldozers were knocking down houses in which women and children were living,"" responded by saying:  ""they are all terrorists.""  His statement accurately summarizes Israel's strategy and the assumptions that underlie it, for many years.  In Copenhagen, Knesset Member Yosef Rom told a television audience ""that Israeli soldiers were greeted in Lebanon with flowers and rice."" The interviewer interrupted him with the following words: ""Do not tell us in Denmark about flowers and rice. Nazi Germany also had pictures of how the Danish people greeted the April 1940 conquest with flowers..."" One Palestinian boy was reported to be sitting on a Haddad Land Rover, his cheeks slashed by bayonets, forced  ""to reiterate his crime, 'I am a Palestinian',""  before being killed. Dr. Shlomo Shmelzman wrote a letter to the press announcing his hunger strike in protest against the Lebanon war: ""In my childhood I have suffered fear, hunger and humiliation when I passed from the Warsaw Ghetto, through labor camps, to Buchenwald. Today, as a citizen of Israel, I cannot accept the systematic destruction of cities, towns, and refugee camps. I cannot accept the technocratic cruelty of the bombing, destroying and killing of human beings. I hear too many familiar sounds today, sounds which are being amplified by the war.  I hear ""dirty Arabs"" and I remember ""dirty Jews.""  I hear about ""closed areas"" and I remember ghettos and camps. I hear ""two-legged beasts"" and I remember ""Untermenschen."" I hear about tightening the siege, clearing the area, pounding the city into submission and I remember suffering, destruction, death, blood and murder...

As a matter of fact, she is said to have written her autobiography through her stories.""The storm"" was written in 1898 and like the title would suggest, the backdrop of the narrative is that of a turbulent storm which shakes up Louisiana, a chaos of the elements of nature (heavy rain, lightning etc..). That is the extrinsic aspect of the storm. The intrinsic one is a chaos of the elements of human nature (desires, impulses, instinct..). Both these storms erupt against our will, we have no means to halt them, they are inevitable.So there's a storm dampening the Louisiana soil, and there's a desperate housewife called Calixta home alone ""sewing furiously on a sewing machine"". Her husband, the simpleton Bobinôt, had taken their son Bibi out to the store, and since the storm was raging outside, decided to stay there until it passed.Her old lover Alcée Laballière, an Acadian rich (married) man, rode in at the gate and asked if he could wait inside her home until the storm had passed. Calixta (obviously) agreed and let him inside. We can't help but notice the difference between Alcée and Bobinôt, their names alone reflect the divergence of their social standing and sophistication. As everyone has probably already guessed, Alcée and Calixta fornicate, both committing adultery and betraying their partners. During the act of making love, Kate Chopin shows the woman in position of power contrary to the common submissive role she is stereotypically assigned in bed: ""with one hand she clasped his head [...] The other hand stroked with a soothing rhythm his muscular shoulders"" she is clutching his head and his shoulder, symbolically she has the upper hand on the center of his mental power (his head) and she's also in control of his physical power (his shoulders).The message Kate Chopin is trying to convey is, firstly, that loveless marriages will eventually lead to adultery and perfidy. Secondly, she is trying to challenge the social taboo concerning women's sexuality (yes, women like to get laid too) and portraying female strength both in the household (Calixta holds power socially attributed to men since her husband is a twit) and in bed. Even though she never proclaimed herself as a feminist, Kate Chopin is recognized as a forerunner to the great Simone de Beauvoir through her works of fiction that put women in a position of power....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Oct 2014,"Oct 01, 2014",,,view (with text),/book/show/13722759-the-storm

However, the Provisional Government of Georgi Lvov, in the midst of the colossal military turmoil of World War I, wasn't particularly sympathetic of Lenin's anti-war stance. After his arrival in Petrograd (to be renamed after him Leningrad), Lenin was falsely accused of being a German agent and after the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, he was forced to flee to Sestroretsk then to Finland. That's where he wrote his vehement communist rant ""The State and Revolution"".Continuously referring to Marx and Engels and commenting on famous passages extracted from their work, Lenin sought to deliver a pure and untainted account of Marxist thought, since he was enraged at the petty-bourgeois democrats like Kautsky, Plekhanov and Bernstein and he kept reiterating the need to ""purge Marxism of its distortions"" (glad he didn't live to see the brutality of Stalinism)Beyond that, he elaborated on ideas of the state, social classes, The Paris Commune of 1871, the polemic with anarchists, democracy and most importantly, the 'withering away of the state' and the 'dictatorship of the proletariat'.My notes go much further than that but I'll limit my  to titles and generalities.Very interesting read for anyone interested in communism, political science and wanting to explore Lenin's ideas just before the October Revolution. He ends his book saying that it's a much more fulfilling experience to carry out and live the proletarian revolution than to write about it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Oct 20, 2014",Nov 2014,"Sep 16, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/823272.The_State_and_Revolution

I was looking forward to discover his Iceberg Theory in practice and I thought that choosing a novel of his which encompasses one of the major historical events of the last century would just be the best choice for me. I was wrong. I did not like this book.In terms of historical information, this book doesn't provide you with much material (since Hemingway was reporting the civil war in Spain), instead it focuses on a single operation led by an American volunteer fighting alongside the loyalists.To be honest, this novel had a lot of potential to be amazing. The narrative, the underlying message of the futility of war, the setting and the characters were impressive at a first glance, but the way Hemingway conveyed the story, without richness of language (again, I understand his principle of omission but I'm just saying), the characters that could've been emblematic in historical fiction just lacked human warmth, their colloquies were flat and even the protagonist's meditation on death, loss, war and love were just... dry. At no point I felt the urge to underline or highlight a passage, even though it contained a plethora of beautiful reflections and thoughts, but with his minimalistic and detached writing, Hemingway's narrative failed to grip me by my heart, and I was left indifferent at even the most ""heartbreaking"" peaks of the novel. P.S. The pervasive sexism thoughout the story was irritating, note that I've read the even more ""misogynous"" (as they call him) Henry Miller and I didn't even notice because the beauty of his writing outshined it. For Hemingway, it was stark and bothersome to my feminist zeal. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Aug 18, 2014","Sep 16, 2014","Aug 18, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/840230.For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls

And when you say Dublin, you say James Joyce. Every tour guide had to say something related to James Joyce, the author of Dublin, who loved and hated his home city at the same time. And that is how I feel towards this book right now. On the one hand, Joycean literature is one of majestic linguistic beauty, and on the other hand, the short stories in the book were really insipid, but maybe that's exactly the idea James Joyce is trying to convey -- how incredibly tasteless Dublin is. City of misfortunes, drunkards, parochialistic mentalities, rainy, depressive weather... The author could barely find anything admirable in the city, yet he devoted all his literary works to it and his legacy is mainy that of the writer of the Dublin. The writing is so beautiful, no wonder James Joyce receives such acclaim, he fucking deserves it. But I guess I still have to read Finnegans Wake and Ulysses, before giving a final verdict. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 10, 2014",Jul 2014,"May 10, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11012.Dubliners

But you would find yourself intrigued and disconcerted when the author is none other than the Russian giant, Leo Tolstoy.And really, who am I to give a mediocre rating to a book by such an erudite writer and ingenious thinker? It is the man whose anarcho-pacifism inspired Gandhi to liberate India through nonviolence and here I am, granting him no more than a 2-star rating. After almost 50 years of epicurean pursuit of pleasure, Tolstoy was appalled when he looked back at his life: depravity, contempt, adultery, theft and warfare. He found himself unhappy and unable to find a meaning to this senseless and evil life, perplexed at his inability to answer the simple question that every wise child asks: ""What am I? and What is the meaning of my life? What will come of what I am doing today or shall do tomorrow?"" Adhering to the rational and scientific knowledge he spent his whole lifetime corroborating, Tolstoy found no solace, no palliative for the empty chasm inside him that would soon swallow him up whole and push him to the edge of suicide. Pleading enlightenment from wise men of thought like Schopenhauer and Socrates, Tolstoy was again facing an impasse: ""We approach truth only inasmuch as we depart from life"" said Socrates.Numerous speculations and diligent quests for truth were in vain, but finally Tolstoy found a dim beacon of hope when he turned his aristocratic-self to the proletariat, the masses of people that constitute the underprivileged labor force. Then, the author of Anna Karenina had a life-changing revelation: those people who wallow in adversity and ignorance, who bequeath nothing but debt to their posterity, whose inborn poverty is their death sentence, those people who are supposed to be miserable were revealed to be the happiest people, accepting illness and misfortune, performing arduous tasks for meager salaries and most importantly, very conscious of the meaning of life, that big existential crisis for a learned aristocrat like Tolstoy, wasn't of any ambiguity to the uneducated masses. And that is because they clung to religion and they pledged allegiance to the Holy Trinity. Ever since, Tolstoy's long abandoned Christian faith surged once again to salvage him and bring him back ashore from the uproarious storm that shook up his entire being to its core. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Mar 13, 2014","Mar 13, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26244.A_Confession

It also evokes the capital and indispensable role religion plays in politics while it is separated from political power. The importance of this oeuvre lies in its chilling prophecies. Tocqueville predicted more than a century earlier the rise of two giants on the global platform - America and Russia and thus heralded the development of the Cold War (1947-1991). He also broached the then-sensitive subject of slavery in America and alluded to the outbreak of the American Civil War (1861-1865)....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 04, 2014","Feb 20, 2014","Feb 04, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16619.Democracy_in_America

What's more, the history of modern French literature will always remember him as a remarkable pranker endowed with sardonic humor: After being disappointed with the Pléiade prize not being awarded to L'écume des Jours after being promised by the judges that it would, Vian did a parody of the Pléiade prize by creating the Taboo Prize ""awarded to the authors of Scorpion to the authors of Scorpion and organized by the director of Scorpion."" On the 25th of February 1948, the prize is awarded to Sally Mara, pseudonym of his accomplice Raymond Queneau, by a jury composed of Boris Vian himself, his wife Michelle and his brother Alain. Vian declares that ""He hasn't read the book in question, that the laureate was picked cursorily, that the Taboo Prize is just another occasion to drink for free."" Fascinated by this young satiric author, I decided to introduce myself to his demiurgic skills in fiction, because they sure as hell were impressive in real life.Not a big fan of fantasy, but I enjoyed this small book as I leafed through it furtively during classes I judged boring and found in Vian's most acclaimed work much compensated pleasure and wholehearted laughter.Very creative, rich with neologisms and very easy to read with short (sometimes one-page long) chapters, this book made me discover a few unexpectedly memorable characters, a plethora of idiosyncrasies and a certain Jean-Sol Partre, who constitutes an indelible fictional testimony of Vian's admiration for Jean-Paul Sartre (Funnily enough, Sartre will end up having an affair with Vian's wife Michelle)....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 25, 2014","Jan 28, 2014","Jan 25, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1519560.L_cume_des_jours

A name that frequently resonated in my ears during French Literature classes but never sparked my interest until I read a  of thiDenis Diderot. A name that frequently resonated in my ears during French Literature classes but never sparked my interest until I read a  of this book by one of my goodreads friends Joselito, and I have been fascinated by this book ever since. The story of a girl stripped of her freedom, forced to join the convent against her will, imprisoned and mistreated in that wretched place of seclusion and worship, and who finally falls into the deep abyss of libidinous vices with a perverted Mother Superior. Very brief synopsis yet one feels intrigued to read that audacious novel that mars the sanctity of religious life in the most egregious way. La Religieuse (1796) came out twelve years after Diderot's death, much like his most notable works. Holder of a degree in theology, Diderot soon strayed away from religion by publishing his first radically subversive work ""Lettre sur les aveugles"" (1749). Heresy being a felony, Diderot was imprisoned for 4 months for his unorthodox ideas. Unlike his near-contemporary Voltaire, who took pleasure in sparking controversy, Diderot avoided conflict with the authorities and kept his polemic works to himself, ""writing for the desk drawer"" as it was known during Stalin's repressive Soviet Union.The Roman Catholic Church was belligerently opposing the new modes of critical thought highlighted by the intellectual tidal wave that washed across Europe in the 18th century known as The Enlightenment ""Le siècle des Lumières"". The prosecution of the philosophes by the religious authorities may have contributed to the virulence of the satire in ""The Nun""In the middle of the 18th century, 1 Frenchwoman in every 200 was a nun. The convent was an intriguing and very enigmatic place to the male specimen to which he was denied access. This cryptic subject of fascination generated prolific fiction fueled by sexual fantasies who weren't very far-fetched from reality during that time.Diderot's fiction is not entirely made up. He suffered himself the experience of enforced vocations and the cloistered life. His own father locked him up in a monastery when the rebellious son of his refused to comply to his wishes and become a priest. Diderot finally managed to escape and he married his beloved Nanette.The book is not, as it would seem at first glance, a rebuke directly addressed to the Roman Catholic Church and Christan faith but rather an attack on enforced vocations as a means of social control, in this book Diderot uses satire to argue for human rights and self determination. Here's one of the most eloquent passages in which Suzanne, the persecuted nun-against-her-will expresses her desolation:  ""I hate the solitary life, I feel deep down that I hateit and that I shall always hate it. I shall never be able to subjectmyself to all the drudgery that fills a nun’s waking hours: it is nothing but an endless round of childish things which I despise. I would have got used to it by now if I had been capable of getting used to it. I’ve tried a hundred times to deceive myself, to break my resistance, but I simply cannot. I have envied, and asked God for, the blissful stupidity of my companions, but I have not obtained it and he will not grant it me. I do everything badly and say everything wrong. My every deed lays bare the fact that I have no vocation, and it’s plain for all to see. Everything I do is an insult to the religious life. They call my inability to do things properly pride, and they spend their time humiliating me. My wrongdoings and punishments become ever more frequent, and I spend my days gauging with my eyes how highthe walls are"" ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 30, 2014","Jul 02, 2014","Dec 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18216.The_Nun

Emile Zola is one the pioneers in nineteenth century French literature, having written the classical series called LAn author worthy of his renommée. Emile Zola is one the pioneers in nineteenth century French literature, having written the classical series called Les Rougon-Macquart that portrays heredity and its inescapable weight on the descendants of the notorious family of The Rougon-Macquart. Reproached of not giving the divine and the metaphysical a place in his series of novels, Zola wrote Le Rêve about mystification and the supernatural. This book tells the story of a beautiful, chaste and pious young girl called Angélique, her name reflecting her cherubic nature, who is abandoned by her mother, Sidonie Rougon and is adopted by a poor couple of embroiderers, les Hubert. The heavy hereditary impact on Angelique was visible, she was impulsive, mutinous and passionate but her rapturous whims and enraged revolts were always attenuated by her spiritual attachment and her religious devotion. The narrative reaches its climax when Angelique has to choose between love, passion and, irrevocably, vice on the one hand and obedience and virtue on the other hand, but her pious and stern education finally thwarts her inveterate capricious and inflamed character. Beautifully-written fiction, satisfies your appetite for an angelic tale of love and all its complications in an epoch when social disparities stood in the way of youthful infatuation. Unlike what is said about Zola, his descriptions aren't tedious and his style isn't hard to keep up with, quite on the contrary, he is endowed with one of the best writing skills I've seen. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 10, 2013","Jan 25, 2014","Oct 10, 2013",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1367032.Le_R_ve

The author managed to convey the story without leaving any trace of his Arabic origins or his hatred for the Israeli state (if he has any).This is a story anchored in the turmoil of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, in the bloody warfare that cost thousands of lives and dried the tears of so many mothers. The eviction of a thwarted nation burned the souls of millions of patriots who witnessed the demolition of their houses, the dissociation of their families, the proliferation of the graves in their public cemetery and the collapse of their lives. All of that fed their rampant hatred and their consuming desire for revenge to the evil usurper, Zion.This book tells the story of an eminent Arabian surgeon that succeeded in building himself an acclaimed reputation in the Israeli community, that strived to spoil his wife, Sihem and place her on pedestal in comfort and opulence. However, the complacent life of Dr. Amin Jaafari brusquely plummets into a deep abyss when Sihem is revealed to be the perpetrator of a suicidal bombing in a restaurant crowded with children and innocent civilians in Tel-Aviv. When Amin receives a letter his wife has written to him before her death confirming she is indeed the kamikaze, his hope of her vindication is blown away.Amin is obstinately determined to unravel the causes of his wife's perfidy, the reason she forsook the luxury and security he endeavored to procure her and allowed herself to be brainwashed by extremist militias until she was blinded into murder disguised in the euphemism of martyrdom. This book is poignant, so powerful it reaches in and seizes your heart and stays branded in your mind a long time after you've finished it.

The turncoat of Jewish origins got deported to Devil's Island where he spent 5 years pleading his innocence but it all fell on deaf ears. The well-staged framing of a ""Jewish bastard"" went perfectly until evidence in 1896 identified French Army major Esterhazy as the real culprit. After a second court case acquitted Esterhazy, Emile Zola felt prompted to write an open letter to the President Felix Faure, pointing a finger of accusation on the deceitful injustice of military authorities and the loathsome antisemitism pervading the French population which will forever tarnish the history of France.""J'accuse"" is a poignant and (you gotta admit) very ballsy account of Emile Zola's militant devotion for justice and human rights in a century where discrimination and racial hatred were still the social norm.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Aug 12, 2013","Aug 12, 2013",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/817012.L_Affaire_Dreyfus

Here's why:First of all, this story is poignant but unfortunately, very... flat. I've seen a lot of people complain about how the author was incapable of creating three-dimensional characters, they weren't ""alive and breathing"" to me. I haven't shed a single tear throughout the SUPER HORRIFYING AND TRAUMATIZING SCENES. The story Hosseini is telling has so much potential to wound, to make you cry your eyes out but it simply manages to make you flinch. Repeatedly. During every chapter. But it fails to engage you on a deeper level, and this is a skill that I believe is lacking to mainstream authors, partly why they are so widely read and admired amongst amateur readers. Now, what is absolutely abhorring is the fact that this brutal fictional account is an everyday reality for many women in Afghanistan. One good thing about this book is it makes you very grateful for the life you have because apparently, security in your own home and basic human rights in your society are a luxury for a woman in the Middle East.Secondly, the narrative is brimming with historical references and we follow Afghanistan's history a little before the Soviet invasion in 1979, passing through protracted civil wars, up until the early 2000s and the overthrow of the ruthless Taliban rule. That is one of the few things I liked about the book, although the way the history was delivered was dull and superficial ""wikipedia-styled"" (as another er put it) and the information only truly sunk in for me with google guidance. Lastly, (also paraphrasing another er) the Nicholas Sparks plot twists made me shake my head, grunt, sigh, facepalm and snort at the way inexperienced writers use this trick concomitantly with emotional manipulation to reach a bigger audience of, let's say, less mature readers and well, have a bigger profit pie to carve up and savor.. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 15, 2014","Jan 17, 2015","Jul 24, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3850639-a-thousand-splendid-suns

He also elaborates the Oedipus complex and the ambivalence caused by the troubles of identification. In his Oedipus complex, the young boy's process of identification to his father wavers between feelings of affection towards his father and desires of evicting the latter because of oedipal jealousy induced by his love for his mother. Freud moves on to dividing the human psyche into conscious, preconscious and unconscious, then develops the concepts of Ego, Super-Ego and Id. The Ego represents the external world and it is the instrument of conscious perception. The Id dissimulates the innate instinctive drives and tries to make the ego conform to its desires and impulses. The Super-Ego interferes and plays the role of the censor and the moral guide that stops the ego from succumbing to the Id's every whim. In ""Group Psychology and Analysis of the Ego"" (1921), Trotter's theory on gregariousness in which he professes that the gregarious drive is inborn and that man feels incomplete when he's alone is rejected by Freud. The Austrian neurologist accentuates the initial hostility between people that, in an ulterior stage, turns into identification then friendliness. Let's take the example of diehard fans in a rock concert. They're all crazy about the same band and they're jealous of each other, coveting the lead singer's affection just for their personal exclusivity, but once they realize the improbability of possessing the object of adulation, they abandon their impossible pursuit and identify themselves to fellow fans (whom they initially despised)and their relationship acquires a positive, gregarious aspect. A similar scenario happens with the oedipal love triangle. All of Freud's theories are based on the concept of libido. He even interprets the infantile habit of sucking the thumb as a sexual innuendo. Not to undervalue the capital role sexuality plays in psychology, but I'm afraid Mr. Freud pushes his analytical caliber too far sometimes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 16, 2013","Jul 23, 2013","Jul 16, 2013",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3698681-essais-de-psychanalyse

The story was compelling, and very fun to read. It is an emblematic Young Adult Fiction about adolescence and the problems we face during this fragile stage of our lives where uncertainty about the future, the flair for recklessness and the thirst for absurdity fuel the driving force behind our lives. It is also a reminiscence of high school years for adults who will relish the rush of memory travels. You'd think I liked the book from what I've said above, yes? WELLLLLL....What I seriously couldn't stand AT ALL in this book is, firstly, the writing. The writing was abominable. I don't understand how some people mentioned in their s that ""the writing is amazing""...Seriously?Taking into consideration this is a filmmaker's first attempt at writing novels and the fact that the narrator is a fifteen year-old, I'M HOPING IT WAS DONE ON PURPOSE.I strongly suspect that, for the first and last time in the entire history of humanity, and as an eminent exception to a prevalent belief, the movie adaptation will be much better than the actual book. YES. That's how bad the writing was, you'd get just about the same information from a Wikipedia summary. And it might be even better written that that.Lastly, I would like to point out that Charlie sounded like a 7 year-old throughout the book, even though he's supposedly an avid reader of classics and a very ""intelligent"" and ""gifted"" person. Yet, he has a peculiar sexual ignorance (he doesn't know what masturbation is, and can't tell when a girl is being raped in front of him), can't manage to make advances with the opposite sex, and his naiveness is probably the most annoying thing about this stupid book.Stephen Chbosky, please stick to the film business and stay away from literature, thanks. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Mar 2012,"Oct 07, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4327066-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower

This seemingly cherubic young woman, pushed to the edge of her forbearance, strangles her fickle and perfidious husband one night. Forlornly helpless, Yayoi turns to her trustworthy co-worker Masako Katori for help concealing her impulsive, heinous crime. The reliable woman agrees to get rid of the body with the help of two venal co-workers: Yoshie, a hard-up and diligent fifty year-old who spends her days changing her querulous and decrepit mother-in-law's diapers; and Kuniko Jonouchi, a corpulent, improvident and money-covetous woman who's over her head with debts as a result of her profligacy. The three women, promised a sum of money from Yayoi, dissect and carve up the corpse, making mincemeat of Yayoi's husband, and then carefully place his body parts in garbage bags and throw them away.As a callous and emancipated Yayoi begins a new life with her two sons, Masako and Yoshie undergo lurid dismemberment tasks in exchange of millions of Japanese yens. The four women tiptoe on a tight rope of secrecy to keep their little scheme veiled from the police, but they begin to notice ominous innuendos of a cryptic nemesis lurking surreptitiously, premeditating their descent to hell.Natsuo Kirino intelligently explores the depths of the human psyche and the clandestine wickedness extant in it, while powerfully underscoring the hardships and prejudices inflicted on Japanese women.Absolutely loved this book. Had my heart racing with its final scenes. Kudos to Natsuo Kirino for portraying the inherent gender warfare so engagingly well.P.S.

The reason for his conviction is never revealed and even the officers who came to deliver the news are uniformed.In the next chapters, we follow K. in a series of encounters that are ground for meaningless and empty discussions with various characters that seldom reappear throughout the story and don’t seem to have an efficient role in the progress of the narrative. K’s so-called quest to seek answers and vindicate his name turn out to be futile as he never musters enough courage or audacity to extract definite answers and instead, allows his complacency to let him act in a way that harms him more than it helps him in his case. (I especially loved how almost every female character seem to want him, which feeds his arrogance all the more) For a year, Josef K awaits a trial that never happens; he’s never told the reason behind his criminal charge and the ultimate zenith of befuddlement comes with K’s death that is also underdone in mystifying circumstances. Nothing is explained or elucidated and yet people seem to abundantly laud Kafka for an unfinished, miserable excuse for a novel which the author himself wanted to be burned posthumously. It really saddens me ‘cause after hearing copious praise for Kafka, the anticipation upon starting this novel was great and I was eager to be acquainted with his “genius”, but my high expectations were annihilated by an immense disappointment.The Trial is among the most disturbing books I’ve laid eyes on to this day. It was an excruciating experience from which my brain cells are still suffering aftershocks. The atmosphere of the novel was so odd and gruesome; the rooms with low ceilings and stuffy, fetid offices made me feel like I’m having a bizarre nightmare. (Well, at least it’s better than his other unfinished book about a man metamorphosed into an insect). Kafka intentionally delineated an inhuman world inflicted with the depravity of the law (which is ironic because Kafka was a lawyer himself). And when you finally finish this story of 200ish pages (but you feel like it’s 2000, I don’t know how Kafka managed to do that), you’re supposed to be in a state of awe ‘cause it’s so fucking deep and philosophical, aiming to depict life and the big fat interrogation point behind our existence and its purpose. Well. That was a waste of time. Max Brod should’ve listened to Kafka and set fire to his manuscripts.

It takes place during world war 1 thus it must be teeming with enriching historical insertions that I take in with relish.2. It is a gay romance, thus it must vigorously investigate homosexual liaisons and the torment of their clandestinity during the Great War.For those reasons, I had presumed that The Absolutist would appeal to my tastes. But, as my one-star rating would suggest, this book did not impress me at all. First of all,  the historical passages I was hoping for were almost non-existent which is deplorable because there was plenty of room for ample references to the Great War such as the inane incident that provoked it, the stratagems  each side undertook, the catastrophic number of casualties and the aftermath of the war on a global level. Although, I have to admit that Boyne exploited a vital aspect of war: the heinous and inhumane crimes soldiers were forced to commit, the horrors they had to witness and how it all made them ""immune to violence"". What I loved the most about this book is its ability to show you where that line between cowardice and bravery is drawn.Boyne shed light on the concept of patriotism that urged English men to fight in the war and how a man who refused to fight out of principle and humanitarian motives was denounced as a coward by his fellows while in reality, he was the bravest of them all.Tristan Sadler was a homosexual seventeen-year-old whose family disowned him when  his sexual inclinations were revealed. He had to lie about his age to get enlisted in the army.While training in Aldershot, he developed a one of a kind friendship with Will Bancroft and the two soldiers quickly became thick as thieves.Infatuated and mad with possessiveness over Will, Tristan tries to stifle his illicit love but in vain. During their last night in Aldershot, Will, consumed by apprehension of what's coming next, initiates sex with Tristan bur ulteriorly ignores him and looks at him in revulsion. The same scenario happens again in France, which leaves Tristan crestfallen. Unable to loathe the man responsible for his emotional torment yet rejected, desolate and enraged  because he couldn't have him, Tristan suddenly has a big role to play in either saving Will's life or putting an end to it....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,May 2013,"Jul 17, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13635076-the-absolutist

Leaving the World is trulThis is my first Douglas Kennedy novel and I’m kind of reprimanding myself for not having picked up one of his books before. Leaving the World is truly an exemplary contemporary fiction armed with a plot brimming with tragedy, love and mystery; accompanied by a narrative easy to read and fathom though it lacked some literary weight (and this is why I'm not rating it five stars). The copious musical, historic and literary references made throughout the story delineate Douglas Kennedy as an erudite pedant. Though I did sense at times some paragraphs were redundant, characterized by tedious, florid prose. The book follows the life of Jane Howard in an ingeniously gripping narrative that enthralls in a way ensuring the reader feels his own heart beating inside Jane’s chest; pondering her decisions, commiserating her sorrows and losses and battling with her against destiny. The last ten/twenty pages of the book were somewhat a disappointment. Although it partly lived up to my hopes and expectations (the fact that Jane contacted Christy again and came back to Boston), I was hoping Jane would confront Theo, visit Emily’s burial place, meet (and maybe adopt?) Ivy McIntyre after her recovery. I did like the fact that Jane and Vern didn’t get romantically involved and remained friends. Anyway the book overall was an amazing, highly enjoyable read that is worthy of the adulation and acclaim it is receiving. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 26, 2012","Jul 17, 2012","May 26, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7775250-leaving-the-world

I was left astonished by the beauty and tragedy of it all. What makes this novel a popular masterpiece is the exuberance and humor that distinguished it as an irresistible thriller that would engross the most reluctant readers. Set in Barcelona, it relates the story of Daniel Sempere who was brought to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books when he was 10 years old to choose a book from its dusty shelves. He picked a book by Julian Carax called ""THE SHADOW OF THE WIND"" but this choice will lead him to daunting consequences. In the following years, he encounters a mysterious and faceless figure that smells of burned paper and is inordinately interested in the Daniel's precious find. This man who calls himself Lain Coubert collects all of Julian Carax's novels and sets fire to them. Intrigued, Daniel decides to unravel the enigma of Julian Carax's life and death, then maybe he could find out the motives of Coubert. During his endeavor, and with the help of his partner-in-crime Fermin Romero de Torres and his beloved Bea, Daniel discovers Julian's past - his misfortunes, his troubled childhood and his impossible love with Penelope Aldaya whose bereavement held Julian hostage to a prolonged despondency and obsessive yearning to see her again. Zafon's brimming talent for storytelling never ceases to leave you spellbound. I know I keep lauding this author but I have every right to. Grab a book by Carlos Ruiz Zafon and let it guide it's way into your heart. This is what Zafon does best: trapping people in a world of mystery and magic from which they can never elude....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 13, 2012","Apr 08, 2012","Mar 13, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9529.The_Shadow_of_the_Wind

The descriptive paragraphs were so amazing, it makes you plunge in the plot, the setting and you really feel you're in Barcelona, walking in David's shoes. And since it's translated to English, then the translator, Lucia Graves, is immensely talented as well. Each sentence, each word is so beautifully-written, it fits perfectly into each paragraph. Zafon mastered the art of narration, leaving me speechless as I flip each page.Secondly, I really liked the story. Gothic, dark and cryptic, every page leaves you thirsty for more. David struggles with his dream of literature and his impossible love with Cristina (which by the way was so heartbreaking it made me sob). I love how it exposes families living in destitution and their problems, and the battle against hopelessness. When you really think things are over for David, a wave of hope rises again so I really admired that. Anyways, there are a few things I didn't like about the book and I was tempted to rate it four stars because of them. I think the end can top that list because it was seriously pretty disappointing. I mean, you can't end a book THAT good, THAT miserably. I don't know, Zafon could've came up with a better ending but it hasn't diminished one bit how much I loved that book.Plus, there were so many mysteries and enigmas left unsolved with the end of the book. The author just threw so many ideas in the beginning but didn't take time to uncover the truth about them.But other than that, the book was highly enjoyable.
