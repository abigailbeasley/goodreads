Interconnected stories about overeducated millennials feeling lost and pretentious and old, which isn't exactly where I am now but definitely could be soon. Honestly lots of the characters could be interchangeable, but the real success for me was capturing emotions and traits that are so real but not usually portrayed so vividly--the idea that one character doesn't really have strong opinions on things, or the super visceral feeling of losing your car keys and feeling yourself go kind of crazy because of it.

There’s a lot you can read into this book, and it made me realize mainstream gender conversations have come a long way since even 2019. Is this speculative, or is it all just metaphor? I kind of chose to read into the latter. But beyond the sex/magic of the whole concept, I was mostly just blown away by the subtlety of Paul’s interior life — like, as a reader, I could tell when Paul wasn’t that into someone before he even could, and I think the whole thing with Diane was such a good depiction of infatuation with a person who ultimately just doesn’t match up.

George Saunders is a master of juxtaposition (comedy and tragedy, humanistic and absurd, etc) and this is a master work. The balance between truth and fiction was perfectly struck and perfectly confusing. Definitely found this book super Ulyssean--it's an obvious influence, but 166 speakers rather than three made the speaker notes super warranted, and helped ground me in the weirdness of it all. I read an interview with him where he said he's never trying to make a ""point,"" he's just telling a story and it often gets to a point--that really stuck with me, because his stuff always ends of making me cry. For this one it was richard bevins iii and the versions of all the characters that could have been but never were. Wow.

I dissolved into these characters and this universe and got happily lost in every beautifully-spun tangent. One of the most interesting elements of this novel for me was the way that incredibly important events (with a few very notable exceptions) were just dropped offhand in large blocks of other movement or thought--with the history and themes being covered, I would have expected large portions devoted to certain deaths, marriages, etc, but often a critical detail was just sprinkled in, somehow making the whole thing feel at once more grandiose and more intimate. We got to live in the details and the tangents, and those made up the big shifts, and when those shifts happened offscreen, they were simply alluded to. Really interesting tactic...
