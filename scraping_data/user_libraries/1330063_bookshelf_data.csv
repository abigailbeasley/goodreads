Perhaps it is flying by ourselves to visit beloved grandparents. Perhaps it is seeing our name on a list at school, giving us a part in a play or a placement on a team. For the author, Jim Serger, one of those moments is attending his first concert: Van Halen. Forty years later he has written a book about his friends and their night at the show.It is filled with nostalgia. You do not need to have been at this or any concert to find yourself on the pages. You do not need to be a fan of the band.

Although Everett takes the basic plot points and important characters and brings them into this book, I believe that calling this novel a retelling does it a disservice. James' story is much darker, sadder, and more intimate. It is a somber story of racism and slavery, and not a boys' adventure. In this book we get to understand the realities of life as a slave; the emotional impact of language, cruelty, abuse and incessant worry. There is a bit of humor, but in that area this book doesn't live up to the original. That did not ruin the story in any way, as I found this story to be more mature and that the emotion was evocative and true. Near the end of the story, I cried.Some of my favorite moments were the quiet, intelligent conversations between James & Huck, which were deep and meaningful. James was teaching Huck to see the world in a completely new way, letting the boy realize that slaves are people with the same thoughts, desires and emotions as the white people who owned them. He shared the stories calmly and without heat or emotion, just giving Huck the respect, hopeful that the boy would learn.Although this book could be read without visiting Twain's story, do yourself a favor and read both.Everett created a beautiful twist that I will not mention, but please read this book as soon as you can so that nobody ruins it for you.I received a beautiful finished copy from the publisher, @DoubledayBooks -- it has earned a permanent place on my shelves.

I was sent this book by the publisher, and picked it up without paying attention... so I will need to go back and pick up the first two books.Lisa Gardner's main character, Frankie Elkin, is one I liked very much. She is completely imperfect, flawed and very real. She carries around guilt and scars; is a tough and resilient survivor of a difficult past, she now spends her life finding missing persons. As this book opens she is talking to ""the beautiful butcher"" - a woman on death row for killing 18 men and feeding their bodies to pigs. Before she is put to death she is deperate to find her younger sister who disappeared more than a decade ago. This killer shows no remorse. In fact, she seems to be proud of her crimes, but her desire to find her sister seems genuine.Frankie must insinuate herself into a remote eco-lodge in Hawaii, posing as a new staff member, and try to locate the missing woman to bring her home. Unfortunately soon after her arrival the remnants of a woman's body are found, and all the possible scenarios are dangerous. And, to make it all more complicated, threats are being made against all of the employees, but is one of them the culprit?I look forward to getting to know Frankie better, and watching her journey to a place where she might forgive herself and find some internal peace.Thank you @GrandCentralPub for the #gifted finished copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 15, 2024","Mar 16, 2024","Mar 15, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/166395806-still-see-you-everywhere

It is a unique character portrait told with intimate descriptions of food, and internal dialogue. This is a woman, called Piglet, who has recreated her life, buying a new home in one of the best neighborhoods, working in a job as a cookbook editor, and getting engaged to a man named Kit. Everything is perfect... or is it?Unfortunately, 13 days before the wedding her fiancé tells her something that throws her. She is devastated, but remains silent, continuing to do all the work required to pull of the wedding. Piglet is in pain, and nobody seems to notice, except the reader. She is watching her new life fall apart, which also sinks her deep into her memories, dwelling on the things that hurt. All the while she continues to pretend that all is well.The descriptions of food were almost shocking. They were so vivid that you were often smelling and tasting the food. At times it was repulsive. These passages reminded me of moments in Patrick Suskind's book, Perfume. He did something similar with his passages about the sense of smell.

However, when I learned it was a book about the loss of a mother, and grief, I was all in. This is a literary theme that I love. Unfortunately, the books isn't as impactful as I hoped. I found it a bit too subtle. None of the depth of grief is discussed in any real way. It is all on the surface. We do not feel the devastating sadness, the anger, or confusion. This family doesnt talk to one another, or yell at each other, or cry themselves to sleep. It is all barely touched, and I wanted so much more.

The book was emotional, Brooklyn by Tracy Brown was my first book by this author, and I was sad to learn that she passed away at the young age of 49. The book was emotional, and captured my attention from the first pages.We meet the main character, Brooklyn, when she is a young girl, living in her parents' home. They are far too strict, and she lives a sheltered life, lacking understanding about the outside world. When she experiences a horrible, life-changing event, her mother fails her by not demonstrating unfiltered love and acceptance. That moment colors the remainder of Brooklyn's life.Unfortunately neither she or her brother are perfect, and both have secrets that push their parents' views. Brooklyn is younger than she should be, which comes out as impulsivity and immaturity. Later, when she falls in love, she chooses a person who is all wrong for her and that leads to more disaster, and a firestorm in her home. Brooklyn is angry and hurt by her mother's failures, and takes it out on her brother. In the end, the family implodes and all of them experience significant trauma.None of the characters are perfect. They are messy, self-absorbed, judgmental. They don't always act out of love. They are very real, and because of that I found myself very attached to all of them. I cared about what they went through. I found myself angry with each of them at different moments. I wanted to sit them down and tell them they were acting like idiots.I received a finished paperback from the publisher. Thank you.

These women created a better workplace environment for the female journalists who followed them. They were smart, educated, and brave women. They broke through a ceiling, and gave all the female journalists that followed them a chance for progress.Povich captured my attention immediately, when she described the career stagnation experienced by several women working for Newsweek in the 1960s. The reader gets to know the women, and experience all the ways they experience the personal torment. We learn about their career goals, but also their personal stories. We find ourselves thinking of them as our friends. We become embroiled in the events, and hoping for change.Their history feels both shocking and familiar for any woman reading it. The book demonstrates how much progress has been made, and also reminds us of how far we need to go.When they won their lawsuit, we expect change. Unfortunately for most of them the fight continued and they never expereinced any tangible benefits to their careers. Some were finally allowed to write, instead of being exiled to the role of fact checking for the male writers, however now they were forced to write fluff stories. The men continued to progress through the ranks, and received all the best stories, while the women were forced to write about arts and culture. It took years before any women began to see the benefits of the lawsuit, and for the most part these were not the women who brought the suit. These were the next generation of female journalists.The book presents a story of change, of strength, of bravery, of women who deserve to be known.

With each clue I found myself more convinced that I was part of the excitement and might be able to find the money before the others. The action introduces us to several characters who are all thinking they can find the money - for some it is their only way out of big problems they created for themselves. The background detail allowed me to care for the characters and I found myself rooting for them. If I couldn't win the prize, I had my favorite about who I hoped would: Sally was a single mom who is about to experience a catastrophe of her own making, even prison. She needs the $50,000 prize to get out of trouble. She is likable and relatable and it is easy to see that she has only gotten into trouble in an effort to parent.

But, I was wrong. This book was powerful, moving and smart.As the book opens we hear a phone conversation between a young, desperate, hurting girl and a volunteer at a suicide hotline. The volunteer, Felicia, is distressed when the girl is going to hang up and gives her personal phone number (breaking all the rules). Soon the two are in an ongoing conversation where the girl shares more about the assault she suffered at the hands of boys in her high school. With each text, Felicia is more worried. Her own assault, years ago, causes her to feel even more empathy for the girl. And, she begins to worry that her son knows something about what happened.The book is heartbreaking, insightful and challenging.4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 10, 2024","Feb 10, 2024","Feb 10, 2024",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/203146256-one-of-our-own

However, it is a story that made me think about difficult things, and struggle with the issues that so many must confront. It made me feel anxious. And, at the same time, I couldn't put it down. I needed to know what would happen.Our main character and narrator is Dr. Oliver Harding, an English professor at a small college in Seattle. He is a white, divorced man, and finds himself infatuated by a Pakistani law professor. The book allows the reader to get into the head of Oliver, and it isn't a comfortable space. The man is obsessive, and his thoughts are often misogynistic. The things he thinks about her verge into the scary territory of a stalker -- and unfortunately it is believable. It makes the reader question whether the men around her might have similar thoughts. It makes the world feel less safe for the character, but also for the reader.The events take place during the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, and the political climate is almost another character. The fears, anger and hatred expressed towards Muslims in America jumps off every page, adding to the apprehension.It is a bold, incisive book, that challenges the reader, and I enjoyed it very much.4.5 rounded up....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 06, 2024","Feb 07, 2024","Feb 06, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61145400-the-laughter

It was a wonderful job that allowed me to travel around the world. It was also a difficult one as I was breaking into a world that had only admitted men. There were about 5 females in the entire Wing by the end of 1982. It was a world not quite ready for us. There were not flight suits or boots available in our sizes. There weren't dorm rooms and restrooms for women. It was complicated by the fact that many of the men were equally unready to accept us. I share all of this, because Hannah's book resonated with me. I was a child during the Vietnam War, but a decade later, not a lot had changed.Women were in Vietnam! Nurses were often on the front lines. They were bombed. They performed gruesome surgeries while under fire, and holding flashlights because the power was out. They wrote letters of condolence to families. They convinced young men to have hope, and sat with them as they died. They did all of this while also in danger of sexual assault by the men they worked with, and often needed men they trusted to escort them around their own base. And, after they went home to the USA nobody believed they were ever in Vietnam. Even the VA doctors refused them treatment and discounted their service.Kristin Hannah in The Women carries the reader to another time and place where the characters are very real, and the war is tangible. If you come away without a better understanding of the experiences and politics of the time, then you didn't read it well. It is a transporting, emotional and intelligent books that allows you to gain knowledge about the war and the world of the time, and also allows you to find compassion and empathy for a generation of people who came before you.There are event which are predictable, but it does nothing to ruin the story. It is a book I will recommend to everyone, and also a book that made me feel seen.Thank you @stmartinspress for my #gifted copy.

This book is complex, taking the reader into the world of Bodie Kane, a woman in her early 40's who is now dealing with issues from her traumatic teen year. It is a combination of genres: women's fiction, suspense, dark academia and drama.Bodie Kane has returned to the boarding school in New Hampshire where she was a student more than two decades before. In 1995 her roommate, Thalia Kent, was murdered. Bodie struggled. Her father and brother died, her mother abandoned her, leaving her with a cult, and when she finally is given an opportunity to make a better life, the girls' group at the school ostracized her.Today Bodie is a mother, wife (though separated), and successful podcaster. Still, she is fixated on the mystery about what happened to Thalia. She doesn't believe that the man in prison is the one who did the crime. Will one of her current students figure out what really happened? Will she?I always enjoy thrillers that bring to light real social issues and this book discusses many of them: social media bullying, sexual assualt, racism, the #metoo movement, and more.

Its a complex and intriguing story that puts so many questions in your mind. It is dystopian, speculative fiction. But it is also an LGBTQIA story. And, to make it even more engaging, the main character is a female chef, which the author uses to create a tangible connection to the story. Everyone understands food. We know what it looks like, smells like and tastes like. We know it can be appetizing or repulsive. Zhang describes all of it, so that you too will react to the food alongside the characters in the book.As the book opens our chef has arrived at a compound on a mountaintop, where they are experimenting on food: how to create new food options and how to bring back food that was destroyed when a mysterious smog covered the world and killed food sources. She is thrilled to find herself surrounded by exotic foods, allowing her to create wonderful meals using precious, delectable ingredients. She is cooking for the wealthy, who understand food, and finds joy in making them love the food enough to invest in the business.Zhang's ability to describe the food took this book from a 4 to a 5. These meals were either mouthwateringly lush and sumptuous sumptuous or nauseating and revolting. Each meal was described in beautiful detail, and my mouth actually watered or my stomach roiled.Unfortunately, things are not all good... there is something strange about her employer. It seems suspicious and unethical. And his daughter is confusing. They enter into a sexual relationship, but the relationship is by no means equal.

It is a messy story, with very realistic interactions and dialogue. At times it felt overwhelming. There is a lot of profanity, which makes sense to the people, place and plot. This is a book about generational trauma. It is a book about loss, frustration, need, and all the ways we love each other and hurt each other. It is a book about survivor's guilt. It is a book about what it is to live between two worlds, and dealing with racism and misogyny. We stand beside a child who cannot communicate in Spanish beside a white boss who assumes she can. We stand beside the auntie as she takes control when the family is trying to gain admission to a bar where they can confront Ruby. These scenes resonate because they are believable. The characters are flawed. They are living a nightmare that we have all dreaded. The situations are a nightmare, and we feel a connection to the characters due to our empathy and compassion.In 1996, 13 year old Ruthy disappeared, leaving behind her two sisters and mother. They are left to wonder what happened. Was she taken? Did she leave on her own? Is she living somewhere without them? And, then one day the sisters are watching a reality television program and become convinced that the young woman named Ruby is actually their Ruthy. Could it really be?The reader wants to believe that Ruthy is still out there, that she will return home. The reader wants them all to find a happy ending.

Whose Names are Unknown is her story of the Dust Bowl, and the migration of the ""Okies"" to California where they hope to find work and were subjected to more savage and brutal conditions. She submitted this novel to her editor in the late 1930s and it was set to be published with Random House in 1939, but after the success of Steinbeck's classic, The Grapes of Wrath, the publisher shelved it. In 2004, The University of Oklahoma Press finally published it, and I am so glad they did.The story centers around an Oklahoma family (Julia & Milt Dunne, plus Milt's father, and the couple's two daughters) who endure extreme poverty due to the Great Depression and the drought which lead to the storms known at the Dust Bowl. Unlike The Grapes of Wrath, this family doesn't leave for California in the early pages. We are in Oklahoma for a good chunk of the book, experiencing what life was like during the incessant dust storms. The reader gets a good idea of what it was like to be covered in a cloud of dust, tasting the grit, feeling the harsh and abrasive wind, and hoping that this storm would be the last. The family fights the extreme conditions for a year before they finally leave.But, unfortunately, California doesn't offer any form of plentitude.The book is a new favorite, and one day I will read this one and Steinbeck's back-to-back....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 23, 2024","Jan 24, 2024","Jan 24, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1197158.Whose_Names_Are_Unknown

And I am glad I chose to read it, as I found the writing beautiful, restained and acute. Plus the story is complex and nuanced. I found the portrayal of the characters to be sympathetic without being sentimental. I didn't always like them, but I did care about what happened to them. Their feelings were relatable and important to me. Each moment built on what happened previously, building layers of emotion and insight. I came away from the book felling like I better understood the complexities and hardships of daily life in Palestine.The story centers itself around two sisters: Sonia and Haneen. Their relationship is often strained and feels very realistic. It feels like 80% of what is happening between them goes unsaid, and as a result they walk around on eggshells, afraid to share their thoughts. Sometimes my own relationship with my sibling is similar, and so their interactions resonated with me. I found myself waiting for the tension to break, the emotions to spill over, and the sisters to spill the secrets of their shared history. Sonia has recently returned from the UK where she found success as an actress. Haneen works at the university.I am not a scholar of Shakespeare. In fact, I know very little about his works, and with this book it played a large role as Sonia becomes involved in a production of Hamlet. I am guessing that I missed a great deal of symbolism due to my own lack of education on the play.

She is responsibility for the care of her alcoholic father trying to keep up with the shabby and dilapidated house. She also works for a boys’ reform school, so even while away from the horrible house she is stuck in a gray and depressing place.When a new woman, Rebecca, comes to work at the prison they strike up a friendship, which allows Eileen to reassess her life and begn thinking about escape.Eileen is not likable. She is ridden with anxiety. She is morbid, dull, and lacking self-awareness. And yet, I found myself rooting for her to make her life better. It isn't easy to like her but it is very easy to find compassion for her.Thank you Penguin Books for the #gifted book.

The story begins when it is only the two of them, and we watch as Enzo grows from a puppy to best-friend, pet dog who becomes the pet of a growing family. Denny marries and then the two of them have a daughter. Enzo watches as life changes, and he becomes only more loved, and his observations are smart, witty, and insightful. I have two little dogs and I am constantly narrating their thoughts, which gave this book even more heart for me.Denny is a race car driver and throughout the book the stories of racing enhance the lives of all members of the family. But the heart and passion in this book comes from Enzo. He is the center of the book. He is the character I will be thinking about for a very long time. I found him to be wise, compassionate, funny, and, of course, loyal.I cried like a little girl twice. I found tears brimming in my eyes twice more.

It is a story that I sunk into after only a few pages, completely captured by the characters.The main character and narrator is a self-involved, insecure, judgmental woman. She is a writer who cannot find any success -- probably because she isn't actually very good. But, she is convinced that her more successful friend is only more successful because she is Asian, and given priority. She believes that she -- the white woman -- is a victim of racism. It's a shocking idea, and yet it resonates because there are people who actually feel this way. She is desperate for a book that will bring her fame, power, and attention. And, so, when her friend dies, she steals her newly finished manuscript and submits it as her own.This is a story about resentment, jealousy, desire, and the things that some people will do to gain power. I often dislike satire, because it feels so cynical and negative to me. But this book is thought-provoking, modern and intriguing. I was rooting for this character to find her way out of the mess she made, to learn, grow, and move forward in her life. The author took us into the character's world and allowed us to both hate the character, and still find hope that she would become a better person through the lessons she would learn. It's a complex and challenging story, that forces the reader to consider things that are not easy to think about.

It is done so well that I found myself standing outside the burning city, on the waterfront, trying to comprehend how we would recover.In the early morning of April 18, 1906, a devastating 7.9 magnitude earthquake shook San Francisco. As the shockwaves rumbled through the city, buildings collapsed while people tried to find places of safety. Quickly thereafter, people trapped below rubble were also finding themselves flooded by rising sea water, and then by fires which turned into an immense firestorm. Flames consumed the city for days, and unfortunately the city was completely unprepared. Many of the fire hydrants failed to work, firefighters were forced to fight fires without break and without the infrastructure necessary.The author used first-hand accounts found in letters and diaries and wrote the story in such a way as to reveal the stories of destruction, loss, greed and corruption, and survival. It is a fascinating book about a tragedy that was so much bigger than I ever knew. It is told with respect and intimacy, introducing the reader to the people who lived, and also to many who died. It carried me to time and place, and I found myself emotional to the point of tears at times, and angry at others. I was truly blown away at how well this nonfiction book developed the character of the people on its pages and also of the city itself.I highly recommend this one to everyone.Thank you @stmartinspress for the #gifted book.

Narrated by a 20 year old young woman named Mia, it is the story of a Korean American family who are dealing with issues of racism, ableism, and the search for their missing husband/father. Mia has a wonderful, unique voice: she is pessimistic, blunt, skeptical and reserved. She sees much of life in black and wife. She is also a genius, and is booth angry and sad after her father disappears.Mia has two brothers. Her twin, John, who is much more optimistic, joyful and tenderhearted than she is, and Eugene, who is autistic and has Angelman syndrome which prevents him from speaking. Much of their lives revolve around caring for Eugene, chasing miracle cures and trying to placate the boy.In the first pages of the book Eugene returns home without his father, after they had went for their daily walk. He is frightened, irritable, and unable to explain what happened. What follows is the search for answers. The police are brought in but they focus on Eugene, which only makes matters worse. It is an emotional and thought-provoking story, challenging the reader to see Eugene differently. It forces you to examine your own prejudices and wrong assumptions about people around you. The characters are each flawed, making them feel very real. This is every family. They are your neighbors, friends and family. You feel their pain and sadness, and are sad to leave them behind when you finish the last page....more",Notes are private!,2,6,1,"Nov 27, 2023","Nov 28, 2023","Nov 27, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/75495002-happiness-falls

It is a melancholic story.In the opening chapter, we meet Jacob Hampton, who is sitting on guard duty trying to spot any potential attacks by the enemy, and thinking about his pregnant wife, Naomi. Jacob's parents opposed their marriage, and so Naomi is being looked after by his friend Blackburn, who works as a caretaker at the local cemetery.Jacob is attacked by a North Korean. In the struggle Jacob is injured, but stays alive because he manages to kill the attacker.Back in his hometown Blackburn and Naomi have grown close, but she is ostracized by the town who consider her a gold-digger. When Jacob's father confronts her, she is hurt, embarrassed and angry, so she leaves town returning to her widowed father, who is also bitter and resentful.Unfortunately Jacob's injury gives his parent's and opportunity to separate the couple further, and their decisions lead to heartache, loss, grief, and more. The story is a wonderful examination of human emotion. We find so much empathy in our hearts that it almost feels as though these characters are our real-life friends. They are complex people with real thoughts and emotions who we love or hate based on our own life experiences.And, it isn't only the storytelling that is beautiful. The author uses language to create vivid images, describing the changing seasons in a way that the reader sees the flowers poke through the grass in the spring and the leaves fall to the ground in the fall. The reader sees the light filtering through the brancches, creating shadows. The reader sees Blackburn as he tends the grass, and the images create a pensive, wistful mood.Thank you to the publisher for the #gifted copy of this wonderful book.

She did a powerful and commanding job voicing each and every character. Her raspy, hoarse voice brought the mood of the pieces into play, and I was transported into their world. I found the pairing of author and narrator to be perfection. Nobody else could have matched better.Parker's stories are filled with sarcastic, caustic humor. They are dark, sad stories, where it is difficult to like the characters -- and yet you will feel compassion and empathy for all of them. You will watch as alcoholism destroyed s lives, as marriages disintegrate, as women are used and discarded by lovers and bosses. You will find yourself angry, sad, and hurt.

It is set 15 years after the first book ends.Mitch and Abby are now living in New York, raising twin boys, and he is a partner in one of the largest law firms. They seem to have put the past far behind them, they rarely even speak about Memphis or the events that caused them to make a great escape. They have a good life.Mitch has been asked to travel to Rome to work with one of their managing partners, Luca. The case involves a major contractor from Turkey and a bridge in Libya. Soon after Mitch's arrival in Rome he learns that Luca has cancer and wants Mitch to take over. Luca's daughter, Giovanna, is an associate in the firm (out of London) and she will work alongside Mitch.Mitch and Giovanna will meet in Libya to see the bridge and discuss their stategy. However, when Mitch is unable to go, she makes the choice to go alone, with assigned security. When she is taken as a hostage Mitch is determined to put together the $100 Million demanded by the kidnappers. He quickly learns that the other partners in his firm are greedy and spineless, leaving him and Luca alone to figure it out. It is a great mirror to the Mitch we knew all those years ago, and allows us to reinvest in the character.I enojoyed the return to Mitch & Abby.Thank you to the publisher for sending me a finished copy of this book.

A friend gave me their copy of The Firm, which I read, enjoyed and put aside. Then, last week, I received a #gifted copy of the sequel, The Exchange.

I think I like the story even more this time, though I am surprised that it didn't scare me away from tax law back then!The story revolves around Mitchell McDeere and his law career in the Bendini, Lambert and Locke. As he graduates near the top of his class at Harvard he wooed by the firm. Everything seems so perfect -- the firm appears to offer everything that he and his wife are looking for. In fact, it offers so much more than they hoped for.Nobody has ever quit this firm. They all have beautiful families, fancy cars, large homes, and business trips to the Cayman Islands. After he arrives there he starts to see the cracks in the facade, including lawyers who died under mysterious circumstances. It isn't long before Mitch is using his legal skills to quietly investigate the other men he works with.It is an intriguing, provoking and thrilling book.

It is a book about social justice, told in the most unique fashion. The writing is brilliant, and I am putting this one on my desired short-list for the Aspen Words Literary Prize.The story concerns the commercially successful Criminal Action Penal Entertainment program (CAPE), which allows convicted murderers to earn their way out of prison... Each prisoner or link, is part of a chain, and they fight in death matches with links in other chains. The story is brutal. These men and women are televised fighting for their lives. It is blood sport, in the most vivid, and gruesome way. The country is obsessed with the sport, packing stadiums to watch, and the prisons are making large sums of money. To make it worse, they keep changing the rules.The victorious links rise through the ranks of their chain, in the hopes that they will eventually earn freedom.The two most popular prisoners/fighters are Loretta Thruwar and Hamara Stacker. They are on the same chain, and are lovers as well as teammates. Thurwar is only a few wins away from freedom, unless that rule changes like so many others.It is impossible to read this book without thinking about the state of our prison system. The violence is shocking, sad and inhumane, and it makes the reader contemplate the ways we ignore, out of negligence or intent, the brutality and savage nature of the prison system. It becomes impossible to avoid the realization that there are people living in cages, fighting for sustenance, lonely, frightened, and lacking in all of the things that make humans human. The characters are toys to all of those who are gaining power, prominence and riches off their lives, much like prisoners are today.The book is hard to take, in that it depicts violence so openly. It is a gritty and sometime gruesome book. But, that is part of what makes it impactful. I often thought about two books when reading this one: Orwell's 1984 and McCarthy's The Road. A couple of years ago I also read American Prison by Shane Bauer: an excellent nonfiction exposé of the for-profit prison systems. It would pair perfectly with this book, allowing the reader to more fully understand the messages contained on the pages of both....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Feb 13, 2024Oct 24, 2023","Feb 16, 2024Oct 24, 2023","Oct 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61190770-chain-gang-all-stars

The book is moving, moody and engrossing. The story takes place in a tiny town: Sugar Bend, Alabama. It is a place where everyone knows everyone. It sounds charming and romantic, but is it?Two sisters grew up in Sugar Bend during the 1970s and 1980s. They are very different from one another. Violet is the oldest, and is a smart, sensible girl. Her younger sister Trudy, is popular and outgoing. Trudy is the beautiful one. She is the one everyone expects to marry well, and to be successful at everything she does. Unfortunately they live with a drunk and abusive father, and an absent mother who disappeared in the middle of the night, leaving Violet a note instructing her to take care of her sister.Flash forward, 40 years, and the sisters own a business together and live together. Trudy is mute after suffering a trauma decades earlier. She creates beautiful artistic pieces from found items, which are sold in their shop. Trudy communicates with Violet through notes.Both sisters have secrets, which slowly unfold, allowing the reader to immerse themselves into their lives and experience their emotions.Thank you to Harper Muse for the #gifted book, in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 30, 2023",Oct 2023,"Sep 28, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60693360-a-place-to-land

The two must survive a dangerous world, while suffering loss of almost everything they knew. When the suffering and hardship get to be too much, Eliza becomes mute and ConaLee must take the role of parent and caretaker.

It is a dismal, sad, reflective story.Orwell takes the reader to Paris in the late 1930's, but it isn't a romantic journey. The first person narrator is living in squalor. He is barely able to feed himself, hoping to find work somewhere as a writer, he instead must work long hours as a dishwasher. The descriptions of the work, the attitudes and the things done by the employees are sometimes shocking. It is moving to find all of the workers surviving by pawning their belongings or stealing food.Later the narrator moves back to London, after securing a job. Still, he must spend time as a vagrant, moving from one shelter to another. This section was fascinating as he was able to describe the failings of the system in place at that time. I learned a lot, and found myself very sad on behalf of Orwell and the characters.The writing is spare, sharp and simple.

It is a story of one woman, and her reflections on her past, sharing her stories with her daughters. Long-married, she once loved another man who went on to fame as an actor. As she looks back on that part of her life, it is almost dream-like. There is no heat or passion now, there is just a bit of humor and sentimentality. I enjoyed that style of storytelling as I understand it well. I will soon be 61 and am married for 28 years. I have past loves and despite the fact that I was devastated when the relationships ended, today it is just a soft, noiseless whisper... a calm memory.I do think I missed a great deal in this book because I have never read (or seen) the play, Our Town.

It felt choppy and gave the impression that she was telling more than one story. Having said that, it inspire me to learn more about Eileen Blair and to read more Orwell. For that reason I give the book 4 stars.The first few chapters felt like I was listening to my friend tell the story of the day she met her hero, favorite author, and her disappointment that he wasn't the man she expected. My hero author is John Steinbeck, and I could picture myself having dinner with him, being totally startstruck, but them finding that he was sloppy and angry, drunk and mean-spirited, instead of the compassionate and insightful man I have found on the pages of his books.I also felt the author failed to look at Orwell through the lens of time.However, when we moved further into the book I found myself inspired by Eileen, and her story. I was happy to find an intelligent, forward-thinking, strong woman. I found myself immediately purchasing and reading another biography of her.

This is much more exciting than I expected. It is a suspenseful story that built tension slowly, steadily and gave me a sense of dread.Sun Damage by Sabine Durrant takes place in the South of France. We meet Sean and Ali - who we quickly find out are grifters, and they have a new mark. Lulu appears to lack substance: a fluffy, spoiled and vacuous young woman. The most intriguing part of this early story is watching Ali as her emotions take over. She isn't comfortable in her role. She resents Sean, and she is angry when he keeps changing their path. Ali is a relatable woman despite the trouble she gets into, and I found myself on her side very quickly.(view spoiler)[When it soon appears Sean may have murdered Lulu, Ali decides she must find a way to escape. She has soon stepped into the shoes of Lulu, hiding from Sean and trying to figure out a path forward. (hide spoiler)]The writing is sharp, crisp and vivid. I was carried along at a brisk pace, turning pages, wondering how Ali could get herself out of the mess that just kept growing. The author gives little moments of reprieve, when we see Ali in small moments, let her guard down, and with her I found myself taking a breath and releasing the tension.Thank you Harper Collins for the #gifted finished copy of this book.

It isn't out of the realm of possibility. Iris (Ines) is a first generation US citizen- she was born in the United States, her parents were born in Mexico. She lives here. She went to school here. She is American. Unfortunately, though, a new idea has taken hold: Everyone will wear a bracelet which carries all of their personal information. It is used for everything. It is a way of storing everything important. Driver's license, banking, grocery apps, credit cards, reservations at restaurants. The bracelet is purported to stop trafficking. It could result in the ability to find missing children quickly.It is meant to make life easy... or is it?Iris loves the idea. Until she cannot get one.You cannot escape the idea the author is putting forward. His message is clear. It is probably even a bit amateurish, however, it is nonetheless powerful and moving.

When Kate briefly looks down at a text on her phone, Olivia disappears in the waves. A minute or so later, she pops up and everything continues as normal. But, in the second timeline, Olivia doesn't resurface.The unique story-telling style allows the reader to see how life changes in the aftermath of loss, and how grief changes us. It is a story of raw, unimaginable grief. It is a story of they type of pain nobody should ever experience. And, it is also the story of the slow, difficult journey towards acceptance. The author provides moments of relief, when the pain gets to be too much we switch from the second timeline back to the second.I also loved that in the first timeline the author doesn't create a perfect girl, who does everything her mother asks.

These women created a legacy which led to my own service in the Air Force almost 40 years later. The book is packed full of interesting details. It brought forth facts that shocked me. For example, when women first volunteered for war they were not officially members of the military, which meant if they were injured they were not given any form of disability pay and if they died in service they did not receive any benefits. Even after their status was changed they were paid substantially less than men doing the same job.I loved this book, and I hope to reread it again very soon....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 20, 2023","Aug 21, 2023","Aug 24, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61858962-valiant-women

Deputy Packard is looking into the last few days of his victim's life, and is finding nothing but dead-ends. And, while the investigation is happening, more people are dying. Soon an attack is made against him, and that makes him believe that he is onto something... but what did he uncover?My biggest complaint about the book is that there were too many suspects, and I didn't really believe that most of them had any motives. Some of them felt like red herrings, and some of them felt like they were too perfect. However, I did like the main character, and felt like he would be a good lead for a series.

It takes place during two timelines, and the story is unique compared to anything else I have read.Part of the story takes place in the 1950s, where a young Russian spy has managed to obtain employment at the nuclear testing site. I had to put aside some of my disbelief here, as I am certain that these workers would have all had top secret clearances.The other part of the story takes place in current day, and centers on a sheriff (and former intelligence officer in the Army) in a community north of Las Vegas, in the same town where his dad was once sheriff. A retired FBI agent is murdered, and the investigation points to the testing site. The sheriff teams up with an agent, and they become embroiled in learning more about the events of the past.I found the storyline of the past more intriguing, despite the unbelievability. I hated that in the current storyline the author chose to create an immediate flirtation between the sheriff and FBI agent.

As the story opens she has just won her latest case -- where she represented George Benedict, a scientific researcher who is now famous for developing a vaccine for Alzheimer’s and whom Kelly has just gotten off after he was charged with sexual assault.Unfortunately she quickly learns that he was definitely guilty, and becomes his latest victim. Her hands are seemingly tied, until she reaches out to some of his former victims and they put together a revenge scheme.Kelly is not always likable, and we find her home life is complicated and confusing, but all of that made the story even more powerful. She is not a wallflower. She does not look like a victim. This is a woman that we would think is too strong to be victimized, and because of that it shows how we can all be hurt.This book is certainly inspired by the #MeToo movement which saw the downfall of Harvey Weinstein among others. It is emotionally charged, as it should be.

Although it can be read as a standalone, I recommend starting from the beginning. Some of the character development along the way enriches this book.The story starts with a quick, shocking murder scene. We are immediately into the guessing game, suspecting everyone. A young Amish man is found dead, and they quickly realize he was shot with a bow, and that the murderer pulled the arrow from his body before leaving his body. This young man seems to be a pillar of the community. Likable, respected and loved. But, who wants him dead?Kate is only days away from her wedding, but needs to solve the case without distractions. She quickly finds that there are many secrets and that the story of the victim's life is much darker than she would have guessed. I always enjoy spending some time in the rolling hills of Amish country. I like the supporting cast, and find Kate' history an important part of her ability to solve crime in this community.Thank you @macmillan.audio for the #gifted audibook. I will be back for book #16!

The story is told in the narration of three characters, all of whom are well-written.Mina, is a 12 year old girl living in the 19th century; Evie, a girl who lives in the 21st century; and Grey, a mysterious and shadowy figure who lends the story its suspense. Although the two girls are living in drastically different times, the connections between the two are believable.The girls are dealing with catastrophic and traumatic life events. Mina was stolen from her home and forced into dangerous work. She longs to be home, but instead will find herself changing history. Evie is the child of celebrities, but when she learns her father is dying she is desperate to say goodbye, after missing the chance with her mother. These events will force her to confront an old secret which has haunted them both.The biggest miss for me is the character of Grey.

If you haven't heard about her extraordinary life, blame your teachers, parents and text books. This woman was an intelligent and interesting human who broke all the rules and created a safer space for all the women who came after her. Thank you Lorissa Rinehart for writing this book! It is inspirational, moving and I loved learning more about this remarkable woman.Dickey Chapelle was a war correspondent. A small woman, carrying her camera into the most dangerous places, decked out in cats-eye glasses, pearl earrings, and military fatigue. During WWII she jumped onto the open ship's deck to capture a photo of the Japanese bomber aiming for the ship. She took photos of doctors and nurses giving their own blood in order to encourage those back home to give more. During Vietnam she walked the jungles with the toughest marines.And between these wars you could find her in Cuba during their internal war, or in Algeria where they were fighting for independence from the French. She witnessed the infestation of locusts in the Middle East, and documented the failure of the west to offer any real aid. She went to India where she documented the ways American tractors impacted farming. In Hungary she reported on the Hungarian Revolution, where she was arrested and imprisoned, tortured physically and emotionally.She lived her life telling the stories and arguing that women were best suited for the job. She told military leaders that only a woman could tell the story to the women back home, because men would never understand how to reach into their hearts. She lived her life at war, with only a camera as protection. Dickey didn't just write the stories. She shared her heart. She cared, and it showed in her stories.And, still, very few people know her name. She has been mostly forgotten. (view spoiler)[She died in the Vietnam war.(view spoiler)[ It wasn't until 2017 that she was made an honorary Marine.There is no doubt that this will be in my top 10 this year. It will have a permanent place on my bookshelf. Thank you @stmartinspress for the #gifted finished copy of this extraordinary book. I loved everything about it.
