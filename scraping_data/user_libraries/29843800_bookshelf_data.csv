Fortunately, my library had it on its shelves.Written in 1978, this novella is about a young Japanese woman and her young daughter about to turn three. The young woman has just separated from her husband and the father of her child, so she moved into another apartment, on the top floor of a business complex. The apartment is very well lit, which is not easy to find.There isn't much to this novel, it's quite mundane. The mother, a librarian, struggles, trying to get a divorce, dealing with the rinse and repeat cycle of work, childcare and chores.

It's not.Hera is twenty-four and just muddles through life. She doesn't know what she wants from life, she's intelligent but not willing to settle, and she's antsy. She's got a couple of humanities degrees, she'd rather study than work for a corporation, but one needs money to survive, even though she's living in her father's place and doesn't have to pay rent.So she takes a job to moderate comments for a news website. She hates her job, most colleagues and is quietly dispering. One day she stumbles upon Arthur, a forty-something journalist, who is intrigued by her bluntness and sense of humour.Hera has mostly been with women, suddenly she's into this guy and enjoys having snarky, teasing chat message exchanges. Besides, she's so damn bored. So what's a man and a woman to do - they hook up. Besides the age gap, there's one little problem - the dude is married. Oh, the cliche. Hera is aware, she's not stupid. So what will happen to them, will he leave his wife? They are both declarative and the guy makes promises, but because he's such a nice guy he has to find the right time, he doesn't want to hurt his partner of twenty years. Feel free to roll your eyes, I certainly did.I get why some would hate this book - Hera is not that particularly likeable, she makes a problematic choice, or several, still, despite those barriers, there were quite a few things I appreciated about this novel: - a realistic, flawed main heroine, bonus points for her being bisexual; - she's witty and quite in touch with herself, oh the irony that she still lies to herself for a man, an undecided, coward - but, it's love! - it was just different from all the other Gen Z, millennial sad female character novels.This is not for everyone, but a worthy debut novel. ...more",Notes are private!,14,21,1,"Mar 29, 2024","Apr 05, 2024","Mar 29, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127282597-green-dot

If you're like me, you don't need to worry about this novel. Hawke sure took the mantra, advice ""write what you know"" to heart, as this novel is about a thirty-two-year-old movie actor, who's about to divorce his gorgeous, talented, famous music star wife. He's taken a beating in the media due to his cheating and there's disdain thrown his way. He's also starting a new challenge, being in a Shakespeare play on Broadway.The poor, pretty boy William, just wants to be loved and admired, he wants to be a good dad and his marriage to work, why doesn't the world give him a break? (insert small violins)At some point, I was asking myself why am I listening to a novel about a self-involved actor, who's got a crisis of confidence and feels sorry for himself and self-sabotages.Truthfully, this was well written, at times brilliant, at times self-indulgent and infuriating. Hawke was such an excellent narrator, it only showcased how smoothly the novel flowed and the naturalness of the dialogue.

UnfortunaI had to DNF, despite listening to over 6 hrs of this overly long novel.Many of my GR friends loved this novel so I was sure I'd love it to. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Early on, my antennas were raised, first, it was the very modern language and concepts that felt off to me. I had to double check that it wasn't one of those dual time novels and that I wasn't listening to a modern day section. It's all set in the eighteenth century. The first obvious anachronism - the use of the term vernix to describe the film many newborns are covered in when coming into the world. I'm annoying like that and googled, apparently, ""the term 'Vernix caseosa' first appeared in 1846 in the Dunglison dictionary of Medical Sciences.""I continued on. Our heroine is Martha Ballard, a fifty-four year old midwife, who sounded like a modern-day woman, the way she was challenging the status-quo, the men and the entire society was so outside of anything I could believe, it really irked me. This is yet another so called ""historical fiction"" that doesn't care much about history, fact and takes lots of liberties. I find it more jarring and frankly insulting, when we have google at our fingertips.The husband, whatever his name was, a carpenter, was so unbelievable, even if he had been a contemporary man. Were people French kissing in the 18th century? While we don't know for sure people's proclivities, it's unlikely they would do that when cleanliness was dubious. Speaking of cleanliness, Martha knew about disinfecting wounds back then? I can't be bothered to search, but I'm dubious.Irrespective of all these many anachronisms, the liberties taken with language and people's behaviours and the fact that Martha was better than everyone in so many respects irked me big time. I'm a feminist, I'm passionate about reinstating, reviving the ""forgotten women"", but we don't need to go so over the board, even if it's fiction. ...more",Notes are private!,12,22,1,"Mar 12, 2024","Mar 13, 2024","Mar 12, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/112975658-the-frozen-river

A collision with a scooter and a contusion pushes her to quit her secure but boring job.With no savings (something that didn't make sense for her personality and age - but I digress), Amelia moves in with her scatterbrained mother who lives in a cluttered house, which drives Amerlia crazy, but beggars can't be choosers.How's Amelia supposed to know what she wants to do next when she pretty much had the same job after finishing university? She decides to try different jobs, so she takes on different work-experience gigs - working in a surfboard shack, a florist's shop, as a teacher's assistant, in wedding planning and volunteering at the zoo, while also writing articles about her experiences as an adult trainee for a prestigious magazine (we all know it's easy to get freelance writing gigs with no experience, insert sarcasm ;-)).The realist I grumbled at times at all the opportunities that came Amelia's way, especially when it came to certain work experience areas that are difficult to get into even as a volunteer. Who doesn't love a good heroine growth journey, right? This one had plenty of growth, to the point that Amelia became a completely new person - nobody changes that much, and certain traits and characteristics are ingrained, otherwise, we'd all be perfect if changing was that easy.

We find out she's an empty nester, as her three boys had left their home in pursue of degrees and lives as adults.

Oh, the agony of the first love. The mature me got irked by it, telling her to get a grip, asking myself was I that pathetic and obsessed? Very likely. The two become an item for a little while, but then Simon moves to Paris. We follow Marianne's life, as she attempts to finish a secretarial college in London, as she dates again and just finds herself directionless, letting things and life happen, including when it comes to partnering. Then she finds herself married to a man whom she doesn't love, but she was expecting a child and it was the sixties. Class, parenting, gender roles, and the stiffness of English relationships, are some of the motifs that gently emanate from the novel. The main one for me was about gender roles, women's lack of autonomy, and the lack of expectations for themselves, besides marrying well.

But never say never ...Back to the book. Laing moved to New York in her mid-thirties and found herself feeling utterly lonely even though she was surrounded by so many people. Does one feel more lonely when one is in proximity to so many people? Laing ponders these questions and then she starts looking at some New York-based artists and their art and lives, with Andy Warhol featured greatly - I'm guessing he's a favourite of hers, not to mention there was plenty of material about him, from him, which made the elusive attempt of ""knowing him"" somewhat easier. She also brings into the mix the famous Edward Hopper - best known for his paintings depicting loneliness and loners in the big city. A few other artists and their art and lives were also interspersed throughout - some I'd heard of, some were introduced to me for the first time - Henry Darger, Valerie Solanas, David Wojnarowicz and a few more. Vivian Maier, one of my favourite street photographers, was briefly mentioned, and so was Billie Holliday (I had no idea about her traumatic and tragic life). To be honest, the only small grumble I had with this book was that there weren't more women featured - even though I get why.There is a commonality between all these artists - they were different, queer, non-caucasian, many had mental health issues, survived childhood traumas, some probably were on the autism spectrum. Laing argues excellently that being different in any way very likely enhances one's detachment from society, in many cases, the members of society ignore and push away the unknown, the uncomfortable, the strangeness, the unconforming. While New York and the artists feature greatly, I would be remiss not to mention the writing which was of the highest level, each sentence was beautifully crafted - I was in awe. Of course, that prompts to seek more works by Laing....more",Notes are private!,30,28,1,"Feb 26, 2024","Feb 29, 2024","Feb 26, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25667449-the-lonely-city

Reading about it, I discovered it was inspired/adapted from a novel by Alasdair Gray, a writer I hadn't heard of.Of course, I had to read the book. I'm glad that I did as the novel had so many more facets than the movie - and I'm not one of those people who expect the screen adaptations to be exact representations of the text that inspired the script. This novel was original and had so many things that appealed to me: a strong, interesting female character, feminist themes, anti-colonialism, anti-patriarchy, and anti-religion. Gray played beautifully with form and the changes in PoVs worked well to unfold the story, I was surprised, to say the least, by how the novel ended. I hope I get the time and disposition to read the book in print, as I wasn't as taken with the narrators, I don't know why, they did a decent job.After having read the book, I'm even more in awe of Yorgos Lanthimos and Tony McNamara for how they adapted the novel. In saying all that, there is room for another adaptation - perhaps a mini-series that will be closer to the novel, as there's so much great material.Anyway, I urge you to read the novel and watch the movie, in whatever order, although, as far as I'm concerned, I'm glad I did the movie first. ...more",Notes are private!,16,26,1,"Feb 22, 2024","Feb 25, 2024","Feb 22, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/72355.Poor_Things

When their father dies, the brother inherits everything, so they have to make do and adapt to their new circumstances.Despite being twins, the two sisters are opposite in character and appearance - Lady Augusta is tall, not necessarily the demure, fainting kind, she's quite feisty and doesn't suffer fools.

Have you noticed how there are no women who have a second family?

While listening to this, I was wondering for a while whether I was listening to Phosphorescence as many of the anecdotes, and stories were known to me - her love of the ocean, her multiple operations and treatments for cancer, her relationships, her mother working in prisons with Catholic organisations and a few other bits and pieces.Nevertheless, I didn't mind it, her shooting voice was a good companion while I spent a million hours in the kitchen over the Christmas period. The irony wasn't lost on me when she mentioned the unequal division of domestic and emotional labour. Grace is such a wishy-washy word, so hard to define, Baird herself realised. You could call it forgiveness, giving second chances - I don't know. She offers some examples of people who suffered great, unimaginable losses - who eventually came to forgive those who caused those losses. I get it, forgiving needs to happen in order to move forward. But also, it can't be forced, and if it doesn't occur that's perfectly valid, well, it's reality, it's a personal choice and/or ability.We all get hurt and we hurt others, intentionally and unintentionally, we should keep that in mind. ...more",Notes are private!,3,15,1,"Dec 25, 2023","Dec 27, 2023","Dec 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56153870-bright-shining

Then, when James switched to his normal, inner voice which was much easier to understand, I had to work at suspending my disbelief as he was a little too articulate, the language quite refined - I just didn't see how and when he'd had had the time, opportunity to acquire such skills. The spectrum between illiteracy to understanding Voltaire, philosophy etc. is vast. Anyway, James/Jim's intelligence allowed Everett to bring in issues relating to slavery, religion (of course I loved Jim's agnosticism) etc.The reveal at the end felt a bit forced.So, I'm sorry to say that, yet again, I won't be jumping on the bandwagon, although I'll wave when it passes by and wish it arrives at its destination.

In this case, Zoe's husband of many years died suddenly. After his death, she buys an abandoned church in a small town and takes on converting it into a home.

Let me explain.I was super keen to read this but was prepared for a long wait as I was late to reserve it. But then, I came across a newly added e-audiobook on one of the library apps and I didn't have to wait that long after all.I appreciate Hannah's objective - remembering the somewhat forgotten women who served in the Vietnam War, most of them as nurses and in other non-combat roles.This novel should have been titled The Woman as it focuses on Frankie McGrath, a privileged South California young woman, who's just finished nursing school. Her beloved older brother joins the forces as a helicopter pilot, but he soon dies. It's difficult to say what worked and didn't work for me without giving away spoilers.I'll try to be succinct. Kidding. :-) - some incredible, improbable situations, such as an inexperienced recent graduate being sent to the front;- Frankie being such a heroine, she's in the middle of everything, barely sleeping; - several men falling for her, admittedly... horny young men, a few women, away from home ... - there's a lot of hand-wringing, so much explaining and overexplaining, Hannah tells us how to feel and what Frankie's thoughts are, which probably would have irked me less had the novel been written in the first person.- there is so much misfortune and grief that Frankie goes through - at some point, I became numb. This is not to say that I haven't read, or watched movies and documentaries about that war and its many atrocities and casualties, it's just that so many happened to and around Frankie.- while the first half was understandably repetitive due to being war and things happening a certain way, slowly, the novel veered into a soap opera.- then there are the characters in the novel: the two female nurses who became her best friends (side note: the twenty-year-old had no best friend before joining the war effort - weird). despite not working together and barely seeing each other, they became ""best friends"". Whatever. After the world, they were able to fly to California, dropping careers, studies or jobs, whenever Frankie was in distress and needed them. Did people do that in the 70s?- the love/lust interests are just cardboard characters, there's not much substance to the affairs, even if some were just affairs of the heart. What I'm trying to say is that it felt that several characters were conveniently added to move the plot, to add to the drama. Certain situations, reactions, and dialogues were incredible, I raised my skeptical eyebrow a few times.- Hannah covered a lot in this novel: how women were treated/mistreated; the social aspects rang true, including the society's disenchantment with the veterans and their mistreatment to a certain degree; PTSD and the resulting addictions and post-war struggles the veterans faced; many important events are mentioned; after all, it was an era of great unrest and change.- while there was a lot to cover, this novel felt too long, albeit it was easy to get through - my journey was facilitated by Julia Whelan's soothing narration. I get why so many readers loved this novel, kudos to Hannah for giving it so much time and consideration.

This time of the year is super busy, so my mood is not the best. This book won the Booker Prize and some expectations and pressures accompany the reading and ing such a novel. The plot can be summed up as a professional Irish mother and her four children, including a baby, are trying to survive the authoritarian/fascist new regime that sees her union leader and teacher husband being apprehended by authorities. On top of that, she's got to deal with her ailing, demented father. She is kind of naive in the beginning, believing in the rule of law, human rights and common sense - oh, how easily those principles of modern democracies can crumble. Her naivete was even more striking as she lived in Ireland. But we all have our blind spots and some people are the half-full type of people. Moving on. Not to spoil it, but there's more chaos, misinformation, confusion and a lot of grief.I couldn't help but think of those suffering through armed conflicts, bombings and other such reprehensible things inflicted by other humans on other humans. The writing was good, but things didn't hit me on an emotional level, I'm happy to blame my mood for my lack of emotional conectiveness. Now that I try to articulate things here and to myself, I'm convinced that had Lynch used the first-person narration, the novel would have been more impactful, at least for this reader. Also, while Gerry O'Brien was perfectly adequate, I thought it was a peculiar choice to have a male narrator deliver this novel mostly about a woman's journey.

Honestly, had it not been available as an audiobook, I probably wouldn't have read it, despite having loved Hill's debut, an equally long novel. Nathan Hill is a clever cookie, with a penchant for digging into what makes people the way they are, and why they behave a certain way.Jack and Elizabeth are a couple struggling with their relationship after 20 years of being together. Busy jobs, a challenging kid, a mortgage and all the grown-up hullaballoo tend to get in the way, even for couples with good intentions. Jack and Elizabeth are different people, with completely distinct backgrounds, professions and personalities. Elizabeth is a scientist, who is leading Wellness, a company dealing with the placebo effect and other psychological research. Jack is a photography lecturer at a university. He struggles in his profession and with the new business-oriented leadership. His photography is not lifting his spirits either.Hill takes us back and forth in time, not only looking at Jack and Elizabeth at previous life stages but also giving us a background of their parents and ancestors. As someone interested in psychology, human behaviour etc., I appreciated the many insights into those fields. There's also a lot of information (some may call it info dumping) on social media, and algorithms, which was interesting even though I was partially aware of its machinations, not that I don't fall into its grip, although I like to delude myself that I know what they're doing but I'm allowing it to happen - Hill would have something things to say about one's power of lying to oneself. :-) There's quite a bit on psychology, the placebo effect in particular - I found that interesting.A lot is happening in this novel, many questions are raised, and some answers are provided - I found it all fascinating, revelatory, intriguing and informative.

It was so lovely to reacquaint myself with the Deleanu family, with Olguța, Dănuț and Monica. I was apprehensive that this wouldn't live up to my fond memories, but I'm happy to report it wasn't the case. I was surprised to rediscover the regionalisms and archaic words, there were so many I had to guesstimate. This was written in the 1920's, by a Moldavian writer/lawyer. Moldavia is in the NE of Romania, the language and the accent there are different to standard Romanian, it was even more so 100 years ago. I was able to find the English translation and occasionally I would check to see how they translated certain things - I'm happy to say the translation is pretty good, but the regionalisms and archaic words are lost in translation.This first volume introduces us to the Deleanu family and their property in Medeleni, a village somewhere in Moldavia. They're affluent, have a big property and lots of servants, the economic gap between them and the peasants is huge. They're nice people, though. The Deleanus take under their wing Monica, an orphaned girl who's Olguța's best friend and schoolmate. They're both nine years old. Dănuț is eleven, he's getting pushed around and challenged by his sister. I've always adored Olguța, it was the first time and only time when I came across a girl character that I shared similarities with. She was feisty, cheeky, challenging and very determined. Oh, how she tormented her older brother - loved that. :-) This first volume takes place in the school summer holidays, the kids are playing their simple games, there are family feasts and so on. When the autumn comes the family's dynamic changes forever as Dănuț is sent to a boarding high school in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, which is around 500 km away, which for the 1910's would mean a long trip by train at the beginning of the 20th century. It was fantastic reading this again. Of course, as the cliche goes, it reminded me of simpler times, especially when I was a child.

Gottlieb is a fascinating person. In this book, she mixes personal background This was such a good read/listen, albeit slightly on the too-long side. Gottlieb is a fascinating person. In this book, she mixes personal background and stories with a few clients' stories and issues that she had seen in her practice. I find it interesting and also perplexing that therapists who are supposed to know so much about human psychology, behaviour etc. seek other psychologists's help on occasion. It could be because it's easier to help others than to help ourselves, or it's easier to see certain things clearly from the outside when we're not involved or affected personally. The case studies she provided were all valuable, albeit they all resolved, if there's such a thing.My takeaways: - everybody seeks/needs to be loved, seen and understood, and to feel secure.- things in our childhood tend to shape so much of who we are, for better or worse, but also, no matter how good a parent is they're inevitably going to screw up their kids one way or another.- fear makes us do crazy things, e.g. fear of abandonment, therefore I'll push the other person away etc.- the obvious - we only have one life, there's no do-overs, there's only today.Indeed, we should all talk to someone, but let's face it unless you're desperate to receive help, it can feel like such an extravagance given the exorbitant hourly fees. I had another thought while listening to this - there was never any mention of any patients being neurodivergent, surely, being wired differently makes things more challenging? I couldn't help but wonder if Gotlieb treats everyone the same because she doesn't think neurodivergence is an issue, or because the root of most problems is similar? It's also possible that she just picked cases that served the scope of this well-realised book. After all, nobody can cover everything. I'll probably never find out the answer and I'll have to be OK with it.

Subjectively, I just couldn't connect, I often found myself reading but not taking anything in.The protagonists of this short novel (something that goes in the plus category) are two men who are a bit different: Calvert is a Falkland Islands veteran with a good case of PTSD, Redbone is an anti-authoritarian, musician of sorts. It's 1989, somewhere in England. The two friends have plans and goals - to make crop circles. Calvert is the logistics man, Redbone is the designer/creator of those crop circles that get more and more sophisticated. They do it at night, it's all anonymous.

When we meet the protagonist, she's a twenty-six-year-old virgin, working as a teacher in an all-girls' school. She lives in a dark and depressing boarding house. Nothing much happens in her life, she's only got one friend. At a party, she meets an older man, Alfredo, who takes an interest in her. They start going out, he shows an interest in everything she has to say, she loves being seen, who doesn't. Is this love, she asks herself?

And then, she falls pregnant and has a baby - will that revitalise their marriage?Ginzburg's writing is as simple and unadorned as it comes, but that makes it even more potent.

There's chemistry between the two, but misunderstandings and insecurities stand in the way. Two years later, during the pandemic, Noah messages Sally and the two of them become pen pals of sorts. Will they finally get together and if they do, will it work out? Read and find out.Everything about this romance novel was hyper-realistic, and it didn't shy away from mentioning aspects relating to bodily functions and other unmentionables. This novel also shows how ridiculous we become when we fall in love and start a new relationship. Or at least this was one of the takeaways.I appreciated the behind-the-scenes info, as I'm curious about the logistics of shows. I also enjoyed hearing about the protagonist's pet peeves when it came to romance novels: e.g. the ingenue, who's extremely cute but she doesn't know it etc. - all valid points. My least favourite parts, crazily enough, were when the two actually got together, too much hand-wringing and insecurities, all realistic and believable, but all the talk and stuff bored me. I preferred it when they weren't so earnest, it was more fun when there was banter. Anyway, here's to more realistic romances....more",Notes are private!,8,20,1,"Oct 20, 2023","Oct 21, 2023","Oct 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62628727-romantic-comedy

The truth is I finished this very short novel and I was left scratching my head wondering what was the point, what did the author want to convey?I somehow was under the misapprehension that this was a difficult book, it wasn't as such, the writing was straightforward and accessible. What was not so easy to grasp were the author's intentions. Sure, I could sniff some of the themes: family issues, gender roles, the roles determined by one's birth order; some xenophobia, something relating to the past when it came to one's background, which based on the author's Jewish sounding name I'm presuming/assuming it was about Jewish people ostracisation in the past? The novel is somewhat unsettling, with some weird things happening in the village somewhere in a Northern country. The relationship between the narrator and her eldest brother was kind of strange.

Until reading this, I never fully realised how important Mikhail Gorbachev was to the fall of communism.  Willner tells the story of her mother's family after WWII, when Germany was divided in two by the big powers, here's half to you, US, and here's half to you, Russia. Those Russians really had a bad reputation due to their behaviour mind you as crude, alcoholic, rapists. (I remember my grandmother telling us that when part of her family house was requisitioned during the War, she preferred when the Germans stayed as they were clean, and didn't impose themselves too much, whereas the Russians were pissing everywhere and had no manners - it's interesting how certain things stay with people). #notallRussiansWillner's mother, Hanna, had escaped to the West and eventually ended up in the US. The rest of the family, consisting of her father, mother, and many siblings (eight or nine) stayed behind and suffered through forty years of communism.

The cherry on this exquisite cake was the many uncanny similarities in our experiences, although we grew up in different countries, albeit with similar regimes, Ypi is Albanian, I'm Romanian, and she's a few years younger than me.Growing up, Albania was never much on my radar - I knew they were a communist country (NB: Ypi refers to all as socialism, I always think of it as communism, regardless, it was pretty much the same - obviously, they played by the same book). Growing up in a closed border country very few goods were making their way in, most of them were from other communist countries. Some of my favourite treats to eat when growing up were a whole date jam and some sesame bars both imported from Albania. Even for those you had to have contacts to purchase them. I was privileged in that way.:-) Like in Albania, we had to queue up for basic necessities, there were rations etc. This might explain my absolute phobia when it comes to queuing. This memoir is mostly told from the perspective of a child, who absorbs the school's propaganda and her parents' and grandmother's views and opinions - which I thought was a clever way to go about telling a story that is complex and layered. Given her family's diverse biography, this provides the readers with a full-bodied, personal history that overlaps with a revolution, and a civil war, after all, when big historical events take place, people still live their small lives, sometimes, without realising they're living through important historical moments.Ypi is a professor of political theory. The author's afterword is a must-read/listen as well.I'm so glad I took the time to listen to this and I'm grateful to the public library system for making this audiobook available for free.

Its social movement roots excited me, learning that they wanted to live closer to land, and eat a vegetarian diet made me think good on them.Spoiler: it turns out that, like all religions, it's just another patriarchal incarnation, with old fashioned rules where the men rule authoritatively and the women do everything in and around the home and have no say - at least that was the case in the Sinclair's family. The women are expected to be monogamous, but the men have no such qualms, spreading their seed  easily, in many cases, without bothering to look after the resulting crops.My heart broke for Safiya's mum, such a caring, resourceful woman, who had had her fair share of childhood trauma but she managed to rise above it.While the father had his own childhood trauma, had he not taken out his frustrations on his family members, I would have felt more benevolent towards him.

So when she asks someone else to clean up after a meeting, the men are puzzled, so she tells them she's pregnant and that the coffee smell makes her nauseous. And so it begins.

Who knows when and if they'll ever wake up to the fact that all work and no play makes people unhappy - for all the modernity and conveniences of modern life, the Japanese are conservative and deeply rooted in tradition.

This 4.5I couldn't remember placing a reservation for this, so I was surprised when the library notification let me know it was available to pick up. This was a fortuitous discovery, as I have been struggling to find something to keep me engaged in the past month or so. Small Mercies is set in Boston, 1974. There was a lot of racial animosity between the poorer white communities in the Southies, made up mostly of Irish Americans and the black communities, as those in power decided to eliminate the segregation in public schools. Their unwelcome idea involved busing white kids into black neighbourhood high schools and some of the African American kids to some of the high schools in the white neighbourhoods. Mary Pat Fennessey is the main character in this novel. She's forty-two, a single mother, who barely scrapes by working as a carer in a nursing home. She's lived all her life in the same neighbourhood. She's a tough woman, who's suffered many losses and disappointments. The light of her life is her seventeen-year-old daughter, Jules, who's set to be one of those being bused to a black neighbourhood for schooling. Jules doesn't return home one night. Mary Pat starts looking for her. She knows something is not right. Her frantic search introduces us to different characters, to the local gang bosses who control everything, to the drug peddlers, policemen and other side characters. Among the school busing protests, there's another issue - a black young man was found dead in the metro station in a white neighbourhood. Mary Pat is astonished to discover it is the son of the only black work colleague she deals with. This fast read manages to pack a lot in its 320 pages. At times, I cringed when reading the derogatory terms used by the Irish when talking about non-white people, even though I know it was a realistic depiction of the times and many people's views. It's a story about family, tribalism, and racism, among other things. I'm glad I went into this without knowing much about it.

He's a placid, forgettable man, a loner, who supposedly prefers living life via novelsIf you expect to encounter a lot of library and book talk given the title and the main character's job and reading habits, you'll be disappointed. I certainly was.We are told many a time that Bob loves books, that he's always preferred books rather than interacting with people. I never felt the passion unless it wasn't a true passion just a way of hiding from society? The novel is divided into several sections: first, we meet Bob at seventy. That part I enjoyed, it gave vibes of a Anne Tyler novel. Then the flashbacks come in, first it was Bob's only relationship that resulted in a short-lived marriage. Strangely, we then move further back to 1945 when Bob, an eleven-year-old boy is unhappy with his mum and runs away. Those flashbacks are written in the present tense, and are rich in dialogue and minutia, I thought it was unusual. The childhood segment didn't add anything to the story, it felt like a filler, replete with cartoonish, bigger-than-life characters. Occasionally, there are cute observations, also clever and funny turns of phrase, but overall, this wasn't worth my time....more",Notes are private!,10,16,1,"Sep 25, 2023","Sep 27, 2023","Aug 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62645180-the-librarianist

I love learning new things, and I sure learned so much from this novel. The narrator is Mia, a twenty-year-old student. Her mum is Korean and her father is American. She's got a twin brother and a younger brother who's got Autism and Angelman Syndrome (AS), he's also non-verbal. Mia is hyper-intelligent, confident, analytical, an over-thinker with a penchant for criticising and speaking her mind. Some may find her insufferable, but I loved her! Through her, I learned about music, philosophy, happiness theories, Autism and AS (I know plenty about autism I had no knowledge of AS). The novel also deals with racism, inter-racial marriages, marriage and the prescribed roles, disability, therapies, prejudice, assumptions and so much more.Happiness Falls is a mystery on another level. I confess, I don't care as much about plot, as I'm not a huge fan of the genre, for me, the best parts were the characters, race, disability, and perceptions and I also loved the sciencey bits, thanks Ms Kim for aiming high and not dumbing things down.

It's another novel set in Tasmania in the fictional rural town of Nowhere River.It's your typical small town, with a variety of characters, where everyone knows everyone business, but nobody truly knows anyone.We get to meet several characters: Carra is a young mum with twin babies, married to the handsomest doctor in town. Everyone envies her, but she feels like she's losing herself in the drudgery of bringing up kids and keeping house, while her husband is always busy helping everyone but her.The town and its inhabitants are stressed due to the long-term drought. Carra's in-laws had suffered the loss of a daughter thirty years prior. Their pain still affects them to the day.There are other characters that pop up here and there, some with more airtime than others.Without spoiling it, this is the type of story where the town's people come together to help each other in hard times, which allows them to have realisations about what's important in life etc. This was an easy to listen to audiobook, well narrated by Marta Dusseldorp.

I found this audiobook, so I jumped right in.Told via journal entries, this is the story of Susannah, a Tasmanian housewife, mother of four, and a former viola player, who tries to reignite passion in her marriage, as the domesticity and the busyness of raising children and keeping a home has diminished the sparkle of her relationship with her husband - a typical scenario, part of the course. So the neurotic and insecure Susannah adds something else to her chore list - reigniting the passion in her marriage.There were some funny moments, relationship truths and also some sad moments, emphasising the highs and lows of relationships, motherhood, and life.

He endows her with survival skills, applied science and develops her sense of smell. He's a scientist obsessed with preserving scent, which he captures with a special machine and stores in bottles sealed with wax. Emmeline grows up hearing his stories, many of them as fairytales.

The seclusion of the island kept Emmeline in the dark, now she's looking for answers about her parents and herself.There are many secrets she needs to uncover.

Its residents are from varied backgrounds, many of them coming from Sri Lanka and India. This novel has a large cast of characters. Behind the charming, cosy-looking title and cover, there are stories of past trauma related to the civil war in Sri Lanka. Some traumas are more recent.Yet again, I was struck by how little I know about the Sri Lankan civil war, which only ended in 2009. The atrocities that were committed are beyond belief. Speaking of which, reluctantly, I should warn you that there are several descriptions of torture. It was hard to hear about them, I can't even comprehend how one would survive such treatments, many didn't. The owners and residents of the peaceful home find themselves in the middle of a culture war, started by self-interested, frustrated white men, who forget that real people are affected. Some say that Australia is not a racist country, arguably, the laws try to be fair. But Australia has its racists, who seem to gather more strength in recent years.I appreciated the points the author was making via some of the novel's characters that as non-caucasian immigrants, regardless of the many years you lived in the country or if you were born here, you always have to prove yourself, show your worth and be grateful, and don't you dare complain and object to anything, as if being grateful and objecting to certain things are mutually exclusive. I personally don't do blind love, not for people, let alone for systems, nations, entities etc. Anyway, I recommend reading this book.

On the oI enjoyed this novel much more than Beach Read.The main character, Nora Stephens, is thirty-two and a determined, high-strung literary agent. On the outside, she's uptight and focused. Her love life suffers as men find her too unfeeling, and too tall, as she's 5'11"". She doesn't sweat it too much. Her main focus is her younger sister, who's married, with two kids and another one on the way. Nora became her sister's guardian when their mother died ten years prior. It's just the two of them in the world.Charlie is a book editor. Nora founds him cold and arrogant, based on a few work related interactions. When Nora's sister takes her on a trip to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina, who does Nora run into? Charlie of all people. It turns out he was born and raised there. The small town and a few not-too-crazy coincidences allow them to get to know each other better. I'll leave it a that.This romance novel appealed to me for different reasons: the main characters were different and it was nice to have a female protagonist who doesn't give it all up for the possibility of love. It goes without saying, the fact that both of them are book lovers was appealing to this bookworm. There were none of the somewhat caricature characters one usually comes across in this kind of novel, such as the gregarious assistant/friend or the flamboyant gay best friend. The dramatic moments were realistic and not melodramatic - always a plus as far as I'm concerned.I'm glad I gave Henry another chance. I'll look forward to reading more from her.

Anna Funder turned to Orwell's writing as she was feeling overwhelmed with life, motherhood, the domestic and professional workload. Funder has always admired Orwell's writing and his opposition to totalitarianism and oppression. She took on reading multiple Orwell biographies. Eileen was barely mentioned in most of them, only as an afterthought. When Funder came across several letters Eileen wrote to her best friend, she was struck by her writing and humour, she couldn't help but wonder who was this creature.Eileen was intelligent and well-educated at St Hugh's, Oxford. She also had a two-year post-graduate degree in psychology and received a Master of Arts. Then she married Orwell (real name Eric Blair). So she took on all the domestic responsibilities, living in a cottage with no heating, one cold tap and doing everything to support Orwell's writing, which included typing and editing his scribblings. She also ran a small shop at the front of the house, growing a garden and raising animals. So the educated, entrepreneurial, creative Eileen disappears under the wifedom burden. Did her efforts and sacrifice get noticed better said appreciated? Spoiler, NOPE.Orwell was an unattractive, tuberculose-ridden, womaniser, brothel frequenter, sterile, homophobic, and relatively poor. He was also rapey.It is ironic but not that surprising that the man who invented the expression ""doublethink - the act of simultaneously accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct"", who was against tyranny and other social injustices was an entitled, condescending, uncaring a-hole in his marriage.At times, I was furious with Eileen herself for staying, even when knowing those were different times, but reminded myself to direct that frustration towards Orwell.I was so taken with the way Funder went about this. The mix of biography, memoir, letter extracts, fiction and essays worked really well for this reader.There are some excellent s around, including in the Guardian. For interviews, search Funder's name on the ABC webpage (www.abc.net.au).NB: I've just realised something: My first sentence mentions Elaine as the wife of someone ... grrr I should have written - George Orwell was lucky enough to have had Eileen O’Shaughnessy as his first wife....more",Notes are private!,32,68,1,"Aug 15, 2023","Aug 26, 2023","Jul 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62802741-wifedom

On top of that, post-natal depression, an unsettled baby, a missing in action father who works late (a more common scenario than you'd think where new fathers have no choice ;-) but work longer hours), and no other friends or support network, are a recipe for a mental breakdown. We're constantly in the mother's head, her anxieties, tiredness, confusion, self-loathing and resentment in the open for us to judge, gawk, compare and contrast. In my case, I empathise and sympathise. It was all quite visceral and intense. I felt intense anger towards the husband, who worked long hours, even dared enjoy golf sessions for ""networking"", and told the wife to keep the screaming baby quiet as he had an ""early start"" - oh, the many small but oh so significant everyday cuts that in which the male selfishness rules supreme.

Like it or not, there’s no escaping AI. It’s already being used extensively, it’s going to take over almost every aspect of our lives.Spicer did a great job not going all alarmist (others may disagree) but also pointing out the many benefits. For instance, it’s said that AI can mitigate about 5-10% of adverse effects of climate change. But, (there’s always a but), AI has a huge footprint itself. AI is bringing the 5th Industrial Revolution upon us. As with every revolution, there are winners and losers. If we are not being careful – and based on what I’ve been reading and the podcasts I’ve been listening to, we are not careful at all – we are going to be in trouble. And guess the people most affected in a negative way? Ding, ding, you’ve guessed it, it’s women. If you are a woman and a person of colour, then you’re doubly impacted. If you’re a woman, a person of colour and forty-plus – congratulations, you “win” the best loser. Infuriating. In case you don’t know, artificial intelligence learns from and is based on existing patterns and big data. And when the data is incomplete or biased you’ve got “trash in, trash out” and the exponential amplification of the wrong. Given the pre-existing and ongoing bias and prejudice – thanks, Patriarchy! – it doesn’t take a genius to see how the bias in science and AI is a big problem, well, for those negatively affected, which are “only” 50+% of the population. When you take into account that the majority of Tech people are white men - you get the idea. Spicer gives plenty of examples in many fields, from medicine to human resources and hiring, to facial recognition and the many issues associated with it besides the privacy aspect, and even sex robots. The conundrum – how to change the machines when they become our carers, feeders and shoppers and even company.Tech dudes tend to create stuff to get ahead of others because it’s all about profits they don't care about consequences. Unfortunately, governments are slow to act and even slower to legislate, and when they’re in the pockets of big business … We have to ensure the AI future is humanistic, collaborative and intersectional. We need to train people in AI. We need a Human-Made AI. I could write so much, about this book, but I’m short on time, so I’ll encourage you to read it.

I was grabbed and spun into its web from the first page. This is a novelI don't have the words to express how much I loved In Memoriam by Alice Winn. I was grabbed and spun into its web from the first page. This is a novel about the incipient love and infatuation between two best friends, Gaunt, a half-German, and Ellwood, a beautiful, charming, poetry-obsessed young man, (they're really just boys). The two have been friends for years, boarding at a prestigious all-boys school. There's miscommunication or better said lack of direct communication, side-steps, glances, experimenting and a whole lot of ""boys will be boys."" It's a feat in itself that Winn made me care for privileged boys at a posh school. I detest them in the twenty-first century, even Australia has those kinds of schools. But I digress ...And then Austria declared war. The naive, underage boys, enrol to fight in the war. Gaunt goes first. He's ambivalent, will he have to fight against his German cousin? He's only eighteen. He's got no life experience, but given his privileged position in society he automatically becomes an officer, which comes with perks, and better pay, but he still has to fight, there's no hiding from the horrors of brutal fighting. Elwood and others will join soon.Many letters are exchanged in this novel, between former schoolmates, between soldiers and their family members. Most are blase and don't really show the horrors of the war. The list of casualties grows, and an entire generation of young men is wiped out. There is a large cast of characters peppering the pages of this novel. There's humour and banter, there are also vivid descriptions of the horrors of war. This novel fits a lot in its four hundred pages. I am far from a WWI connoisseur, but I appreciated Winn bringing to my attention the fact that even when it came to fighting against a common enemy, one's station in society still played a big role. What was outstanding about this historical novel, from my perspective anyway, was that Winn didn't hit us over the head with the ""big issues"", it's all there for us to grasp, without leaning the balance one way or another. Ultimately, this is a story about love. It's a formidable novel, an incredible debut. To say that I'm perplexed this didn't even make the Booker longlist - would be an understatement.

It's been a while since I last read a book so male-centric. I've been intending to read more by Serong but never got around to it. I've noticed this title many times but the cricket bit was a deterrent. Anyway, some readers on a Facebook group assured me this wasn't about cricket as much etc. They lied to me. While this novel is mainly about two brothers, they're professional cricketers, so there's cricket talk, a lot of cricket talk. Now, for the North American readers of my ramblings, cricket is similar to baseball but it last much longer, some games can last up to five days. Yep, you've read that right. Cricket becomes the centre of everything for the two brothers who played obsessively in their backyard. Their progression to local teams, state teams and then the national one is seamless, at least it is for the older brother, Wally, who reaches the top of the game by becoming the national team's captain. His younger brother, and the narrator of this novel, Darren, is given to mishaps and misadventures - he lives hard, including partaking in drugs and gambling. There are several bad things that happen to the family. Darren is the bad boy of cricket, the larikin, the oops, I did it again player. It was somewhat cute in his twenties and maybe thirties, it's pathetic when in his forties. While this is about cricket, the upsides and downsides of professional sports apply to most popular sports. It's the travelling, the adulation, the money and other perks, but also many stressors and pressures. Listening to this novel hasn't changed my somewhat unfavourable opinion of elite sportsmen, professional sports and the business behind them.

I tried hard to go with the flow, but I also tried to make sense of it all.When I finished the audiobook - brownie points to me for actually finishing the audiobook, as I've been an awfully prolific DNF-er - I was left feeling annoyed with myself, because there wasn't much of a payoff for my ""staying power"". I probably would have been more enchanted with this, had the characters been more complex, had flaws etc.For instance, all I can remember about Tommy's love interest, Carey, is that she was damaged, a lawyer and very pretty. That's about it. This had a YA feel about it, with simple scenarios, and underdeveloped characters. There was one character in particular who was made to sound ominous or strange but he didn't add anything to the story.This was promoted heavily, obviously, the publishers were very excited about it. If you like time travel novels, have no problem suspending disbelief and don't mind under-developed characters - this novel will appeal.So I'll put this down to ""it's not you, it's me"", although it's a bit you as well ... :-)...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,"Jun 08, 2023","Jun 07, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60731187-how-to-be-remembered

Thirty-something-year-old Cleo is a single mother of two under five-year-olds. She's a florist, owns her own business but she's struggling. Her ex is an alcoholic with many issues. As it seems to be a genetic component of all women, Cleo feels guilt about everything, about divorcing, about not having seen the red flags regarding her relationship with her ex, for giving in too often etc. Many of the single motherhood aspects and the character's qualms and struggles felt very realistic.Pushed by her best friend and housemate and her employee, Cleo decides to go on Tinder. She's planned to have 20 dates.There are a few bad dates, but also a couple of promising ones. Cleo is determined to take it easy and just have fun. Lots of sexual encounters occur, some of them, multi-orgasmic. I was, you go, girl, good for you, but also, I didn't want all the sex details - that's on me, I'll admit it.Lo and behold, Cleo doesn't just find one decent man, there are two in the fold. And they say there are slim pickings out there... ;-) Gabe, a British expat, is a librarian, but not into monogamous relationships. I rolled my eyes. Archer is a tradie (what we call tradesmen in Australia), he fixed her shop's window and did other repairs. He's hot, kind and quite in touch with his feelings and knows what he wants - incredibly enough, he says he wants a woman who's honest and knows what she wants. Ha! I laughed at that. I also told myself off for take it so seriously, after all, it's a romance, it's not supposed to be realistic, it's aspirational etc. Both Gabe and Archer are pretty decent men, not to mention so in touch with their feelings and respectful and also very good at sex. Lucky Cleo. It's truth universally known that men are keen on single mothers who aren't in their twenties anymore :-). Sorry, I can't help myself. I may have been dubious/jealous of Cleo's energy, as a full-time, business owner, and mother of two who's also able to have all-night sex with different men, on different nights. Anyway, those were some of my grumbles as a curmudgeonly, middle-aged, sceptic woman.If you're willing to go with the flow, you'll enjoy this as it's a competently written novel, about a woman's empowerment and self-discovery, a novel that tried to break the mould by turning some common scenarios on their head - which I'll have to commend the author for doing so....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Jun 07, 2023","Jun 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/76229928-west-side-honey

She's small for her age and a bit of a loner. Her passion is fixing things. Or people.A fortuitous meeting brings her and a stray dog, Runt, together. The two become inseparable. It turns out, Runt is great at obeying Annie's directions and commands. His biggest flaw is his inability to perform if other people are watching. Annie lives on a sheep farm with her kind parents, Brian and Sussie, grandma, Dolly, and her adventurous, daredevil brother, Max. As it's the case for most farmers in the area, the ongoing drought has greatly affected their livelihoods in a negative way. Many people are selling their farms, and many facilities and shops are being closed down.The Shearers have big debts themselves and struggle to get on top of them. The big annual local markets have a dog competition and the prize is quite enticing. Annie thinks Runt and her could win. Will she? And will she be able to help save the farm?This is a classic story, an underdog vs the world kind of story.

The number one reason for homelessness is escaping domestic violence, unexpected, major life circumstances and lack of affordable and social housing. This book was published in 2019, and since then, the issues have grown exponentially, the increased cost of living affecting an increasing number of people.Jane Caro looks back at her time growing up, and at the achievements of feminism, including the #meetoo movement. She's concerned about the plight of women of a certain age, who after years of caring for their families and putting everyone's needs ahead of theirs, find themselves in their fifties and sixties with no superannuation or very little, single, no housing and no possibility to get decent employment due to lack of skills and/or ageism and sexism. Society, patriarchal beliefs, the tax system, the lack of adequate and affordable childcare, and especially the fact that women do the majority of caring are some of the many barriers that see women 's financial disadvantage compounding. Of course, there had never been more women with power and financial affluence, which allows women over a certain age to finally have the time to do volunteer work and enjoy hobbies and take up new interests that they could never find the time to do while caring for kids and/or working. We need more women in power, in all fields. The saying/stats show that if you lift a woman out of poverty, she'll bring up four other people with her. We need more women to be in power, not only because women represent over 50% of the population. And most importantly, we should demand and expect that women's contributions as carers are recognised in a tangible way, and by tangible I don't mean the crappy Mother's Day gifts - as in financial recompense so that their later years are comfortable. Like it or not, if women stopped providing care services, nobody would achieve anything. Just think about it, everything women do is devalued. Women do most of the cooking, who are the most celebrated chefs - men! Women did most of the sewing and mending, yet men are the ""great designers"" - yes, I'm rolling my eyes big time and may have said very ""unlady"" like words (speaking of which, using lady to describe certain attributes is another way of keeping women in their place - be pretty, demure and most importantly, quiet, but I digress).

Baurmeister's writing was perfect, nuanced, elegant in a restrained but also expansive way, with no superfluous words and no extraneous commas, managing to convey so much without blasting the reader with big words or shocking revelations.No Two Persons is made up of loosely interconnected short stories, the link being Theo - the debut novel of a young, recluse writer named Alice Wein. After years of writing and editing, Theo gets published. In each subsequent chapter, we meet different characters at different stages of their life when they come into contact with this book.

I bought the audiobook as I knew I wouldn't read it in print due to its size, but I was curious.The novel begins by introducing Ajay, a boy sold by his very poor mum to pay the family's debts. Oh, the poor boy. Unlike other boys in a similar situation, Ajay ends up with a family who treats him nicely, although he repays them by being a servant, farmer, and cook, and doing everything. He thinks his mum is being sent his wages. Oh, the poor, naive soul. Eventually, he ends up working for Sunny Wadia, the son of a businessman/mobster. Ajay is so dedicated, sacrificial, and the perfect servant, guard, and driver. He's got no life of his own, no personal aspirations.Sunny is a self-destroying individual with daddy issues. When he falls in love with Neda, a journalist, things become tricky. The POV switches to Neda, a twenty-something young woman, from a middle-class background, who somehow enters Sunny's Wadia universe. I get being blinded by a powerful man, but once you know the person, there wasn't much there left, he seemed to always be drunk and/or under the influence of drugs. My goodness, the amount of alcohol, drugs and smoking taking place - talk about extremes.The last quarter of the book confused the hell out of me. I may have missed an important element while listening to the audiobook (I usually do other things, like potter around the kitchen), when a new character was introduced. That was so confusing. Also, I didn't care at that point. The ending was unsatisfactory, I felt like I wasted my time. I don't know what the author was trying to do/say. This novel needs a good edit. If you take out some of the drinking, smoking, drug taking and a few crimes du jour, you get rid of at least fifty pages. I'm yet to read a book over 500 pages long that would not benefit from a good trim. This was too much thriller/soap opera for my liking. While I rooted for Ajay, in the end, I got irritated by his passivity - nobody can take that much crap and not explode. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Apr 10, 2023","Apr 18, 2023","Apr 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60177466-age-of-vice

There are trips back in time, which allow us to know more about the narrator. There's an elderly cat and a few secondary characters who are introduced but who didn't add that much to the story.I don't know if it was the narrator's delivery, the writing, or a mix of the two, at times, the writing was too choppy for my liking.

Geeta is a thirty-something-year-old, her rubbish husband had left her without saying anything, everyone assumes she had something to do with his disappearance. She doesn't correct the record, there are advantages to others thinking of you as a badass. Geeta makes wedding jewellery and is part of a group that receives micro-loans. The group members are diverse, Geeta is not well regarded, her former best friend and the group leader hates her guts and makes sure Geeta knows it. But then, one of the group members needs Geeta's ""husband disappearing expertise"".Rural India seems to be replete with poverty, hunger, alcoholism, domestic violence, sexual assault, tradition, religion and superstitions, and a caste system - patriarchy at its worst! Most of the men in this novel are horrendous, despicable creatures. I rejoiced when bad things happen to them. The themes in this novel usually make my blood boil. Shroff's writing kept things sort of light - not the right word - with its natural, conversational writing, which changed direction often, so I was never bored.I appreciated that the women were flawed, different but also ordinary.Occasionally, there's humour sprinkled throughout. It cracked me up that whenever the women in the group would have small or bigger complaints about their respective kids, they would immediately follow it with (paraphrasing) ""joys of motherhood, so rewarding"", with the other women echoing the same phrase. This novel pays tribute to and was inspired by Phoolan Devi - nicknamed the Bandit Queen - a woman born in poverty, in a lower caste, who was married off at age 11, to a much older man and who suffered horrendous sexual and domestic abuse throughout her life. She joined a gang and took revenge on some men. Her legend was born. She also spent a long time in prison, was released and become a politician, before she was assassinated, you guessed it, by a man, when she was only 37 years old. To conclude my ramblings, The Bandit Queens is a fun feminist/revenge novel, in which women take control of their lives. It's dark, humourous and fast-paced, which made it for a satisfactory reading journey. Oh, I forgot to mention, there's also a cute dog called Bandit, just in case I needed to add another enticement for you to read this. :-) Don't worry, it's not a talking, philosophying dog. :-) Recommended...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"May 23, 2023","May 31, 2023","Apr 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61065982-the-bandit-queens

The good bits: very short, easy to read and digest.The rest was kind of meah, if I'm being honest. It wasn't because Leah, the protagonist and the narrator of this novel, wasn't particularly likeable. I like unlikeable female characters, if they stand out and are interesting in some ways, say, think, and do interesting things. Leah was just not that interesting. She's probably attractive because people seem to want to have sex with her, and she got married to an Australian wanna-be writer, whom she doesn't seem that into and whom she finds suffocating - with good reason. The novel begins when Leah is twenty-three, lives in San Fran and works as an admin assistant. She's forming a close bond with her twenty years her senior boss, Judy. The two are close buddies, have long lunches together, go for drives etc. It's an unusual relationship which seemed very one-sided.The title refers to Judy's red car, which was, from the description, a sports type of car, l0w to the ground and fast. Leah disliked the car and felt unsafe when she was the passenger.Ten years later, Leah inherits the car, after Judy's passing. Within a couple of days, all sorts of unusual things happen. I raised my eyebrow, metaphorically speaking, finding certain events and behaviours unbelievable.All these things and the detached writing style, plus an out-of-nowhere hearing the dead talk to you made this novel have a dream-like quality, better said, sur-real.

Some not-so-nice policemen leaked the photos and the arrest charges to the media. That was kind of a blessing in disguise as Dan had to come out and disclose his gender dysphoria. That was only 3 years ago. It was a challenging time as Danielle was a father and husband, son and brother. When he was apprehended, he was addicted to ice. The drug rehabilitation gave him the opportunity to recognise among, other things, that his drug use was also due to trying to cover and disconnect from the fact that he felt, wanted to be a woman, something he's been struggling with since he was a little boy.It was good to learn about Danielle's life. As football was and still is an important part of her life, it's covered on many pages. Those parts were of little interest to me.While Danielle is continuing on her transition path, she's now an ambassador within the AFL (Australian Football League) for inclusivity and acceptance. It's lovely to see how much more accepting society is becoming, may it continue on this path....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Mar 26, 2023","Mar 29, 2023","Mar 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62221847-don-t-look-away

The farm is in Michigan.Lara, the mother and narrator of this novel, is absolutely delighted to have them all in the same place again.They're busy picking cherries, but all that time spent together gets them reminiscing.It took me a little while to get into this novel. Once certain aspects were established, including the fact that Tom Lake was a place in rural Michigan, it was smooth sailing. When Lara's husband lets out that Lara and Peter Duke knew each other, the young women who grew up watching many of his shows, want to know more. And so we hear about Lara's short-lived career as an actor. It is also an opportunity for the kids to discover that their parents are/were more than just their parents. One summer in 1988, Lara and other young actors came together to rehearse a play put on by the theatre company in Tom Lake. Lara only has eyes for the handsome Peter Duke, so they have an intense romance. Other characters come into the mix, including Duke's older brother, Sebastian, Pallace, Lara's understudy, who also was a singer and dancer. It's a magical time - the town and its lake are beautiful, and rehearsing for the play is satisfying. I enjoyed the descriptions of the place and the theatre work. Didn't quite feel the chemistry between Lara and Duke, but that could be because Lara seemed a rather passive participant/observer.There were many things I liked about Tom Lake, including its slow, non-flashy moments. Most people look back and wonder ""what if"". Many know they are where they should be and appreciate it, which is where Lara finds herself....more",Notes are private!,26,24,1,"Aug 30, 2023","Sep 03, 2023","Mar 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63241104-tom-lake

During the day, she finds shelter in the local public library. That's where she meets, Jane, a well-to-do middle-aged woman, who seems out of sorts and out of place. The two of them strike up a conversation, which later develops into a friendship.This novel has alternating timelines, we move back to Dolly's past and then to Dolly's present life. Dolly was born and raised in Geelong, Australia, and managed to get started in the theatre in Australia before moving to the UK. Her career trajectory and her life had some ups and downs. Everyone who's lived has regrets. Both Dolly and Jane have their fair share.This is a novel about family, both the one we're blood tied to and also the found families. This is also about second chances and finding a new purpose in life.The novel does touch on some important matters, such as older women and homelessness, social media, mothers' guilt and so on, all matters that I care about.Unfortunately, I never bought Dolly Jamieson as a real person. Her cheerfulness and optimism despite her precarious, demoralising situation, didn't ring true to me, in fact, those aspects irritated me, I would be bitter and pissed off and I would have every right, I was angry on her behalf. Also, there's naivety and then there is Dolly Jamieson's level of naivety, I may have dropped a few FFS here in there. Imagine being destitute, living in sheds in the cold in your seventies and just go along with it, not making any inquiries with the authorities, not investigating and talking to anyone about what you could do to change the situation - I didn't buy that for a second. What person who's lived for decades in the UK doesn't know they're entitled to social security such as a pension? Again, I didn't believe that.

I understand now why he's been lauded for so long, his writing is sublime. My list of Irish writers whose writing I love seems to be growing and growing. Old God's Time has at its centre the now retired policeman, Tom Kettle. Tom is a widower and a loner. He doesn't see or talk to anyone. His memory goes back to the happier times with his wife and children, and, occasionally, to his unhappy childhood, as an orphan. His beloved wife suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a priest and extreme cruelty from the nuns who were supposed to look after her and the other orphans. It was a difficult read in that respect. While it's no news to me and am lucky not to have such personal trauma to deal with, oh, it just made my blood boil at that loathsome corporation that destroyed so many lives for centuries now which is still allowed to exist.

If you take offence to what I'm saying, maybe you should direct that anger and rage towards the actual perpetrators.So, while the writing was beautifully crafted, given some of its themes, it was a difficult read even though there were a few moments of levity.

Cleopatra is a twenty-five-year-old British artist living in New York. She's stunning, her American visa is about to expire. Frank(enstein) is an early forties successful advertising executive, who lives the cliches - works hard and parties hard. The two strike an instant relationship and consequently marry six months later. Both of them have their own parents' issues, albeit they're different.This novel is not only about Cleo and Frank. It's about other people they know and who play an important role in their life. There's Zoe, Frank's much younger sister, Anders, a handsome Danish magazine executive, Santiago, a Peruvian restaurant owner and chef, Eleanor, a late thirties freelance writer, living with her mum. Some characters' stories were more gripping than others. I'll admit, somewhere around the mid-point I got annoyed and wondered what was the point of the novel and questioned if I should finish it.I'm glad I stuck it out, as the last twenty per cent or so was much more satisfying.

Our Wives Under the Sea was haunting and unsettling. The novel alternates between Miri's and Leah's points of view. The two women are married. Leah is a marine biologist who went on a submarine research trip, missing for some time. Upon returning, Leah is not herself, physically and mentally speaking. The two women give us enough background information on their upbringing, how they met and some current events. I liked that this was the story of two women. The writing was lyrical and polished, melancholic and introspective. I was somewhat confused by some speculative elements, as I was trying to diagnose what was wrong with Leah, which, I'll admit, wasn't important.While the novel didn't quite hit all my sweet spots, it definitely made my antennae stand to attention, so I'll be interested to read more by Armfield....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,"Feb 23, 2023","Feb 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58659343-our-wives-under-the-sea

But not to this extent! Talk about a character being one-dimensional!!! Maybe that's what it takes to reach the summit, obsession, sacrifice, a killer-instinct etc. Carrie Soto was all about tennis. She had no hobbies, friends or interests (oh, I think she liked reading thrashy magazines - I guess we can call that an interest... )I liked that Jenkins Reid made the main female character so unlikeable as it sort of highlighted how female and male athletes are talked about in different ways. While it wasn't necessarily mentioned in the book, since we're on the subject, am I the only one who's been annoyed for years by the fact that the female players have to wear those skimpy outfits that don't offer much sun protection, they have to put the damn balls in their underwear!!! because why have no pockets (I mean it follows in that great female garment tradition of making clothes for women with no pockets!). Surely not all female athletes are comfortable wearing them, even though they're young, fit and attractive.I'm impressed and feel bad for tennis players that have to sit through those infuriating interviews, being asked inane questions and the platitudes and cliches that go with sports talk. I'm aware that in the big scheme of things and given how much money is in play, there are worst things to deal with when it comes to a job.In closing, reading this novel felt like reading transcripts of a tennis match. Some of the conversations between Carrie and another worthy opponent who surpassed her previous record were cringe. I don't recall the last time I consumed a book so rich in dialogue, which made it for a quick, easy-to-digest offering, albeit common and forgettable.

It's set in Western Australia, so some of the places were familiar. The narrator, Rowan Brockman, is a young journalist, who moved to Perth (the capital of Western Australia) away from his wheat farming family in Septimus. When his mum decides to sell the farm, he has to go back to help with the last harvest.The patriarch's health is failing, as he's got dementia. His wife does the best she can to help, it's an arduous task.

Incredibly, it's still an integral part of my social media life, that's thanks to the many wonderful people I came across here.Without counting I know this year was the year of the audiobook for me, without them, I wouldn't have consumed so many books due to being busy.This year I started and abandoned lots of books (I haven't kept track). Having so many wonderful library resources at my disposal affords me the freedom to pick, read or DNF, without the financial investment. Despite the many abandoned reads and a few highly anticipated titles that ended up being disappointing, 2023 was another fantastic reading year.Without further ado, my favourite titles, for different reasons:Fiction- In Memoriam by Alice Winn - debut historical fiction, WWI, boys boarding school, LGBTQI (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- Everyone and Everything by Nadine J Cohen - debut Aussie contemporary, mental illness, grief, relationships (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- My Husband by Maud Ventura - translated from French, taut writing, read in two sittings (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- Big Swiss by Jean Beagin - OMG! Original, quirky, funny, sexy (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- No Two Persons by Erica Bauermeister - interconnected short stories, books and writing are at its centre, top-notch writing (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- Happiness Falls by Angie Kim - thriller, mixed raced couple and their kids, great narrator, smart (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- The Angry Women's Choir by Meg Bignell - Aussie novel, feminist, it made me want to join the choir (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- Queen Bee by Ciara Geraghty - I almost crashed my car as I was laughing so hard while listening to this in the car - peri-menopausal 50 yo writer with everything happening in her life. (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver - a classic I've been avoiding due to the bible thing. Kingsolver is becoming one of my favourite writers (my : https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- The Bandit Queens - delightful debut, feminist revenge, N of India - we need more books like these! (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- Runt by Craig Silvey - middle grade novel about a girl on a farm and her dog named Runt - utterly cute, can't wait to watch the adaptation (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- Wellness by Nathan Hill - immensely clever, informative, funny, real, it's long but worth it.Non-fiction- Free by Lea Yepi - Albanian memoir about Albania pre and after the change of communist regime, fantastic writing (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- Man-Made by Tracey Spicer - AI and its biases against women, POC and other minorities (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)- Wifedom - it's more of a fictionalised bio of Eileen O’Shaughnessy who was George Orwell's first wife. Spoiler: Orwell was not so great as a person. (https://www.goodreads.com//show...)That about wraps up my list of favourites. What else? I can't be bothered to count, but I figure about 70% of the books I read were written by female writers. I'm sure this will stay the same in 2024. I'm sure my audiobook consumption will outweigh the books I read in print next year as well. Other than that, I don't make plans about what I will read, I let titles come to me.Thank you for bearing with me.

That's one word that best summarises my feelings while listening to Grace Tame tell her story. Grace Tame was thrust into the public eye exactly two years ago when she was named Australian of the Year. (The Australian of the year is a ""celebration of the achievements of extraordinary Australians, nominated from eight states and territories in four categories.""). At 15, Grace Tame was groomed and raped by her 58-year-old teacher at a private girls' school in Hobart. Eventually the abuser was jailed, but Grace couldn't speak about her experience publicly under Tasmania's gag laws, even though the media and the perpetrator were free to do so. Hello, patriarchy! Grace was the catalyst for the #LetHerSpeak campaign. Spoiler, the laws were amended. Did I say that she was only 25 years old at the time? So that was a bit of background on Grace.I thought I already knew quite a bit about her, as I follow her on Twitter and follow politics closely. Grace is so much more than a victim of child sex abuse. She's so much more than a woman on the spectrum, who also has ADHD. She's fierce, outspoken, blunt, and passionate. She's a fitness freak and a yoga-certified instructor. In her 27 years of life, she's gone through so much. She's also a talented writer and artist. I'm trying hard not to put her on a pedestal (she dislikes that, and I agree with it on principle, but old habits die hard). She takes a good, well-deserved (in my view) swipe at the media machine and how they manipulate and exploit with no regard for people's wellbeing, especially when it comes to traumatised people.

One couple is made up of the estate lawyer, Pipa, her stay-at-home husband, Gabe and their two daughters, Asha and Freya. Most of the novel is narrated by Pipa.The other couple is made up of the childless partnership between Max and Amanda, a wealthy, successful couple. The other occasional narrator of this novel is Amanda.Pipa and Gabe have a house that is close to a popular suicide spot called the Drop. Gabe has managed to deter seven people from jumping. He's a local hero, known by the police. But he doesn't manage to save his eighth, Amanda. Her death brings up all sorts of secrets and entanglements.

Willa Knox's inherited house is falling apart. She and her underemployed and underpaid professor husband can't afford the repair cost. Worries and desperation ensue. They've worked all their lives and now have nothing to show for it. Willa has lost her job, and she takes care of her father in law whose health issues are multiple. There are other complications coming from their adult kids.Willa is investigating whether their old house has any heritage value, which would allow them to get a grant to fix it. She stumbles upon Mary Treat, a naturalist who was corresponding with Charles Darwin, and her friend and science teacher, Thatcher Greenwood. The novel has dual timelines, the 1880's, dealing with Thatcher's and Mary Treat's issues at the time when there was a lot of resistance to teaching the theory of evolution. (I don't know why I say there was, as in the past ... ) Via these characters, Kingsolver denounces religion, superstition and anti-science stances - preaching to the converted, in my case. There is a lot of debating and discussing capitalism, absurd consumerism and continuous growth, environmental destruction and climate change, inadequate health care, childcare and many other issues - things that very much preoccupy me.At times, I was a bit bored by the old-time stories, I would have liked them to be shorter, nevertheless, I appreciated learning about Mary Treat and a few other historical events.I see many didn't like this novel, as it was didactic, preachy, and political (isn't it interesting that we only throw that at progressive views?). I sympathised with the more contemporary characters and appreciated how Kingsolver weaved different themes and issues through the story.

The story is narrated by Agnes, who reminisces about their relationship and the past. Fabienne is the dominant, moody friend, Agnes is the follower and observer. One day, Fabienne decides to write a book about their lives. They make a game of it. She dictates her stories to Agnes, who's got better penmanship. They show their book to the local postmaster, who helps them get published, with only Agnes as the writer. Agnes becomes somewhat famous and ends up in a finishing boarding school in England.This is a story of friendship, destiny or chance.

The Troubles are picking up steam. Cushla and her family live in a mixed community, the sectarianism is getting more extreme. How does one navigate these tumultuous times?Cushla enters into a relationship with an older, married man.The usual complications arising from having to hide an illicit relationship are amplified by the fact that she's mixed up with a protestant.All around, people are being killed, and bombs are being detonated.

I consider myself a gold-card feminist, but my contrary personality makes me even more critical of books that appeal to my biases. My qualms were quickly put to rest, as I fell under its charm quite early.The novel is set in Tasmania, the smallest state in Australia, an island on the SE coast of Australia. The cast of characters is varied as far as age, origins, and life stories are concerned. I felt invested in everyone's stories. Unsurprisingly, they all have different viewpoints and grievances. The first character we meet, and probably the most developed, is Freycinet Barnes, a middle-aged mother of three, whose main job is looking after the family, chauffeuring the kids to their respective schools and after schools activities. She's a privileged middle-class woman. Then why is she feeling unsettled when on paper she's got a perfect life? One inauspicious day, she gets hit by a car and discovers something unexpected. Enter the West Moonah Women’s Choir, whose characters Freycinet finds fascinating. Their singing is out of this world. When they sing their troubles, Freycinet is hooked. She's accepted and embraced by the group. She gets to know Rossana, Bizzy, Kyrie, Avni, Irene, Dr Sally, Quin, Mary, and Eleanor.I cried, laughed and raged. Meg Bignell not only wrote this terrific novel, but she also did a great job narrating it.

Demon Copperhead is the narrator of this novel. He didn't win the birth lottery, he was born to a teenage single mother, who was addicted to alcohol and drugs. They lived in a small community in the Southern Appalachians. She does the best she can, but she's not terribly capable. And then, Demon becomes an orphan. Here come disappointments, including terrible foster homes. Some good things happen to Demon as well. His life is a rollercoaster, with many nauseating highs and lows. Speaking of highs and lows, he gets the physical kind as well when he joins the plethora of painkiller addicts. While I had seen the news reports and read articles about the opioid crisis that destroyed so many people and communities, reading about it in this novel was more potent as it was portrayed through characters that I came to care about.I read other novels about dispossessed communities, more often than not, they come very close to joining a category of novels which I call misery/trauma porn. This incredible novel never even comes close to going into that (made-up) category, quite the feat as far as I'm concerned. The voicing was outstanding, it felt so realistic, even more, impressive was the fact that Kingsolver chose to write this through the voice of a male character.Another thing that I noticed and was impressed by was the lack of preaching, even though the novel had plenty to convey.So don't let this novel's size put you off, it's an easy read/listen, it's got a fast pace, and there's no sagging, lagging or padding - it's remarkable.A special mention goes to Charlie Thurston, who was terrific, he should get an award for his splendid reading....more",Notes are private!,0,76,1,"Nov 03, 2022","Nov 08, 2022","Nov 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead

I like books with quirky female characters and, let's face it, lost people make for good subjects/stories. Unfortunately, I never believed Penny Rush - the thirty-something-year-old woman and the main character of this novel - was a real person.My suspicions were raised early on. What woman accepts an offer from her grandmother's accountant, whom she had never met, to take lodgings at his place, only to discover that he was sleeping in his office and she was fine with taking his sofa while he slept on the floor? She's a woman with a family, recently with a job.It was all farcical, unrealistic, unbelievable, and never funny.There's a paranoid eighty-something grandmother with literal skeletons in her backyard. A ninety-something grandfather with a beyond ridiculous wife. Besides one or two underdeveloped secondary characters, every other one is portrayed and behaves in ways that don't make sense.There's an ad-hoc visit to Australia to look for Penny's lost-without-a-trace parents. Drama ensues on the plane. There's one ridiculous situation after another. The cherry on this undercooked cake is that the ending is all over the place, it leaves so many threads untied, it's infuriating and I say that as someone who usually complains when things are wrapped up with a nice bow, but really, this type of novel requires closure and nice packaging. Honestly, I just can't believe this novel was written by the same author who wrote The Portable Veblen.I read this because of loving the author's previous novel, apparently, it's longlisted for the Women's Prize. WHY? Even the title is kind of random and Spoiler, the dog is mentioned a couple of times - that's it. So basically the blurb, the title and the covers are selling something that it's not there.

There was a lot of build-up and padding, as there were several PoVs, some unnecessary. The main character is forty-year-old, Mel, a recently divorced mother of two. She embodies the cliche (which is a cliche because it is true) of the stressed, busy, working mother. Things become ""interesting"" when a guy who looked very much like a man Mel loved and dated moved into the apartment upstairs. He's much younger, in his early twenties, full of confidence and swagger. He's taken over the lease of someone and keeps throwing parties and having all sort of people over. Mel is fascinated and repulsed at the same time. He's bringing back memories of times past. We occasionally hear Fin's thoughts, they're not particularly interesting, which I guess match his persona.Then an English young woman moves in with Flynn. Her name is Lori. She's pretty and not very self-assured. Mel is watching them and doesn't like what she's seeing. Lori occasionally babysits Mel's kids which allows them to become closer.Then, Lori disappears. Where is she, what's happened to her?While the novel was breezy, the ending and the epilogue greatly redeemed this novel, even though I generally don't care for epilogues. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Oct 10, 2022","Oct 10, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61199882-the-couple-upstairs

No biggie, aI had no idea this was a romance novel, the wonderful title, taken from Florece + The Machine's song Hunger, and the cover led me astray. No biggie, as I do read romance novels occasionally. I'm always keen to read books about characters with different backgrounds. The main character of this novel, Feyi Adekola, is a Nigerian living in Bronx, New York. She's an artist and shares an apartment with her best friend, Joyce.My reaction to this novel is best described as a bell curve. In the beginning, I was irritated by Feyi and Joyce calling each other bitch. Eventually it stopped bugging me as much. I know, it's a little thing, but there you have it. After a while, the writing style started to grow on me and I was eager to find out what happens next.I'm much more open-minded and indulgent when it comes to characters in novels. Also, nobody reads novels for their realistic characters and plot, right? Then why did I get irked by the fact that the men were all drop-dead gorgeous, well-built, well-hung and so in touch with their feelings and, incredibly enough they were able to discuss and articulate those feelings - I didn't know I was reading books about aliens ;-) Oh, and although they were super attracted to Feyi they were willing to wait around and just cuddle and spend time together. Yeah right, these people at their sexual peak, in their 20s, waiting around ""to feel right""... Impossible or nearly impossible relationships make for good tension in novels. That part hooked me in, although I had some moral qualms about it - I'm trying not to give away spoilers.Towards the end, there was way too much talking about feelings which I found over-the-top. I know, it's contrary, on one hand, I'm implying that men are not good at talking about feelings but then I say there was too much talking about feelings. But there was too much, unnecessary, very teenage in spirit talking about feelings, to the point that it was off-putting. Also, one of my pet peeves is when people make such a big deal out of getting married or not. This was imperfect but there was something different and captivating about the writing style, which kept me interested. It was the right length.

It's a hard job, both physically and emotionally.

She shares her room with her long-term partner, another woman.The narrator is unhappy with this arrangement, she doesn't get it, she doesn't see the point, how can they have kids, and how about what people say.

We get to travel through post-war Britain, the Thatcher years and pre and post-Brexit Britain. Roland also visited East Germany and later united Germany. Roland's boarding school life is intensified and at the same time thorn apart by his sexual relationship with the piano teacher, an event that affects his future relationships and life trajectory.Roland's life is dealt another blow when his German wife leaves him and their baby boy to follow her dream of becoming an important writer.Roland takes on with relative relish the sole parenting role. He does what needs doing, making sure his boy has well looked after and knows he's loved.McEwan deftly moves through time and to different characters' lives. Major historical events are referenced, some were more affecting than others. Regrets, lost opportunities, relationships, and ageing are some of the major themes of this sprawling novel. Chance, family secrets, memory and history feature greatly as well. The last part covering the later part of Roland's life was quite sad. As they say, getting old is not for the faint of heart.Lessons is a topical novel, with many references to authors and writing, that I couldn't help but feel were McEwan's own views on certain things. I think the novel could have been tighter, certain aspects and passages weren't that interesting and didn't add that much to Roland's story. As far as the audiobook production is concerned, I confess I wasn't very fond of the narrator's delivery.

When, where and how does one so young master the English language and the art of writing to such a high level? I'm glad I listened to the audiobook because it was superbly narrated by Tamsin Greig and Lydia Wilson who were phenomenal. Their reading emphasized the text's musicality and playfulness. Apparently, this is also one of those novels that play with typography, paragraphs and images. I'm a fan.For instance, one of the main characters of this novel is cancer who interjects now and then and whose voice is in a bold typeset. (I need to get me a copy, besides, it's got such a beautiful cover and the title is superb.)The cancer is taking over Lia's body. She's had it before, but now it's returned and it's terminal. Her beloved husband, Harry, is destroyed and so is their twelve-year-old daughter, Iris. They have their distinct ways of dealing with their pain. When one is dying, one looks back. We get to travel back in time to Lia's teen years and younger years. Painful memories, cold parents, bad relationships, sickness, loss, parenting, and a mother's love for her daughter - are themes that are familiar to all of us. Mortimer excels in the way she goes about telling those familiar stories, she uses incredibly lyrical, unrelentingly beautiful language (this is a novel to savour). The structure was brilliant, it never felt gimmicky.

The story is relatively simple - Maali Almeida is a thirty-something gay photographer who finds himself dead and in a Limbo-kind of after-life situation. He's got seven moons to try to find out who killed him and then move on.With each moon that passes by we find out a little bit about Maali. Maali was playing the field when it came to his sexual relationships and work assignments - he was photographing different camps of the civil war. He sees corruption, and gruesome, unfathomable crimes. I confess I didn't know much about Sri Lanka's history, it was good to learn a little, even know it didn't put Sri Lanka in a favourable light.The novel is peppered with a variety of characters, from ""garbage men"" who were disposing of bodies, to government officials, professionals, Maali's friends, lovers and family. They all contribute to the puzzle. This is a literary who-done-it, with a twist.

The fact th3.5As many others had stated before me, this is an impressive debut novel, written by a teenager no less, when she was seventeen-eighteen. The fact that it is based on a real life case makes this novel more powerful. Of course, it's horrific that the police, who are supposed to protect and respect the law, disregard it, not to mention the ick and moral considerations - using a seventeen-year-old for sex parties.The narrator of this novel is seventeen year old, Kiara Johnson, who had been dealt bad cards in life - her father passed away, her mother is in jail, and her guardian, her older brother is a lost, head-in-the-sky dreamer, who can't help to pay the rent. The rent is put up yet again, there are no jobs to come by, so what's one to do? Start night crawling.I appreciate Mottley's intentions and writing, to be honest, I wasn't quite as affected by the novel as I should have been. Something was missing. Grittiness (is that a word?)? Throughout the novel, I felt distanced from what was happening to the characters - I could always sense the author's hand and viewpoints when writing beautiful, impressive sentences, which I didn't quite believe as they were supposed to come from a teen who hadn't finished high school.While I'm not one to care about endings, I don't expect books to have nicely wrapped endings, in this case, the last part of the novel and the ending felt rushed, unbaked and left me unsatisfied.

Not important, but I was surprised to learn that those loans were such a burden, I was under the impression that Canada's education system wasn't as unaffordable as the US one. A somewhat naive young woman finds herself in one of the most toxic environments around - not only because of the oil extraction that causes irrevocable damage to the environment, but also because it's mainly inhabited by men, and we all know that men in groups act like ... (I don't want to insult the animals). #NotAllMenButMenI live in a State where mining is huge. While most places are a few hrs away by plane, I know many who work there. They're referred to as FIFO (Fly-in-Fly Out) workers, due to their work schedules, which require them to fly to those camps, for 1-2 weeks, and then fly back home for a few days or a week. I'm aware of the disruptions to family life. The money is good. In Australia, there have been inquiries into the working environment on the mine sites, sexual harassment is rampant. Reading about Beaton's experiences made me so angry on her behalf and every other woman. The structure and the story could have been a bit more cohesive - it's probably a limitation of the genre, and I don't have much to go by.The drawings were OK, I particularly loved the landscape ones. The strength of this book comes from bringing to light some unsavoury, unspoken truths. Here's hoping that since Beaton's time on mine camps, things improved greatly.

(NB: As of 2021, all Australian states have passed voluntary assisted dying legislation.) Delphi goes to visit her. She has to return back to London. She's drifting, with no place to live, she's crashing at some friends' place. She's got all sorts of experiences. She's trying to reconnect with her cold and shut-down father, who's remarried. There's a lot of bitterness and unexplained memories and emotions. Poor Delphi just can't get a break.Her life becomes even more complicated and complex.

Something tells me Everett is not going to do any book signings in bookshops in those states. :-)Given its language, I initially thought the novel was set sometime before the 70s, to realise that it was contemporary. I found myself cackling several times. Arguably, this punches down, I'll let it pass, given those states' racist history (and present), Everett and other people of colour should be forgiven for having revenge fantasies. There's plenty of sarcasm, observational, situational and language-based humour. And a lot of crimes, gruesome and weird; they also involved a lot of testicles being removed, which can be interpreted in many ways, not to mention it's an opportunity for some cheap jokes, which I found funny anyway. I am not too proud about it, but it is what it is, pardon the cliche. Speaking of cliches, this novel plays with cliches and stereotypes and takes them to another level.In case you've managed to keep up with my ramblings, would you believe me if I told you that this novel is basically about the lynching of people of colour in America? I probably wouldn't have been able to read this book had it been written in a classical, linear, strait forward way. The humour, the ridiculousness of situations, the absurd and the improbable kept me guessing, while it also amused and delighted me. What else? Oh, the novel is short and dialogue-rich. The Trees has some of the most well-written, natural-sounding dialogue I've come across. I would be remiss not to mention Bill Andrew Quinn, the narrator of this novel, who was outstanding.Yet again, if it hadn't been for the Booker and a few other awards, I wouldn't have come across this title, or the one I read before this, both of them, incredibly accomplished novels for different reasons.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Aug 26, 2022","Aug 29, 2022","Jul 13, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56269278-the-trees

I had no idea about it, although we've all seen the ubiquitous fake brown Louis Vuitton handbags. Not all fakes are the same. Some counterfeits might have been originals, they were so close to the genuine ones, that not even the people selling the genuine items could tell the difference. I confess, my moral compass needle barely moved, the ""crime"" was bloodless, and those cheated didn't know their luxury item wasn't genuine.

When I was young I used to dismiss comedy/comedians as not as ""important"" or worthy of my appreciation. These days, it's quite the opposite. For those unaware, Hannah Gadsby is an Australian comedian. She so happens to be on the autism spectrum, which she only got diagnosed with in her late thirties, after being diagnosed with ADHD. You can hear about her journey to getting those diagnoses in this book.The memoir is written in a relatively chronological way - with side steps and caveats - pointing to different historical aspects, in particular the gay rights, better said, lack of rights, in Tasmania (the smallest state in Australia - an island off the SE coast of Australia) and Australia in general. You see, Gadsby is queer herself.This memoir brings to the surface many of Gadsby's traumas. Even though this has trauma and difficulties throughout, Gadsby's writing is so direct and matter-of-fact, that I never felt it was a ""trauma memoir"", it was her way of taking control of the narrative of her life and making sense of it all, if that's possible.Gadsby has a passion for art history - her loathing of Picasso is quite something.

It's not a debating competition but a speech-making one. The novel is developed through the alternating perspectives of Frances - a lost twenty-year one old woman and her mentor's, a much older and experienced speech maker - Keith. Incredibly enough, they both qualified for the finals even though they both belong to the same club.Frances and Keith were not likeable characters - for completely different reasons. Frances was neurotic, obsessive, petty and not a nice person.Keith was boring and pedantic.As it's the case with this kind of novel, there is character growth.

Horrible things happen to her at the hands of men. After drifting a bit, Maggie finds a decent man and settles down young. They have a house and jobs and soon they become parents. Tragedy strikes. Again and again. Some people never get a break.I'm glad I went into this blindly. I've become quite iffy about books about trauma - I call them ""trauma/misery porn"". While this novel contains many traumatic moments, the delicate writing, its brutal realism and structure, manage to keep this novel out of the misery porn category. A special mention goes to Casey Whitoos - I loved her voice and narration....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,not set,"Jun 19, 2022","Jun 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58420822-bodies-of-light

Gil inherited so much money, he never had to work. He does his best to give back by volunteering for different charities. His latest endeavour is with a women's refuge in Phoenix, Arizona. When his long relationship fell apart, Gil decided to walk from New York to Arizona, where he bought a mansion, over the internet. In Phoenix, he lives across from a family of four whose house is made of mostly glass.They quickly become friends.Arguably, Gil was bland as sliced white bread, but he was also a kind person. The research shows that having money and being empathetic don't really go hand in hand. Talk about a fantasy man, as Gil was not an arsehole in the least. To conclude, this was an easy read that just grew on me as I listened along. It's about finding purpose, and community....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,not set,Dec 2022,"Jun 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60165418-dinosaurs

She creates interesting characters and situations, her female protagonists don't have your run-of-the-mill jobs, and the details and plot trajectories have something unique and not too exaggerated, even though, given the genre, there are plenty of predictable elements.In this case, Hannah Brooks, is a bodyguard. She generally guards super rich people, until she's assigned to protect one of the most famous Hollywood heartthrobs, Jack Stapleton (does anyone else feel like there are too many Jacks in books, or is it just me? I don't mind the name, still, it feels like every other male character has this name ...)As you'd expect, things get complicated.

The rivalry between Beartown and Hed is still going strong, this time, Beartown is on top, with Hed suffering all sorts of misfortunes.The omniscient narrator employed by Backman works splendidly, it allows us to get into the head of so many characters. We are back with Maya and her parents, Peter and Kira; her best friend, Ana. We’re back with some of the hockey guys, they’re all young adults now: Amat – the boy from the poor neighbourhood, is an NHL prospect, and Bobo is still playing. Benji is returning to Beartown for a funeral. He’d been travelling the world trying to forget the past. There are other peripheral characters making an appearance, arguably, a few too many. Some side characters and some other issues kind of bog down the novel in the middle, but with some digging (ie patience), I was back on steady ground.The Winners has funerals, a huge storm, hockey games, corruption and another tragic event. The full range of feelings is on display - loneliness, anger, disappointment, grief, denial, resentment, and hate, but also hope and love. Backman is a masterful storyteller who creates realistic, three-dimensional characters, whom you come to love.As always, I’m looking forward to reading whatever he writes next.

It's set at the end of the 70s when the Northern Ireland conflict, also known as the Troubles, was manifesting across Northern Ireland and England.Mr Lloyd, a landscape British painter, makes his way to the Island, hoping to capture it in his paintings and take his art in a new direction. Here he encounters a different world, unlike anything he was used to in London. Most people are simple and lead modest lives. Many are monolingual, they only speak Irish/Gaelic.Mr Lloyd takes on an apprentice of sorts who turns out to be quite talented. Young James, inspired by Mr Lloyd, dares to imagine himself as an artist in London, he's over the claustrophobic, boring life on the island.Through the French linguist, Jean Pierre, we get to ponder languages and colonialism. The narrative is broken by news reports about people who were killed in that period of the Troubles. By focusing on the age, marital and parental status of the individuals killed in the conflict, Magee magnifies the horrors of the conflict.This novel was filled with mundanities but also with philosophical and historical inquiries, with art playing an important role.

This is the fourth book featuring Lucy Barton, a writer, divorced and widowed, now in her sixties. When the Coronavirus makes its way to New York, William, Lucy's former husband and the father of her two daughters, convinces her to ""escape"" with him to Maine. They rent a house on the coast. It's a small community, it's quiet, and nothing much happens. Of course, the pandemic affects them mentally, things happen to friends and family members. Remember the ups and downs of that strange period? Lucy experiences worries, panic attacks, grief, and memory loss. Most of us will find those elements familiar, we've experienced them in different ways. Of course, while we were all in the same boat when it came to the pandemic, some were travelling in little boats, while others were facing the storm in luxury, well-built and equipped boats - but that's not the point - this is Lucy's story.I appreciated reacquainting myself with some ""old friends"" whom Strout brought back in more or less significant ways. Obviously, she knows that she's got her faithful readers. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels invested in Lucy's story. So, have you met Lucy yet?

When one turns 40 one looks back and wonders if they are where one should be, where one thought one would be and so on—nothing new there. Alice's life is not bad - she's got a job, working in her old high school as an admissions officer, good friends and an OK boyfriend. Her beloved father is dying though. Her father raised her alone since she was six years old. It was just the two of them for a long time, so they had a special bond.Alice turns forty, gets drunk and finds herself in her old bedroom, as a sixteen-year-old, her father well and young, only forty-nine years old. She goes back a few times, different ages and scenarios.This was an easy novel to read without anything new or that original to add, except for the father-daughter relationship. Honestly, the time travel, time-hopping, or whatever they're called don't do much for me. The time-jumping episodes were repetitive and the general message of the novel was predictable and obvious.

It also reminds us about women being erased from history, how men impose themselves and get all the glory even when it comes to things that women had been doing for millennia: women cooking family meals in perpetuity being mere cooks, while men became chefs; women making clothes and mending them for millennia being just mere seamstresses, while men became designers - you get the gist.

I was considering whether I should read this, thinking I'm a feminist, I read a lot of stuff on the subject, I kind of know it all. WRONG! It turns out things are much worse than I/we ever imagined.This book covers so many fields:- history - how women have been completely erased from history;- education, work, occupational health and safety;- architecture- car safety- medicine - OMG! Did you know that over 90% of studies and medications are done mostly on male animal/human subjects and don't account for biological differences in women, which result in increased female mortality? Everything from heart attacks diagnosis which is based on male symptoms, which is not how the majority of women present; statins for cholesterol are ineffective for 80% of women but increase their chance of developing diabetes which then is a much higher risk for women developing heart problems. The examples are multiple. From misdiagnosis, and ""my favourite"" dismissal of women's symptoms, everything is stacked against us. It's not all intentional and mean spirited, it's just that men, even the good ones, always think of the male as the default. This is yet another reason why REPRESENTATION is important. The meritocracy is a myth, perpetrated by white cis males because it has served and still serves them well. Women do anywhere from two to ten times more unpaid care work, which results in worse labor outcomes, and all the consequences that come with that - no career advancements, less money, jobs that are low paid, women taking on jobs they're overqualified for etc, . Gendered poverty is a real thing. I don't know about the situation in other countries, but in Australia, older women (50+) have been the fastest-growing group of homeless people in recent years. It makes my blood boil! Really, just read this book. I plan on banging on about this book and because I'm annoying like that, I'm going to question and challenge most things. We need a revolution, we need to appreciate and reward women for all the unpaid house/care work without which the society wouldn't function. We need to question and challenge the status quo in research, medicine, arts, academia, e v e r y t h i n g everywhere.I often fantasise about organising or participating in a National Women's strike, as they had in Iceland in 1975.

I began studying English (which I hated when it was introduced to us in year 6) because I'd gotten my hands on the lyrics of my favourite band and I was dying to know what my beloved was crooning about. Strangely enough, I was never compelled to read a musician's memoir. I don't know if it's because I find memoirs to be a self-aggrandising exercise, or it's because my musical crushes of the past ten years are too young to even consider writing a memoir.Anyway, this book is everywhere and I noticed that most people love it. While I don't consider myself a Foo Fighters fan, it's rock'n'roll, so I like it. :-) Coincidentally (or maybe not :-) ), the Foo Fighters just had a huge stadium concert in Australia, the first stadium concert in over 2 years.They also announced an Australian tour for November and December, and guess who got (very expensive) tickets to see them in Perth? :-) Here's hoping I'll get to see them live and it won't be yet another cancelled/postponed concert. Anyway, back to this book. I was pleasantly surprised from the beginning - the writing is smooth, the pacing is just right and it has interesting anecdotes, without following a chronological hierarchy. I'm too much of a cynic, I googled if it had been ghost-written. Apparently not. In interviews, Grohl comes across as articulate and with a great gift for gabbling, but those things don't necessarily translate into one being a good writer. Of course, he's been around the block a few times and is a consummate performer, who knows what works with the public.I sort of internally chastise myself for loving how much he goes on about his mum and his three girls. I guess that is another example of how low the bar is for men - oh, he loves his mum and his own daughters! Oh, he also takes his girls to school and changed their nappies! What a hero! (*Insert sarcasm and a good dose of eye-rolling)Nevertheless, this book entertained me. His passion/obsession for music shines through. I love passionate people. He even had a few anecdotes from Australia.His Nirvana ""period"" didn't take too many pages, which I liked, after all, it was only a 4 year period of his life, albeit an important time. I sort of forgot he was the drummer on the incredible Queens of the Stone Age album ""Songs for the Deaf"" and was in Them Crooked Vultures with Josh Homme. At 53, Grohl did a lot, met a lot of people. You don't have to be a music fan to appreciate this memoir, but knowing who he's writing about certainly makes reading/listening to this memoir better.

By circumstance and lack of direction, he becomes a petty thief, and he gets himself a prison record.When he finds someone to love and settle down with, he becomes a respectable citizen. As was the case with Toltz's previous two novels, there were many quips popping up everywhere. And quite a few philosophical soliloquies or thought bubbles about love, relationships, the afterlife, faith etc. At times, it is somewhat comical, but I never found it ha-ha funny. I was willing to suspend my disbelief and go with the whole after-life scenario. I finished the novel and had no clue about what Toltz was trying to say or show within these pages.

Will their spark rekindle?First of all, I was glad to finally read a novel centred on queer women, I don't recall reading one before, the feminist in me was annoyed by that omission, especially given how many books featuring gay men I read.The novel was easy to read, even though it was overwritten and too long. Back in the day, I used to think, especially when men would piss me off, that it would be so much easier to be with a woman and that it was such a shame that I was attracted to men. It turns out, all relationships are complicated because people are complex. Who'd have thought, right? ;-) Discovering that same-sex relationships deal with the same headaches as most hetero couples was both comforting and disappointing.Anyway, as much as a middle-aged hetero white woman can assess, this was a good debut novel....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Jan 2022,"Jan 26, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53703632-a-world-between

If there are people out there who (still) think being a doctor/surgeon is a glamorous profession, this book will shatter their views. The effort and dedication it takes to become a doctor and then keep on practising medicine are not for the faint of heart.Kay inserted a lot of amusing anecdotes which I'm sure most doctors love enchanting their audiences with during parties.

It's been two weeks since I last touched a book - I blame it on the Christmas/holidays craziness and me discovering another musician to become obsessed with (I love music even more than reading). Anyway, imagine my horror to discover I had 4 audiobooks waiting in my library overdrive, Come Again being one of them. I confess I couldn't remember what/who prompted me to add it to my holds; upon noticing it was very brief I thought I should pause the music and try to listen to it. Let's just say that had my family been believers they would have praised god. I'm an all or nothing kind of person, so for the past two weeks, I've been playing the same two albums on repeat for hours on end. Anyway, timing is everything and this book was the right kind of novel I could concentrate on. Having the delightful Olivia Coleman as the narrator made it all that more special. I didn't even grumble about some aspects that needed a good dose of suspension of disbelief, something I usually struggle with. I should say what this was about. Forty-five-year-old Kate had recently lost her husband - the love of her life. Her grief and guilt are enormous. She now hates her job - she's a computer expert at some sort of history and internet cleaning company, which deals with cleaning some very nasty people's online presence. She's kind of had enough and doesn't feel like there's anything to keep her going. This sounds like a downer of a book but it wasn't.Was this perfect? Far from it. Honestly, given my complete avoidance of anything book related in the past two weeks, I almost feel elated I finished a book, be it just an audiobook.

So far, this is my favourite Shafak novel....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,"Dec 31, 2022","Nov 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57404905-the-island-of-missing-trees

Objectively, it had clever twists and all that jazz. There were some very good observations on how easy it is to take each other for granted when in a relationship and how easy it is to build resentments even when you live a comfortable life and don't have the stresses associated with raising kids. Of course, most of us think the grass is greener on the other side. I can see why people are so into this novel. I think I'm just a bit fed up with the genre, you can't escape it, the bookshops and library bookshelves are filled with books in the genre.

I almost finished it in one day but had to stop because I had things to do, places to go to.Basically, this is a story of revenge. An illigitimate daughter decides to kill her family, better said the family of her billionaire biological father, who allowed her and her mother to live in poverty. I'm in the ""let's eat the rich"" camp, but even so, I'm generally not comfortable with murder.Mackie succeeded in preventing me from flinching (for the most part, anyway) when it came to the creative and (mostly) plausible methods of killing someone. I love an unlikeable narrator, Grace Bernard's fits the bill. We're used to reading books narrated by unlikeable men, lately, I'm noticing there are more and more unlikeable female narrators. I dig that. Grace was ruthless and brutal, even more so when it came to her observations. The rich and the middle class are mercilessly criticised. There's even some feminism and a few takedowns of the good old patriarchy, so it's very topical, in a very light, non-preachy kind of way.The pacing was fantastic, I wasn't bored for a second. In my view, this was much better than My Sister, The Serial Killer.I'm looking forward to reading more by Mackie....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Dec 10, 2021","Dec 11, 2021","Nov 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50224049-how-to-kill-your-family

I've been struggling for a while with reading books. But I devoured this one. This novel is about three very different women: Margot, a literature Professor in her seventies; Ivy, a new mother in her forties who's also a philanthropist; and Summer, a young usher and drama student. Their inner thoughts and backgrounds are presented as their minds drift while watching Samuel Becket's Happy Days, while fires rage on the hills around Melbourne. The themes cover relationships, feminism, racial and sexual identity, motherhood, grief, art, philanthropy, and climate change and climate anxiety, and, of course, appreciation of art. All these aspects transpire in a natural, non-didactic, non-message-y way. The Performance had that rare quality of being intellectually stimulating and emotionally affecting, creative but also accessible. I'm in awe of Thomas' talent. This is one of the best novels I read this year. As far as I'm concerned, it should get all the awards.This is why I read!In case any publishers read this, I absolutely loved the book's design, the type, the larger than usual line spacing.

I know she's got a new book out, but since my library hasn't yet added the audiobook to their collection, I decided to try whatever was available as an audiobook, as I didn't want to add another book on my neglected pile of books on my bedside table.This novel has at its centre the Fullers, who own a potato farm in Liberty Falls, Idaho. Lloyd is a successful potato grower. His Japanese wife, Momoko, is a keen gardener, who's started a seed business. Their only daughter, Yumi, feels stifled. This is a relatively long novel beginning in the 70s up to the late 90s. We first meet fourteen-year-old Yumi, who is seduced by her history teacher. Yumi and her father's relationship falls apart. Yumi runs away.Twenty five years later, Lloyd is dying, he's had cancer and several heart attacks. Momoko has Alzheimers and is too fragile to look after Lloyd. Cassie Unger, Yumi's former best friend and neighbour, looks after the Fullers, but she's got her own obligations. Hearing that Lloyd doesn't have long to live, she tracks down Yumi, now living in Hawaii, and tells her to come home.Yumi is almost forty, she teaches and also sells real estate. She's got a forteen-year-old boy, Phonix, an almost seven-year-old daughter, Ocean, and a one-year-old, Poo - the kids all have different fathers. Life is messy. Relationships are messy. It's so easy to break them even when there's love.Ozeki adds more to the mix, and as far as I'm concerned, it made the novel all that much interesting.There's a group of environmental activists who are fighting against the bioengineering companies that are pushing their products onto the stretched farmers. They're taking residence in the Fuller's drive with their bus, in exchange for helping with taking care of Lloyd and helping Mamoko's seed business.This novel is imperfect and it could be accused of being message-y and sentimental (I don't see how one could avoid those accusations when one addresses GMOs and corporate farming) but I really enjoyed it.

She loves her job, as she believes in rules and order.Her world is small. Her father is back on the island, he's getting older and more eccentric. Allegra only talks to the village baker where she gets her coffee and pastry every morning, a colleague and a gallery owner who hires Allegra to pose nude for art classes. An unpleasant encounter with the owner of a Ferrari issued with many parking fines triggers Allegra; she starts looking at who and what made her, especially who are her five people who matter the most. Some unpleasant realisations push her to the limit.This was a lovely story about trying to figure out one's place in the world and finding one's group of people one can count on, because no one is an island, even if they live on an island.

For the first forty pages or so I was thinking - oh, no, I'm not liking it. As I got to know the characters better, I started to feel things, even though for the most part they were mostly in the ""I could slap these people"" they were infuriatingly obtuse, despite being smart people in a conventional way, well, except for Felix, the warehouse worker, who somehow had quite the natural insights into people's psyche despite being quite the jerk, at least in the beginning, to Alice, the famous writer. Initially, I was thinking, who writes long emails these days as if they were writing letters back in the day. Then I accepted it, remembering that it can be much easier to say certain things in writing than it would be face to face. The email writing was an excellent device for Rooney to insert the characters' philosophies on life, politics, climate change, being a famous writer and hating it. Through them, Rooney makes some good points.There are four main characters in this novel. Alice is a famous writer, who's had a major mental breakdown and moved to a seaside town, three hours away from Dublin. Her best friend, Eileen, works as an editor for a literary journal, she makes very little money, and even at twenty-nine, lives in a shared house, paying most of her salary for the privilege. Both women are depressed and unhappy, despite their different circumstances, even when it comes to their love interests, who happen to be two very different men - Felix is the warehouse worker who met Alice over Tinder. He's kind of a jerk but she lets him. On the other hand, Eileen's love of her life is her best friend, super gorgeous, smart and kind, Simon, who works for a left-wing party - the ideal man, in my book anyway. Oh, wait, nobody's perfect, Simon is a devout Catholic, although, to his credit, not the zealot, preachy kind. His faith afforded Rooney some observations on religion, Catholicism and its huge influence in Ireland - not that it went very far or far enough, but then it would have become another type of novel.

I was beyond ecstatic to discover the audiobook on the library BorrowBox app. You see, all previous Joyce Maynard books I read were consumed as audiobooks, two of them were narrated by Maynard herself, so I've become quite fond of her voice.This novel cut deep. It's the story of Eleanor, who becomes an orphan at sixteen. She dreams of having her own family and a nice home, to make up for the love she never had as a child. She buys a farm when only twenty years old. A few years later, she falls in love with a handsome artisan. Three kids join them in quick succession. Life is busy, messy, money is tight, there are ups and downs. But things can always get worse. Truthfully, my heart broke and ached for Eleanor. She was too unselfish, gave too much. It pissed me off big time how easily Cam, the father of her children and the love of her life, got everything she loved the most. Life is messy, people hurt us, we hurt people, even when we have the best intentions.

She wants to put a labyrinth there. It's fair to say that's a bit of an obsession of hers. Erica meets some interesting characters in the sleepy town.

Eventually, kids appear. The wife is burdened by the drudgery of daily life, not getting any fulfilment from the domestic chores and having each day indistinguishable from others. The husband does the fieldwork and the cow milking and expects a good, ""manly"" dinner. He seems to have very little self-awareness.

The narrator of this novel is Theo Byrne – a forty-five year old astrobiologist, recently widowed, and the father of a challenging but interesting nine-year-old boy, who may be on the autism spectrum. So besides the environmental themes, we also have grief, parenting and some politics – as I said, themes right up my alley. I’m trying to make sense to myself why I didn’t love this novel. Was it my disinterest/ignorance of all things astronomy related? Could it be that it bugs me to no end that we spend so much money on astronomy projects, university courses etc, when this planet is dying? I found the astrobiology and the astronomy passages beyond boring, not to mention they pulled me out of the story. As someone who generally bemoans the dumbing down and anti-intellectualism of society, I also gave myself a stern talking to - Bianca, just because something is beyond your understanding, knowledge and capacity, means nothing. So, I’m conflicted.Let’s forget about the astronomy bits, how did the rest of the book go? Well, the more relatable aspects of it were fine – the challenges of sole parenting, especially parenting a neurodiverse child, were well done. I did have a few quibbles about the father’s opinions on diagnoses and treatments, amazingly enough, they didn’t bother me that much, even though his views didn’t necessarily align with mine. His nine year old son, Robin, is a very interesting character, intense, super intelligent. An alternative treatment, a sort of cognitive manipulation using the mother’s old profile is used to create new neuropathways for Robin. Those aspects were interesting, I should do some googling to see if they actually exist. Powers uses the child as a conduit of ideas, not unusual in literature. Unfortunately, I never thought Robin as a believable character and I was never truly touched on an emotional level, which I found disconcerting. The mother and wife sounded like an incredible person, out of this world. Both husband and son put her on a pedestal. Now onto the political, topical aspects of the book. As I’ve confessed before, I’m a full-fledged lefty. I loath Trump & Co, I greatly admire Greta Thunberg, and the environmental concerns are close to my heart and mind. While Trump remains unnamed, you would have had to live in a cave not to recognise the president’s stance on things. Thunberg is given a different Scandi name, but you’ll recognise her as the teenage girl on the Autism spectrum, who’s scolding the politicians of the world. It pains me to say this, but I found these aspects a bit on the nose – for lack of a better expression. So, I don’t really know how to rate this. The reading experience wasn’t smooth, I appreciated some aspects of it, but emotionally I was completely disengaged.I’m bewildered baffled I didn’t love Bewilderment.

What kind of name is Jeffers? Even the name annoyed me (sorry Jeffereses out-there). The improbability of such correspondence between a man and a woman didn't bother me too much, as I saw it as a writing device. Given that a pandemic is mentioned, I assumed Second Place to be written about the contemporary era, although, I don't remember mobile phones or computers being mentioned, hmm, it just occurred to me now, as I'm writing this rant.The beginning was incomprehensible and pointless. The narrator, M, tells Jeffres about this devil-like man on a train, who frightened her, but nobody seemed bothered by him. Was it a dream, was it a metaphor for something - no idea. The narrator moved on - to another random episode about meeting an artist at an exhibition, hanging out with him for some hours and the narrator being perplexed that by the end of their night together, the artist decided he'd rather go to bed alone. Alright, and ...? Then the narrator moves on to another episode, period, she's fifty, she's remarried to a nice, dependable, quiet man, Tony. They live in a recluse place by some marshes, country unnamed. They have a second place on the property where they have all sorts of artists, friends stay. But this fifty-year-old woman likes this famous artist, L - oh, how she waxes lyrical ad-nauseum about his paintings as if there was no other art in the world. (I say that as someone who LOVES art). Who among us hasn't written a letter to an artist they admire and invited him/her to come to stay with them - even though they never met? And what famous artist would answer to such an invitation, even considering that apparently, they had common acquaintances? The way M goes on and on about his occasional, short letters to her was infuriating.Not as infuriating as when the artist dude finally accepts M's invitation and decides to grace them with his presence. Never mind he had lost his houses and had no better options, but hey, M will be happy with any crumbs. Except, that, surprise!, the dude artist, L, shows up with a very good looking woman half his age. Talk about cliches.M is immediately annoyed with the young woman. There's some perplexing description of her mouth, I didn't quite know what to make of it. It only gets worse. Nothing much happens, the artist and the young woman, don't spend much time with them. That doesn't prevent M from obsessing over the artist. She analyses, quantifies and digests the artist's every glance, blink, tone of voice, posture, gesture, touch etc. She's so freakingly self-involved she thinks it's all in some incomprehensible way about her. I mean, give me a break! this is a fifty-year-old woman, who's lived, got married twice - she was worse than a virgin ingenue who'd never met a man before. To say that I found her pathetic would be an understatement. The more I read, the more insufferable it became. Oh, and the word salad became excruciating. The dialogues were over the top as well. To conclude this rant, Second Place> is a pretentiously overwritten, infuriating, pointless novel. It's definitely the worst book I read (or attempted to read) this year. And you know what else pissed me off big time? The blurb, this fragment in particular, ""His provocative presence provides the frame for a study of female fate and male privilege.""

She enjoys his attention and the car rides. Things happen. Karuna becomes pregnant.Written in the first person, as a letter from Karuna to her daughter, this novel looks at a fraught mother-daughter relationship. There's codependency, emotional blackmail and abuse, ignorance, innocence, loneliness and poverty thrown in the mix. The mother is a simple woman, who still hangs on her Philipino old wives' remedies and customs, which she imposes onto Karuna. One of those customs is that mothers and newly born babies should not leave their house for 100 days, which is what the title refers to.The mother is overbearing in every way possible.

It sounds better in Japanese :-). The writing is intensely introspective, atmospheric and quite lyrical. There are several perspectives that we hear throughout the novel. Mai is a twenty-eight-year-old woman, recently married, always doing what's expected of her. One day, she meets the mother of a former school colleague. She is told that Hikaru hasn't left his room in years. Mai starts writing him letters, which he doesn't reply to.My heart broke for the mother. She loves her son. She blames herself for her son not being a successful member of society. Shame compels her to withdraw from the few friends and acquaintances. Her husband only comes home to sleep and eat. She is lonely and alone, despite having somebody living in the next room. Sadako is a young woman who's beautiful. She works in a bar, attracting customers. She's lonely in a different way. We also hear Haikaru's perspective. He seemed very self-aware as to why he was a shut-in.Brabon's writing is haunting, deftly creating a sense of suffocation and dissociation.

I like novels about ordinary people with ordinary lives - this novel is that. But something was missing. Hession affords chapters to several characters, some very loosely connected with Joseph, aka Panenka - a former Seneca FC footballer, infamous for missing a penalty shot some twenty-five years ago, that would have promoted the football club in the first division. This one failure has affected Panenka's life trajectory, he's become even more closed-off, pushed away his wife and daughter and became a mystery, even to his few so-called friends of his. His daughter, Marie-Therese and her seven-year-old son, Arthur, came to live with him, following her separation from the boy's father. Panenka enjoys having them around, but he's still mysterious, they don't even know what he does for a living. I mean, give me a break. I understand talking about feelings and past hurts is hard. But talking about one's job should be easy peasy. So I didn't buy the premise, the behaviours and their justifications, which made it difficult for me to care.I hope Hession's third novel brings back some of the spark and humour found in his debut novel.

Then I read the more accessible Mimi, which I also loved.Needless to say, I was excited to read Ellmann's essays.Even though these are essays, some of them feature themes that also appeared in the two novels mentioned above: the patriarchy and the many evils men bestow(ed) upon the planet, women, children; the proliferation of guns and nuclear power; the environmental destruction, plus a few other more mundane observations that cracked me up and made me think, ""oh, no, you didn't"": morning routines that are popular on YouTube and I'm guessing Insta and TikTok, objects, electricity. She makes some very good points on travelling and how much it ruins everything, including the culture, the environment - undeniable facts. I firmly agree with her, especially when it comes to business, academic junkets. Those travels are, for the most part, unnecessary, especially when we have such modern ways of communicating. There's also that perplexing aspect of eco travelling - an oxymoron if ever there was one. Her picking on American travellers had me in stitches. Of course, she generalises and exaggerates, but she also makes very good points. She's audacious and gutsy, Ms Ellmann, and I love her for that. She even dared to pick on genre literature, particularly on crime novels. As I was saying, she's fearless, picking on the most published/most read genre. It cracked me up.The essays are varied in both themes and style. As a collection, they just showcase her masterful writing skills and splendid intellect. I don't know about others, but I feel a particular kinship with Lucy Ellmann, I feel we could be friends, although I'm nowhere near as intellectual or skilled as she is, I do love a good rant about the patriarchy, politics, culture etc.Lucy Ellman for no 1 leader of the planet EarthEssays:Things Are Against UsThe Underground BunkerPygmalion in the White HouseTrapped Family FingersThe Woman in the HouseConsider Pistons and PumpsThree StrikesA Spell of PatriarchySing the UnelectricThe Lost Art of Staying PutBras—a Life SentenceMorning Routine GirlsAh, MenTake The Money HoneyI've received this ARC via Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest .

She doesn't cope well with her new retired life. The empty nest feels emptier than usual. Not being constantly busy and challenged by the latest dramas and emergencies gives one time to think, reminisce. And get irritated with one's husband.

She's hard-working and caring.- I was aware of the Dust Bowl, but there were many gaps in my knowledge. Of course, Dorothea Lange's incredible photographs pop up in my mind instantly. (http://100photos.time.com/photos/doro...)- my enthusiasm for the novel rose sharply once the communists came along, fighting for fairer wages for the farm labourers who were exploited. I thought that was very gutsy of Hannah to bring that into the novel. Environmental degradation and climate change, immigration issues, the labour relations are still such current issues. As they say, history repeats. Unfortunately, humans don't seem to learn much from history.I love that Hannah is focusing on resurrecting women and their untold stories and role in history. If it hadn't been for the aspects mentioned above, I would have found this novel too melodramatic to the point of finding it unbearable. There is also some clunkiness to the writing, the pace is very slow for half of the novel, we move quickly through some life stages, then plod along with others. There's a whole lot of telling, not that much showing. I generally find this irksome. I found some of the characters either sketchy and/or unbelievable. I had a hard time believing that Elsa's parents would be so incredibly horrible just because she wasn't a great beauty. Also, she had sisters but they never seem to matter or get a mention. Elsa's teenage daughter seemed a bit too modern and too grown-up at times.

Most of us need reminders, reinforcing, gentle coaxing, or kicks in the arse now and then. This comforting book offers those, except for the kicks in the arse. In conclusion, this won't cure your depression (not that it promises to do that), but it could lessen one's anxieties and existential dread, at least until its glow fades and one returns to old patterns of thinking and living....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,not set,"Jul 21, 2021","Jul 21, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/55506579-the-comfort-book

Phew.Eleanor (Elle) is the narrator of this story. She's fifty, a mother of three, married to a handsome and nice British man. Their life is pretty good. In the shadows, there are unfulfilled desires and longings between childhood friends, who are now adult friends who brought into the mix their significant others. Some people never find true love or have good, meaningful relationships. Others have the fortune, or misfortune, to be thorn between two perfectly good men. We all know by now, life is not fair.It could be argued that the place in Cape Cod is, to a certain extent, one of the main characters of this novel. Elle and her family spent every summer there. They still do. It's a place that holds meaning, a place where things happened and are still happening. There are some secrets hiding the shallows of the pond and in the sandhills of the beach nearby. I liked the structure of this novel, alternating between a day's events and then going back in time, to where the narrator's mum was younger, up to the recent days. This novel is very filmic in its nature. I would definitely watch a movie, or even better, a miniseries based on this novel.Update: re-reading it, this time listening to the audiobook, which was a pleasant experience.

I knew early on this wasn't going to be a five-star book for me, but was hoping for a four. I love books about quirky female characters who get second chances and find their true selves etc. This novel checked those boxes. It even had some amusing situations.While Miss Benson was the more fleshed-out character, the others were cartoonish. I thought the storyline of Mr Muncic, a prisoner of war, was superfluous, and I had issues with his involvement in the narrative and how he affected the plot. I won't elaborate on it so I don't give away spoilers.There were some aspects that were unbelievable and contradictory and conveniently brushed over, which prevented me to fully immerse myself and want to get back to the story.

Also, the audiobook was available without waiting. :-)The novel takes place in Edenton, North Carolina via two different POVs in different timelines. The modern-day narrative is from Morgan Christopher's perspective, who is unexpectedly released from jail on parole. All she has to do is finish restoring a mural that a famous, now deceases artist, has requested in his will. The mural was painted by Anna Dale in 1940 and it was supposed to be installed in the Edenton Post Office. As you could probably guess, the other POV is that of Anna Dale, who at just twenty-two is the lucky winner of a competition that awarded her the contract to paint the mural for the Edenton Post Office. There weren't many women artists in that era, not even in the NE states that were more liberal. So Anna encounters some resistance from the folks in that small, conservative Southern town. Anna carries on. She takes on some high school students to help her on, including a very talented black student, which is highly frowned upon.As the formula demands, through painstaking work and a whole lot of coincidences, Morgan discovers what had happened to Anna Dale.To be honest, I'm tired of this dual parallel timeline/POV structure. But then, there are only that many ways to write a novel. I get it. In saying all that, there weren't too many unbelievable scenarios and too many anachronisms, when it came to the 1940 section of the book. As an art lover, I appreciated the parts of the novel that were describing the process of making the mural, and later on, its restoration. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 11, 2021","Jul 14, 2021","Jul 11, 2021",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/56777043-big-lies-in-a-small-town

Now, don't get me wrong, I like good guys, who are sensitive, introspective etc, but I never bought Simon as a real person. Usually, first-person narrated novels get me on the side of the narrator no matter their flaws. Still, this perfectly nice young man got on my nerves. The Vixen is a body ripper novel whose main character is supposed to be Esther Rosenberg. Simon, the newly hired assistant editor, is given the task of editing it. The author is this sexy, mysterious young woman, who's inhabiting Simon's fantasies, even before he meets her. When they meet she looks just like in the photo he was given. There are some incongruences and question marks, but Simon is too busy drooling over her and having sex in public places, pretty much on each date. Simon is used like a human dildo. I never found those behaviours believable, even knowing that many men would not say no to free sex with a gorgeous woman, I just didn't buy the premise, the justifications, few as they were. There are spies, CIA agents, pretenders, everyone has secrets - it's one tangled mess. Also, Simon seems to fall for every half-decent looking woman who says hi to him, I found that somewhat perplexing.I thought the storyline was incomprehensible, convoluted, I didn't get what Prose was trying to say/accomplish. It was as if I was trying to put together a puzzle by using the pieces belonging to other puzzles....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Sep 24, 2021","Sep 30, 2021","Jul 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55507033-the-vixen

Following the Lottery win, her mum and her baby boy, Nana, move from Ghana to Huntsville, Alabama, to stay with a relative who lived there. The husband soon follows and a few years later Gifty is born. Their life is not easy. The mother can only get a job as a carer to very old and sick people. Long, backbreaking working hours for very little pay. The father finds it even harder to get a job, he's a very tall black man in an all-white community. Even the Pentecostal church they attend every Sunday is all white. But people get on with their lives, the best way they can.Nana becomes quite a successful high school basketball player. But then, tragedy strikes. Enter OxyContin. Enter addiction. My heart broke for the mum and her kids. Gyasi's writing blew me away from the get-go. The transitions from the current day to the past were so incredibly smooth, the writing was just exceptional. I was fascinated by the scientific aspects of the book. Gifty is doing her neuroscience PhD at Standford. Her research focuses on the brain pathways that make one addicted. She's all work and no play. I don't quite have the words to articulate what makes this novel so good. It's introspective, unassuming, smooth as silk as it ponders not fitting in, questions faith (Hallelujah!), tries to understand one's parents and sibling.

On one hand, this is a competent, beautifully written novel, with plenty of insight and heart.But the thing that made it good is also the same thing that made me grumble and, to a certain extent, kept me at a distance - there's no way a ten-year-old, no matter how precocious, would be that articulate, observant, resourceful, and manipulative.

I am well aware of the hoo-ha about cancel culture. I can't help but notice that those bemoaning it are, generally speaking, people who have had platforms and a certain privilege. On many occasions, their misbehaviour, inc sexual abuse, and other transgressions come out to light. I'm not a big fan of people digging out past comments from when one was a teenager - we're supposed to grow, learn and change, so we should allow people the benefit of the doubt for past jokes and other misdemeanors. As with most things, it's how you use them.Boyne has chosen the Cleverleys to drive his views on social media and society. The patriarch, George Cleverley, is a famous BBC presenter with over thirty years in the public's eye. He's got clout. He thinks of himself as the most wonderful, measured, generous public figure. His wife, Beverley Cleverley, is a successful romance novel author. Well, she uses ghostwriters, but she still thinks of herself as a terrific writer. They have three children who still live at home, in their multi-million pound home. Nelson, the eldest, is a twenty-two teacher, a neurotic virgin, who is seeking help from therapists. His sister, Elizabeth, is attached to her phone, she thinks herself an influencer. She takes great pleasure from bullying people online under her second Twitter account. Then there's the handsome, sociopathic Achilles, seventeen. He enjoys blackmailing unassuming middle-aged men. This is one affluent dysfunctional family, none of its members has any insight or self-awareness. It was very easy to hate the Cleverleys. Which I thought was problematic. They were too cartoonish. I would have appreciated this novel more if Boyne had been less obvious and had made the Cleverleys slightly less obnoxious.While reading this novel, I found myself wondering if Boyne had had any bones to pick with people on Twitter, because the messaging was a little too obvious. Google provided me with the answer. My suspicions were correct.That's not to say that there weren't some very funny moments, among the many ridiculous situations and occasionally grating monologues. I particularly enjoyed his comments on certain very popular TV shows.To conclude my ramblings, this novel will appeal to some people more than others, depending on where you find yourself on the woke/outrage scale. I like to think that I'm self-aware and woke enough not to take the jabs personally, especially since they were occasionally warranted. I just like my baddies to be more nuanced and the novels less obviously message-y, which I realise is a contradiction when it comes to satire.

This feels like the longest dry spell, as far as 5-star reads are concerned.I picked this on a whim when I noticed it on the new releases shelf at the library. I've been meaning to read Reservoir 13 for a while so I thought why not try McGregor's newest. It started off well. Was it going to be an adventure/mystery kind of book? I was up for it.The novel begins with the point of view of a young Antarctica scientist who finds himself in a sudden storm and loses track of his two other partners. The adrenaline was high, what will happen. The POV quickly shifts to the other two people in the group and what happened to them, to a certain extent. One of them was the older, very experienced technical assistant, Doc, who's been coming to the Station and Antarctica for decades. The three people find themselves in trouble. That's part 1 - Lean.Fast forward to part two - Fall - Doc has had a stroke, which left him incapacitated and without speech. His wife in the UK is asked to come to the hospital in Santiago, Chile. Now we suddenly hear Anna's point of view and we get a better idea about her and her life with Robert, aka Doc, and their two now grown-up children. I appreciated this part regarding how a carer's life is upturned and the mixed feelings that such a huge life event has for both the affected person and those who care for them.Stand, the last part - is about Robert's recovery journey. Another character is introduced, the therapist running a group for people with speech issues. McGregor briefly moves to her pov but not for long enough or to make it worthwhile getting to know her. There were a few barely sketched characters. Speaking of characters, even Robert and Anna's adult children, Frank and Sara, made appearances here and there, but there wasn't much substance to them. That last part was boring and quite messy writing-wise. While on a logical level I appreciated and I think I understood what McGregor was going for, I was always kept at a distance by the omniscient narration. There are a few characters that come in and out but they're not very well developed, not to mention that novel starts with a character's POV, barely developed who then is completely dropped.To conclude this rambling , I thought Lean Fall Stand  was a hodgepodge of a novel. I don't know what it was about, who it was about. Well, I sort of know. It seemed to me that McGregor had these two ideas in his head and strenuously attempted to connect them into a novel.

We follow the life of twenty-six-year-old, Jane, who moved to Boyne City to be a second-grade teacher.She starts a relationship with forty-two year old, divorced carpenter and odd-jobs man, Duncan. Duncan was quite the ladies' man. The relationship is going smoothly until Jane realises that it wasn't going anywhere, as Duncan wasn't the marrying (again) kind of man.A car accident and a few other happenings bring Jane and Duncan together again, and his ex-wife and her husband. Heiny did a good job showing the ups and downs of life, the absurd, the mundane, the boredom of raising small children, occasionally interspersed by levity, cuteness, and pleasant surprises.I'm bummed out I didn't love this more.

I thought I should read one of her books before I start watching the Netflix documentary about her.The Joy Luck Club is about four Chinese women, living in San Francisco, who meet often to play Mahjong, eat, and chat. It's also about their families, especially about their American born daughter.Despite its Chinese fragrance, there are many aspects that are shared with most immigrant stories. There's the intergenerational conflict, with an added layer of complexity - kids born to immigrant parents, living and absorbing the culture of the country they were born in, while having the influences of their parents' native countries, which for the most part, especially when young, they reject or disdain.Without a doubt, the mother-daughter relationships were quite fascinating. Tan pinpointed brilliantly how little kids know about their parents and their history. The novel also made me realize how many people who have suffered greatly, somehow manage to keep on living, seemingly ordinary lives.

It was like nothing I read before, usually, that goes into the plus column. The first part is made up of short passages about random things, including some clever observations on society, the way social media has interwoven itself into so many aspects of ours lives, and how it changes the way we behave and interact. So it is clever in that way, sort of. If you don't get the reference you're left scratching your head. The second part is more cohesive, and it makes sense, as it's mostly about the narrator's sister, who becomes pregnant but discovers, too late, that her baby was suffering from a rare genetic disorder, the Proteus syndrome. Going from exaltation to heartbreak and everything in between. Some of the shortcomings:- too contemporary - those who are not immersed in all aspects of social media, those who are not up to date with memes, trends, or whatever Lockwood is mentioning, will miss the point. At least, it still capitalized the first letter at the beginning of a sentence - so, I didn't have to struggle with overcoming my aversion towards that trend.- there are two different books in one.- this book was already dated by the time it came out, because of the nature of the internet and social media.Despite some of its limitations, I'm not sorry I read it.

Anna lives in Sydney, Australia in 2017. While renovating her grandmother's house now Anna's, she discovers a beautiful box that contained some treasures. Her curiosity is aroused. The other protagonist is Elizabeth Trebithick who lived in Cornwall, the UK in the late 1800s. A death bed promise to her father sees Elizabeth undertake a long voyage to Valparaiso, Chile in search of a rare plant. As you've probably guessed, there's a connection between Elizabeth, the journal and Anna's grandmother's house. The Botanist's Daughter was a reasonably good novel. It didn't quite tickle my fancy, but then this genre is not my cup of tea. I also thought the love interests for both women were too good to be true. Unfortunately, I never felt fully engaged and didn't get invested one way or the other.

She does what she has to, using her attractiveness to get what she wants from men - if you can't beat them join them. She becomes very famous and very rich. Her many marriages keep the public interested.

Jenkins is great at keeping one's interest, despite the many old Hollywood cliches that seem so familiar - the parties, the rivalries, the infidelities and so on.I also loved how JT went about introducing Evelyn Hugo, via the magazine writer, Monique Grant, who's offered a life-changing opportunity - writing Evelyn's Hugo authorised biography.

This memoir has been lauded by many, so I took the opportunity to check it out for myself.It focuses primarily on Bowditch's struggles with anxiety and depression. The death of one of her older sisters when only seven years old, years of dieting, from when she was just eleven, relationship breakups, and probably a genetic disposition - accumulated to the point of a major nervous breakdown at only twenty-one when living in London. What followed was a period of slowly but steadily fighting her demons. She was lucky enough to have had the love and support of loving parents and siblings, finding the right kind of books to read and the right therapist to guide her towards reframing the way she thought of things - what you think is your reality, after all, the brain doesn't know what's real or not. Bowditch's writing is straight forward and non-preachy. She doesn't overshare but gives the reader a detailed enough overview of events in her life and of things she felt and thought. Her diaries must have been cathartic to re-read and very useful when it came to writing this memoir.I listened to the audiobook which was narrated by Bowditch herself. She did a great job.

What's the opposite of hitting the jackpot? Despite all those struggles that are time-consuming, frustrating, expensive, energy-sapping, Lawson has her very own quirky sense of humour, which she happily dispenses for our entertainment. While there's plenty of humour, there are also chapters that are on the serious, vulnerable side. She also recognises her own privilege and fortune, even when she gets frustrated with the health insurance companies. We are all broken. Some may only have tiny fracture lines that haven't cracked the vessel, some have one, two major shards that could be glued together, some are broken into a million pieces. The truth is, nobody goes through life without scars and, really, nobody gets out of here intact. Another reminder to be kind, sometimes the smallest of kindnesses can make someone's day.

In most households, anywhere from 70-85% of the buying decisions are made by women, from groceries to cars to holidays. It's yet another responsibility women are burdened with. I'm also very aware that having choices is a privilege that many women/people don't have. While I believe that we should all change our current unsustainable ways, I'm also aware, that putting the responsibility on the individual is exactly what the big polluters, the corporations have been pushing for so that we focus on this person or that person who may be using plastic bags or straws or driving big cars etc (guilty as charged) while it's business as usual for those who cause the biggest damage to our planet. Regardless, I'm going to continue to do my best, including educating my kids and those close to me. One of the easiest things we can do, besides voting for the right people/party, involves doing nothing. Not buying stuff. Oh, also being mindful about food waste.

A road trip + a cute dog - yes, please.This was a lovely novel, with a realistic plot. The characters were well fleshed out.

Still Life  is a sprawling novel that begins in 1944 in Italy and goes on for decades.This novel had so many things I love - first, some wonderfully memorable characters: Ulysses Temper - a British young man, whom we first meet during his stint in Italy during WWII. While there, he met the effusive and erudite sexagenarian, Evelyn Skinner, an art historian, a unique person. Their short meeting left an impression on each other. Ulysses's wife and first love is Peg - a beautiful woman, independent and stubborn. Their relationship is unusual. They live in a room above a pub where they work.Peg's ""dalliance"" with another man results in a baby girl. Ulysses adores her as if she were his biological daughter. He's a better parent than Peggy could ever be. The pub is filled with interesting characters - Col, the publican, Pete, an accomplished pianist struggling to make it, Cres, a father figure to Ulysses. To make things even more interesting, there's an extraordinary blue parrot named Claude. Claude is quite the character and a philosopher of sorts.Ulysses' good deed, performed when in Italy during the war, sees him as the owner of a beautiful apartment in Florence. So, together with Peg's daughter Alys, Cress, and Claude the parrot, they make their way to their new life. A new location, a new business, a new language, new friends, - a life filled with light, love, good food, and the simple joys of life - the three ex-pats and their bird flourish. The book is also filled with art and art appreciation; traveling and art as means to opening one's mind and heart.This is not a perfect novel. Some might grumble about the overly precocious child, not to mention the surreal parrot. The book takes a little while to get going, it picks up the pace and becomes much more interesting once Ulysses and Co moved to Florence.Despite its imperfections, Still Life is full of heart; there are some extraordinarily beautiful paragraphs, there's tenderness, quirkiness, memorable characters, chance encounters, beautiful descriptions, and so much more.Since I can't travel to Italy or anywhere else really, I shall have to indulge in some of Fellini's movies that I haven't watched in a long time. I've been listening on repeat to this Italian rock band, so why not watch some Italian classic movies that were mentioned in the novel - La Dolce Vita, The Bicycle Thief, an amazing movie.

Every minute, the equivalent of 1 truck of plastic rubbish finds its way into the oceans. Then there's the microplastics from cosmetic, cleaning products, toothpaste etc.There's also the microfibers that get into the ocean every time we wash our clothes made from non-biodegradable materials. The microplastics and microfibers are eaten by plankton then by fish. So if you think you're eating fish that's good for you - think again. They've discovered plastic in newborns' umbilical cord. They say by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish. I've been aware of the plastic problem and have been fighting my own battles with plastic for some years now. I only read, well listened to this book, to reinforce my determination to reduce my personal plastic use and to learn new information.This was the type of book that I like - a good number of pages, with plenty of stats but also action-oriented and filled with doable changes for all aspects of life - transportation, personal hygiene, food, work, kids parties etc.While we should and could greatly reduce our plastic consumption, the corporations who produce all this plastic without any thought or care for how to remove it from use, do next to nothing to alleviate the problem (admittedly, they're very good at greenwashing and making promises). I'm looking at you Coca Cola, Pepsi, Unilever, Nestle et al. I say make the fuckers pay, see how quickly they'll come up with better solutions. Meanwhile, I'm trying my best to boycott their products._______________________________________________Who's watched Seaspiracy on Netflix? Must watch.

Its themes are not fun - there's grief that manifests in uncomfortable ways, self-mutilation, animal cruelty/death, incestuous sexual experimentations and a whole lot of weird stuff. To my great relief and consternation, I believed it all and the weird stuff never felt gratuitous or exaggerated. I usually struggle with child narrators. It wasn't the case with Jas, the young twelve-year-old narrator of this novel. She was naive and candid enough while also very observant.

As luck would have it, Addie and her ex, Dylan, have a collision on the freeway on their way to a common friend's wedding. Addie is driving with her sister and an acquaintance, Rodney.

The Salters are an aboriginal family living in Durrongo, New South Wales - a fictional town.The imminent death of the family elder brings back home Kerry Salter, who's been living in Queensland for over ten years. She's a lesbian and drives a Harley motorcycle. She's got a sharp tongue, or ""too much lip"". She's scared of and kind of loathes her alcoholic brother, Ken, who still lives in the family home with their mother, Pretty Mary, who is looking after her dying father in law. This family is as far as possible from a perfect family. They've had their share of drama and heartache. There's the intergenerational trauma suffered by predecessors, there's alcoholism, violence, stints in prison, gambling addiction, the disappearance of Pretty Mary's other daughter, Donna, presumed dead. The ups and downs of this family are dizzying. When the town mayor tries to sell the land adjacent to their ancestors' holly island to build a new prison, the family members come together to stop its development. Secrets, repressed memories resurface. So much pain, trauma and anger. Lucashenko managed to infuse some humour and lighter moments to give us a breather from all the drama. One might think that it's too much drama, but the author assures us that ""...…lest any readers assume this portrayal of Aboriginal lives is exaggerated, I would add that virtually every incidence of violence in these pages has occurred within my extended family at least once. The (very) few exceptions are drawn either from the historical record or from Aboriginal oral history. Lucashenko's writing is unadorned and realistic.

The novel begins in the 1950s, when Elise, an opera singer, marries Bill, a Mallee farmer's son, who moved to the city to make money to help support his father's farm.Due to unhappy circumstances, Bill and Elise have to move to the farm. The Mallee is a region in Victoria, Australia, named after the mallee tree. It's very flat, dry and hot. They have two daughters in two years, Ruby is beautiful and serene, Marjorie is clingy and moody. The sisters are inseparable. The years pass by. The elegant, artistic Elise doesn't fit in with the pragmatic, harsh, tedious, repetitious life on a farm. Her cooking is too fancy and lacks when it comes to making a good grab to hold the men over. She drifts, changes, disappears within herself. This is a novel about family, farming life, loneliness, not fitting in, rural people's conservatism and/or narrow mindedness, but also about their helping spirit. Mental illness is also at its core. It doesn't affect just the sufferer but also those close to them. The men don't know what to do about ""a nervy woman"", the children do their best but they're just kids. This kind of story has been told before. The beautiful writing is what elevates this novel. It flows, it meanders and it floats. It tells the story with vivid details.

It makes no sense that women would put themselves through all the BS to be with half baked, men- babies, who can't commit to a pair of socks, who always think the grass is greener, while they put almost no effort in a relationship (#NotAllMen) - and that's the ""good guys"", ""the good on paper guys"". I liked this book from the very beginning. The narrator is Nina Dean, 32 years old, a food writer, who has finally decided to join the online dating game, after two years in the singledom, following the breakup of her long term relationship. Nina is quite content - she's got a job she likes, a mortgage, she's attractive enough, but she'd love to find a partner, maybe start a family. I mean how dare she? ;-) Enter the dating app Links, where one swipes left and right, through a multitude of potential matches. I enjoyed some of the observations she makes about dating, apps, the type of people on dating apps and so on. And wouldn't you know it, she strikes it lucky on her first date. Max is 37, an accountant, super tall, with rugged outdoorsy skin, curly dishevelled hair. He even reads. Books. The literary fiction kind. And he says the right things without seeming too sleek or sleazy. Nina - one of the most level headed female characters I've come across in novels by and about young women - falls in love. Meanwhile, on the family front, things are not going very well. Her beloved father, now in his seventies, has dementia and is getting more forgetful and confused. Nina's mum, who's not terribly close to her, is not on the same page regarding her husband's care. It's hard for everyone. Alderton wrote a very relatable and readable novel that looks at relationships in all their many forms - friendship, familial, amorous, even neighbourly. She takes a good look at ageing and loss as well. Unlike other novels I read in recent years, Alderton didn't go for the shock value, for the overtly descriptive sex acts and obviously weird characters. I also liked that, for a change, our main character is not a damaged young woman (I mean we're all damaged in some ways, but she doesn't have any traumas that needed addressing). Anyway, I'd better finish this overly long . Thanks for reading my ramblings. NB: The audiobook narrator did a great job.

It gripped me and delighted me from the first paragraph and continued to surprise me through to the last sentence.I wouldn't have picked this to read because of its title and assumption that it might be preachy and/or religious.

Most essays focus on nature, with birds being the protagonists. Through personal stories, travel stories, people encountered throughout her life, Macdonald encapsulates the unmitigated damage humans have done to the environment that caused the extinction and almost extinction of so many birds, trees, insects. She does it in direct but subtle ways. There's philosophical pondering on how humans perceive and relate to animals, and who would have thought, but even bird keeping and bird watching depend on one's class.

I'm so glad I remembered to try it again, as it was such a delightful novel.The writing was beautifully lyrical and the magical realism elements didn't overwhelm, they just added fairy dust for lack of a better metaphor.The characters of this novel are the members of the Flores family, the matriarch, Malia, and her husband, Augie, and their three kids - two boys, Dean and Noa, and their little sister, Kaui. Malia and her kids get their points of view in alternate chapters. Through them, we get to know their personalities and views on the family, Hawai'i, their destinies and roles in the family, while they grow up and try to make their way in life, outside the constraints of the family and Hawai'i. It's a story we're all familiar with, but it was brilliantly put together by Strong Washburn. Some of the themes covered are those of family, destiny, old beliefs, socio-economic standing, ambition, the love/hate relationship that one can develop with their place of birth which sometimes can feel claustrophobic.It's also about an old culture that's being swelled up by developers and tourism. There's no way around it, this is an impressive novel, I absolutely loved it.If you're into audiobooks, this was outstanding.NB: I forgot to mention that this was on Obama's Best books of 2020....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Feb 10, 2021","Feb 14, 2021","Feb 10, 2021",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/51846825-sharks-in-the-time-of-saviors

I am generally not a fan of novels based on real people, but this one was impressive.I was familiar with Rudolf Nureyev, who was regarded as one of the greatest male ballet dancers of his generation and had a lasting influence on many male ballet dancers who followed. His name is often mentioned and referenced when it comes to ballet excellence. This novel introduced me to some biographical details. Told via different POVs from people who were close, peripheral to Nureyev, or just imagined, McCann accomplishes to create an ephemeral portrait of someone who was well-known yet a mystery, a complex, extravagant character, with a temper and penchant for drama.I can only imagine how much research and work McCann must have put into this novel. The parts about Russia felt authentic and they reminded me about stories I'd heard or experiences I had as a child growing up in another communist-ruled country, ie food, fuel shortages, electricity blackouts, the propaganda etc. Anyway, I loved this novel and encourage everyone to read it. Many thanks to Candi for bringing Dancer to my attention.NB: excellent audiobook, with many different narrators. I did grumble at the fact that some of the characters were given accents, mostly the Russians when the narrations were in the first person.

I was charmed from the first chapter, but I didn't want to declare my delight early, just in case things went down the drain.Summerwater is made up of chapters written in the stream of consciousness style. Each chapter represents the points of views of several people holidaying in a Scottish cabin park. There's a forty-something woman, who loves running; a couple of teenagers, an elderly couple, a young mother, an engaged young couple and a few kids. All the characters were very realistic and well-drawn. They're ordinary people, with petty grievances, some are tired, depressed, annoyed. The unrelenting rain and the cabin fever makes one go crazy no matter one's circumstances. The lyrical writing was beautifully atmospheric and I could almost smell the rain and feel the humidity in my bones.Some annoying Ukrainians/Romanians/Bulgarians and their loud music and partying irritate many of the people in the cabins close by.

What a brilliant idea to have this most charismatic, intelligent, tormented, ambiguous character spend time in the country that colonised Vietnam, his father's country, a father who had never recognised him. The Committed is a masterclass in writing, with one of the most exquisite unreliable narrators I’ve ever come across. He’s intelligent and well-read, philosophical, self-aware, self-deprecating and immensely funny. I’ve highlighted quite a few paragraphs. Our character epitomizes complexity. His views on colonialism, racism, ideology, Vietnamese people and culture, French people and culture and so many other things blew me away, yet again. Occasionally, I found myself giggling, delighting in the narrator’s observations and cheekiness. While my enjoyment of this novel did dip here and there, the peaks were so many and so high, I have to rate this 5 stars, as it's on another level.

Serenata has just turned 60, her husband, Remington, is 64, a transport engineer, who had to take early retirement. When he announces he wants to do a marathon, Serenata is incredulous, bemused and somewhat irritated by his zeal, which eventually comes to consume his life. What makes things worse for Serenata is that her knees are not co-operating anymore, she really needs knee replacements, but she dreads the pain and being incapacitated.This was my first Shriver novel. It was quite an interesting read, engaging and thought-provoking.The Motion of the Body Through Space is a social commentary on the newfound ""religion"", extreme fitness and to a certain extent the ""wellness"" world, where people spent a huge portion of their time and income drilling their bodies to the point they do more damage than good. This novel is also about ageing, in all its many ""glorious"" ways, especially when it comes to the ways our bodies betray us, no matter how careful and fit we've been.While I generally enjoyed this novel, on some occasions, Shriver's stance on things was way too obvious, especially when it comes to ""political correctness gone mad"".Anyway, I'm not one of those readers who need to love the protagonists of a novel or have identical beliefs with an author in order for me to appreciate the writing. It's good to hear diverse, opposing views, now and then. Shriver is a talented writer, with a fine eye/pen for social commentary.

First of all, I've broken yet again my stance on not reading any more ""girl"" titled books, even though this is a much better title than the two-word ones.Congratulation to Jessie Tu on her debut novel. It's gritty, gutsy, uncomfortable. Sometimes, it verged on the pornographic, as the descriptions of sexual encounters were, well, very detailed. And there's an abundance of them. I probably read erotica that had fewer sex acts. Of course, what's too much, too little, or just enough is a relative, subjective measure. My issue with all the sex, besides the yuck factor, is that it overshadowed the really good things in this novel. Things that made this novel worthwhile reading:- the representation - our narrator is Jenna Lin - a violinist, a former child prodigy, the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants to Australia. At twenty-three, Jenna is back to playing the violin, but in an orchestra, not as a soloist. She reaches to sex with men (they're all rubbish, in very different ways, but nevertheless rubbish) to fill a void. She's got a dark side that propels her to hurt even those few people close to her. Unfortunately, she never reveals herself to anyone, just to us the readers. She's a stunted young adult. Isn't it amazing how some people can be so extraordinary in some ways, yet lack some basic life skills? I so loved the fact that an Asian woman was portrayed in such a non-stereotypical way - well, except for the fact that she plays the violin and she's really good at it.- as a lover of music, including classical music, I enjoyed all the ""shop talk"" - the rehearsing, the music scores, the topic of white men being played all the time, with very few women composers getting through or acknowledged. It's definitely a different world. It takes a lot of talent and even more hard work to make it.I'll keep my eyes out for Jessie Tu's sophomore novel.

Furiously Happy was highly entertaining and well written. Lawson is a clever cookie, with a penchant for drama (to put it mildly) and exaggeration, but the things she comes up with are just kookie - in the best kind of ways. I sometimes felt bad about enjoying this book given the many mental and physical health issues that afflict Lawson. She's not the type of person to ask for pity, just understanding and compassion. Obviously, she's become a very good maker of lemonade out of the lemons life threw her way. She's got one thing that many people don't - the love and support of a husband and extended family and a bunch of good friends. It doesn't hurt that she's financially well-off, so she can afford the many medications and therapy hours she needs. I won't hold that against her.I'm keen to read her Let's Pretend This Never Happened.A huge shoutout to the cover designer and to Lawson for providing this taxidermied racoon, the cutest, funniest looking thing ever.

LucI sometimes think I don't need to read any more feminist books, after all, I'm an unabashed feminist, I keep up with the issues and am very vocal. Luckily, I'm also aware of my limitations, not to mention my incessant need to learn which compel me to read on subjects that I am (relatively) well versed in.I loved this collection of essays. Gay is a prolific consumer of popular culture. I admit I sniggered at some of her favourite things to watch and listen to (ie reality shows, some misogynistic rappers' songs etc). I guess we all have our contradictions and bad taste when it comes to certain things (not me, of course ;-) ). Nobody is perfect, so I shouldn't expect feminists to be everything to everyone, because there's no such thing as the ideal/perfect feminist, people are imperfect. Many essays analyse in great detail some popular culture movies, books, music and musicians and other personalities. Most of them were known to me, ie Hunger Games, Fifty Shades of Gray, The Help, 12 Years a Slave, plus the movies of Tyler Perry and his dubious morality, everyone's favourite director and screenwriter - Tarantino (she gave voice much better to some of the issues I've had with his movies); some rap songs and musicians such as Chris Brown, Taylor the Creator + plus Robin Thicke (they can all go to hell as far as I'm concerned). Of course, the rape culture features greatly throughout the essays.Oh, yeah, Gay also discussed the double standards when it comes to writing by women and how men's writing is universal and women's writing is just for women. As a reader and someone who knows a few writers, I'm well aware of this debate. Basing my opinion on my own reading and paying attention to awards, I believe things are getting much better. It's interesting that I almost never see discussions about men not reading in general, and if they do, they never read fiction. (I sleep with one of those).I appreciated reading Gay's views on intersectional feminism.I think Gay is an easily palatable feminist, as she likes nuance and doesn't come across as ""aggressive"" *Insert sigh and eye-rolling - another one of those adjectives thrown at women for voicing their opinions sternly and with assurance. She's also willing to show herself and to be vulnerable and recognise her failings as a feminist, as a woman, as a human.Anyway, this was right up my alley and I recommend it to everyone....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jan 14, 2021","Jan 15, 2021","Jan 14, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18813642-bad-feminist

Anyway, back to the books.A few observations:-	For the first time ever, I read more books in audio format than in print. It is kind of amazing to think that not even 6 years ago I was grumbling that “consuming audiobooks is not reading” (yes, I roll my eyes at myself for being such a snob). To be honest, I think I’ve developed a bit of an addiction to audiobooks. The only problem is that they compete with my music listening time. They do make me less annoyed about doing chores (only slightly, because I still hate chores). -	A huge shout-out goes to the Western Australian public libraries which provided me with 99% of my audiobooks and also indulged my many requests to purchase new titles.-	While I don’t make plans about what to read, because I’m not inclined that way and I rebel against my own hopes and plans, I would have liked to read at least one of the classics that I’d been meaning to – still plenty of Russians I want to read and I still haven’t read Vonnegut or Orwell.-	My love for Wallace Stegner’s writing grew even more – after reading his Angle of Repose, All the Little Live Things and Remembering Laughter. I don’t have the words to express how much I love his writing.Drum roll for my favourite reads of the year: (in no particular order)-	The Secret Lives of Church Ladies by Deesha Phyliaw-	The Performance by Claire Thomas-	Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi-	Once There Were Wolves by Charlotte McConaghy-	The Paper Palace by Miranda Cowley Heller-	The Labyrinth by Amanda Lohrey-	Angle of Repose, All the Little Live Things by Wallace Stegner-	Beautiful World, Where Are You by Sally Rooney-	Things Are Against Us by Lucy Ellmann-	Leonard and Hungry Paul by Ronan Hession-	Wearing Paper Dressed by Anne Brindsden -	Count the Ways by Joyce Maynard-	Little Scratch by Rebecca Watson.I could easily add at least 10 more titles since I read over 120 books this year, but I don’t want to make this recap longer than necessary.Once again, many thanks to my GR friends, who’ve been a source of inspiration, laughter and everything in between. I love our bookish discussions and not only and even though I don’t know you in person, I truly appreciate you. As always, let’s hope that 2022 will be a better year.

I thought Miriam was under-developed and mostly there as a sex object. In the second half, there's a lot of lesbian sex. It was repetitive and way too descriptive, which felt like a filler.The ending was anti-climatic as well.Worst of all, the writing was simplistic and flat.

As a well-versed contrarian who's known to argue/debate points endlessly, The Land Before Avocado was refreshing as it brought forward statistics and comparisons between the ""back in the day things were better"" pervading statements in the media, conversations and the historical truth, which, spoiler alert!, doesn't support those claims in the least. Glover focuses solely on Australia, which was so incredibly backwards, it's laughable when we look at today's societal norms, way of life, environment etc. Obviously, I know that the older we get, the more we seem to see the past with rose coloured glasses to the point of reinventing history and our lives, but besides being younger, healthier, more attractive, objectively speaking, life and the society have gotten undoubtedly better for everyone, but especially for women, minorities, people with different sexual preferences, religions and so on. Life expectancy has increased by about 12 years in the past four, five decades, if that's not something to be grateful for, I don't know what is. This was quite a timely read and a great reminder that life has its ups and downs and that each generation has had its great challenges and they all thought at the time it was ""the worst time ever""....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 16, 2020","Dec 18, 2020","Dec 16, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/40048349-the-land-before-avocado

Then there's Eloise, who's a professor of hedonics at Harvard. Rowan and Marian are married with two under five girls. Rowan is a principal in a low socio-economic primary school. Marian is a stay-at-home mum dealing with the drudgeries and blessings of modern, unrelating parenting, with no outside help, except for Rowan who was the most loving partner and father. The reunion is yet another opportunity to catch up and to compare and contrast.

I must have read a favourable  somewhere to make me want to read a book about a saint and about Texas, generally speaking, topics of little interest to me.This was an unusual novel, even though I had no expectations. The writing was charming and it kept things interesting. To a degree. Yvette and Yvonne Crawford are identical twin sisters who grew up in Dallas, Texas. Their mother died when they were young. Their gruff, uneducated father struck it lucky with oil on his property in the 1950s. The two sisters couldn't be more different in temperament. Yvette was studious, pious, obsessive, introverted, anxious and anorexic. Yvonne was the superficial social butterfly, the debutante and sorority joiner type. Both girls were lookers. Yvette moves to South America and becomes a nun, whereas Yvonne moves to Paris where she marries a poor baron. She gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl.The title of the novel is deceptive, as most of the novel is written from Yvonne's point of view, with a few letters from Yvette to update us on her goings-on over the years. Yvette's letters didn't feel authentic, as I didn't believe that she would be so forthcoming with certain aspects of her life. I recognised the letters' purpose to give us her perspective. Most of the novel though is about Yvonne. Initially, her sexual exploits and explorations were intriguing, but then they became, I don't know, kind of tedious. I kept reading to see where this unpredictable novel was going. The fresh and playful writing style kept the momentum going. Unfortunately, I never cared much for any of the characters.

But since I claim that the plot is not always what makes or breaks a novel, I thought I'd give it a go, of course, hoping that there was some twist involved.The premise is original in that there is this institution that calls people to let them know they've only got one day left to live. This is the kind of book that makes one wonder if they'd like to know when their time was up and probably imagine how they would react, what they would do. Some people find reading about other people's deaths and tragedies life-affirming. I'm not one of them. This wasn't a bad book, it wasn't the best YA either. Coming to its conclusion, I had to ask myself what was the purpose of this novel, especially why would a teenager want to read it? To see that lots of bad things happen to good people, that life is not fair? Surely someone who's been around to make it to their teens has already noticed those things. To remind them to live life to the fullest? What does that mean, especially for a teen? Anyway, I'm disappointed this wasn't the sweet, uplifting YA novel I was hoping for.

They have two young children and live in LA.This book is made up of diary entries and additional thoughts from February until the middle of the this year.

O'Porter is also grief-stricken as one of her best friends committed suicide. This is about the ups and downs of daily life, of trying to hold it together, dealing with grief, while also appreciating one's privilege and some of the unexpected benefits of the lockdown, such as the opportunity to truly slow down.I liked O'Porter's writing style and she's a terrific narrator.

But then I'm also keen to learn more and, unfortunately, I need to be inspired and prompted now and then, when the wind in my sails seems to wane, which is why I ended up spending almost fourteen hours listening to Sarah narrating her own book.Sarah Wilson is an Amazonian goddess, an objectively beautiful human specimen. She's much more than that, though. She's a thinker, a constant learner, an experimenter, a chance taker. A few years back, you may have come across her under the I Quit Sugar umbrella. She made a hobby project/blog into a very successful business. Instead of following the capitalist model of ""constant growth"" and getting richer and richer, she gave it all up, as selling it to multinationals would have required her to continue to be the face of the movement/business, something that she wasn't willing to do. This book is a call to action, a call to reconnecting to nature, to stopping mindless consumerism, to stepping outside the zeitgeist. She does it through personal anecdotes and stories from many of her hikes through forests, deserts. It references authors, philosophers, environmentalists, artists and everyday people she met along the way. There is enough data to scare the pants off of you, but there's no info-dumping, not that it's anything wrong with that. Sarah Wilson opens us herself to judging by opening up about some very personal, intimate aspects and events of her life. Luckily, as she said ""she doesn't have any more fucks to give about what others think"" and she shouldn't. Isn't that one of the perks of getting a bit older and being comfortable with not being liked by everyone or wanting to be liked by everyone?

Also, there was too much overexplaining, overanalysing, I do that in my life, I'd rather not read it in a novel as well.Mr Robertson, leave some room for the imagination, also, many things are already known and understood to us, we don't need them spoon-fed like we were toddlers. Being in Luke's head the entire novel was no fun, it became tedious and rather annoying in the end.Thank goodness it was a relatively short novel....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,Oct 2020,"Oct 10, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52162563-how-to-save-a-life

When I spotted the newly added library audiobook I jumped at the opportunity to listen to it.I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the humour to make an appearance. It never did. I was expecting irreverence, some shocking behaviours and observations, a la Fleabag, those never occurred. I got annoyed with myself for (partially) falling for the marketing. While the novel itself is readable, the writing was, for the most part, flat and, occasionally, jumpy. I wondered if it was intentional, since the narrator, Martha suffers from an undisclosed mental/mood/personality disorder - which remains unnamed. Speaking of the disorder, I both admired and got annoyed that it was kept a mystery. The wanna-be doctor in me needs diagnosis, even though I understood that Mason didn't want to put the spotlight on a particular disease, but on being misdiagnosed and the suffering that affects not only the patient but everyone close. The last quarter picked up the pace and my dopamine levels surged. The resolution was satisfying.In conclusion, I wanted to love Sorrow and Bliss more than I did.

Fifty year old, Raynor and her husband of thirty-something years, Moth, lose their house/farm due to a very bad investment, so they find themselves homeless, or better said, without a home. Their kids are students and are apparently unable to help them. On top of that, and more importantly, Moth is diagnosed with an incurable, degenerative disease. So what are they to do? Instead of waiting for government housing and asking friends for help, they decided to walk 640 miles along the South West Coast path, camping along the way.I must say, when they were struggling to eat or afford a 3-pound ferry ticket, I wondered how hard could have been for their two grown kids to put together a 100 pound and help their parents. There's pride but surely when one's hungry and unwell, one's pride takes a break? But other than me being judgy about a couple of things, I thought it was an enjoyable book. Winn is a good writer. I appreciated that it wasn't saccharinely sentimental, there weren't too many grandiose pronouncements and it wasn't a ""this is how you do it"" kind of book. Coincidentally, today, as it's tradition, we watched a movie (they release lots of good movies on the 26th Dec in Australia). The movie is Nomadland, about a widowed woman, in her late 50s, early 60s, who's destitute, lives in a crappy van, picking up minimum wage jobs along the way. Not an uplifting movie, but a touching one. Another reminder about how easy things can turn horribly wrong.Hugs to all....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Oct 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38085814-the-salt-path

Then it took me a little longer to organise in my head who was related to whom, as the characters and their backgrounds were introduced. This novel doesn't say anything new - families and people are complicated, little things can build up into bigger issues and resentment. Mistakes are made, things are said or left unsaid. Love is the answer, stories are important. I generally like this kind of stories and for the most part, I did enjoy this short novel. What bugged me the most was the nonlinear structure. It's something one comes along in pretty much every other novel, but in this novel, it was a few weeks back, some months, one-two years before, it was all over the place and unnecessary, in my opinion.

It's a small book which I found extremely compelling.First of all, I had no idea what flash fiction was, but whatever the definition is, I liked it. A lot.This book resonated with me on a personal level, as I am a Romanian child of the 70s, so many of the stories, descriptions, foods, rituals, behaviours, social and work relations were very familiar.I thought van Llewyn accomplished so much with so little. The structure worked incredibly well to put together a jigsaw puzzle of life in Communist Romania, to make up a picture that was pretty realistic, simple yet complex. I couldn't stop asking myself whether my assessment was objective, even knowing there is no such thing as objectivity when it comes to any form of art. I've been told that I can be harsher or too critical when it comes to anything Romanian. It's complicated. I loathe nationalism/patriotism and while I am not ashamed to be a Romanian, I also don't feel pride. I like to think I'm more than geography, while also having the geography in my blood, to a certain extent. I am happy that I got to experience some Communism but was lucky to be a teen when it ended so I didn't get brainwashed. I can smell propaganda like a bloodhound. Anyway, what I'm trying to say in my convoluted, unedited way, is that I believe this is an objectively good book. There is one magical element to the story, which didn't quite work for me, even though I understood it served a purpose and added a bit of quirk to a bleak story.So, yeah, I'm glad I read Bottled Goods and I'm grateful to Deanna for bringing it to my attention.I hope this book finds a bigger readership and I'm looking forward to reading more from Sophie van Llewyn (I'm guessing it's a pen name as it's not Romanian in the least)....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Sep 24, 2020","Sep 24, 2020","Sep 24, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38720267-bottled-goods

I had no qualms and made no moral judgements towards their arrangement. But I did find Ava and her paramours uninteresting and boring.

If there is such a thing as perfection, this novel came pretty close to it.The prose is lyrical, atmospherical and truly beautiful, so I knew early on I was going to like this novel. That was all good and dandy, but will the plot be realistic enough and melodrama free, in order for me to truly love this novel? As you can tell from my high rating, I had no issues with how things unfolded. Franny Stone is broken and bereft. But she's also determined to track the last migratory birds left on earth- the Arctic tern. The Last Migration (or Migrations for the North American readers) managed that rare literary feat: high-quality prose with an interesting plot. The way McConaghy unpeeled Franny's history was masterful. I understood her and came to care about her a great deal. I am in awe of McConaghy's talent, how she managed to write a book about the environmental crisis without being preachy. My contrary/annoying personality demands more from books that appeal to my biases and convictions and this novel just mesmerised me. The Last Migration is one of my favourite reads of the year.

A great deal of the plot happens in Vilnius, Lithuania and I found that fascinating. I would love to visit the three Baltic countries - Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Look at me dreaming about travelling ... It's difficult to articulate why I love Thorpe's writing so much. On the surface, the writing is not overly lyrical and obviously crafted to impress literary fiction connoisseurs. Thorpe's writing flows easily, the reader is not burdened with deciphering style and fancy literary devices which sometimes can put a distance between the reader and the characters. These characters are as real as they come, ordinary yet very interesting. I also loved how Thorpe structured the story. It's mostly narrated by Lucas, an English college teacher, thirty-five, who's trying hard to better his relationship with his seventeen-year-old, Vera, whom he fathered when eighteen. There's a lot of guilt and awkwardness. Vera is super intelligent and sees through people's BS. As it turns out, she's also mentally unwell. We find out Vera's thoughts through her emails to her boyfriend and through some of her Word documents. I thought that was clever.A trip to Vilnius, Lithuania gives the father and daughter the opportunity to become closer, while also allowing Lucas to track down some of his beloved grandmother's life.

In the past three years, I read quite a few novels written by young female authors, about young female protagonists, where sex acts are quite explicit, so the novelty and the shock factor waned. It seems to be the new trend - no holds barred, so we'd better get used to it. The main character of this novel is twenty-three year old Edie, who's black and an artist. She feels lost and untethered. She starts dating a much older, married man, Eric. She expects, wants very little.And then she moves in with Eric, his wife and their adopted black daughter, Akila. It's quite a weird situation. Edie is horribly lonely, she misses her parents, now dead, and just wants to be noticed and to matter. Like all of us. Race, sex, class, relationships are just some of the themes that Leilani navigates in this impressive debut novel.

I'm not one of those. I'm more interested in characterisations, atmosphere and the overall writing style - which, as I've come to expect from John Banville, were top notch. It's a bonus if I don't find any gaping plot holes - there were none. It's 1957, Ireland. Detective Inspector St. John Strafford is sent to a small village in County Wexford to investigate the gruesome murder of a Catholic priest. He was the guest of a retired protestant colonel who lived in a big, old mansion. St John a was an interesting main character, not your stereotypical smoker, drink-to-oblivion kind of detective.Banville affords us a glimpse of the era - the divisions between the Catholics and the Protestants that penetrated every aspect of life and the overwhelming influence of the Catholic church in all aspects of life.The novel has a good, steady pace, in keeping with the times, the era, and the season. I could easily picture the characters and the locations, I could feel the cold and the gloom.The only thing that I found jarring was a small chapter from the deceased priest's point of view, I thought it was random and unnecessary, and I say that as someone who enjoys hearing from unreliable characters.

The Girls of Corona del Mar is about the friendship of two girls from the Californian town, you've guessed it, Corona del Mar. Mia is the narrator of this novel. She loves her best friend, Lorrie Anne, who’s extremely beautiful, but also kind, sweet and innocent, all the things Mia thinks she lacks. Their friendship is the opposites-attract kind. Even their family situations seem at odds – Mia’s family is complicated as her mum is an alcoholic, with two young boys from her second marriage, whom she doesn’t parent very well. Lorrie Anne’s family seems to be wholesome, loving, and artistic. But their luck seems to change, as Lorrie Anne is struck by a series of tragedies. I love friendship stories. This was a good story, albeit imperfect, as occasionally I questioned the likeliness of Mia knowing so many details about events that had happened in Lorrie Anne’s life, even though I understand having a first-person narrator is limiting in that way. Do we ever truly know anyone, when even a similar lived experience can be interpreted and felt in a different way? These are some of the questions to ponder. It’s probably unfair to compare The Girls of Corona del Mar, a debut novel, to the exquisite The Knockout Queen, a third novel, but we all do it.

It had a distinct tone and it certainly painted a vivid picture of the Caribbean Island. The title, the cover and its setting might make you think this is an escapist read. Far from it. We hear from three different characters: Betty Ramdin, now a widower, whose husband was an abusive drunk. Mr Chetan is a closeted gay man, a teacher, who ends up renting a room with Ms Betty. He's kind, likes to cook and becomes a father figure for Betty's son, Solo. Solo is the third character whose point of view we get to hear. Persaud looks at love in its many shapes - amorous, filial, familial, and anything in between.

There are several things that IThe Survivors is Jane Harper's fourth novel and it's yet another well realised, beautifully written literary thriller. There are several things that I loved about this novel: the descriptions were incredible, it was very easy to picture the locations, the vibe of the place. The small seaside town of Evelyn Bay, Tasmania - a made-up location - was easy to imagine. The characterisations and the backstories were excellent, they added layer upon layer to the mystery, they took us on sidetracks, as the genre demands, but it was all smooth sailing as everything was plausible, nothing was amiss, I couldn't find any plot holes, always a bonus as far as I'm concerned.If you need to know about the plot here's the blurb: ""Kieran Elliott's life changed forever on the day a reckless mistake led to devastating consequences. The guilt that still haunts him resurfaces during a visit with his young family to the small coastal town he once called home.Kieran's parents are struggling in a community which is bound, for better or worse, to the sea, that is both a lifeline and a threat. Between them all is his absent brother, Finn. When a body is discovered on the beach, long-held secrets threaten to emerge. A sunken wreck, a missing girl, and questions that have never washed away...""

It's not that I didn't enjoy comedy when I was younger - I grew up watching Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Norman Wisdom and a few others, but I never intentionally sought it. As you can tell from my list, all those comedians are men. I never got to watch Lucille Ball or any of the other female comedians.These days, I make it a priority to watch female comedians.I still remember stumbling upon Ali Wong's Netflix special ""Baby Cobra"" and feeling like I was about to die because I was laughing so hard, I couldn't breathe. I just couldn't believe her candour, her straightforwardness, her crassness - and all that coming from a tiny heavily pregnant Asian woman. I had to tell the world to go watch her special. Needless to say, I watched her second Netflix special (still awesome) and the movie she wrote/co-produced (average). I was curious to read this memoir. It still has some of the explicit sexual description and other things that could be considered crass - at this point, it's still her MO. But it some had insights into her relationships and life prior to becoming famous.It was a nice surprise to hear her husband, Justin Hakuta, tell a bit of his story at the end of the book. I confess I was wondering about him, thinking wow, he must be a special kind of man - first of all, he was in a relationship with a female comedian! Second, he's talked about and made fun of in every stand-up special. Third, he gave up his job/career to support Ali and to look after their daughters - is that some kind of mystical creature? He sounds like a smart, kind, woke man, who didn't let cultural background and social norms and expectations dictate his life. Anyway, I'm not one to praise men for taking the trash out or for ""babysitting"" their own kids (insert huge eye roll) if you know what I mean, just thought I'd mention it because I liked what I was hearing. Here's hoping their relationship survives.I'm glad I took the time to listen to this. Ali is a dynamo.

Stella is a bit of a goody-two-shoes, who's obsessed with self-help books and therefore thinks she knows it all and that she should help the people. Except that people are much more complicated and don't quite fit under the self-help labels. I liked her. I was intrigued by her rambunctious sister. Except for Stella, all the other characters were underdeveloped. Especially the parents, I didn't quite buy their actions, and interactions, they didn't feel real to me. Adoption, gambling addiction, depression, poverty are some of the themes addressed in this novel.Unfortunately, in my view, this novel was half baked and needed some polishing. I didn't hate it, but it didn't have the emotional impact that I've come to expect from Henry-Jones' writing. Here's hoping the next novel will be more to my liking....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Jul 16, 2020","Jul 16, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/52541662-how-to-grow-a-family-tree

It also introduced the reader to the Wiradjuri language, one of the many Indigenous languages and dialects in Australia - many of which had disappeared. I am ashamed to say that I don't know any words in the language of the native people in my area - the Noongar people. None of my Aussie born friends and acquaintances know any words either, unfortunately, many of them wouldn't even learn it had they had the opportunity - but that's another topic ...The novel unfolds via three different characters: August Gondiwindi, who returns from England to Masacre Plains for her grandfather's funeral - Poppy Gondiwindi, whose point of view introduces us to another period in history. The third narrative is via letters written in 1915 by a German reverend, who established an Aboriginal mission in Massacre Plains. Through his letters, we bear witness to the atrocities committed by the whites, whose intense hatred and extreme cruelties made the reverend doubt his faith in God. Poppy Gondiwindi, an elder in the community, was working to preserve the Wiradjuri language and to find artefacts that would stop that mining development in Massacre Plains that threatened their home and farm. His story is strewn with pain and suffering but also resilience and hope.The Yield shows us the effects of intergenerational trauma, dispossession, abuse, and language loss. Self-determinism is empowering. Having your own language is essential.This is a complex novel that can be analysed for hours. I'm going to recommend it to lots of people.Congratulations to Tara June Winch on receiving so many awards and the well-deserved recognition for her hard work and talent....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Jul 11, 2020","Jul 18, 2020","Jul 11, 2020",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/53475204-the-yield

She’s thirty-one, lives in a smelly, tiny potting shed, works as a waitress, has huge debts and is chased by collection agencies. She’d recently lost her beloved mother so grief is still at its peak. She’s been working on her novel for six years. She’s stuck, can’t sleep, and has some health scares. Men tend to complicate her life as well. The poor Casey, nothing is going well for her. But what is one to do but put one step in front of the other. While I never had any aspirations to become a writer, King’s novel felt authentic. She takes a few jabs at male writers, which, of course, I loved. The thing about the male authors' photos vs the female writers' cracked me up because I noticed those things myself. The only thing that disconcerted me was that the novel was set in the 1990s and I only realised that in the second half of the novel. Yes, there are typewriters, writing on paper, riding a banana seat bike – but I thought it was just artists being unconventional. It wasn’t a big deal, it didn’t distract from the story.

Anyway... this wasn't bad. I appreciated the fact that our lead character was a sixty-four-year-old policewoman, on her last working days before retirement. When she's offered/pushed into earlier than anticipated retirement, she gets to pick a cold case as a last hurrah. She settles on the apparent suicide of a Russian refugee a year prior. Was it a suicide or a crime?Interspersed into this novel, there are chapters from two different characters, a young single mother in the 1960s and another from a young woman who turns out to be someone only mentioned for the first time towards the end of this novel. I found those chapters a bit confusing and, in my view, unnecessary, especially since they pulled me out of the story. While I never intentionally try to discover who's the criminal, I had guessed pretty early into this novel, which gives me less contentment than you'd expect.

It's ""only"" taken half a year for me to get that special kind of giddiness that comes along when I read something that enchants me, surprises and/or delights me. Lucy Ellmann's Mimi is that kind of book. Had I not read and loved Ellmann's epic Ducks, Newsburyport, I probably wouldn't have considered this book. After all, it's not very popular or highly rated. Such a shame because it's on another level. Plot-wise, this is relatively simple. But it's the writing, the tone, the strong female characters that just make this novel a stand-out. Harrison Hanafan is the narrator of this novel. He's a fifty-year-old, affluent, plastic surgeon. He's a bachelor, who lives in a very nice apartment in the Garment District, New York. He's just gotten out of a five-year relationship with a pretentious, preposterous New York socialite. It's New Year's Eve, he is home alone with a sprained ankle and feels terribly lonely. He's got too much time on his hands, too much thinking going on. His only living relative, his sculptress sister, Bee, lives in England. Their relationship is very warm and loving, although they're very different people.Unexpectedly, Harrison falls in love with a woman who's not his type. She's a formidable woman, quite the feminist. She's far from perfect physically speaking. She's close to his age, again, not really his type. I was bemused and perplexed by their relationship, if I'm being honest, I thought it was wishful thinking on Ellmann's part, but it's fiction, one can dream, right? A few lists, music scores, letters, manifestos and other interesting tidbits appear in this novel, especially in the Appendix. Lots of little things and details delighted me. The language is playful and extremely clever. Also, this is an unapologetically feminist novel. In this case, it didn't bother me in the least that it was so obvious and it preached to my convictions, things that bugged me in other novels. I guess the devil is in the detail.

As far as this novel is concerned, such grievances, while present, were quickly mellowed down by the story.What I loved about this novel:- it informed me about dictionaries, something ubiquitous, that I've used for decades, something I took for granted, never questioning or realising the extraordinary effort and amount of work involved in compiling it. - it reinforced that there is no such thing as a ""bad"" word, that there is and there was sexism even when it comes to words. It reminded me of a discussion I had with my French sister-in-law about sexism and the patriarchy. She told me that the French for vagina - le vagin - is a masculine noun. - it also made me think of the women who contributed and worked hard for the Oxford Dictionary, women who hadn't been recognised nor acknowledged. Behind every great man, hell, behind every man there's at least one woman if not several, who took on the mind-numbing, time-consuming domestic tasks, including rearing their heirs, which in turn allowed them to thrive, think, contemplate, invent, make, and rule the world. - I quite liked the bits about the suffragettes' movement, albeit it took a backseat.Why I didn't give this novel 5 stars? The first person narration, from the point of Esme, was a bit flat. Esme came across as a passive character, which is fine, in some ways, it matches the era, her upbringing, but I don't know, I just never fully warmed or cared about her in a visceral way. I quite enjoyed the letters from Edith Thomson, Esme's godmother in the book, a real person, who contributed thousands of quotations for many years. To conclude my ramblings, this book gets 3.5 for the writing, character development and plot but 5 stars for what it brings to the forefront and the research work undertaken to write this book (I highly recommend reading the Author's note)....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Mar 10, 2021","Mar 15, 2021","Jun 19, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49354511-the-dictionary-of-lost-words

But so many were reading it and raving about it, I felt compelled to read it myself, after all, there's always room for improvement and learning. Also, I found the title provoking. After reading the book, I think it's the perfect title.“If, as a white person, I conceptualize racism as a binary and I place myself on the “not racist” side, what further action is required of me? No action is required, because I am not a racist. Therefore, racism is not my problem; it doesn’t concern me and there is nothing further I need to do. This worldview guarantees that I will not build my skills in thinking critically about racism or use my position to challenge racial inequality.”I love it when a book teaches me and challenges the status quo. This book managed to do that and more.  I've learnt a few things (in no particular order): - race, like gender, is a social construct.- If you're white, you were socialised in a racist system that benefits you. It's not your fault, it is what it is, but one should recognise it, without the pointless guilt, and educate themselves and actively challenge and work against racism. - There's a distinction between racism and prejudice, many of us conflate the two. We are all prejudiced, have biases and blindspots. - Saying and believing you don't see colour is BS. - Racism is adaptive - just because there are no lynchings and cross burnings - it doesn't mean that racism has disappeared.- White women stop your/our freaking tears!- It's not the job of people of colour to teach us about racism and how to be antiracist. They've been telling us for hundreds of years, there's a plethora of information available, it's our/your job to seek it, consume it, learn from it and take action.- For those white people, and not only, who claim ""reverse racism""- “People of color may also hold prejudices and discriminate against white people, but they lack the social and institutional power that transforms their prejudice and discrimination into racism; the impact of their prejudice on whites is temporary and contextual. Honestly, there was so much to ponder and learn from this book. As far as I'm concerned - this is a MUST READ book. I know, it's not the only one.

I'm so happy to say that I ate this audiobook up, I didn't even skip the chapter on faith and religion. Julia Baird's writing captivated me from the very first page. She came across as genuine, non-preachy, not a know-it-all while also being very knowledgeable and interested in lots of different things. I'm fascinated by other people's preoccupation/obsession with all sort of things - basically, I find people who have interests/hobbies very interesting. While it had personal details, Phosporescence was in no way a look-at-me - how - wonderful - am -I kind of book. It was mostly a reminder, a strong encouragement to appreciate the little things, to be awed by things, moments, and, most importantly, to be present and live consciously. As a survivor of cancer who endured complicated treatment and surgeries, Baird had to face her mortality. As for the author, Julia Baird is a well-respected journalist, presenter on the ABC (Australian Broadcast Corp), I've been following her on Twitter for a while. It's obvious she's very intelligent and eloquent. While she's a person with faith, she's also a feminist who campaigned for women to have more prominent roles in the church. I personally find those two sides hard to reconcile, but that's because I'm lacking imagination and other things. Sorry for being superficial, but aren't the cover and the title stunning?

It is the quintessential book club novel as it's topical and informative while also having enough secrets and a variety of characters to make it a page-turner.While I was aware of ""passing"" for white by people of colour and the inherent favouring of lighter shades, I never came across it in my reading journey. So kudos to Bennett for bringing it to our attention. Having identical twins follow two different paths - one living as a white - the other one marrying a darker man and birthing a very dark child - juxtaposes brilliantly (the American) racism. Add to that class and privilege and you've got a very interesting story.While I appreciated the plot and the issues presented, the writing style kept me at a distance, I never felt emotionally invested.

Isn't it interesting how the older we get the more sympathetic, understanding we are towards our parents? Having our own kids, relationships allow us to see our parents in a different light. Enright balanced the narrative between Norah's childhood memories and the young adult's very well, there's melancholy, admirations, vexation while also attempting to put together the puzzle her mother was.

I lWhen I was offered the opportunity to read John Boyne’s upcoming novel I immediately said “Yes, please!”, I didn’t need to know anything about it. I loved his A Ladder to the Sky and The Heart’s Invisible Furies.So I started reading it without having any idea what to expect. I got startled a bit, thinking it’d be a Jesus/Christian parable, reinterpretation etc. , soon to realise that it wasn’t. Phew. It was slightly confusing in the beginning, it didn't take long to get the gist of it. Our unnamed hero traverses time and countries, the novel spans over two millennia. I was pleasantly surprised to see a chapter on Romania, with accurate names and historical context for that era. Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to charm me and keep me engaged. I found myself avoiding getting back to it, never a good sign. Boyne used this device to show that people are the same, they have similar struggles, aspirations for love, safety, health, happiness etc. Jumping through time, we also get to see how society progresses, painfully slow, when it comes to many aspects such as women’s rights, war, tribalism etc. Certain well known historical figures make an appearance. A Traveller at the Gates of Wisdom reminded me of Matt Haig’s How to Stop Time. Unfortunately, while it preached to my convictions, I wasn’t captivated by this novel, it was a bit too obvious for my liking and I could feel Boyne’s presence throughout, which prevented my full immersion into the main character's epic journey, I ended up just going with the flow, without actually caring for our protagonist.While this novel wasn’t my cup of coffee, I’m looking forward to reading Boyne’s next project.I’ve received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for my honest .

It makes them psychotic and unreasonable.The main character and narrator of this novel is Jean, a middle-aged park guide. She's got a drinking/smoking problem, is foul-mouthed, and a bit of a mess, to put it kindly. She looks after her granddaughter, Kimberley, while her mother, Jean's de-facto former daughter in law, runs the animal park. The zooflu seems to have taken over the entire country.

As far as I'm concerned, Soren and Kingsley lost whatever allure they might have had in the past. It's possible I outgrew them.

The current climate doesn’t do anything for my literature reading mojo, still, I pushed myself to read this. I loved the plot and the concept of this book and how Backman brought everyone’s stories together.Yet again, Backman’s understanding of human nature shines through. Everybody has a story, everybody hurts and most people have anxieties, ranging from daily life anxieties to the more serious kind. There’s suicide, suicide attempts, grief, trauma, loneliness, relationship breakdown, and self-loathing. All these serious aspects are well balanced out by humour, be it observational or situational. As I read on, my enjoyment and appreciation of this novel grew exponentially. I don’t know what it is about Backman’s books, they just make me soft. For whatever reason, I never resent him for doing that to me. Backman’s books are always killing me softly.So, get anxious people, in the exciting kind of way, this upcoming novel is another fantastic read from Fredrik Backman.

He’s an excellent observer of his surroundings and pretty apt when it comes to characterisations. This book seeps with passion – passion for nature, landscape, and knowledge.

Joe Allston takes everything personally when it comes to Jim - his dishevelled appearance, his speech, his motorcycle - everything is an affront. Joe resents the young man even more, as he gives in and allows him to set camp on a part of his land that was unused.

Yes, he wrote some books, but you can borrow them from the library or just watch the many youtube videos available.

Her paternal grandmother, Genevieve London is the other important character, whose point of view we hear often. She's eighty-five and reconnects with Emma and her great-grandaughter, Riley, on account of wanting them close by as she's dying from a brain tumour, or so she claims. There's bad history, grievances and miscommunication that have built up over the years. Of course, nobody is regret-free. Because we get both Emma's and Genevieve's perspectives, we understand their reasons for their actions and views. We even hear from Emma's absent and self-involved father. This was a very realistic novel, with characters that were very well fleshed out. If anything, and I can't believe I'm saying this, this was a bit too realistic, there were too many feelings, too much explaining and justification, it read like one huge shrink session. Most of us are in touch with our feelings and have a greater understanding of why certain behaviours occur - ie a lonely child, who's emotionally damaged is likely to misbehave, be clingy etc. We've read the books, seen the movies, some of us even had the shrink sessions. We get it - we don't need it all on a platter, which is what this novel is - one huge bento box, where several characters' feelings are neatly arranged for our consumption.Other than that, it's a perfectly good looking bento box, with palatable and familiar foods on it.

Unfortunately, she perished in a fire in the warehouse where the copies of her sophomore novel were being kept before publishing in 1939. Only a few fragments remained. These fragments and other objects related and belonging to Inga Karlson are part of an exhibition that opened in 1986 at the Art Galery in Brisbane, Australia.Caddie Walker is a twenty-something bookseller in Brisbane. She's obsessed with Inga Karlson's novel, knows the book by heart and has read everything and anything on the famous writer. While waiting in line to enter the exhibition, she meets an older lady, who was feeling unsteady. When the lady says a line that seemed to sound like it belonged to Inga Karlson, Caddie is puzzled. The old woman's name is Rachel Leiher.The Fragments is told in alternate chapters and points of view - one is Caddie's in 1986 Brisbane, the other POV belongs to Rachel Leiher, in the 1930s New York and Pennsylvania. Caddie is on a quest to find out the old lady and to discover the cause of the fire Inga Karlson perished in. I'll leave it at that, for fear of spoilers.This was enjoyable enough, even though at times I thought Caddie was too gullible, I guess those flaws led to the novel's main conflict.

In a world where so many have no qualms when it comes to airing their dirty laundry, I respect Rowe's restraint, even though I feel I didn't get to discover ""the real Mike Rowe"" - which I acknowledge, it's a ridiculous concept/expectation.I loved how he integrated famous people's unknown or less known facts with some of his life's events.

I added it to my TBR a year ago, it didn't even have a cover at the time. For me, there is no other writer like Ferrante. I've read many books about adolescents, most of them tend to be on the cutesy, sentimental, even purist side, especially if the main character is female. Ferrante's teenage girls are raw, contrary, angsty, challenging and not necessarily sweet. They're complex and complicated, good and bad.Twelve-year-old Giovanna, raised in an intellectual, middle-class household realises that she'd been lied to by her parents, whom she used to idealise. Her father's off-hand comment triggers her insecurities and the search for a long-lost aunt.Many of the themes in the Neapolitan novels reappear: class, double standards, education as a means for social mobility, the use of language as an indicator of socio-economic status, complicated familial relations, the loss of innocence, adults hypocrisy. At times, you'll be made uncomfortable by the rawness, uncensored thoughts, especially when it comes to sex. I don't recall any other authors writing about the duality of feeling aroused while also finding the sex prelude, the male appendage not as appealing as one imagined based on novels, movies, drawings (this novel takes place in the 1990s). Ferrante's writing speaks to my heart and mind like no one else's. I shall miss Giovanna, just like I missed Lena and Lila.

The story moves back and forward in time, between several characters, showing snippets of their lives, conversations, memories, recollections.The writing style gave this novel a dream-like quality. Occasionally I struggled with this novel as it took a couple of phrases or more to find out whose pov we were reading, so I think that jerked me awake and pulled me out of the story.While there were issues of class and race, it wasn't an overtly militant or political novel, even though it mentions the Tusla massacre and a few other incidents.

They are the nicest people, kind and unassuming, living the American dream in the 1960s. Their two sons and daughter are nice people as well. When tragedy strikes and the eldest son Danny dies, his younger brother, Ian, blames himself. Depression and guilt entrap him. His saving grace is the Church of the Second Chance, which shows him that he should atone in practical ways, not just with meaningless words. So he drops out of college and becomes the carer and guardian of his two nieces and one nephew, who had become orphans.As always, Anne Tyler crafts very realistic characters.

The first time around, I just couldn't get into it - I put it down to not being in the right mood, although it was puzzling as I adore Opera and I'm keen on Latin anything and I had enjoyed Patchett's writing before.For what it's worth, I wasn't as enchanted with Anna Fields' delivery. I hope this audiobook is reissued, with a better production - I mean you have opera, you have all kind of languages, bullets - it could be an enhanced experience. Whenever a certain aria was mentioned, I found myself singing it, although it hurt my own ears, it's torture for those who hear me. I did get used to the narrator, as one does. As the novel progressed and we got to know some of the characters, I was completely taken with the story. I could easily picture the location, the characters, their interactions. I know this has been made into a movie and I'm kind of desperate to get my hands on it, see what they've done with it.So what is this about?In an unidentified Latin American country, a group of insurgents assail the vice-president's house where a big party was taking place. They were hoping to kidnap the president, who was absent, therefore they find themselves in a situation they didn't prepare for. After releasing the women, the kids and the workers, the insurgents and the fifty-nine others are locked up inside a beautiful mansion while the police were waiting outside. The inhabitants are people from many parts of the world: Japanese, Italians, Germans, Russians, locals, and the renowned American soprano, Roxanne Coss.My favourite characters were the Japanese men: a rich businessman, who's obsessed with opera, Katsumi Hosokawa, and his interpreter, Gen Watanabe. They were classy, dignified and very intelligent. I appreciated that Patchett chose to portray most of the terrorists as more than just jungle rats. To have even the most uneducated brought to their knees by the power of opera was music to my ears and heart. As it's been established, Patchett writes characters incredibly well. She's at her best in this novel.

The narrator is seven months pregnant with her/their second baby when she discoveres her husband was cheating on her with a friend. Besides my automatic sympathy for anyone in the sisterhood who's been wronged, it was difficult to take it too seriously - it was all upper-middle-class, superficial, mostly happening in the gossipy Washington circles or in New York.

I love his writing!The Spectator Bird is narrated by Joe Alston, a depressed, morose, seventy-year-old, retired literary agent. He lives with his devoted wife, Ruth, in Northern California. Their life is quiet and he seems to be happier with just staying home reading rather than socialising. There's a more exciting, distracting episode relating to the couple's visit to Denmark twenty years prior when Joe attempted to track down his roots of his Danish-born mother, while recuperating from illness. They rent a room in the house of mysterious countess Astrid, a striking woman, down on her luck. While spending time with her, they find out about her family's strange history and a few other things. The indignities of ageing, long marriage, grief, depression, making choices vs just falling into things are some of the prevalent themes of this relatively quiet novel.This novel was published forty-two years ago.

Khai, a twenty-six-year-old Vietnamese American man (or is it American Vietnamese - I get confused about these labels) is on the Autism spectrum. His mum is desperate for him to marry, so because there are no single women left in the USA ;-), she decides to go shopfind him one in Vietnam, her birth country. When in the toilet of a fancy hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, she comes across My, who was cleaning the toilets. And because cleaners talk to patrons *insert eye-rolling - and because, Khai's mum noticed how the young woman arranged the tissue box - apparently, a testament of one's good character - *more eye-rolling - she decides after a five-minute conversation that this young woman would make a perfect wife for her son. After all, what mum doesn't dream for her boy(s) to marry a cleaning woman? ;-) I must have forgotten, it seems class issues and prejudices are so last century. Apparently, obtaining a visa to the USA is easy-peasy, so May leaves her young daughter with her mum and grandmother and arrives in San Fran where she begins living with poor Khai, who agrees to be friendly with her for three months, to get his mum off his back. Early into her stay, she disturbs his routines and gives him constant boners. Yes, it's natural and all that, but it was mentioned ad-nauseam. For someone supposedly shy and unassuming, My sure takes charge quickly, she begins gardening, arranging things around the house as if it were hers, and cooking. Speaking of cooking, somehow, without going shopping, My has ingredients available to make soup when Khai was only eating protein bars and heating up one of the many take-away foods his mum stuffed into his fridge. What can I say, I pick on this kind of things, editors should have as well.Also, little Miss Innocence starts wearing his t-shirts and boxer shorts without asking, because that's what people do, right? ;-) Oh, and they have to sleep in the same bed, with no touching, because ... just because. So many eye-rolling moments, explanations, misunderstandings.Oh, another thing that had me perplexed - Khai could understand Vietnamese but wasn't speaking it much. Somehow young My has learnt English by watching American movies. Because it's that simple, right?This was riddled with many incongruences, cliches, the inner monologues were irritating as hell. I never felt anything about either character, their chemistry didn't ring true, and My was manipulative and bland, which would have been ok had she not been supposed to be Miss Goody-Two-Shoes.The Bride Test is a half baked, badly written novel, that suffers the curse of the second novel.

Set in 1976, in Odessa, Texas, during an oil boom, the novel's nucleus is the brutal rape of a fourteen-year-old Mexican girl by a twenty-something Caucasian oil rig worker. When she escapes, she stumbles upon the heavily pregnant Mary Rose, who lives on a cattle farm with her daughter and husband. The story comes together via the narrative of different women in town: Mary Rose, who's about to give birth; then there's the recently widowed, Corrine, who used to be a teacher. Another character is Debra Anne, ten years old. She's a bit of a loner, riding around the neighbourhood on her bike. Her mother had left the family and the father works long hours on the oil rigs. There are a few other characters who are given less time in the novel.I love this kind of stories, where different characters' stories and paths come together. If it's about women, I'm even more interested. The novel deals with some heavy themes: rape, racism, misogyny, patriarchal norms, the adverse effects of the economic boom. In saying all that, my eagerness to return to this novel was up and down.

Autumn, Winter, Spring featured among my favourite reads in their respective publishing years. I was greatly anticipating reading this last instalment. Many thanks to Penguin UK for approving me for this eARC. Smith continues to bewitch us with her language play, observations, quirky characters, historical recollections, thoughts on art, the environment, political climate. Truthfully, the novel sagged a bit in the middle and there were some bits that didn’t contribute much and left me asking questions.Also, nitpicking here, while it serves to propel the narrative, it didn’t make sense that young people, not even relatives, would visit Daniel Gluck, now 104 year old, during the COVID lockdown. Despite my small discontents, this novel is on another level. My favourite parts were those about Grace Greenlaw, a single mother of two precocious, know-it-all kids - Sacha, a sixteen-year-old environmentalist, and her brother, Robert, a moulding, inquisitive, creative, very intelligent, and antagonistic thirteen year old. I also loved Sacha’s letters to Hero, a Vietnamese refugee who was held in a detention centre.As in the previous seasons, we are introduced to a (relatively) unknown female artist, this time, it’s the Italian Lorenza Mazzetti, a director, writer, painter. Her 1956 film “Together” is referenced several times. I plan to watch it this evening. If you’re interested, here’s a link: https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/w....

There's also a Catholic priest and two siblings who believe in aliens. Religion and aliens are definitely not on my favourites list. The amazing thing is that I enjoyed this novel very much. Incredibly enough, it's not preachy! Also, there's a good dose of healthy questioning of god and a few Christian concepts. Kudos to Matthew Quick's phenomenal talent and kind mind. This has been the third novel by Quick that I read. Each and every one was different in style, plot and characters. His novels have something in common - quirky characters, all outliers because of different reasons. In this case, Bartholomew Neil is a thirty-nine years old virgin, who has never had a job and who has lived all his life with his mum. He was bullied at school and called names, including ""retard"". He likes to write things in a notebook. He also likes going to church and spends numerous hours at the library, where he's watching a librarian, who he surreptitiously fell in love with, although he never dares talk to her. He's named her ""Girbrarian"". How cute is that!Following his mum's death, Bartholomew discovers in his mum's closet a 'Free Tibet' signed letter from Richard Gere. Yes, the actor. His mum was besotted with him and together they spent countless hours watching Richard Gere's movies. So, Bartholomew takes to writing to Richard Gere, seeking his guidance, spiritual and otherwise. A great deal of the novel is written as very long letters addressed to Richard Gere. It's very well done. One can't help but feel for the poor Bartholomew. He's so lonely and extremely naive. He's got a heart of gold, but that rarely counts for much in the real world. But fate, or maybe synchronicity, has other plans. I'll leave it a that, I've given away too much.Mathew Quick yet again charmed me, surprised me and enticed with his wonderful characters and what is an uplifting story.

I will only write a few thoughts about this 1971 Pulitzer winner novel, which was called  a Western epic. I am not generally drawn to Western pioneer stories, but this was written by Stegner, some say it's his best novel, so, of course, I had to read it. The copy I bought has a very small print, so I opted to listen to the audiobook, which was splendidly narrated by Mark Bramhall.The truth is that Wallace Stegner's writing beguiles me and keeps me in a constant state of awe. Each sentence is crafted to perfection. There's playfulness and musicality to his sentence structure. And the descriptions, oh, the descriptions ... Sure, his writing, especially by today's standards, could be accused of being too writerly (is that a word?) I don't care, I love it.I also thought the novel's focus and its structure were brilliant. Lyam Ward, a retired history professor, confined to a wheelchair due to crippling bone disease, decides to write his grandmother's biography. Susan Burling Ward was a writer and an artist. Her five-decade-long correspondence with her best friend, Augusta Hudson, provides a good picture of who his grandmother was. Of course, there's more to a person than it transpires from letters. Lyam Ward is given to imagining and wondering and filling in the gaps. I loved how unjudgemental and understanding he was, it's as if he understood women, amazing, right? :-) Ward's recent divorce, which took him by surprise, makes him wonder about his grandmother's marriage to Oliver Ward, the very kind, determined, unsophisticated and laconic engineer, who brought her to live in the West, where she had to do without the luxuries and the type of company she was used to in New York.This tome didn't feel long, I didn't want it to end.I think even the title is perfect.

Many thanks to Grove Press, Black Cat for the eARC. Girl, Woman, Other is a perfectly titled novel. This time, you won’t hear me complain about “yet another girl book”. This novel is made up of twelve interconnected chapters that focus on a certain woman, eleven of them black, one of them unaware she had black genes. Evaristo managed to cover a wide spectrum of British black women - women from different generations, with different sexual orientations, and gender identity. Some of them are ardent feminists – some had been feminists before it was trendy; others just want to fit in with the middle class. Some seek and find a career and financial success – many of those people reject, to a certain extent, their origins and become players in the “establishment”. Some are artistic, some are pragmatic, some are erudite, some had obtained top-class education, and others had left school early. Some know what they want, others fumble through life, making it up as they go along. The intergenerational conflict is present throughout. Of course, racism, a-la Great Britain, is featured throughout. It also covers single motherhood, domestic abuse, drug-taking, and rape. This novel is written in a very direct, unadorned way, it felt like listening to someone’s life story told by someone close to them. The lack of full stops between phrases didn’t impact the reading flow, but I thought it was unnecessary.Girl, Woman, Other is not perfect – what is? After finishing it, I felt warmth, compassion, empathy and sympathy, while also being enlightened to certain aspects of gender and sexual identity and expression.I'm happy this has made it onto the Man Booker Prize shortlist.

This was an original novel, about Vivian Morris's life, whom we meet as an unassuming, bored nineteen-year-old. She flourishes once she moves to New York to live with her unconventional, theatre owner aunt. In no time at all, Vivian turns into a fun-loving, sexually adventurous young woman, taking all sort of risks, especially for a young woman in the 1940s. I can't remember the last time or if ever I read about the multiple sexual dalliances of a woman of that era. Of course, I arched my moralistic and practical eyebrow about her nightly drunken escapades since Vivian wasn't getting much sexual satisfaction - in a conventional way. But Vivian thought it fun, so that's what matters, until she got into trouble.I enjoyed reading about Vivian's time at the Lily Playhouse, surrounded by showgirls and other show people.Above all, I appreciated this novel's tone, Vivian's irreverence and her way of looking at the world.

A luxury afforded to me and others by our wonderful library system.The blurb of this novel is perfect, as unlike many other blurbs, it says enough without giving too much away: 'Set in a fading family estate nestled within the Chiltern Hills, this is the story of two summers, sixty years apart, woven together to reveal one dramatic family story.'I enjoyed Richell's writing, even though, at times, I thought certain parts were drawn-out and stagnant, but it seems to go with the territory for this kind of novels. The setting was an important part of this novel, as the Cloudesley estate is the central part of this novel.The narrative alternates between Lillian Oberon's story from sixty years before and Maggie Oberon's, Lillian's grand-daughter, who finds herself back to Cloudesley to help her elderly grandma.As for the characterisations, I thought Lillian and her husband, Charles, lack depth and could have been a bit more nuanced, as Lillian was assigned the saint, victim status, while her husband was the monster.As the novel progresses, the reveals and the conclusion of this novel become more satisfying, albeit somewhat predictable.This would make for a nice BBC TV miniseries. ...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Aug 05, 2019","Aug 12, 2019","Aug 05, 2019",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/52410407-the-peacock-summer

I felt that way when I was reading her excellent The Museum of Modern Love and even more so after hearing her speak a couple of times at the Perth Writers Festival. When I picked up the brand new copy of Bruny, I was kind of put off by the Crime label on its spine but remembered it wasn't the first time I noticed books mislabelled, more importantly, it was written by Heather Rose so that was what mattered the most. So, here are a few random thoughts, unedited and unpolished (like most of my s), especially, since I haven't fully made up my mind about this book:- Bruny is about a small island in the South East of Tasmania - the smallest state in Australia, which happens to be an island off the SE coast of Australia. I wasn't aware of it, so now I'll add it to my Must-See List if/when I visit Tasmania (in other words, I'll be another pesky tourist, something Heather Rose was, directly and indirectly, complaining about. Sorry. :-))- this novel was topical, polemical, factual, in a way, it's an Idiot's Guide to Tasmania's, and Australia's, social, economic, environmental and political landscape. There are micro and macro facts and observations on Tasmania and Australia, and broader ones on global geopolitics. I remember reading somewhere that only about 15% of the population is paying attention to what happens in politics, I dare conclude that this will be very informative and maybe give you some food for thought. - feminist and environmental themes feature as well. There's no such thing as the perfect marriage or family, so there's plenty of conflict in those departments to keep things interesting.- the views and opinions expressed here matched mine uncannily. Despite that, at times it felt a bit heavy-handed or spoon-fed. - there is a bit of romance in the novel, I didn't care for it, but it adds a bit of lightness.Bruny is an audacious novel that doesn't hold back. Kudos to Allen & Unwin for publishing it. It's an easy read that also manages to be informative and enlightening....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Oct 17, 2019","Oct 20, 2019","Aug 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46194329-bruny

Nevertheless, I went toWINNER OF THE GOLDSMITHS PRIZE 2019When I read about this novel in the Guardian, I was intrigued but also put off by its size. Nevertheless, I went to Edelweiss and requested the ARC, thinking if I’m meant to read it I’ll get approved. Many thanks to the publishers for approving my request.As you’ve probably heard, this is a very long novel, written from the point of view of an unnamed forty-something stay-at-home mother of four, who lives in Newcomerstown, Ohio. She ruminates, wonders, jumps from one thing to another; she’s perplexed, vexed, stuck, scared, and filled with guilt; she’s nervous, neurotic, forgetful, distracted, intense and constantly tired. She’s a good representation for many mothers in today’s developed world. Three years prior, she had had cancer, “the embarrassing kind”, which put a strain on the family’s finances, which is why she’s taken to baking pies and other desserts to sell to cafes and diners. Her second husband, Leo, and the biological father to the youngest three kids, is an Engineering professor at an Ohio University. He sounds like a great guy, which is a nice counterbalance to all the male vileness mentioned in the book.Have you ever wished you had less knowledge about current affairs, politics, the environment, hoping that ignorance might bring you some semblance of bliss? Is it possible to be happy and serene when one knows about the crazy world we live in? Is it surprising that so many people suffer from anxiety? This novel is basically riddled with one woman’s anxieties. I related to some and understood others. There are several themes that keep popping up in this novel:-	how much her mother’s stroke just “broke her”-	male violence- deadbeat dads-	parenthood and its many tribulations-	gun violence and the constant fear that someone will shoot your kids while at school-	the environment and the damage caused by humans-	history and the many cruelties and injustices perpetrated against the native people-	police violence.Several movies and books are discussed in detail - some I knew, others I had to look up. Google will be your friend on many occasions.Ducks, Newburyport is extremely contemporary, a time capsule of Trump’s America. It’s mesmerising, original, realistic, intelligent, observant, and occasionally amusing. Oh, and anxiety-inducing.Ultimately, this was satisfying and worthwhile the time spent in its company.It’s not for everybody, no book is.Brava, Ms Ellmann....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Jul 30, 2019","Sep 17, 2019","Jul 30, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43412920-ducks-newburyport

The author uses this device for flashbacks, starting with Leila's mum's life as a second wife, Leila's arrival into this world, her growing up, to her death. Leila's upbringing was unorthodox, as her Muslim father had two wives. Her biological mother became her aunty, while the father's baren first wife is Leila's mother. At sixteen, the impulsive Leila leaves for Istanbul to escape an arranged marriage. Innocent and unprepared, she's sold into prostitution, ending up working in one of the government-sanctioned brothels of the 1960s.She acquires five good friends, all people who didn't belong due to skin colour, gender identity, origins or physical disability. We briefly get to know everyone's story. Women on the verge, women who suffer, women who are just trying to survive. But, if I'm being honest, it felt tokenistic..Crazy, messy Istanbul features greatly in this story. A couple of important events, such as the 1968 anti-US fleet protests and the May 1977 Taksim Square Massacre, events that affect Leila's life trajectory.This is another novel I feel I should have liked more, much more, even without the added pressure of it being shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. There are things I admired about it. Overall, I found it uneven, and occasionally clunky. The ending was completely over-the-top, veering into melodrama. All these things, and more, kept me from feeling much for the characters. If you can't win me over when I'm already a convert, I blame it on you the writer.This novel is not greater than the sum of its parts.

The cast still includes relatable characters, who have their ups and downs, and the customary secrets.The narrator of this story is Amy Whey, a new mother and stepmother to a teenage girl, who lives a comfortable middle-class life in a Pensacola suburb in Florida. She's involved in the neighbourhood, attends the neighbourhood book club organised by her best friend, Char. When a new alluring neighbour joins their book club, things take an interesting turn. Angelica Roux has a way of making people spill out their secrets. Secrets she uses to get what she wants. I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers.I enjoyed this novel, albeit I didn't get the warm, fuzzy feelings the previous JJ novels induced in me.I think I've reached my saturation point as far as domestic suspense/mystery novels are concerned.With thanks to the publishers for this e-ARC I received via Edelweiss....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jul 21, 2019","Jul 24, 2019","Jul 14, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36679186-never-have-i-ever

I read fewer titles than in 2018 but still surpassed my target of sixty-one books. My favourite discovery this year was Wallace Stegner. I can't quite express how much I loved Crossing to Safety and The Spectator Bird.Another stand-out novel was Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellmann. Whenever I hear news from Ohio (interestingly enough, they're never good news), I think of this novel. Many other small things, expressions, baking remind me of Ducks. I can't recommend this novel enough. Other favourites this year were Spring by Ali Smith; Normal People by Sally Rooney and Olive, Again by Elizabeth Strout.In 2019 I've enjoyed three of Ruth Hogan's novels, I'm looking forward to reading more by her. I am ecstatic to have read two classic novels Frankenstein and North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell, which have become some of my favourites books ever. There are many other classics I've been meaning to read but still haven't. We live and hope. As far as non-fiction books, 2019 has been very satisfying. My favourites: 21 Lessons for the 21st Century and Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow both by Yuval Noah Harari; Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World by ..by Rutger Bregman; Becoming by Michelle Obama; 2040: A Handbook for the Regeneration by Damon Gameau; Any Ordinary Day: Blindsides, Resilience and What Happens After the Worst Day of Your Life by Leigh Sales; The Barefoot Investor for Families: The only kids' money guide you'll ever need by Scott Pape.

Abigail Sorensen began receiving the ""Guidebook"" twenty years prior, the year her fifteen-year-old brother, Robert, disappeared, never to be seen or heard from again. Abi's now a thirty-six-year-old single mother of a boy and the part-owner of the Happiness Cafe in Sydney.Her life revolves around her child and work. She gets an opportunity to attend a free retreat organised by the son of the people who had been sending the Guidebook. There she meets a mix of people, although only a few of them will be chosen to attend a special seminar back in Sydney. Is that some kind of pyramid scheme, a cult?This novel is about finding your way and moving on when grief, heartbreak over a failed marriage and the day-to-day struggles seem to cage you.Despite the above, the tone of the novel is very light, with some amusing episodes. I had a good chuckle at Abi's analysis of many very popular self-help books, such as The Secret, The Celestine Profecy, He's Just Not That Into You to name just a few. I'm not doing this novel justice, so I'll just sum it up by saying that it was surprising, intelligent, relatable, touching, uplifting and I loved every minute of the twelve hours plus I spent in its company. I hope Jaclyn Moriarty will write more novels for grown-ups. She's got a fan in me. A huge shout out to Aimee Horne who was absolutely magnificent.

I didn't hate it, but I never felt compelled to get back to it. As with Ordinary Grace, which I enjoyed very much, I had the feeling that I'd read this type of story before. There have been quite a few books addressing the horrible events when white people deemed it necessary to remove indigenous kids from their families in order to ""integrate"" them. Australia's own history is riddled with such events, the trauma of the kids taken away is still felt today and passed on to the new generations. Oddie, twelve and his brother, Albert, sixteen, are the only white kids in a school for Indigenous (Indian) children are sent to be ""educated"". It's the 1930s, the Depression is at its peak. The poor kids are left in the care of violent, abusive adults, who do as they wish. They're pretty much slaves, being sent away to work for farmers or around the school. Oddie's best friend is Mose, a mute Sioux boy, who communicates with Obbie and Albert via sign language. The three boys and Emmy, the orphan little girl of one of the nicest teachers in school, run away. They have a canoe which they use to escape. Over the course of several months, the four of them have all sort of adventures or misadventures. They encounter all sort of people, some nicer than others. These adventures reminded me about Huckleberry Finn and other similar stories.The last fifty pages or so really lifted this novel to another level. There were some interesting twists.To conclude my ramblings - this wasn't bad, the writing is good, Oddie's voice is compelling enough. Cutting out some parts or making them shorter would have given this novel a smoother flow.

Coincidences and the right people in the right place at the right time move this story along.I don't think this is as well realised as The Wisdom of Sally Red Shoes - with which is tied-in in certain ways- but it was nevertheless still a very enjoyable read.I'm looking forward to reading Ruth Hogan's fourth novel....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jun 23, 2019","Jun 24, 2019","Jun 13, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42082779-queenie-malone-s-paradise-hotel

She builds the story slowly, allowing us to know the main characters, via their parallel points of view. Masha is a grieving mother, unable to move on with her life, even though it’s been twelve years since her son died. Alice is a single mother to Michael, now a changing teenager. He’s the apple of her eyes. Masha is fascinated with the Victorian graveyard in her neighbourhood, where she spends countless hours, either by herself or in the company of her adorable wolfhound, Haizum. Besides her job as a psychotherapist, she enjoys swimming in an outdoor pool, no matter how cold it gets. As they say, the devil is in the details. This is the case here as well. The settings and their descriptions are beautiful. There’s a large cast of quirky and interesting characters. I enjoyed the “word of the day” that popped up now and then and, incredibly enough, learning about the Victorian era ‘death business’, and a few other bits and pieces.Although there’s death, pain and grief, The Wisdom of Sally Red Shoes ends up being a feel-good, life-affirming kind of novel, which I savoured and found satisfying.Highly recommendedI’ve received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jun 08, 2019","Jun 09, 2019","Jun 08, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/39860004-the-wisdom-of-sally-red-shoes

The business-savvy Cyril Conroy buys the house and everything in it to surprise his wife, Elma and their young children, Maeve and Danny. Overwhelmed by the huge change from living frugally in a very small house to living in a grand old house, with a cook, a cleaner and a nanny, the young mother eventually abandons her family.Written from Danny's point of view, this is a novel about family, abandonment and its effects, hanging on the past and not letting go. Danny's sister, Maeve, seven years his senior, becomes his mentor and protector, while the two sisters working as cook and cleaner, respectively, take on the caring roles.When things get worse for the two siblings, their relationship is what gives them strength, their intelligence and ambition what propels them further to outward success.The Dutch House features prominently throughout the novel. Detested, loved, admired, longed for, the house pulls at the hearts and memories of those who lived in it.Spanning over five decades, at times, the story sags as it becomes quite mundane. But it's very readable; the details, the little scenes and recollections make it very lifelike. You know how it is, you're a teen, then you study, begin your grown-up life and then, bam! you wonder what happened to time, when did you get to be forty, fifty etc. The last quarter picks up the pace, quite a lot happens.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, the characterisations were excellent, the descriptions, of the house in particular, were quite vivid.

I considered giving up but since it’s a McEwan novel and I was able to renew my loan, I stuck with it until the end.Set in an alternative historical period in the United Kingdom, Machines Like Me looks at many contemporary issues such as artificial intelligence and machines taking over, ethics and morality, Brexit, relationships, adoption, to name just a few. This should have been riveting, given its complex aspects, but it was uneven, pontificating, it felt like the author had all these interests and just dumped all the research into this novel, through Charlie, the narrator of this novel or via his humanoid robot, Adam. On a couple of occasions, the famous mathematician, computer scientist, Alan Turing, still alive in this novel's 1980s, delivers some overdrawn monologues either on his past and his homosexuality or on artificial intelligence. While there are worthwhile things to contemplate and learn about, this novel wasn’t as engaging as it should/could have been. I wasn’t wowed, charmed or entertained.

She and her father are the last people with this condition, a rare genetic disorder. Her father is a miner and they barely scrape by. The area is quite poor, with many illiterate people and high mortality rates. Cussy is very dedicated and loves her patrons, she loves to facilitate the education of people who otherwise wouldn't have had any opportunities to get reading material. Her kindness and devotion break through some people's prejudices. Of course, that's not always the case and she encounters oppression, derision and abuse on many occasions. I had never heard of the Blue people of Kentucky, so I appreciated learning about them. The Pack Horse Library Project was a wonderful outreach initiative I had no knowledge of. While these two aspects anchored the novel, a few issues prevented my full immersion into the story. Cussy is the narrator of this novel. Nothing wrong with it, except that her voice was inconsistent - sometimes the dialogue sounded more authentic, with dialect, especially from people sounding uneducated, as they were supposed to be, but it waned and then came back as if the author suddenly remembered who her characters were so she'd throw in some colloquialisms. Cussy was too saintly. She sounded way too sophisticated for someone so young and uneducated.As the story progressed, the middle part that involved Mary's tracking to her patrons was quite repetitive.The last chapters turn into a full-blown soap opera, way too melodramatic for my liking.In conclusion, this had the makings of a great historical novel, but its incongruences and the melodrama made it just an okay read for me.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest . ...more",Notes are private!,2,166,1,"Jun 12, 2019","Jun 22, 2019","May 14, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40914165-the-book-woman-of-troublesome-creek

The Kinsellas are a childless couple, who work hard and have everything they need. They treat her with kindness and care for her in a manner the little girl had never experienced before.The writing is relatively simple but given that the story was told from the girl's POV, I found it unbelievable that a young girl would think like that, especially when it came to describing the environment and other events - in other words, I could see the author's hand in it.

Also, while it's becoming a publishing schtick, I enjoy swear words - as long as they're not in my native language.

Thank goodness, Roger Wayne, the narrator of this book was excellent, had it not been for him, and the audiobook's duration, I wouldn't have finished.The beginning was really promising, well, I liked it a lot, I thought this will be so up my alley, as it professed itself to be an anti self-help book, against that mindless positive crappolla that is prevalent in the field. I'm not so sure that was achieved.That's not to say there weren't good things in the book. As far as I'm concerned, nothing was new, groundbreaking or will impact me in any way (truthfully, not many, if any, books in the genre ever had, to my dismay, as there's so much room for improvement where I'm concerned). My biggest gripe with this book was that Manson doesn't seem to take into account people's genetic make-up and experiences. It is a complex notion, probably not covered when studying for a business degree, I know mine never did. Not to mention, saying that genes have a huge role in one's make-up would be counterintuitive and unproductive, as it wouldn't leave that much for the self-help gurus to write and preach about. ...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,Jan 2019,"May 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck

The three of them are from different parts of the US, have different socio-economic backgrounds and have different interests and personalities. Somehow they became the three musketeers - ""all for one and one for all"". They did have one thing in common - all three were in love with Jacy, but since she was engaged to be married to someone else, none of them acted on their infatuation, so they were just good friends. Life took them to different locations and they had different trajectories. Despite good intentions, they didn't keep in touch as much as they promised they would. The three of them manage to get together to Lincoln's house in Martha Vineyard. The last time they were all there was in the summer of 1971, following their graduation. Jacy was there with them as well. It was also the last time they saw Jacy, who was not heard from since 1971. Being in that house together brings back memories and raises more questions about Jacy's fate, which accounts for the mystery-suspense element of this novel. This was another enjoyable novel.

So I waited for my wonderful library to make the audiobook available, as I had developed a great fondness for Moriarty's novels narrated by Carline Lee. I grumbled a bit at the 16 hr duration, then remembered all Moriarty's books were pretty long and it never stopped me from loving them. Without giving away spoilers, when one of the bigger plot twists came about I thought ""you, naughty woman, Liane Moriarty, how awesomely modern are you!"" It surprised me, but it shouldn't have, because, really, Liane Moriarty is one talented writer. I always think very fondly of her and feel like we could be friends - yes, I know authors are not their characters or their books blah blah, but really, in many ways, they are. It's obvious that Moriarty is an incredible people observer and her commentary on society is underestimated, but she's spot on. There's a very thin line between a cliche, cartoonish character and a realistic, well realised one. I am guilty of calling, thinking certain plots, characters were cliche and/or cartoonish. I've never felt that way about any of Liane Moriarty's characters. My Eastern European self grumbled slightly at the portrayal of the Russian Masha - the owner of the spa resort - but then recognised certain opinions and views I held when I first moved to Australia - such as the strange habit of inviting you to a party and expecting you bring your own drinks/meat. For those of you unfamiliar with the ways of Communist block people - I generalise here, but it seems to apply to most Eastern European countries - even during basic food shortages, when meat was rare, coffee was a luxury etc, when you had guests over you offered them the best of the best you were able to provide, on the best china you owned, while wearing your best clothes when having a dinner party etc. I still fret and stress when people come over, but nowhere near as much as I did when I moved here. If that's not a sign of integrating, I don't know what is ;-). And damn it, I still can't get my head around that we all sound the same - although my native tongue is of Latin origin, doesn't sound like any of the Slavic languages or Hungarian, nevertheless, we all sound the same when speaking English, probably other foreign languages as well. Anyway, I digress, again ...So, yeah, this was a very satisfying read. I wish I could go to a spa resort - I wouldn't mind some pampering massages... Thanks for reading my ramblings.

I was right. The autism aspects of this novel are familiar to me. We’ve been on the "" autism journey"" for over 10 years (*I cringe using these words), I do remember the fervour I experienced in the beginning, reading everything, researching, attending million and one parents' groups, seminars etc., therapies, albeit they were the run-of-the-mill kind. I do get why some people would go the non-kosher way, hoping for miracles. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is one of those unorthodox therapies, which caused the deaths of two people when the fire entered the HBO chamber. Who caused the fire and why is the novel's main story arc. Angie Kim did a wonderful job showing us the many aspects of caring for someone with a disability and for kids on the spectrum. The guilt, the exhaustion, the driving to this or that doctor and/or therapy, the advocating, researching, implementing strategies, administering treatments, the damned if you do, damned if you don’t and the constant questioning. Of course, you've got those with fewer needs than others. Autism is a spectrum, where some could be put in the ""just quirky"" category, while at the other end, you have those who will never be able to live independent lives. Elizabeth's son was in the ""just a quirky boy category"". Her story broke my heart in a million pieces. Each character's story, their motivations are gradually revealed to keep us fully engaged to the bitter-sweet end.I could go on about this novel, but I won’t, I’ll just encourage you to read it.This was a very impressive novel, even more so as it's a debut.I’ve received the galley from the publishers, via NetGalley, in exchange for my honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,50,2,"May 28, 2019not set","May 31, 2019not set","Apr 22, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40121959-miracle-creek

But since my library purchased it because I requested it, I felt I had to read it.Besides, I'm kind of obsessed with music, and I've always had crushes on musicians - not that I would want to be with one, especially not a famous one. I'm in the don't-meet-your-heroes camp because they'll be disappointing. Speaking of this camp, I mistakenly googled things early into this novel, as I was trying to find out if characters and the band were real. That opened Pandora's box alright, as I stumbled upon groupies, famous groupies. Of course, I've heard of groupies, but I had no idea they were so young, babies really, some as young as 12. And then you read about all these famous, much-loved musicians such as David Bowie, the Rolling Stones guys, the Led Zeppelin guys, Jim Morrison and many others, sleeping indiscriminately with these young girls. Paedophiles, but nobody calls them that. Slimy, disgusting worms. I got so angry. I've got so many conflicting feelings, but I cannot listen to favourite songs the same way anymore, so I'm furious.So yeah, it's fair to say I went into this novel a bit riled up. :-)I knew early on it wasn't going to be a 5-star read.It took me much longer than anticipated to finish it, despite being so easy to read. Around the halfway point, I got a bit bored. The ending was pretty good though. More than anything, this novel is about memory, how people can experience the same things, but come up with different narratives and observations. I find it both fascinating and depressing at the same time. I appreciated the original, clever format of this novel. I can't remember reading any other novels based on and about the music scene before, so it was refreshing to have something different to read about. Given the success of this novel, I predict a new publishing trend.

To give a few examples: Why have we been working harder and harder since the 1980s despite being richer than ever? Why are millions of people still living in poverty when we are more than rich enough to put an end to it once and for all? And why is more than 60% of your income depends on the country where you just happen to have been born?24 Utopias offer no ready-made answers, let alone solutions. But they do ask the right questions.I’ve had this on my TBR since 2017. Upon watching the viral video of Bregman at Davos berating the billionaires for not paying their fair share of taxes, I felt I had to read his book. For those of you who haven’t seen that short speech here it is https://www.theguardian.com/business/... .As you can tell from my rating, I’m very happy I read this book. It was riveting, informative, and most importantly, it challenged and changed some of my ideas. I love when this happens.Bregman is starting to be known as the “universal basic income guy”. I don’t know about you, in the past year or so I’ve come across some articles about this notion, half dismissing it as undoable. Upon reading this book, I’ve changed my mind. It sounds like a far-fetched idea until you read more about it.In the past, the economists and other people in the know were predicting the working week will be around 15 hrs by 2030. Obviously, it didn’t happen, and it’s unlikely to, if anything, the opposite is true, especially for certain countries in the developed world, especially the USA, Japan, South Korea etc. But many of the more enlightened European countries are moving towards shorter and shorter weekly hours, the Netherlands is at the top with an average of 27.5 hrs/week followed very closely by Germany. Another thing that Bregman discusses in depth is poverty, homelessness and foreign aid to poor countries. I’m a proud and loud lefty, and even I have, better said, had, some misconceptions about poor people and poverty, and I was far from being one of those people who go on and on about “why don’t they just get a job and why do they keep having so many kids (well, I still think that about everyone – because of overpopulation) and they should stop drinking and smoking (I dislike drinking and smoking in everyone) etc. The big reason poor people are poor is because they don’t have enough money,” notes economist Charles Kenny, “and it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that giving them money is a great way to reduce that problem.Those more sceptical will probably huff and puff at all these utopian ideals, but guess what, most good things we take for granted today, such as democracy, women’s right to vote, birth control, you name it, they were all considered “undoable”, “unnecessary” in the beginning. Somebody, usually on the fringes, had an idea, a vision. Look, I can go on and on about this book. It’s by no means perfect, but it gave me food for thought and it whetted my appetite to read more books/articles on such important issues.

Men's opinions matter even less. I'm heterosexual - I know, quite the tragedy, as I like to joke to most people's astonishment. And guess what, most feminists are not men-haters, although I'm sure some are and I'm certain they have good reasons for that. It actually gives me great satisfaction when occasionally I discover that a certain man, usually a friend's partner, can't stand me. It's usually because instead of fluttering my eye-lashes and gushing over their ... whatever it is we are supposed to gush over - I challenge their sexist remarks, jokes and attitudes and so on - not that I spend that much time in their company, I'm bored out of my mind by sports talk. Anyway, let's  ...For those of you outside Australia, Clementine Ford is one of the most prominent feminists in Australia. It's redundant to say I admire her. I like and treasure all feminists, no matter if they're the suave, diplomatic, conciliatory type or the acerbic, cussing, don't-give-a-fuck kind. Feminists come in all shapes and colours, just like women do. I won a signed copy and a t-shirt for asking a question that was read on a live Facebook event. I listened to this via audiobook and I loved it as it was narrated by Ford herself (she's quite good). The first word that comes to mind to describe this book is unapologetic. Like many other feminists, young Clementine was your typical girl, brought up in a loving family, together with her older sister and brother. She couldn't quite find her place in the world, being a chubby girl (I know the biggest crime of them all!), until she became a teenager who decided ""to take control"" by becoming anorexic and bulimic. Interestingly enough, but not unusual, nobody in the family noticed, she was getting lots of compliments for losing that weight to become attractive. Her parents were loving and quite enlightened by comparison, still, they weren't perfect. The mixed messages we give girls, the ever-changing goalposts of what it means to be attractive, of what's acceptable and not acceptable. Just think of how we were parented and how we parent our boys and girls: for the girls - be nice and kind, make yourself pretty, cute, followed by don't go out at night, don't show too much leg, wear a bra, wear girly clothes, of course, not too revealing we don't want people to call/think you a slut. Shave your underarms, shave your legs (why is it so different for men?). The boys are mostly left to be themselves, go explore, be conquerors, be a leader, assertive, encouraged to go after what they want etc.Completely different messages. Ford confesses to having had two abortions, but unlike most other women, besides being unapologetic about it, she's also not wringing her hands to explain herself beside the fact she wasn't ready for a child. She's got zero, zip, nada regrets about them. Case closed. I'm, of course, pro-choice but I can't remember seeing this stance - the narrative around abortion is that, surely, there must be some regret, shame etc. It's kind of refreshing to hear it's not the case for everyone. NB: If you're not pro-choice, I'm not interested in hearing about it - it's never ever going change my views - so don't waste your time). Ford describes and reads the abuse she gets online, day in and day out, from angry, vile men. It’s atrocious! Other issues addressed in this book are the rape culture and horrendous statistics on domestic violence.Here are some statistics to help demonstrate the prevalence and severity of violence against women:•	On average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner.•	1 in 3 Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. •	1 in 5 Australian women has experienced sexual violence.•	1 in 6 Australian women has experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or former partner.•	1 in 4 Australian women has experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner.•	Australian women are nearly three times more likely than men to experience violence from an intimate partner.•	Australian women are almost four times more likely than men to be hospitalised after being assaulted by their spouse or partner. My favourite part of the book was the last chapter It’s OK to Be AngryI’ll conclude this overly long  with a quote:Be angry. Be rageful. Be loud. Be unrepentant. Be assertive. Be aggressive. Be the kid of she-beast that trains her fire-filled eye on the male gaze and burns it down. Be everything that women are always told not to be, and commit to giving zero fucks about who may or may not have a problem with that.It is okay to be angry.

The first part of the novel, which introduced the newly married couple, Herta and Ernst Schafer, was more enjoyable, especially, Herta's point of view. In saying all that, throughout the entire novel, I could see the author, I could ""smell"" contemporary attitudes, as through Herta we were seeing ""the right path"", what was right and what was wrong, which to me, it feels a bit revisionistic, a problem encountered in many historical novels, more obvious in some novels than others. As if things weren't disjointed enough, there is also a dead-panda, whose soliloquies pop up now and then. Even though those passages were well written, they felt preachy and gimmicky, not to mention they broke the flow of the story.A great chunk of this novel is dedicated to Schafer and his hunting exploits in order to collect animals for Himler and not only. The details of the tracking, explorations and the descriptions of hunting the animals and preserving them became tedious and repetitive and after a while, felt like padding.While I appreciate the research that went into this novel, The Hollow Bones has failed to leave a positive impression on me.

More importantly, Harari answered a question I've been asking myself for many years. In retrospect, the explanation is logical but it never occurred to me and nobody else was able to enlighten me either. Algorithms - a modern word, but very important, as we all are biological algorithms.What's more important - intelligence or consciousness?I also enjoyed the recap/rundown of some historical events in history. Harari also addresses our cruel treatment of farm animals. I'm an omnivore who feels guilty. What else? There's a lot to take in, but Harari unpacks it for us in an eloquent, easy to understand manner (well, I understood it).

It's wonderful that mental illnesses are no longer taboo. I don't know if it's because we're getting more enlightened or because so many people have mental health issues. I'm guessing it's a mix of the two. I enjoyed the very multicultural aspects of this novel that added another dimension and layer of complexity to the story. This story is mainly about Lucia and her sister Miranda. Their Chinese mother was pregnant with Lucia when she immigrated to the USA. Miranda was seven years old. The beautiful Lucia was the unlucky one, as she suffered from schizophrenia or bipolar disease or something in between. When not medicated, her behaviour became erratic and uncontrollable - as you'd imagine. Miranda tries to help as much as possible, although she's got her own life to live. Another immigrant's perspective is added when Lucia marries Yonah, a much older Jewish man who seeks a new life in the USA. Manny, Lucia's baby daddy, provides us with insights into an undocumented Ecuadorian young man's life in the US, doing all sort of jobs in construction and kitchens.I appreciated this novel, but I never fully got into it. I understand why Mira T Lee chose the multiple points of views, but I thought some of them were better executed than others.

Out of the Dark continues Evan Stoak’s journey as the Nowhere Man. But now, there are more complications added to the mix, such as Evan wanting to kill the President of the United States in order for the President not to kill him and the other Orphans. This scenario made me arch my sceptical, really? eyebrow, even though I enjoyed the tactical intricacies and other such details. I wasn’t as charmed by this novel as I was with the previous one, even though some of the things that I wished to happen for Evan did occur. In my opinion, Hurwitz went overboard with the action sequences, there was so much packed in, on the East and West Coast of America, oh, yeah, plus a quick trip to Europe. Evan never seemed to sleep. I know he’s some kind of superhuman, nevertheless, I grumbled about certain aspects of the novel I found incongruous. I did enjoy seeing Evan’s emotional growth, but that in itself would have taken a mental/physical toll on him, so it didn’t make sense to me that he’d still be able to do all the many things he did in this novel.Even though this latest volume in the series was my least favourite, I’m looking forward to finding out what Hurwitz has in store for the Nowhere Man.

She looks out the window and notices a guy sitting in a bus shelter absorbed in a hardcover book. He lifts his head and sees the girl staring at him. Their eyes meet. They communicate wordlessly … I am on page 7 and I'm already grumbling. Not about the insta-love, although, really? Not even about the irritating first-person narration, which somehow I find irksome mostly in romance novels. I would just like to know how is it possible to ” stare straight at each other"" when one is sitting on the top deck of a double-decker bus in London and the other person is sitting in a bus shelter, with a roof I assume, head down reading. Did I mention it happened on 21st December – the shortest day of the year when at 4 pm it’s already dark? Besides the fact that I was incredulous that a young man would read a hardcover book, in winter, when it’s dark outside, while waiting for the bus, I would just like to know how it is possible for two people on different levels, in pretty close proximity, distance-wise, to achieve the staring contest. It’s physically unlikely. But hey, let’s not let something as stupid as the laws of physics derail our enjoyment of this love story. The twenty-two-year-old and her best friend and roommate, Sarah, spend what seems like the entire year looking for the “bus guy”, in bars and so on. Neither of them thought about taking the bus at the same time or waiting in the said bus stop around the same time. I guess that would be too logical. Right … moving on. Guess who falls in love with “your bus guy” – your best friend, Sarah. Poor Laurie, she’s lost the love of her life… Give me a break. She saw the dude for one minute. Besides, once she got to know Jack, there wasn’t anything special to admire about him. He was as interesting as a wet dishrag. Not that Laurie was miss excitement or had much of a personality either. Apparently, she had blue-purple eyes and dark hair – yeah right. That would make her striking. But according to Laurie, she wasn’t the gorgeous one, her best friend, Sarah, was. Alright … Sarah seems to have more of a personality and since she was gorgeous and sleeping with Jack, I found it very hard to believe that Jack would pine for Laurie, because, what? they saw each other through a window? Do men operate like that? Nope.Given it's an English novel, I expected some good ol’ British humour, sarcasm, banter, I love banter! – but there was no banter! :-( Those are the best bits about starting up a relationship. Something tells me the author is a coffee drinker, because nobody drinks tea in this novel - so very un-British of them *smirk. Besides a lot of alcohol drinking and getting drunk (one of the very few things about this novel that were life-like), there’s very little of anything else. Even douchebag Jack, who’s a DJ, never mentions music. The only movies they briefly mention are Twilight and Grease. Ok… Oh, I forgot, The Great Gatsby is apparently highbrow literature (don't they study it in high school in the States?).Josie Silver does a whole lot of telling, very little showing. Laurie keeps telling everyone, and Jack, that they're best friends. Really? Based on what? They spent less than 50 pages together. This old romantic trope of the male best friend drives me crazy. Most of us know that women and men can’t be friends, because men, young and old, won’t spend time or think about a woman they don’t want to sleep with. I mean friendship as in the kind you share intimacies and personal things, not the hanging out type.One Day in December was cliche and there were lots of things that irked me:-	Annoying first-person narration with two points of view, Jack’s point of view, only reinforcing his douchebag qualities. -	Too much telling not enough showing, actually, it’s all telling; -	The novel's structure didn’t work for me, too many vignettes, not enough meat to the story;-	The worst thing was that the two main characters, Laurie and Jack, were flat, unidimensional and their chemistry was non-existent, so I ended up not caring at all about either of them.As far as I’m concerned One Day in December  was boring, trite, uninspired and lacklustre.Who wants my paperback?...more",Notes are private!,19,808,1,not set,"Jan 19, 2019","Jan 19, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38255337-one-day-in-december

Detective Reilly moved to Galway, as his girlfriend, Emma, pursues a career as a scientist in the prestigious Darcy Therapeutics.When Emma stumbles across a dead girl, while making her way to work, she calls Cormac, who takes on the case as the lead investigator, despite Emma being a witness. This was the first time I raised my critical eyebrow in disbelief, but I let it pass.Quite early on, without trying, I was able to see one of the main subplots. It took Cormac and his team halfway through the novel, if not longer, to get to that point. Besides the red herrings that this genre employs in order to distract us from spotting the culprit, I found quite a few loose threads and incongruences. Also, without going into too many details for fear of spoilers, the motivations were unbelievable to me and there was too much made-up unnecessary drama and a bit too much padding, including the introduction of a character - Carrie O'Halloran - who basically gives the case to Reilly and then comes back to it in the end, but ends up getting Reilly to close it. I hope the introduction of O'Halloran was for the benefit of a third novel in the series. While I'm at it, the prologue was too long, and worse, unnecessary. I am aware that there's pressure to ride the wave of success, before people's attention moves onto something else, but in my opinion, this novel suffers from a lack of credibility, lose plot points and too many fillers. I'm afraid The Scholar hasn't overcome the curse of the second novel. In saying all that, I'm looking forward to reading McTiernan's third novel.

Those books are exciting. I'm even more impressed by authors who write stories about ordinary people, doing everyday, average people things. I guess I take comfort from other people's ordinariness? I'm not quite sure what it is that makes me appreciate these quaint, domestic novels so much, it must be the characters, as regardless of the genre, I always like novels with well-developed characters, people who are nuanced and flawed. It's been established long ago that Anne Tyler is brilliant at creating very realistic characters. Her latest offering is a great example of what an astute people observer she is. I ended up loving Willa Drake, the heroine of this novel. Deep down I wished I had more of her looking through rose-glasses personality. She may have come across as a bit of a push-over, with her cheerful disposition, willingness to please, making sure never to ruffle any feathers. She's a kind person, interesting in a non-showy way, but like many women, she put her kids and husband(s) ahead of her needs and dreams.Despite some sad moments, Clock Dance is an upbeat novel.

In the previous novel, The Rosie Effect, Don and his wife, Rosie, were living in New York and were preparing to become parents.Fast forward eleven years and the Tillmans have just moved back to Melbourne, Australia, where Don takes a position as a genetics professor at a university and Rosie becomes the lead researcher for a mental health project. Their son, Hudson, now eleven, has a hard time settling in in the new school. Meltdowns occur, problems at school, issues with making friends, irritating the teacher etc. The Tillmans are summoned to school to discuss Hudson's behaviour issues. In no uncertain terms, it's recommended they seek a professional assessment for autism. It wouldn't be the first time parents don't notice the obvious, no matter how educated they are. Both parents are conflicted.Due to a kerfuffle at the university, Don takes one year off without pay. That allows him to embark on the Hudson Project. The Hudson Project is made up of issues that need addressing, in order to guarantee Hudson's acceptance in high school and general wellbeing. Some of those include: helping Hudson making friends; increasing his competency with regards to catching a ball and other useful skills; and so on. Over the years, Don has learnt the importance of a good support system and he makes the most of his friends' skills and expertise. Don Tillman is one hell of a problem solver. I loved his methodical and logical approach to obtaining results. He's a very involved father. And a businessman, and a cocktail maker. He excels in many other areas. Who said that people on the spectrum are one horse ponies? If I have one criticism is that Don is better than most men I've come across, neurotypical or otherwise - but I'll let it pass, as this is a novel, not a non-fiction account. Graeme Simsion is one clever cookie. He addresses quite complex issues regarding Autism spectrum diagnosis that comes with the ""added benefit"" of being labelled as autistic and people making assumptions. Of course, the flipside is that by having a diagnostic one can excuse/explain certain behaviours. We are introduced to a couple of opposing views when it comes to interventions, even to Autism activists. Other issues touched upon are the double standards working mothers encounter, the ingrained sexism; anti-vaxing and anti-doctors attitudes (""Thanks"", America!). While this is a light read, there's a lot to ponder and learn. In conclusion, it was a joy to see what Don Tillman was up to now that he was a father. Without a doubt, he is one of my favourite literary male characters. We need more Don Tillmans in this world.Many thanks to Text Publishing for sending me a copy of this novel.

I didn't enjoy Jordan's Our Tiny Useless Hearts, but I wanted to try another novel.Addition was a much more enjoyable experience than the above-mentioned book. Thirty-five-year-old Grace Vandenburg is obsessive compulsively counting and has very strict routines that she follows adamantly. She loves numbers and her idol is Nikola Tesla. The nerd in me enjoyed the bits about Tesla that were interspersed throughout the novel. The guy was a genius! I enjoyed getting to know Grace. For someone so rigid, she sure had a sense of humour and could be self-deprecating. When she goes shopping she buys things in tens. When in the cashier line, she discovers she only places nine bananas in the basket. What to do, she doesn't want to miss her place in the line. So she steals one banana from the guy behind her. And that's how she meets Seamus O'Reilly.And that is where the cynic Bianca reappears. The dude was too good to be true. And Grace's behaviour was a bit contradictory to her usual self. I guess there wouldn't be much of a plot otherwise. With Seamus' help, Grace decides to address her issues and seek professional help. Will she be cured? Does she need to be cured? Do we all have to fit the mould? These are questions that Toni Jordon attempts to answer.So, if you're after quirky heroines and are interested in a light romantic read, give this one a go.Caroline Lee, one of my favourite Australian narrators, did a brilliant job, as always.

I'll try to express them here, although I'm sporting a headache and am not really in the mood to write a .I came across this novel and its author only three days ago, through a GR friend's raving . The literary raunchiness intrigued me, so I promptly borrowed it from my local library. The good bits:- I love the cover and the title;- I loved the French setting, beautifully described by Salter, especially the drub, wet and dark winter days. It's a very atmospheric novel. Some paragraphs were exquisite.The rest:- The narration was really strange, as it's told in the first person by a voyeur/friend of the main male character, the twenty-four-year-old American, Dean. Early on, this guy professes that it may not be true, or that it's a mix of his dreaming, imaginings and, maybe, reality. How would he know what really happened? This aspect of the novel really discombobulated me. I was on the look-out, paying attention to see where he's hiding. - There is a lot of repetitive sex, which was fine. It didn't do anything for me, if anything, it was all very unsexy. I personally didn't have any issues with the language or the acts. I just didn't feel the connection between Dean and his nineteen-year-old French lover, Anne-Marie. I many respects, they were like an old married couple, without the sex: drive around France, eat out, book a room somewhere, then have sex. Rince and repeat. There wasn't much dialogue, meeting of souls, flirting or playfulness. I didn't feel their chemistry at all. - There is some casual racism going on - it didn't bother me, as I could contextualise - it all takes place in the 1960s.- The secondary characters didn't add much to the story either.While I'm not sorry I read it, I'm still somewhat confused.

The only resolution I set in 2018 was to read 60 books, which was easily accomplished. I declared 2017 the Julian Barnes year, this year I’ll call it the year of the female author, not only because I read more books written by women (currently, it’s about 60:40 ratio female to male writers), but also because I’ve discovered and fell in love with the writing of some wonderful writers such as: Sarah Winman, Deborah Levy, Rebecca Kauffman and Maggie O’Farrell. I also listened to 4 Liane Moriarty audiobooks – her books never disappoint.According to Goodreads my average rating for this year is 3.8, which is not bad.

Luckily, my library had the ebook.No matter what genre book I read, what I care most about is the characters. Although this is a mystery/crime novel, it's very character driven.Two different stories are presented to us - one is that of Wyatt Rivers, a private investigator from Las Vegas and the other one is about Julianna Rosales - a nurse in Oklahoma City. They both had past experiences that were traumatic. Wyatt was the sole survivor in a robbery gone wrong when he was fifteen years old and worked in a local cinema house in Oklahoma. Julianna's older sister, Genevieve, disappeared without a trace from a fair, while the twelve-year-old Julianna was waiting for her sister to return so they could go home.Wyatt is asked to help the niece of a client, so he has to return to Oklahoma, the city he'd left twenty-six years ago. What was supposed to be an in and out job, turns out to be more complex. Of course, being back in OC brings back memories, old and new. So not only is Wyatt working the case he was paid to, but he's also trying to untangle the mystery of why he was the only survivor of that robbery. Alternatively, we hear about Julianna's unsettled life. Twenty-six years later, she still wants to know what had happened to her sister. When she's got a new lead, she pursues it. Will she finally get closure and some much-needed answers?I'll have to make a confession - I'm a big sucker for stories that in the beginning seem parallel but then come together at the end, like pieces of the same puzzle. So, without giving away too much, I was disappointed that that wasn't the case for this novel as well. On the other hand, in total opposition to what I've confessed above, I admire the writer's determination to not tie up everything in a nice bow. So, while I didn't enjoy this as much as November Road, it managed to reinforce my appreciation for Berney's writing, so I'll be reading more by him....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,Feb 2019,"Dec 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20663088-the-long-and-faraway-gone

Even though I haven't read any other O'Loughlin novels, my enjoyment wasn't at all diminished, as there was plenty of background information about the characters.Joe O'Loughlin is a psychologist. The past eighteen months have been hell, as his wife and mother of his two girls died due to post-surgical complications. On top of that, the poor Joe has Parkinson's disease.When his elderly father is discovered bashed in a home, lots of questions arise. Joe discovers a very different William O'Loaughlin. He can't help himself, so he takes it upon himself to find out who wanted his father dead, as it's apparent that it wasn't a robbery attempt.My favourite mystery/suspense/thrillers are those that are strong on the psychological aspects and don't have obvious plot holes. I've only read two Robotham novels, but I admire his ability to create complex, realistic characters whose motivations and actions make for a riveting read.I look forward to reading more Robotham novels.This goes towards my Aussie Author Challenge on www.bookloverbooks.com ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 28, 2018",Dec 2018,"Nov 28, 2018",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/40599117-the-other-wife

Isabella was the only woman in Maestro's workshop. Before tje war begins, Isabella and the English Freddie, who was also studying painting, get married. One of their friend and important character in this novel is Oskar, a German Jew, who ends up moving to Paris to become a dancer.Told via alternating points of view chapters, THe Way Back to Florence was The story is told via alternating chapters. We get Isabella's perspective, who's still in Florence where the situation is combustible, with Mussolini's fascists and German Nazis in charge. Her husband, Freddie is flying bombers for the British. They lost contact for years. I usually enjoy WWII novels and given that this happens in arty Florence, I was excited to read it. Unfortunately, it took me forever to get into this novel. I thought the alternating chapters with different points of view were clunky and jarring. There was too much unnecessary detail, too many characters that pop in and then disappear. There were too many chapters about Freddie flying bombers - they were repetitive and boring at times. I personally could have done with not reading about the detailed torture of one of Isabella's friends. Somehow, Isabella came out unscathed, despite witnessing some of it and being herself subjected to violence. Even though I became more engaged in the second half of the novel, I'm sad to say I had a hard time developing feelings for any of the characters. I think it had something to do with the extraneous details of bombers and planes, too many minor characters who bogged down the novel, and even the tone didn't quite work for me. Overall, The Way Back to Florence  was uneven and overly long.

As time went on, it got more and more incomprehensible to me, I couldn't quite understand that the heck Elizabeth Costello was going on about in her many talks, dissertations, lectures.

I mean this had everything without meaning much: vegetarianism/animals rights - I was oh, ok, interesting, I'm open to it - but it went all astray.There was a lecture on African literature - I found that interesting;What else? Oh, these huge rants between Elizabeth Costello and her very religious sister, now a nun in a South Africa. As a devout atheist, I thought, oh, this should be interesting. I thought both women were batshit crazy and, as it's the case with most religious/theological discussions where there are two opposed sides, nothing comes out of it, they were just talking at each other, all well argued with fancy words, but nobody was listening. There were many other subjects. I skipped ahead a bit just to see if this was going anywhere different. Nope. Elizabeth Costello was on another lecture yet again.My biggest gripe with this - whatever it is, as I can't quite call it a novel - is that I never really understood who Elizabeth Costello was, the person, not the intellectual automaton. Most women are more nuanced. Maybe Coetzee should have chosen to write all this from a male perspective, as Elizabeth Costello wasn't that believable. She was too cold and detached. She didn't seem human. It's also possible that she was losing her marbles?This book can be interpreted in a million and one ways. Some books you enjoy and have fun, some are informative, some you admire for their cleverness even though you don't necessarily enjoy them, I'm afraid, this one doesn't fall in any of the above categories, despite its intellectual highbrow lectures.

Forty-3.5 *Scrublands has been heavily marketed in Australia and it was compared to Jane Harper's The Dry due to being set in the Australian outback. Forty-year-old journalist, Martin Scarsden, is sent to Riversend to write about how the community is coping a year after a much-loved priest killed five men. The long-lasting drought has parched everything, including people's spirits. Slowly, Martin gets to know the policeman who shot dead the priest and a few other town people, including a beautiful young woman who owns a bookshop/cafe. As you'd expect, as otherwise there would be no point to the novel, Martin discovers all sort of things, including that nothing is as it seems. His article and discoveries make him first famous then infamous, so life gets complicated. Martin tries his best to untangle the many knots. This novel has lots of elements in it, arguably too many: there's a former special forces man, a priest who may or may not be a paedophile, dead backpackers, rape, affairs, drugs, bike gangs, hidden identities. I forgot to mention, Martin has PTSD following some unfortunate events from when he was a journalist in Gazza.Despite the many cliches, despite being too long and having too much crammed in, this was an interesting novel. The romantic affair wasn't necessary, truth be told, it read too much like an older man's wet dream. Sure, they're allowed to have them, I'm allowed to roll my eyes.When I began listening to this novel I thought to myself ""let me guess, there'll be rain at the end?"". Spoiler alert, the novel ends with one of the biggest cliches - rain as a cleansing/new beginning metaphor. In conclusion, Scrublands was enjoyable enough for me to spend over 13 hrs in its company.

Any Ordinary Day was quite interesting. I haven't read any books that looked at tragedy and how people cope and deal with the aftermath of such life-altering events. Sales interviews a few people who'd experienced tragedies, many of them implanted in the collective Australian minds thanks to the media interest. I appreciated Sale's candid look at journalism, at what makes a journalist good, how at times, there's a very thin line between getting the story and showing sociopathic traits.The takeaway for me is that ""s--t does happen to good people"", sometimes, more than once. There's no reason behind it. Most people are very resilient, beyond anything they could have imagined.

They're both twenty-six but they seem to have accomplished and done so much. Darcy has travelled the world, and works as a barmaid and does product photography, after closing down her wedding photography business. Tom has just branched out and is now his own boss in a new renovating/construction company. His first job is to renovate the run-down house that Darcy and her twin brother, Jamie, inherited from their grandmother. Speaking of Jamie, their relationship was strange and at times completely over-the-top, although it got better towards the end. The novel is replete with the unnecessary drama that could be easily resolved if people actually talked to each other, lots of angst, and convenient coincidences. The dialogue is clunky and I found myself cringing at times. Also, probably not very important, but I couldn't tell where the story was set, not even in what country. It was all very generic.Also, after a little while, Darcy's mentions of Tom's physique got tiresome. I don't know how many times she mentioned his t-shirts moulding on his six-pack abdomen. Oh, and he's so tall and handsome. She's drooling all over the guy, who in turn is apparently unaware of his good looks - yeah, right!I'm sorry to be negative, but I can't think of anything positive to say about this novel.99 Percent Mine is 99 percent forgettable and it will join the ranks of many other meah contemporary romance novels.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .This novel goes towards my Aussie Author Challenge on www.bookloverbooks.com ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Dec 30, 2018","Nov 07, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36300625-99-percent-mine

It's about a hapless chap, Philip Ashley, who was raised by his kind cousin, Ambrose, who, while travelling to Italy met and married, Rachel, therefore becoming Phillip's cousin. Ambrose's untimely death in Italy left Philip shaken and suspicious of cousin Rachel. Some letters written by Ambrose made Philip suspicious of Rachel.When she comes to England to visit, she's like nothing Philip imagined. She's relatively young, petite, demure, elegant and wise. The naive and inexperienced Philip finds himself mesmerised by her. The neighbours and servants are charmed as well. But is it possible that Cousin Rachel did have something to do with Ambrose's death?Written from Philip's point of view, this novel served to reinforce my appreciation for du Maurier's talent. It's much more mundane and less atmospheric than Jamaica Inn, but it's nevertheless a very enjoyable read.The audiobook was narrated by Jonathan Pryce, who was excellent....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 06, 2018","Nov 11, 2018","Nov 06, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/27108770-my-cousin-rachel

She herself is an accomplished cello player, not that anyone close to her has heard her play. Not even her lover of eight years, the charming David, who happens to have a wife and kids in Paris. Grace is always ready to drop whatever she's doing to meet with David whenever and wherever he's available. The crumbs he's offering are delicious. He was in many ways almost perfect - good-looking, generous, knew her very well and made her feel special. When David commits a bravery act, their lives turn upside down. It appears things were not as they seemed. Grace's devastated. Luckily, she has two unlikely friends to help her through her heartbreak: an eighty-something year old gentleman, who comes by her shop for coffee and a chat and her spirited, angst-ridden teenage assistant, who's becoming a very good violin player herself. While the story itself has been done before, what made it special, for me anyway, were all the details about playing music, instrument making, Cremona and its string instrument awards.

While it The Trauma Cleaner is a one-of-a-kind pseudo-biography about Sandra Pankhurst, who's been working as a trauma cleaner for over twenty years. While it does discuss trauma cleaning, this book is much more than that - it's about Sandra's Pankhurst life, which has had more ups and downs than most of us can even imagine. Adopted as a baby boy by a couple in the '50s, she was beaten, ignored, isolated and kicked out of the house.Sandra was a son, a husband, a father, a drag queen, a sex worker, one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery in Australia; she had businesses fail, relationships with men; she was even married to a man for fourteen years. As you can imagine, Sandra has some stories to tell.Krasnostein has spent over three years trying to get to know Sandra, tagging along cleaning jobs, interviewing a few people, attempting to piece together the puzzle this woman is. It's fair to say that we all are unreliable narrators, especially when our own lives are concerned. Sandra Pankhurst is the ultimate unreliable narrator, especially since she'd lost years of memories, some probably repressed, but mostly due to damage to her brain caused by years of heavy doses of hormones, drugs and alcohol.While I'm not a huge consumer of biographies and memoirs, I've read my fair share. Krasnostein's debut is worthy of the success and awards it's been garnering. First of all, its central character is a very interesting person; second, it's written with a lot of consideration, trying to do justice to Sandra Pankhurst, without photoshopping the less favourable aspects of her personality. Also, Krasnostein's writing is wonderfully lyrical at times, which was totally unexpected, and a pleasant surprise, for a book in this category. Written with warmth and eloquence, The Trauma Cleaner is an extremely readable non-fiction book that is riveting, heartbreaking at times, but also life-affirming. We are all damaged and have the potential to cause damage. Some of us crack, others break, there's no way of knowing...Anyway, read this.NB: The audiobook was top notch.Here's a link with Sandra Pankhurst (I hope it's not Region locked) https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video...Link to podcast with the author:https://www.betterreading.com.au/podc...This goes towards my Aussie Authors Challenge on www.http://bookloverbooks.com...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Oct 31, 2018","Nov 05, 2018","Oct 31, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34964868-the-trauma-cleaner

I loved Rebecca which I read many years ago, in translation. I've sort of forgotten what a wonderful writer du Maurier was.The writing was scrumptious, with descriptions out of this world. I'll repeat what many others stated before me - this was a very atmospheric novel.Besides the stunning descriptions, the characters were multi-layered and diverse. Mary Yallan, the heroine of this novel, was only twenty-three when she became an orphan. After selling everything she goes to Bodmin to live with her Aunt Patience and her husband, the proprietor of Jamaica Inn. Aunt Patience is no longer the vibrant and happy woman Mary knew, but a much older looking woman, frightened and weak. The cause of this change is her brute of a husband, the giant Joss Merlyn, who's an alcoholic and a bully. Oh, how I loved Mary. She's earnest, stoic and tremendously self-assured. She won't be bullied. She concedes to some of her uncle's demands as she wants to rescue her aunt from the hands of her domineering husband. Can you help somebody who doesn't want to be helped?There are a few other characters who come to play a role in this story. One of them is Jem Merlyn, her uncle's much younger brother. He's a charming rascal, given to stealing horses. He's in many ways like his brother while also being very different. Mary is discombobulated by his brazenness, although she holds her own. Another man who comes to Mary's help on different occasions is the albino Vicar of Altarnun, Francis Davey. He's kind and caring and Mary finds herself confiding in him about the hardships at Jamaica Inn. There's also a small cast of drunk men who hang around uncle Joss, carrying out illegal business.Will Mary save her aunt Patience and herself from the inhospitable Jamaica Inn is?

It's a very atmospheric novel, I found myself seeing everything and everyone very clearly as if I was watching a film. I have some grumbles as well: there are quite a few secondary characters that are put there just as fillers, I didn't think they added that much to the story.

All over the world, people were slipping away from where they had been, from once fertile plains cracking with dryness, from seaside villages gasping beneath tidal surges, from overcrowded cities and murderous battlefields, and slipping away from other people too, people they had had in some cases loved ... Exit West is a small but powerful novel, that has at its centre two young people, Saeed and Nadia. They live in an unnamed Middle Eastern country. I confess I've always thought of it as Syria. The two young people meet at a university course. Saeed is traditional and religious. Nadia is a free spirit, who wouldn't toe the line, she doesn't even pray. Circumstances and Saeed's perseverance bring the two together. Life in their city takes a turn for worse when the government and the militants fight more and more. They need to escape that hellish place, with no electricity, running water, food, a place where people get killed for all sort of random reasons. Leaving Saeed's kind father behind, they use doors that will transport them to somewhere better. First stop-over is on the island of Mykonos. It's scary and humiliating and they sleep in a tiny tent on the margins of the refugee community. Eventually, they make it to London, they take residence in a big mansion. They're not the only inhabitants there, there are many other people from different parts of the world. The things we take for granted become luxuries - having a hot bath; using a fluffy towel and washing one's clothes.; sleeping indoors, on a bed. Hamid did a great job showing us the refugees' struggles, the many hurdles they have to jump over, the humiliations and the shame. I also liked how well he was able to show the disintegration of a love relation, I thought that was exquisite. I'm glad I finally read this novel. I thought it was well done, relevant and original.

As you can tell from my rating, the fantasy part didn't prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this novel.Lucy is thirty-eight years old and is working on a dissertation on Sappho. It's not going particularly well. Her long-term relationship with Jamie, who was commitment phobic, implodes. Gripped by anxiety, self-doubt, and despair, Lucy finds herself depressed and aimless. On top of that, she assaults her-ex, so she's forced to go to counselling so he wouldn't press charges.When her half-sister, Annika, asks her to take a break and come house-sit and look after her dog in Los Angeles, Lucy accepts. Her sister also enrolled her in a therapy group for love addicts.Although she's supposed to abstain from any sexual relationships for a while, Lucy can't seem to find peace even in her sister's idyllic house on Venice beach, in the company of the adorable dog, Dominic. She goes on Tinder dates, which turn up to be unsatisfactory, although the prepping and anticipation gave her new energy - feeling wanted and desired is euphoric. As it's many times the case, when somebody wants you, somebody else will likely want you, so her ex, Jamie, is back on the scene because he misses her.There's also a beautiful swimmer who Lucy met while walking on the beach. They meet by the rocks. It turns out he's a merman. But he's so understanding, generous and so sexy. She gets under his spell and falls head over heels in love with him. He's the most exquisite lover and their lovemaking is out of this world. Lucy experiences sexual pleasure like she's never had before. Given her addictive personality, it doesn't take long for things to spiral out of control.Despite its fantastical aspects, this novel is contemporary, fresh and relevant. Loneliness, disconnection, aimlessness, mental health problems are captured brilliantly by Melissa Broder. We are all crazy in some ways, it's so easy to ""lose it"", it can happen to anyone at any time.The Pisces is a very introspective novel, intelligent and honest. And very gross, at times. There's a multitude of blow-by-blow descriptions of sex acts and other things involving bodily functions and fluids. I am not normally a fan, but in this case, it didn't bother me, it just added another layer of authenticity. Besides, it's a refreshing contrast to other fiction genres where the sex is always great and multiorgasmic. I shouldn't focus on the sex - this novel is excellent, with or without the carnal bits.Not every novel works for everyone, this one will probably garner some hate.I'm in the I love and appreciate it camp. I definitely want to read more by Broder.A big shout-out to Isabella Inchbald who did a great job narrating this novel....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Oct 11, 2018","Oct 14, 2018","Oct 11, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32871394-the-pisces

I was surprised to discover that he was British, I've always assumed he was American. I own his Magpie Murders, but haven't read it yet, despite having seen the raving s. I haven't read anything quite like The Word is Murder before. Horowitz is inserting himself into the narrative in a very original way. While I haven't yet Googled him, it all felt real. I mean we know about his Alex Rider novels, him writing the script for the TV series Foyle's War (haven't watched it) and many other accomplishments. I loved hearing so much about his writing process, how book deals are done, about his agent and so on. In many other ways, this is a classic crime novel, with a collection of possible suspects and the motive for the crime(s) being not what first believed.Former detective Daniel Hawthorne is a cantankerous, closed character, with an extraordinary mind. I enjoyed the occasionally antagonistic relationship between Horowitz and Hawthorne. I can't wait to find out where Horowitz will go with Hawthorne #2.Anyway, this was smart, engaging and not unnecessarily long.

So, yeah, we are a complex, crazy bunch, sometimes we feel ""too much"", give too much, expect too much, and definitely do too much. We are also extremely apt at splitting hairs and dwelling on things and agonising over what others might perceive as unimportant things etc. Details matter to us; we have insecurities that we take on others, usually other women, whom we judge, sometimes harshly. Some say it's got an anthropological explanation, including the damn patriarchy. Anyway, things are complicated and complex, something that Nicola Moriarty manages to convey brilliantly in this novel. Social media is a conduit for connectivity but also for causing trouble. It offers women a way of connecting, but then cliques are formed and they can get nasty. Mothers vs non-mothers, criticising each other, not really seeing each others' points of view or merits. Mothers who fantasize not being mothers, not having to make a million and one decisions, not having to put up with the constant demands of little people, the demands of work, school, home - feeling that there's nothing left of themselves. The non-mothers, having to defend constantly their choice not to be mothers - because, there are women who choose not to become mothers - but society still has an issue with that. Go figure! They don't care much if a man chooses not to become a father, but should a woman be childless, is she still a woman, is she still whole etc. It's funny how we expect everyone to be like us, is it so that they reinforce the fact that we made the right choice? Why do we care if someone doesn't toe the line? Anyway, I'm going on a tangent, again ...This was my first Nicola Moriarty novel and it was well worth my time. In case you're wondering, Nicola and Liane are sisters. If I remember correctly, there's another sister who's a writer. That's one good gene pool! The messages I took away from this novel are universal: we all have crap in our lives, we all think the grass is greener on the other side, and ... don't post anything on social media when you're angry and/or under the influence - things can go crrraaazzzzy.Anyway, I'll make sure to read more by Nicola Moriarty as I found this relatable and quite enjoyable.This goes towards my Aussie Authors Challenge 2018 on www.bookloverbooks.com ...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Oct 05, 2018","Oct 09, 2018","Oct 05, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/35230472-those-other-women

Is it just my impression or are most self-help books written by Americans? The only non-American self-help books I remember coming across were the Marie Kondo ones. Is it because Americans think they know it best, therefore, must share? Is it because of the constant strive for self-improvement, the you-can-be-anything-you-want-to-be mantra, which creates the demand? Or is my view skewed due to being on Goodreads?

Romance novels are written almost exclusively by women; their audience is almost exclusively women. Then why is it that most of them, pointing a finger especially at the contemporary new adult romance genre, are following and reinforcing those patriarchal views of the nice girl, preferably virgin, who, of course, turns out to be a sex goddess, then there's the jock, who just changes his personality for a girl. It's like they have a personality disorder, even when allowing for the ""love is blind"", ""love gives you wings"" blah blah... In other words, if you want to see how entrenched the patriarchy is, read these novels written by women for women. Apparently, even our escapist fantasies have moulded into the male ones ...

These are questions that Iris Lockard is trying to find the answers to as she finds herself the guardian of this unknown woman who turns out to be her great-aunt.Esme Lennox's story is a tragic one and it brings up how easily men, and families, disposed of the women who didn't conform, who were different. I thought to myself, this novel is going to gut me and leave me emotionally deplete. Incredibly enough, it didn't happen. It had many ingredients that made it very readable, some confusing paragraphs, side romances and a brusque, vague ending, which was anti-climatic.

Maggie is a busybody, helpful, chatty, well-meaning, a bit scattered at times. She's constantly fretting over her kids and the grandchild she doesn't get to see anymore. She wants to help and fix people's relationships. Ira is the ""level-headed"" one, a bit taciturn, serious, almost permanently annoyed with his wife's chattering, interference, and small manipulations (and he's not even aware of half of them). That old adage ""familiarity breeds contempt"" is plenty apparent. - the Morans squabble and get annoyed with each other; they misunderstand each other, jump to conclusions, see things differently. - the main themes of marriage, raising children, expectations/dreams vs reality are very well done. - there's humour, there's mundanity, but most importantly, the characterizations are excellent.- as much as I like to think that I'm unique and cool and all that (I AM! ;-)), in a way, we are all cliches and have stereotypical attitudes, behaviours, (pre)determined by our genetic makeup, gender and societal norms and roles....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Aug 03, 2018","Aug 08, 2018","Aug 03, 2018",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31181.Breathing_Lessons

He had been shot The day Somebody McSomebody put a gun to my breast and called me a cat and threatened to shoot me was the same day the milkman died. He had been shot by one of the state hit squads and I did not care about the shooting of this man. And so it begins – one of the most extraordinary novels I’ve ever read. I got what I call “the giddiness” early on, but gave myself a talking down to not get ahead of myself, because really, can anyone sustain such a high level of interestingness for three hundred plus pages? Written in the first person, through the eyes of an eighteen-year-old, who refers to herself as the middle sister, Milkman is very original. The setting is an unnamed place, somewhere in Northern Ireland during the 1970's Troubles.The characters in this novel don’t have names, in the traditional way, but they are easily recognisable, I never got confused.Speaking of characters, they're interesting, diverse and unusual. There’s Milkman who’s not really a milk man, he’s married, forty and he’s taken to stalking our protagonist. There’s also the real milkman who delivers milk and is also a friend of the family. There’s a maybe-boyfriend because they’re having a maybe-relationship. There’s ma who’s pious, hardened by life and who doesn’t trust our protagonist; pa, who had suffered from mental health issues, is dead now. The wee sisters are eight, nine and ten, they’re extremely intelligent and always together. There’s Somebody McSomebody who stalks her and can’t accept that she’s not interested. There’s the third brother in law, a man who’s in awe of women and who’s a compulsive runner, just like our protagonist. There’s even an issues women group aka the feminists. There’s the renouncers or those who take the republican side; there’s also a more vague category the beyond-the-pales those who society have deemed too different.Our protagonist is apolitical, so much so, she takes refuge in reading mostly nineteen century literature. She’s trying her best to go unnoticed. She’s not pro or against anything. She doesn’t like to gossip, but that doesn’t stop others gossiping about her. People are put off by her walking and reading. Also, they think she’s the Milkman’s mistress. The absurdity of it all compels her to keep quiet, why have to explain herself and deny something that’s untrue? When she finally denies it, nobody believes her, not even her ma. Life becomes hell for the middle sister, as she joins the ranks of the beyond the pale.Milkman is a dense novel, with some of the longest paragraphs I’ve ever read (with perfect punctuation, kudos to Ms Burns and/or editors). It’s both very readable and hard work. This was the closest I’ve ever come to completing/staying with a mindfulness exercise (in case you can’t tell from my all-over-the-place, unedited s, I have a very ADD brain). I didn’t mind taking my time with this novel, as I wanted to savour every line, turn of phrase, tangent and thought bubble. The writing is exquisite, playful, smart, insightful and all together bonkers, in a good way. The times were bonkers. The constant surveillance, suspicion, the imminence of death, affect everything and everyone. Everything is seen as a political statement. What you do and don’t do is labelled. There’s no escaping. The sense of self is easily eroded. There’s so much to ponder and unpack. I am gobsmacked by this novel’s originality and complexity. I loved living in the eighteen-year old’s head. She may have come across as aloof and impenetrable, but she saw and understood more than anyone around. I even related to certain situations, despite having a different nationality. Somehow, in spite of the serious themes and undercurrents, this novel was quite amusing at times, not the slapstick kind of funny, but the kind derived from the absurdity of situations and people’s reactions.This is where I gush about the importance of awards, especially for literary fiction, which seems to have become a niche genre. I read somewhere that each of the Man Booker short-listed novels sold less than six thousand copies in the UK. Had it not been for the Man Booker Prize, I, like many others, would have never come across this incredible novel. That would have been a shame.Ms Burns, I take a bow and thank you for the words....more",Notes are private!,0,149,1,"Nov 13, 2018","Nov 21, 2018","Jul 26, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36047860-milkman

That they are "" ordinary people"" is even more disconcerting, especially to kids.Two very different families live on the same street, in an Australian lower-middle-class suburb (I can't remember if the city/town was named). Rex Jenson, his wife and two boys, Colt and Bastian, have just moved into the neighbourhood. They're an affluent family, the kids have lots of toys and gadgets, and a pool. On the other end of the socio-economic spectrum are the Kileys, made up of Elizabeth, a stay-at-home mum, her blue-collar, violent and alcoholic husband, Joe, and their six children, ranging in age between two to twelve year old, Freya. This novel is written through two twelve year old's eyes, Freya Kiley and Colt Jenson. They are both going through their own realisations about their parents. They are not necessarily happy to discover how flawed their parents are.I haven't had much success with Aussie kids characters, as sometimes I find them too grown-up and unconvincing. I never doubted these kids and didn't raise my metaphorical eyebrow once. It is a difficult read, about domestic violence and paedophilia. I was impressed by Hartnett's writing and her restraint. She also avoided creating those omniscient, know-it-all kid characters, who don't exist outside a novel's page. What she did brilliantly was to capture the kids' vulnerabilities, their struggles and impotence. Golden Boys is a small but powerful novel, nuanced, realistic and a bit different.

You see, he grew up in an orphanage not knowing who his parents were.It's 1976, full-blown flower power era. Except that it didn't make it to Mulderrig whose inhabitants are still very conservative, wary of strangers, set in their ways, steeped in religion and superstitions.Mahoney has a special gift, he sees dead people, except for his mother. He didn't know whether she'd left town, as some people were saying, or if she had had an early demise. The flamboyant Mrs Coley, an older former actress, takes Mahoney under her wing and she becomes a Mrs Maple of sorts. She's intelligent and canny and knows everything and everyone. I loved her character.There's an evil, weasel-like priest. And a mean black widow. Plus many other characters.

I even went to see the author speak to a packed room at the Perth Writers' Festival, so I was somewhat invested.I won't go into too many details about the plot.Boy Swallows Universe is a coming of age novel, about Eli Bell, who is brought up in a rough part of Brisbane, by his drug peddling and occasional user mum, and her boyfriend, Lyle. This novel has a very distinct Australian feel to it, it almost feels put on, although people in the know say it's pretty accurate for 1990s Queensland.Boy Swallows Universe is filled with characters from the wrong side of the tracks, people, most of us have never come across. Among all these people, the brothers Bell, Eli and his elder sibling, Gus, try to survive the best way they can. Their mum is not the most stable person, although she loves them. Their father is an alcoholic agoraphobe who suffers from anxiety and depression. In my view, this novel is quite obviously a debut, as it's self-conscious while trying to be cruisy and quirky. There are some good writing passages and quite a few interesting things fill this overly long novel. But they are vignettes, many times, they stand alone, as we move onto the next chapter quite abruptly. Eli and his brother are charming characters, albeit too saintly.There are many aspects of the novel that are exaggerated and some were outright incredulous, which doesn't really work for me.So, in conclusion, this was not bad, but I never felt completely invested, charmed or horrified.

I'm sorry to say, I see no point in these mythological stories, reimagined or not, besides being self-indulgent exercises for the authors to showcase their writing prowess. I have nothing against re-imaginings, re-interpretations, as long as they stand alone on their own feet. I don't think that my disenchantment with this novel had anything to do with my not knowing the original stories.I did feel the characters' pain, anguish, fear, need for revenge because of Toibin's beautiful writing. It's just that I didn't want to read about a father ordering his daughter's sacrifice so that the gods would blow wind into their sails so they could go to sea and battle others.The female characters, the mother, Clytemnestra, and her younger daughter, Electra, were much better developed. Their POVs were stronger. Orestes, the son of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, has a voice in this novel as well. His POV was less affecting.So, while I can't say this novel was riveting, it worked as an enticement to read something else by Toibin.

I'll have to wait until September for a new novel to be published. To be honest, I've been tired of that old memory loss trope, but I got over it very quickly, because of Moriarty's brilliant writing, relatable characters and thought-provoking situations.Imagine hitting your head and not remembering the last ten years of your life. I doubt it's possible, but we'll let it slide, as it's a brilliant plot device, aptly used by Moriarty. That's what happened to Alice Love. She wakes up and thinks she's still 29, pregnant with her first child and married to Nick. She's about to turn 40, has three children and is separated from Nick. She's now a highly motivated, very organised, gym crazed, busy mother of three, not the shy, happy-go-lucky Alice of ten years ago. When her sister, Elizabeth, tells her that she's separated from Nick and that she's a mother of three she's flabbergasted. As she finds out things about the ""new"" Alice, she's taken aback by some of her new personality traits. There are things that she admires about the new her, of course, like her slim fit body and the very elegant wardrobe and very organised home. The situation with Nick, her husband, is strained, there's a lot of animosities, that Alice can't remember or comprehend. Nick was sweet, she always needed Nick's opinions on everything, they had so much fun together. Who's this middle-aged, defensive and bitter man? What's happened to them? Well, I dare say many of us, married with children, will recognise the scenario, at least some aspects of it.As always, Moriarty puts up a huge mirror and you'll see either your reflection or the reflections of people you know. Her characters and their stories are hugely relatable. Through Alice's sister, Elizabeth, Moriarty brings to the forefront the issue of infertility and what a mental, physical and financial toll it has on those struggling to have a biological child. There's also a very interesting honorary grandmother, Frannie, who lives in a retirement home and is keeping a blog. The ending was a bit surprising. I'll leave it at that for fear of spoilers.This was another satisfying, engaging, relatable read from the sublime Ms Moriarty. I'm so looking forward to Nine Perfect Strangers.This book goes towards my Aussie Author Challenge 2018 on www.bookloverbooks.com ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"May 25, 2018","May 30, 2018","May 25, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6469165-what-alice-forgot

I wanted to like The Eight Mountains much more than I did. But it was soooo slow going, which normally I don't have a problem with, it's just that the writing kept me from engaging and having any feelings, besides boredom. I can easily do slow in literature if the writing is outstanding. While this was competently written, it didn't wow me. When I think of Italy and Italians I think of passion, lots of talking, gesticulating, eating, being impulsive etc. When it came to The Eight Mountains one could be forgiven for forgetting this was about Italian people. Of course, it's nice to have the stereotypes shaken. Its Italianess could have been lost in translation. Regardless, Cognetti's writing and the story didn't engage me and, unfortunately, I didn't care much about any of the characters.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,"May 21, 2018","May 20, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36709372-the-eight-mountains

My love for him, better said for his wit, humour, intelligence, sarcasm, curiosity, observation skills and snark, has reached its highest level and after all these years it's still intact.This book is a collection of weekly columns penned by Bryson between 1996-98. Dated, right? Or is it? Let's see: - mass incarceration for minor offences, injustice, the death penalty issues relating to the immense costs, inequality of who gets put to death and most importantly, people wrongly convicted - still current and getting worse;- airline companies not doing a very good job as service providers - check- people being dumber and dumber, and the increasing trend of dumbing down - check- too much choice, too much of anything, over-consumerism, disregard for the environment and conserving resources - check- mindless shopping - check- having a million and one TV channels and nothing to watch - check.I'm guessing most people still have to drive everywhere as most places don't make any allowances for pedestrians? Things that have changed: desktop computers seem to have put the serial numbers in more accessible places :-), oh, and who remembers the last time they spoke to a real person in a company about installing/setting up anything you bought from them?While listening to this, I couldn't help wonder ""what would Bryson make of today's this and that"".

I read ""sWhen I was young(er) I used to look disdainfully at comedies and comedians, as if they were lesser forms of art and performers respectively. I read ""serious"" books and watched arthouse dramas. Comedies were for the plebs. Luckily, I'm always willing to change my opinions when called for.In the last fifteen years or so, after consuming huge quantities of stand-up and funny movies (there are a lot of moronic comedies out there - I'm looking at you Adam Sandler and few of your pals) I've concluded that comedians are some of the smartest people around. After all, it's much more difficult to make people laugh than cry, especially given how subjective humour is. The only TV I watch these days is on demand and most of it it's made up of political and news satire shows, some stand-up specials and the occasional series or movie. I first saw Magda Szubanski in Kath and Kim, a very popular TV series about a particular type of suburban Melburnian. As many Australians would attest, this was one of the most popular Australian series ever. Many had seen Magda in her previous incarnations in various other comedies, TV sketches and variety programs. She's a terrific actor with a uncanny ability to change looks, voice and accents. The rest of the world would know Szubanski via the very popular movie, Babe.Magda is much more than her perceived funny overweight woman persona. I don't know why I was so surprised to discover that she's a gifted writer as well. After all, she'd written some of the material she performed.She's also a very sensitive soul, who's fought her father's demons and her own. For many years she kept her sexuality out of the public domain, until 2012 when she finally came out as gay. Since then she'd become a prominent figure for the equal rights movement. For those of you who missed the news, in 2017 Australia become one of the many countries in the world to allow same-sex marriage.I enjoyed this memoir a great deal. I loved that it wasn't focused on her acting career, it wasn't the type of name-dropping memoir that so many famous/celebrities put out. We are made by our parents and families and by our experiences. Magda shows herself through the people closest to her and through some of her experiences. As a new immigrant to Australia, Magda was keen to discover more about her Polish roots via her father, and the Scottish-Irish ones through her mom. Both parents, but especially her father, want to leave the past behind. She did know that her father had killed people during the War, but she didn't know the details. She only discovers them later in life. Reckoning is a fascinating story of self-discovery, of finding one's roots, and through it all, of self-acceptance. All the accolades are very well deserved.Highly recommend itThis goes towards my Aussie Authors Challenge 2018 on www.bookloverbooks.com ...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"May 07, 2018","May 15, 2018","May 07, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25875588-reckoning

No other writer makes me feel as uncomfortable as Koch's writing does. I can make this generalisation now that I read, well, listened to, three of his books.How I felt about this novel could be summarised by the following ""eloquent"" expressions: ""Ewww"", ""Oh, No, you didn't just think/say that!?"", ""WOW"", ""Holly $%&t"", plus a few more unsavoury thoughts about men, that I will spare you (You're welcome ;-) ).Our unreliable narrator and protagonist is Dr. Marc Schlosser, a general practitioner, who dislikes his patients, seeing their ugly bodies, with their saggy, hairy, moist places where the sun doesn't shine. (Don't shoot the messenger, Koch is much more descriptive). The dude is not very kind towards fat people, people who drink (as someone who is over the glorification of ""getting pissed"" as some sort of virtue, I found his stance on drinking and hardened livers somewhat refreshing, although, I've never heard of livers exploding). Koch is great at unravelling the contradictions of the human nature, the dichotomy of thought and action. Most characters are unlikeable, but the men are horrible, despicable, deplorable, vile, and/or pathetic. If you're after a feel-good story, don't pick one of Koch's novels. If you like being challenged, surprised, horrified, grossed out, and also don't mind hearing some unspeakable, unlikeable opinions, then you'll enjoy, better said, appreciate Koch's twisted mind.

I was. Olivia Law is 45 and the quintessential blonde TV news reader. She lives in Sydney, in a modern, sterile house with her businessman husband, David. They live parallel lives and haven’t been intimate for over two years. In an attempt to win him back, Olivia makes a drunk video, in the nude, and talks about their sex life and her sexual fantasies. The video becomes public and immediately Olivia loses her job and gets sued by the Network. While she’s down, her husband announces he’s divorcing her.Olivia escapes to Byron Bay, to her best friend’s place. There she meets some interesting characters, the owner of a sex shop chain, who’s worldly and very charming; a good looking vet etc. She’s trying to figure out who she truly is. There were many things that I liked about this novel. It addresses the discrimination and double standards that women face in the media and not only. It also talks a lot about sex and women’s sexual fantasies, regardless of age. I know, who knew that middle-aged and older women had sexual fantasies?The novel is very light and breezy. Besides women’s sexual fantasies, The Upside of Over has lots of mouth-watering food porn. Realistically, while Olivia had her life turned upside down, being in her privileged position is enviable: still looking good, no kids, moving to Byron Bay, staying in some fancy properties, having a tough lawyer to look after your interests, good friends and a rich man who’s very keen on you. To top it all off, she even has the two gay best friends, who are amazing cooks and very supportive. Where can I find me one or two of those? While I enjoyed this novel, I felt that some parts were rushed and under-developed. Nevertheless, The Upside of Over was a fun, cheeky beach read.I received this novel from the publishers via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

It's been marketed quite heavily in Australia, there was a lot of excitement about it,The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart is Holly Ringland's debut novel. It's been marketed quite heavily in Australia, there was a lot of excitement about it, so I had to read it to see if the hype was deserved.It's a beautifully crafted book, with not only a gorgeous cover but also each chapter has the drawing of an Australian native flower and a bit of information about it. It was very well done, so kudos to the book designers.This is a coming of age story. Alice Hart's father is a violent, volatile man. When Alice was nine years old, something horrific occurs which will see her sent to live on a wildflower farm, with her paternal grandmother she didn't know existed. I loved the description of Thornton and the way it was run, exclusively by women, for whom Thornton was a sanctuary and a refuge. I was looking forward to getting to know more of the women on the farm. But midway through, the novel takes a different turn and sort of loses its way, pretty much like Alice. A well-written, credible coming of age story, with elements of domestic abuse, its consequences and surviving it, turns into a melodramatic mess. I can't stand it when characters/people create unnecessary dramas by not talking to each other, and in this case, it was completely over-the-top, inexplicable and incredulous. I realise it was necessary to create conflict, but I didn't buy it and I found it frustrating.There were also things that an editor should have picked. It's a contemporary novel, there's Google, still, there is letter writing happening and going to the post office to mail a letter or get the mail. Those old tropes - ""I wrote you so many letters over the years"" - here's a novel idea (insert sarcasm, if you really want to find someone, if you know the address, drive/fly there - or ""it's not my story to tell"". Honestly, the second part of the novel is a rushed jumble, which I found even more irritating since I was so taken with the first two hundred pages.I shouldn't be so harsh, as this is a debut novel.

I do not read many dystopian novels, but I was attracted to this one as I understood it to be a reversed ""Handmaid's Tale"". And it was, in many ways.The Fortress is a female-run enclosure with its own rules. The men that enter it are called supplicants and they have to leave all ego and demands and do what they're told by the Woman. Some of the men there are Isvestyii - the unredeemable, ie the psychopaths, the paedophiles, whom the society sends to the Fortress where the Woman has control over their lives.The main character of this novel is Jonathon Bridge, forty-two, a corporate executive, cocky, determined and uncaring, with a beautiful wife and a child on the way. He doesn't think much about his work dalliances with interns and other subordinates, he and others like him, assume it as their given right to indulge in the young and willing. When his wife finds out, she kicks him out. The only way for him to have a chance at getting back together is to spend a year in the Fortress.This novel had a very interesting premise. The world building was interesting, albeit I can't say I got fully immersed in it, but that could be because of my limited imagination. I was more interested in the whys and the how come. We get the answers in the last quarter of the novel. I expected to really enjoy this - men being made to work hard, controlled in every way, including being used for sex by the women whenever and however they chose. Wonderful, right? There was something missing and that inhibited my full immersion in the story. The day to day workings of the Fortress and most of the middle part were a bit uninteresting to me. I was going through the motions but I didn't feel much, I was waiting for things to happen. They start happening much more towards the last quarter. I thought the female characters in the Fortress were quite muddled, I never got a sense of who they were. Somewhat ironically, although the women had the power, the main character of the novel was a man. It was all about Jonathon. Sure, he is a very realistic character, we all know men like him. He's the quintessential white, middle-aged, successful man, aka the man. There is character growth, which is the point of the journey.The Fortress is an original novel.

There were many things I liked about this novel, besides its relatability. I appreciated Forman daring to write about a mother - ""the saintest (not a word) of saints"" - who just packs her bags and leaves - husband, kids(!) and job. I hear the outcry - who could she? After all, she was middle class, living in New York, with twins, after several IVF rounds, good job, a decent husband whom she still loved but also hated for always taking ""the easy way out"" - she had it so much better than many. Well, that makes me appreciate Forman's guts much more than if she wrote about a battered woman. Oh, I forgot the mention it: the woman, mother, wife had a heart attack at 44 and a double bypass. So much fun! The middle and the later part got better, more characters are added, new friends are made, a nice doctor appears on the scene.

Will anyone come to their rescue?Jock Seron wrote a compelling, riveting novel that just got better and better as it progressed. The characterisations were fantastic. Surprisingly enough, I've never read a book on this very contemporary issue. Serong gets extra brownie points for daring to write a political novel focusing on an issue which is highly divisive.

The story is set in Italy, during the interbellum, World War II and post-war. First and foremost, it's a story of survival and family.Life is difficult, many are poor, they have too many children to feed. Women are second-class citizens. Men and religion rule.Getting married is all a young woman aspires to. It's a business transaction of sorts. Love is an afterthought, a luxury.

He’s become one of my favourite writers, so it’s always exciting to read something new from him.Us Against You continues to delve into the lives of some of Beartown’s inhabitants. We are acquainted with many of them from his previous novel, Beartown (also known as Scandal in other countries).Again, at the centre of this novel we have the Beartown Hockey Team manager – Peter Andersson, his lawyer wife, Kira, their kids, Maya, 16 and Leo, 12. What happened to Maya in the past year still affects her, her family and, to a certain extent, the entire town. The only thing that makes Beartown tick is hockey, but they’re about to lose that as well. Many players had moved to the bigger neighbouring town, Hed. There’s conflict between the two towns stemming from hockey rivalry but also due to socio-economic issues. Add a sociopathic, master manipulator politician to the mix and we’ve got yourself an explosive mixture. We reacquaint ourselves with some of the hockey players we met in Beartown : Benji, the excellent hockey player, who’s in the closet; Amat – the immigrant, very talented player and his best friend, Bobo, hardworking, less talented but with a heart of gold. Benji gets more play time on the pages of this novel, I personally didn’t mind, as he was intriguing in so many ways. There are some new characters, who are given more or less air-time.I loved the pacing of the book and how Backman kept adding layer, upon layer, upon layer, creating a tower of tension about to topple.This is another ambitious novel that deals with trauma, parenting, friendship, small town mentalities, homophobia, sexism, and politics. Oh, and some hockey. While I agree with every single message of the book, I did find this novel a bit too sanctimonious – it pains me to say that, but that’s how I felt. Also, I would have preferred he’d dialled-down the melodrama. In saying all that, I adore the guy - Backman is a Renaissance man – I don’t say that lightly.As always, I cannot wait to see what he comes up with next. His writing is a treat I hope to indulge in for many years to come.I’ve received this book via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest . Many thanks to Atria Books allowing me to read this novel.

I’d like to thank Random House UK, Transworld PubliI was eagerly anticipating the new novel from John Boyne, as I loved The Heart’s Invisible Furies. I’d like to thank Random House UK, Transworld Publishers for the opportunity to read an advanced copy.A Ladder to the Sky is a dark novel about Maurice Swift and his ambitions. A strikingly beautiful man, Maurice is determined to become a successful writer and to have a child. He’s cognizant of the power of his looks, which he uses diligently and without remorse to accomplish his goals. His way to success is peppered with victims. He never once has any regrets and feels entitled. Maurice Swift is a sociopath. He’s not even particularly charming, but his looks seem to blind people and turn them into needy creatures. Two of his victims are much older men, established writers, who fell under his spell. Maurice discards them once they serve him no purpose. I was quite impressed with Boyne’s approach to unravelling Maurice Swift via several characters’ viewpoints. Since I didn't pay attention to the blurb, it took me a while to realise that Maurice Swift was the central character.We first meet him as a twenty-two-year-old waiter in West Berlin. The narrator is the sexagenarian German author, Erich Ackerman, who falls under the young man’s spells. He reveals to Maurice a deeply held secret which provides him with material for his first novel, which turns out to be a success to Ackermann’s downfall. Another important character is Maurice’s wife, Edith, who’s also a writer. I loved the second person narration of that section. Gore Vidal makes a cameo appearance. He’s one of the few people who is not fooled by Maurice. In keeping with a sociopath’s personality, the last word belongs to Maurice.Through Swift, Boyne has a look at the publishing world, literary awards, and the envy and, sometimes, nastiness, that permeates that word. This was an interesting read, although I have to confess that I enjoyed some parts more than others. I never fell under Maurice’s spell. My enjoyment ebbed and flowed and while the writing worked on my brain, it never quite reached my heart....more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Aug 07, 2018","Aug 14, 2018","Mar 29, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/39676520-a-ladder-to-the-sky

The Convenience Store Woman is a character-driven novel. Our protagonist is Keiko Furukura who's a bit different - very likely she's on the Autism spectrum - and is unable to read society's cues, unless somebody spells them out to her clearly. She doesn't have any hobbies; worst of all - she's got no expectations or dreams for herself. She's a thirty six-year-old virgin who's been a convenience store worker for eighteen years. She breathes the shop. Her life, her routines revolve around her work schedule. She's very competent, but that's about it. She's like a robot. I found this novel sad, there were no endearing quirks or funny moments. Occasionally, Keiko came up with some smart observations about society, other people's expectations, people's inability to fully embrace those outside the norm.While I can't say I was bored reading this, after all, it's quite short, I'm afraid I wasn't that charmed by it either.

The punctuation nazi in me was initially put off by it, but not as much as I would have expected, especially since it's the first time I came across this crime. The writing was so beautiful, so touching, I ended up appreciating the lack of disruptions especially as this novel is made up of memories and recollections. Those recollections belong to two friends, Ellis and Michael, who met each other as kids in the late 1960s. Their friendship was tight and got tighter as time went by. Eventually, the two became three, as Ellis marries lovely Annie. The three continue to be tight until Michael moves away and eventually stops all contact.In his mid-forties now, Ellis is a widower. His loneliness and grief are palpable. Through the mundane details, Winman manages to carry us into Ellis' empty, sorrowful world. It's heartbreaking. Of course, he's given to looking back, and looking back involves Michael, who'd been such an important part of his life.That's when we move to Michael's story. And that's the story of a gay man, who's had many dalliances, but who had only loved one person.Tin Man is a layered novel, written in a non-linear way, it flows and meanders, and it's filled with details and mundanity, and the little things, gestures that stay with one. Tin Man  had an ethereal quality about it that absolutely mesmerised me.

The more I think about it, the more I’m impressed. I mean, I shouldn’t be, because it’s Tim Freakin’ Winton. Every author has the right to come up with duds now and then. You probably heard people-in-the-know bemoaning the dying literary novel etc. It may be so, but don’t tell that to the many people who buy Tim Winton’s novels. Case in point, a few weeks after its release, this is still in the top 10 bestseller list.On the surface, The Sheperd’s Hut is a simple novel about an abused fifteen-year-old, Jaxie Clackton, fleeing his hometown. He thinks the police is after him, so he hides in the outback, although he’s unprepared.Jaxie’s is a story of survival, both spiritual and physical. He's such an interesting bloke. To be honest, when I heard this was a first person POV novel, I feared I won’t like it, especially given my previous experience with much loved Australian novels which also featured kids/teenagers (Jasper Jones, The Choke). So, I didn’t expect to be so taken with Jaxie, to care so much.I must applaud Winton for having the audacity to use the language he did, although if anyone can get away with it, it’s him. The language is rough, Australian slang and expletives heavy – but it felt authentic. In spite of the low brow language in use, Winton succeded to write a very atmospheric novel. And all this about the outback, a mostly arid and flat landscape. The novel has only two protagonists, Jaxie and the old, Irish recluse he meets in the outback. Their relationship was interesting and unexpected. Winton steered clear from sentimentality, I admire that a great deal.The Sheperd’s Hut is a masterfully crafted novel, unique, with unforgettable characters and it's quintessentially Australian. In my view, this novel has the makings of an Australian classic novel, just like Cloudstreet.This novel goes towards my Australian Author Challenge on www.bookloverbookss.com. ...more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,"Apr 08, 2018","Apr 13, 2018","Mar 24, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36742671-the-shepherd-s-hut

KI'm probably one of the very few people on this planet who hasn't read The Book Thief or any other Zusak novel, so I had no particular expectations. Knowing how many people loved The Book Thief I wanted to find out if I'll become a Zusak fan myself, therefore I promptly requested this on NetGalley.Man, oh man, how I struggled in the beginning. The first 50 - 70 pages were hard work, I considered giving up several times, especially dreading 400 pages of the same. I just couldn't get a grip, I couldn't understand what I was reading, who was the narrator, the back and forth, and the tangents, gave me whiplash, but I persevered. I'm glad I did, as it got much better. I got to know the characters, although, even that took some time, anyway, the novel became more readable. This novel is about the Dunbar boys, five of them, six, if you count their father. So much testosterone, grunting, inability to communicate or express emotions ... I can't help but wonder if it was intentional and if that's why it took so many pages for Zusak to get to the point !?!????I've realised that my enjoyment increased dramatically when Zusak unfolded the mother's story. Penelope had escaped Communist Poland and ended up in Australia where she didn't know a soul. It's a long book that felt even longer. There are many well written, even beautiful passages, but there's also a lot of padding, including lots of smaller, insignificant characters that don't add that much to the story. Oh, and a plethora of pets. Even though I began to get it or just got used to it, the structure and pacing were still jarring. I really had to push myself to get back to this novel and I say this as someone who enjoys slow, character-driven novels.So in conclusion, I'm glad that I finally read a Zusak novel, even though it won't make it to my favourites shelf. It was too much work for little reward, as it failed to wow me and get my full emotional investment.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

His best friend is Tony Papadakis, whom JJ calls El Greco. The two boys are very tight, and they are doing what probably many boys used to do in the 1960s and in later years - wonder aimlessly, explore, smoke cigarettes, climb trees etc. There was no over-parenting back then. A child's worldview is pretty narrow, but it seems to be more concentrated. Seemingly small events, gestures become important. The story is somewhat familiar, nevertheless, it's told beautifully by Mark Thompson, whose writing is of the highest calibre.

There's a chance encounter between the two when Clare was having doubts whether to marry Zac, her fiance of only one year. Edith's advice is heard by Clare who realises that she couldn't marry a man she was fearing.Not long after that encounter, Clare finds out that Edith's passed away and that she left her a house in a beach town in Delaware; it's the house Edith's husband bought for the two of them in the 1950's. It was a beautiful, much-loved place, filled with the photos of the two of them. Clare is instantly taken with the place.

I wouldn't have paid attention to this one had it not been for the raving s of some GR friends. I already knew the premise and I did ask myself whether I should read it, considering that my anti-religion sentiments don't need any more kindling. Curiosity and/or FOMO got the better of me.More often than not I feel even more apprehensive about rating a memoir, as it feels like you're rating somebody's life. Tara Westover is to be admired for escaping such horrible circumstances and ""making it"". The seventh child of a fundamentalist Mormon family, Tara is innocent, barely literate, insecure and mostly unseen. Her father is an authoritarian who makes preparations for end-of-days. Unsurprisingly, he's anti-government, therefore he opts out getting birth certificates for his younger kids and never sends them to school. His wife seems to play mostly the role of a doting wife and mother, never challenging her husbands' crazy behaviour or the one of her kids', especially the psychopath, Shawn. There are some incredible stories throughout this book that left me aghast: Tara survived two car crashes, falling from high up, leg gashes, strangling, hair-pulling and other verbal and physical abuses from an older brother. Also, she witnessed a brothers leg on fire and many other work-related accidents, while helping on the father's scrapping and construction jobs practised with a complete disregard for safety.Truth be told, I found the storytelling disjointed and not particularly well-written. Also, there were gaps and I also had this niggling feeling that certain things were exaggerated and unbelievable. I could have believed some of them more if the family had lived in complete seclusion, fully self-reliant. That wasn't the case, they lived relatively close to paternal grandparents - who didn't seem that extreme, they went to church, the mother had family in town, the father was doing construction jobs etc., the older brothers left home to find jobs. Even Tara attended dancing classes and singing shows. Some of the things didn't quite add up. Despite all the apprehensive, horrible things that occurred, I never got emotionally involved, even though I feel I should have been consumed by it. Unfortunately, I never really got a sense of who Tara really was. I think it's got something to do with the writing and the fact that I had all these questions and feelings which inhibited my emotional connection. Also, while I don't have first-hand knowledge of the American education system, I've read plenty of books and keep up with the news. I'm just incredulous that someone who could barely read, and had to teach herself math, trig and so on (that alone is puzzling), managed to get into college and not just any college. I don't know if it was modesty, Westover never made it sound like she was particularly gifted, with a high IQ, so my incredulity remained. I do realise that this aspect of the book is the easiest to confirm, as there are records, diplomas. Obviously, I'm influenced by the Australian experience - we seem to have more stringent requirements.Anyway, I'm not sorry I've read it. I am just sorry I didn't love it as much as everyone else seems to.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,103,1,"Mar 13, 2018","Mar 15, 2018","Feb 18, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35133922-educated

She's got limited funds but she dreams that one day she'll get to be a clothes designer. During her sea voyage to New York she meets a young man, Sam, who is very interested in clothes cutting. A happy coincidence. Estella has a temper so she gets herself fired from several jobs within a short period. On a night out she meets again a mysterious man whom she had briefly met in Paris. His name is Alex and he's a British - American spy pretending to be a lawyer. He's extremely attractive and he's got a reputation of a player. He also introduces Estella to her doppelganger. And from that point on the things get complicated and complex. I won't say much more because it'll spoil it for you.Natasha Lester wrote an ambitious novel - which was meticulously researched. I appreciated the period details and even the clothes making segments - although I have very little interest in fashion these days. In saying all that, I found myself unable to suspend my disbelief on several occasions. That prevented me from fully engaging with the story.There were too many convenient coincidences, complications and so many secrets, I was getting whiplash.

Michael is a CIA recruit, pretending to be a Ford tractor salesman. Scottie has her own secrets. Theirs was quite the whirlwind courtship and marriage, so it's fair to say they barely know each other.Scottie is trying to make a home in Siena, although she's not very domestic. She hires the very eager teenager, Robertino, to teach her Italian, which she picks up surprisingly quickly.Meanwhile, Michael is setting up the business and is making the occasional ""business"" trips to Roma where he meets his lover.

I remembered somebody told me it was one of their favourite books of all time, so, I checked it out.I was taken, transported, mesmerised with the writing from the very beginning. It's so playful, original and oh, so smart. There's snark, irony, sarcasm and wit, especially in the first part. Then it becomes a bit too sentimental, so my enthusiasm waned a bit, but not for long, I was won me back.I loved the music and the poetry references, which made me buy some Dickinson, Whitman poetry books (I haven't read either of them, I'm ashamed!). I even liked the layout, the quotes at the beginning of some of the chapters, and even the fonts were to my liking.

Pearson, who’s seventeen and is trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. An incident at the café she was working part-time triggers memories and feelings that make her feel sleepless and unsettled. She’s trying to piece together things from the past, as she was little when her mum and little brother passed away. She’s got her best friend, Loretta and their side-kick, Gordon, to support her. She’s also got a nice dad, gorgeous half-sister, Evie, a kind stepmother and a strange, older step Brother, Tyrone.They live in a small coastal town in Tasmania.

I managed to finish it in two days, which is quite the accomplishment given how wordy it is.I'm just going to write down some thoughts before I hit the pillow.Golden Boy was quite gripping, I kept reading and turning the page to find out what happens next. Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides was the only other book I read about an intersex/hermaphrodite person. This was quite different and it had a more YA feel about it.The protagonist of this novel is Max, 15 going on 16. He's the ""golden boy"" both literally and figuratively - he's a football (soccer) captain, top student; he's also a very amiable person, always smiling, always kind. Oh, and not only he's like an angel, he also looks angelic, with beautiful blond hair (and doesn't everyone go on and on about that hair, as if they'd never seen blonde hair!), green eyes and full lips.Something horrible happens to Max and that turns the happy-go-lucky teenager's life upside down. His family suffers as well.As gripping as the story was for the most part, there were some things that didn't agree with me. The writing was pedestrian and the expositions were way too long. At times, it was repetitive and there was too much padding. The voices were problematic as well, as there wasn't enough distinction between characters. Also, I found some aspects implausible, unbelievable, ie (view spoiler)[ Max's parents don't talk to him or his brother about intersex, somehow they mentioned it to their best friends, and worse, they told those friends' son about Max's condition when he was 6? How can a six year old get his head around such a concept when adults struggle? Not to mention it'd be difficult for a kid to keep it a secret. (hide spoiler)] Daniel, Max's ten year old brother, sounded way too mature at times. Even the teenagers didn't sound like contemporary teenagers. I didn't quite feel the chemistry between Max and Sylvie, his love interest.Also, there was a little too much melodrama for my liking. Despite the NHS (National Health Service) being mentioned and the fact that it was set around the Cambridge area, one could be forgiven for thinking this was an American novel, the language and most things distinctly British were pretty much missing. I'm curious to see if British readers felt the same.Despite my gripes, I'm glad I read this novel. For sure, we need more diversity in literature. I learnt a bit more about intersex people. While the execution and the editing could have been better, it's an engaging debut novel, well worth reading....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Feb 13, 2018","Feb 14, 2018","Jan 25, 2018",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20554067-golden-boy

OMG!This book ...How do I convey how good this book is, when I'm shouting expletives in my head- the kinds that express incredulity at having one's mind blown away. I'm also very sleep deprived, thanks to staying up late to finish it. So, bear with me.I was browsing through 700+ books on my Kindle, to see if anything jumps at me, hoping for a book that wasn't blah. Honestly, I couldn't remember why I bought this book, especially since I had been thinking ""I've about had enough of reading books about gay men ...""(to clarify, I've nothing against gay people, I just realised there are a lot of books with male gay characters and very few with lesbians and the feminist in me has an issue with it, as in not even the females in the gay community have equal representation etc. Don't mind me.) I thought I'll just read a little bit and decide quickly if I continue or not. I was entrapped from the very beginning. The writing is out of this world. Every single sentence. Every single phrase. Nothing is superfluous.The voice and the structure blew me away. You see, there's an omniscient narrator represinting the collective of gay men who'd passed away due to AIDS. They're looking at the younger gay generation - the Internet generation - contemplating, comparing, contrasting, advising from above. You see, they'd been through a lot, they had it rougher; things have improved, after all, two boys are kissing on a high school lawn, trying to beat the world record for the longest kiss and it's quite the record - thirty-two hours, twelve minutes and ten seconds.  While things have improved, it's not all smooth sailing for the gay teenagers. We get an appreciation of the type of hurdles encountered via several characters' stories.The two boys kissing used to be a couple but they broke it off choosing to be just friends. Harry Ramirez is out, his parents are very supportive. Craig Cole has not come out to his parents yet.Then there's Tariq, a black gay teenager, who loves to dance. He was bashed one night, so he's a bit traumatised.Then there are the pink-haired boy, Avery, and the blue-haired boy, Ryan, who hit it off at a gay prom. Avery is a boy born in the wrong body. The saddest and most heartwrenching story is that of Cooper, who is in the closet, spends numerous hours trawling the Internet and the sex apps, pretending to be different people - characters, messing with people. He feels empty, lonely and he loathes himself.Levithan paints a pretty complex picture of what it is to be gay these days (well, the story is set in the 2013), especially for those living in a small town. He's gay himself so he knows what he's talking about. He also knows what the previous generations had to endure.This is a beautifully crafted, original novel. I'm not American, I'm not a gay teenager, I had absolutely nothing in common with anything or anyone in this novel. Great writing makes one empathise, understand and learn. Levithan accomplished to do that and more.As far as I'm concerned Two Boys Kissing was PERFECT. Dare I say a masterpiece? Can we say that about a YA contemporary novel? I don't care. This is going straight to my Favourites Shelf.What a novel!...more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"Jan 20, 2018","Jan 22, 2018","Jan 20, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20453480-two-boys-kissing

I can't believe this is the same author as the one who wrote The Humans.After reading and enjoying The Humans, I was eager to give this one a go, despite the fact that ""time travel"" and other such concepts don't necessarily float my boat, but I was willing to sail away with it. I got the audiobook for this, as I enjoy British accents, plus, it was easier to fit in with other reading.Honestly, I was getting murderous thoughts towards the hero, Tom Hazard, who was four hundred something years old.

But I just couldn't. It felt as if Haig took the history book out and then picked some events and some cool historical figures, just to spice things up a little. I used to be a huge history buff. Re-acquainting myself with some historical events and meeting important historical figures via Tom Hazard - should have been interesting. Alas, no!

These three women and Mike, a widower with two young children, come together in a baking competition for the New Mrs Eaden - the author of the famous ""The Art of Baking"", which had inspired many homemakers over decades. (She's a fictional character, I Googled her).The four bakers can concoct the perfect cakes, bread and other baking delights. While they can bake to perfection, unsurprisingly, their lives are far from perfect. I particularly liked how Vaughan interspersed the four people's stories with that of the famous Kathleen Eaden, who appeared to be not only the perfect baker but also the perfect wife and mother.

It was 1945, Nathaniel was only fourteen, Rachel was sixteen. What follows is a period of unstructured life, but a much more interesting and exciting time. The siblings meet all sort of interesting people who pop in and out of their house. They're not quite sure who the Moth is, but he's there. The Moth introduces them to the Darter, who takes Daniel under his wing. Together they do a variety of illegitimate jobs, but the young man loves it, it gives him a sense of adventure, completely opposed to the ordered and boring life prior to the parents' departure.The writing is meandering, made of vignettes, some of them about the time with The Darter and the Moth, recollections of the times spent with the mother, Rose, who turned out to be a spy for the British government. There are chapters about Nathaniel's early twenties when he started working for the government, mainly looking over old archive documents. While there, he's hoping to come across information that will unravel some of the mysteries regarding his parents.I wanted to like this novel much more than I did. At times, it dragged and meandered a bit too much. I found myself postponing getting back to it.

The Only Story is somewhat similar to that one, as it has an older narrator, Paul, reminiscing about his nineteen-year-old self in the 1960s and his first love and relationship with Susan, a woman twenty-nine years his senior. You read that right. Honestly, I didn't have any qualms about that, I read books about younger men being seduced by older women before.I would rather be outraged than bored. And oh my, it pains me to say this, but The Only Story was tedious, repetitive and I had to force myself to get back to reading it. I don't know about you, but when I read about something taboo, forbidden, especially a risky love affair, I expect passion, animal attraction, a sense of inevitability and urgency. Even in the beginning of the relationship, there wasn't much fire. It was all so dry and passionless. It was all very proper without actually being proper. Why was Paul so taken with Susan? I couldn't tell you. While the relationship lasts much longer than expected, unfortunately, it takes a very sad turn, as Susan becomes an alcoholic. That was painful to read about. At least, I felt something. I was even more annoyed with Paul and heartbroken for Susan.As for the writing, there were a few paragraphs worth highlighting, especially in the beginning, but it became repetitive and drawn out. The shifts from the first-person narration, to second and then to third and again back to first were jarring.Ultimately, I just didn't feel much about the characters and the writing wasn't outstanding to make up for the lack of a gripping story.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

They've been married for eighteen months when their lives are turned upside down - as Roy is arrested and sentenced to twelve years in prison.He wasn't guilty.This short novel is basically made up of three parts, Roy and Celestial before the arrest, Roy and Celestial during the incarceration, and Roy and Celestial after his release.An American Marriage  is an easy read, pleasant enough, although I never really warmed up to the two protagonists. Also, I was surprised to see how quickly the trial and unfair incarceration were dismissed. Roy had a good representation, and it was easy to prove he didn't do it, I just couldn't understand how he'd be convicted so easily, even knowing how unfairly non-Caucasians are treated by the f-ed up American justice system. Call me a cynic, but I didn't buy those beautifully written letters, filled to the brim with so many emotions, even taking into consideration the precarious, life-changing situation that may exaggerate how one feels. I read and enjoyed them, I just didn't find them completely believable.The writing was accessible, but at times there wasn't enough distinction between the characters, so I found myself going to the beginning of the chapter to see who's point of view I was reading.I've seen that many readers think that love triangles should come with trigger warnings. I find the concept amusing to say the least. I had no qualms what-so-ever about it - if anything, that aspect was very realistic. To conclude my ramblings - An American Marriage was readable, a bit different, but I didn't fully engage with the story and didn't feel much for the protagonists.Oh, whenever I read ""Celestial"" I expected it to be followed by a noun, as in celestial body etc, because celestial is always an adjective.

First of all, Gabra Zachman's narration was splendid. Her voice and talent contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of this novel. Rosie and Penn have got to be one of the nicest, most wholesome parents and loving couple in literature. They were perfect. Are you like me, do you pitty people with three or more boys and no girls? I confess, the feminist in me loves to see this change, as not too long ago, to have boys was such an ""accomplishment"". For the parents of only boys, it must be frustrating to hear people's platitudes or commiserations. It must be the same for people with more than three kids. Rosie, an ER doctor, and Penn, an aspiring novelist, managed, not quite intentionally, to have five!!! boys.As you'd imagine, their life was chaos. Frankel's writing conveyed with great skill the craziness of modern life when there are five kids to look after. I loved the gender role reversal, with Rosie being the breadwinner and Penn the stay-at-home parent. As if life wasn't complicated enough, the youngest, precocious, adorable Claude started wearing girls clothes and showing a categorical inclination to behave, dress like a girl. This Is How It Always Is brilliantly spotlighted the damage prescriptive gender roles cause, for women and men, and even more so for queer, nonconforming people. In an ideal world, we'd not care about genitalia and what is ""female"" or ""male"" or in between. The younger generations seem to be more open and more accepting. The legalisation of same-sex marriage and the portrayal of LBGTQI people on the screen and in books contribute a great deal towards understanding and acceptance. This Is How It Always Is was nuanced, touching, sweet, heartbreaking, without being overly dramatic and soap-opera-like.

The Yarra Valley and Melbourne are the main two locations i I picked this book on a whim when I was at the library.I read many books set in wineries. The Yarra Valley and Melbourne are the main two locations in this book. The protagonist of this novel is Kit Grossard, thirty, a food photographer, about to get married to Scott Baldwin, an up and coming industrial designer. As a keen photographer myself, I enjoyed the bits about photography.When at her parents' estate, she runs into the new employee, Raph. I take it he was handsome, under all that manliness, and dirt and sweat. A complete opposite to Kit's pedantic and very metrosexual fiance. As it's almost always the case in romance books, the dude barely utters two words, because he's mysterious and sexy and smouldering, I guess. I get it, when you really don't know someone you can imagine them being the way you want them to. Still, I may be a fool for demanding articulation of thought in order to grasp someone's personality. Especially a character in a novel, where words are all we have. I've read plenty of romance novels, so I know there's a formula, the guy always gets the girl. So why do I still read them? Because sometimes their journeys to getting together will provide entertainment and give you some feels. Unfortunately, the two protagonists didn't make me feel anything much outside some incredulity and slight annoyance. I didn't buy the story, the coincidences, not to mention that Kit was kind of annoying. I'm sorry to be blunt, but the characters were either undeveloped, cliche and/or cartoonish. F-bombs abound in this novel. I'm not that bothered, but I did notice them and thought that there was a lot of cussing for a novel. It's trying to be contemporary, modern, edgy? so I let it go. But it's a fair assumption that most of us draw the line at the use of the c-word. While I can accept its use in, say, a street brawl description, used within certain echelons of society etc, I find it such a turn off when used to describe a woman's genitalia in a hanky-panky situation, that's supposed to be sexy and all that. I don't understand why the editors, publishers kept it in. The one time use of the c-word wasn't my main grumble. The tedious plot and the lack of chemistry between the protagonists were what made this novel forgettable.

There was some sort of mix up with the approval/archiving date, so the kind people at Simon & Schuster Australia sent me the printed book. Lucky me.The first impression was very good: great title, stunning cover (I loved its textured feel as well). I was eager to see how the writing measured up. I was taken with the writing from the very beginning. To be honest, I'm perplexed by how much attention I paid to the writing, probably because I didn't expect it to be of such high quality? The sentences were so crisp, the descriptions were vivid without being cumbersome. Where Vaughan excelled though was in creating complex characters, exposing human contradictions and the lies we tell ourselves. Male vs female psychology, privilege and entitlement play an important role in this novel. Vaughan has taken on a very delicate subject, one, I dare say, many of us struggle with, in one way or another: sometimes consent and the lack of can sit next to each other, balancing vicariously on a very thin line. As others have pointed out, this is a very contemporary novel, extremely so. I'm trying to think critically and not be all gushy, but I can't come up with anything. Oh, there is something! In my non-expert view, this is not a thriller, albeit it was labelled as a psychological thriller. I was slightly apprehensive about the thriller labelling. Some of the classic thriller fans will probably be put off by the lack of action/full on crime and gore. The publishers got the psychological part right and I dare say it excels at it.I was impressed and I'm very keen to read more by Sarah Vaughan.

Either I'm getting more generous or particularly good at picking books, according to GR, my average rating is 4.1 stars. 2017 was definitely the year of the audiobook, as I finally gave them a proper go (good thing I'm able to change my opinions/views ;-) ), and what do you know, I managed to listen to an entire audiobook and then I got hooked. This wouldn't have happened had it not been for local libraries making audiobooks available via mobile (cell) apps, so I'm forever grateful to them. The first audiobook I managed to finish and enjoy was The Last Painting of Sara de Voss by Dominic Smith.I also declare 2017 as the Julian Barnes year, whom I discovered thanks to the many audiobooks available at the library. Seven books later, he's become one of my favourite writers. Another writer I should have read a long time ago but only read this year is Ian McEwan, who blew me out of the water with his Nutshell.What else stands out about the books I read this year? I seem to have read a bit too many books in the thriller/suspense/mystery genres. I guess it's difficult to escape them given how many flood the market. Luckily, they were all 4 and 5 stars, which must have something to do with reading them after seeing others' very favourable s. It's impossible to read all the books one wants to read. I still haven't read Madame Bovary or any Dostoyevsky. I did manage to read one novel by Edith Wharton, so that's something.So, given that quite a few novels received 5-star ratings, which were my favourites of the favourites?Drum rolls, please .... in no particular orderNutshell by Ian McEwanThe Neapolitan Novels by Elena FerranteFive Rivers Met on a Wooded Plain by Barney NorrisEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail HoneymanThe Heart's Invisible Furies by John Boyne.Siracusa by Delia EphronIf The Creek Don't Rise by Leah Weiss.I also need to mention two new (to me) authors that I'll put into a special category - "" soup for the soul"" - Joyce Maynard and Joshilyn Jackson. I would be remiss not to mention the many wonderful book friends I've made this year and the ""old friends"" who continue to inspire me and make me add even more books to my ginormous reading pile.

I watched some movies on the subject, but they were distinctly American. To be honest, I don't think I grasped what exactly had happened.The Sympathizer is an important novel, as it's written by a Vietnamese born writer, from a Vietnamese perspective. Sure, it's got the benefit of hindsight, it goes without saying that Thanh Nguyen must have heard many stories from his parents and other Vietnamese people.It is a complex novel that deals with a variety of subjects: war, history, refugees, communism, race. What stood out for me is the way Nguyen went about it, via the narration of a Vietnamese captain who is a spy and sympathizer of the communists. He's extremely articulate, self-effacing and self-deprecating, while extremely observant and analytical, full of humour and truisms. The satire and the absurd make appearances as well. The language is to die for. The characterisations are outstanding. I should have read this novel instead of listening to the audiobook because I was a bit distracted and drifted at times.

The Child Finder is the first Rene Denfeld book I read.I wouldn't have picked this up to read had it not been for the many raving s here on GR. This novel is relatively slow, it's sort of like digging up snow layers that had been falling over a long period of time. Denfeld's skillful writing created a very atmospheric novel, almost dream-like. The descriptions are scrumptious. I could almost smell and feel the cold and the snow. The slow build up matched the wintery atmosphere, where the world seems to move at a different pace. Our main heroine, Naomi Cotter, is in her late twenties and specialises in finding missing children. She's very dedicated to the point of obsession. It's all personal, because she was one of those kids, although she still doesn't remember what had happened to her prior to being found.She's back to Oregon, in the Skookum National Forest area, hoping to find Madison Culver, who had disappeared over three years ago. The novel has an interesting structure; most of the time we have Naomi's story, that moves between the present and the past, but we also get to hear from Madison, the snow child, who's in a cabin somewhere in the woods. There is another missing child that Naomi is trying to find. That story felt like an unnecessary addition, although it could be argued that it provided a different perspective on the missing children issue, as far as the cause of the disappearance.I personally didn't care much about the fairytales and the magical realism, but they were short.While I appreciate this novel a great deal, given its subject and what a sook I am, I didn't get fully invested and for once, I didn't shed any tears.

I watched the movie adaptation a million years ago and absolutely loved it. I chose to listen to the audiobook, whichThis was my first Ishiguro book. I watched the movie adaptation a million years ago and absolutely loved it. I chose to listen to the audiobook, which was narrated by Dominic West. The human brain is complicated (or maybe it's just mine) ... I love Dominic West, the actor, I like his accent, but I don't know, he left too much of an imprint on the audiobook, even after some time, I could still hear/see him. I wish Anthony Hopkins or someone else read it instead.So keeping all the above in mind, I'm sorry to confess that I wasn't as awed as I expected to be. Damn the high expectations. It could be my problem with the narrator, it could be timing. It's also possible that I'm tired of repressed, emotionally inept men? Mr Stevens is the epitome of a repressed English man, who's a butler. It was almost heartbreaking to see him agonising over bantering, how to do it when it's appropriate etc., he almost seems to be on the autism spectrum (you'll have to forgive me, I see autism everywhere!). The running of a large estate minutia bored me at times. It may well be what Ishiguro intended - after all, serving others was pretty much Mr Steven's entire life. The man barely leaves the estate. His life is devoid of meaning (if there's such a thing), better said, there are no people he cares for or who care for him. The man is his job. He is very proper, very loyal and dedicated. He's pedantic to a fault. He's also completely oblivious to housekeeper's feelings for him. I liked Miss Kenton a lot. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, challenge and rattle the dormant Mr Stevens. There are many things I liked: the language is beautiful, the descriptions were vivid. It's a very atmospheric novel. Ishiguro even managed to insert some amusing moments. I can see why so many people love this novel. I liked it and appreciated it, but not enough to give it 5 stars. I should have probably read the ebook, but you know how it is, too many books not enough time....more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Nov 23, 2017","Nov 25, 2017","Nov 23, 2017",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/18304456-the-remains-of-the-day

As much as I admired Lee Burke's ability to come up with so many descriptions of settings, smells, atmospheric conditions because it was narrated by Robicheaux, a policeman, I thought it was a bit over-the-top.

She still loves her job as an art professor at a university in Stockholm. But she is lonely, aimless and without purpose. She tends to drink too much. She indulges in social media voyeurism of her acquaintances' lives, without posting or engaging. What's there to post about? She doesn't like travelling, she doesn't go out much, especially since she's been single, she mostly just works.

I'm also incredulous that I only heard of Stegner last year.I can't remember ever reading a novel about a friendship between two adult couples. Such friendships are rare. Lots of things have to align for that to happen, besides proximity, compatibility between four people, and the kids, a similar socio-economic standing, political and intellectual similarities.Written in the 1980s, this is a novel about a friendship forged in the late 1930s, when Larry Morgan and Sid Lang were colleagues in the English Department of a university in Madison, Wisconsin. They're both hoping for tenure. Their financial situation is very different - the Morgans live paycheck to paycheck, whereas the Langs have a privileged financial situation. Charity Lang, Sid's wife, is a force of nature. She's vivacious, enthusiastic, organised, determined, generous, and bullheaded. Nothing fazes her. Her huge house is a hub for entertainment and get-togethers. She's the ultimate hostess. She never stops and loses patience with those who don't toe the line or keep up, an impossible task. I liked her a lot. Larry's wife, Sally, is kind and unassuming, in many ways, Charity's opposite. But opposites attract.The Morgans live their best years in the Langs' company.Besides the wonderful characterisations, Stegner created a very atmospheric novel, with beautifully descriptive prose. I could smell the woods, feel I was inside the Langs' house and had picnics with them and their extended family.Truly, a most marvellous novel. I think this is my favourite novel of the year, so far.NB: A little movie on Stegner.

I don't know what it is about her writing that just grabs me and doesn't let go. Interestingly enough, in the beginning, it takes me a little bit of time to get comfortable with Jackson's Southern accent (she's reading the novel herself), but as I get more into the story, I end up really liking it. Go figure. Jackson is an excellent narrator. She's even got a beautiful singing voice. Some people are endowed with many talents.I'm guessing all Jackson's novels are set in the South, as she's a Southerner herself. It makes sense to write about what you know. Our narrator and the main character is a thirty-eight-year-old cartoonist, Leia Birch Briggs, who, after a one night stand with 'Batman' at a comic-con, finds herself ""a little bit pregnant"". Opsie. She decides to keep the baby, but she dreads telling her parents and especially, her uptight, seemingly perfect step-sister, Rachel. It comes to Leia's attention that her beloved paternal grandmother is not doing very well down in Birchville, Alabama. So Leia and Rachel's teenage daughter, Lavender, head down to Alabama from Norfolk, Virginia.Indeed, Birchie is dying. She's got Lewey body dementia, but she's very well looked after by her best friend, Wattie. Birchie is a pillar of the small community, created and supported by her family for almost one hundred years. Recently though, the elderly matron caused a scandal and the break up of two families. There are also skeletons in the closet - literally. It's all one big mess that Leia is trying to fix. Rachel's relationship is about to disintegrate. There's an elderly, frail grandmother to deal with. Leia's impending motherhood requires many decisions to be made, including if to tell the father. There are a variety of themes in this novel: family, disappearing parent, the small town with all its positives and negatives, memory and how certain things stay with us and how we give them undue importance. I appreciated Jackson ""audacity"" to point out that the South is not all kindness and hospitality, that it's still very racist. This becomes more apparent to Leia as her baby daddy is an African American man, therefore, her child is going to be mixed race. Speaking of mixed race, can someone elucidate this for me: why is it that when we have a mix of say - Caucasian with African American, the resulting child is more often identified as African American? Obama is the best example. We all referred to him as the first African American president, but he was half caucasian. I've noticed that immediately a mixed race child has the obvious traits of the minority race in the mix, they are referred as being of that minority. Anyway, I digress, although this question is raised in the novel as well. You'll be forgiven for thinking this is a chick-lit novel. While it feels light and breezy, it's got substance and some serious undercurrents and themes, which Jackson manages to combine in a very interesting way. I rooted for the characters, who were fleshed out and relatable. I'm glad I got around to listening to another Jackson audiobook. I think I'll be sticking with her audiobooks rather than printed ones, but don't quote me on that.

My fear of missing out (FOMO) and the fact that I didn't get this on NetGalley pushed me to request a library copy. I believe I was the first or second to read it. You've got to love the smell of a brand new book. Its size was quite daunting, especially when one has so many books waiting to be read ... Anyway, I decided that if it didn't capture me by page 100 I will drop it. Since I managed to finish it, in five days no less, you can guess that I enjoyed it.For sure, it’s a captivating novel. Hannah is a skilful writer who managed to weave an interesting story within the walls of domesticity, isolation and the Alaskan winter.The story begins in 1974. Our narrator is Leni Allbright, thirteen. She has to move schools again, as her antsy father, Ernt and her crazy-in-love mother, Cora, move to Alaska, as Ernt inherited a property. Ernt is a Vietnam veteran and PoW, who suffers from PTSD, which he soothes with alcohol. The three of them are completely unprepared for life in Alaska. To their rescue come some lovely, determined, stoic women, with lots of know-how and willingness to help. Many other community members lend a hand. There are a plethora of interesting characters around.I particularly appreciated the descriptions of the environment, both the natural kind and the man-made. It was difficult to read about Ernt Allbright’s short fuse and his unloading of his rage upon his long-suffering wife, Cora. As it’s always the case with dysfunctional families, kids are affected as well. In this case, it was the obedient and introverted, Leni, who’s always on alert. She realizes that Alaska’s winter, animals could kill you, but the biggest threat was in their home, from someone who supposedly loved you. “All this time, Dad had taught Leni how dangerous the outside world was. The truth was that the biggest danger of all was in her own home.”The first three-quarters of the novel had a steady pace, with enough drama to keep my interest. The last quarter's pace gets much faster, there’s volatility in the air. Unfortunately, there’s also a bit too much melodrama, with a sprinkling of soap-opera. Don’t get me wrong, I wanted to read something that had some silver lining, I just felt a few elements were too Lifetime movie like.

This is the story of Sam Hill, who hasI may get crucified for this , anyway, I’ll take my chances.I, like many others, enjoy an underdog story. This is the story of Sam Hill, who has ocular albinism, a genetic abnormality that makes his eyes look red. It’s the early 1960s, so people are less enlightened. Sam’s mom is an ardent Catholic and she’s fierce. She would not let anyone or anything stay in the way of her son getting an education and achieving his potential. Sam’s hardships start early on, practically on the first day at the local Catholic school, affiliated to the church they attend. His nickname became Sam Hell or Devil Son. The poor boy, not only is he shunned by his colleagues, he draws the Principal’s ire, the mean sister Beatrice.The novel moves back and forward in time. During the school and high school years, Sam makes two great friends, Ernie, the only black boy in the neighbourhood, and Mickie, a tomboy, outspoken girl. The three of them are very tight.This started off pretty well. Unfortunately, as I read on, I became irritated with this novel. It’s like a soap-opera, lacking in nuance. Sam is a saint, saving and helping everyone left, right and centre. Also, I would be remiss not to mention that I found all the religious connotations, overtones and undertones and not so subtle Catholic mantras suffocating. This novel is basically a Catholic allegory of good vs evil. I found it emotionally manipulative. While I’ve never read a Christian novel, had this not had a few mild sex scenes, it could probably be labelled as one.There were a few things that didn’t agree with me. (view spoiler)[The White saviour trope - of course, Sam, the brave white boy, has to save the black boy by not only befriending him but also by helping him with school work, as he was dyslexic. Not only that, while in high school, Sam became a school sports correspondent for the Times!, so because of his raving s of his friend's sporting prowess, Ernie ends up getting a basketball scholarship at Stanford University. Who knew high school students had that much power … (hide spoiler)]  I’m going to be pedantic now: I’ve read on ocular albinism – Sam doesn’t seem to have as many issues as others seem to have, even when allowing for individual differences. Also, I had big doubts that someone who had had a stroke that had developed into dementia would last as long as Sam’s father did. So, this was an accessible, competently written novel. I’m sure Robert Dugoni had the best intentions, obviously informed by his own convictions. I’m certain that my own secular views are not to blame for my disenchantment with this novel. This reader enjoys reading novels with characters that are more realistic. I also don't care for melodrama.I’ve received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

Luckily, this was about much more than that. First and foremost, this was about sisterly love between Rachel, the narrator, and Patty, her younger sister. Their devotion for each other was very touching. When their adored policeman father leaves their mother, the girls become even closer. They're poor, their mother is mostly absent, but they're resourceful and imaginative.When the ""sunset strangler"" commits crimes in the mountains behind their house, the girls' lives are affected, especially as their father is the detective in charge with the case. Years pass, more young women are killed, still, the killer evades capture. This takes a toll on the girls and especially on their father. I loved the first three-quarters of the novel, which focused on the girls in their pre-teen, teen and their twenties. Both girls, but especially Rachel, are completely besotted with their charming, but imperfect father.The last part was a bit rushed and uneven, and the ending could be seen as far-fetched, but the rest of the novel was marvellous.This audiobook was narrated by Maynard herself, which was great as she's got a soothing voice.

In some ways, it reminded me of the Three Musketeers, because of the banter and the chases. The three protagonists are Henry (Monty) Montague - the eighteen-year-old son of an earl; his best friend - Percy Newton - who's mixed race, and Monty's insufferable, bookish, fifteen-year-old sister. The three of them and a very strict chaperone are doing a Grand Tour, akin to these days' gap year. Monty is quite cute and extremely cheeky - some of his observations are quite funny. He's also a spoilt, entitled, selfish man, with a very high sex drive, for both women and men. He prefers men, but that gets him into too much trouble. Remember, it's 1720. Monty has a propensity for getting himself into trouble. Because of his impulsivity, the three young people find themselves destitute, running away from a French duke's henchmen, travelling to Spain, being stowaways on a boat to Italy, then on a pirate ship and so on. While I enjoyed this book, I couldn't completely turn off my brain, so there were things that bugged me: somehow people have complex conversations in different countries without speaking the foreign languages properly or at all; how they managed without any money for so long was hard to believe and then it's the hygiene or lack of hygiene. At times the conversations and attitudes felt too contemporary, to be honest, in this case, it didn't bother me that much. This novel is over 500 pages. It didn't feel that long, I'm surprised how little time it took to finish, so don't let its size put you off. Since this is aimed at YA, older YA, given its sexual innuendo and themes, I'm inclined to be less critical. I appreciated Lee's endnotes on Grand Tours, homosexual relationships during that era. Obviously, she did her research. But this is a fiction novel through and through, with creative licenses.

I shouldn't be surprised, after all, the previous six Barnes books I listened to this year were of the highest quality - always extremely eloquent. I am awed by Barnes' brilliance and literary prowess. The way his mind works!!! How he takes some obscure fact - Flaubert's parrot and then constructs such an interesting book, part biography - part novel, a very interesting concoction that melds fact with fiction in a very original way. It is mainly about Flaubert (I knew almost nothing about the famous French writer, although I promised myself that this is the year I finally read Madame Bovary). It's also about art, personality, fame, critics, and relationships. All the biographical details about Flaubert's life are delivered via our narrator, a retired British doctor, who's a Flaubert amateur scholar. Many of the biographical entries are from correspondence to and from Flaubert or his journal entries.I've come to the conclusion that more often than not we shouldn't know too much about geniuses or prestigious artists, scientists, writers etc. Their human selves are more often than not quite disappointing, with their human failings, proclivities and other unsavoury traits. How dare they?It's probably my fault for putting people whose works/creations I admire on a pedestal. It should be interesting to find out how all the things I've learnt about Flaubert and Madame Bovary will affect/influence my reading of his masterpiece. I can't wait to find out for myself. Anyway, I should stop my ramblings. If you're looking for proper, more articulate s, there are plenty on GR.

Harper Drummond is a career woman, who doesn’t want children, but feels compelled to do something selfless, so she decides to donate her eggs. The couple she chooses are the balloonists, Claire and Jasper, who are very much in love but can’t procreate because Claire’s childhood leukaemia treatment that left her infertile. I loved how Johns juxtapositioned the reality of infertility, the medical procedures involved in egg harvesting and embryo implantation, and the legal and emotional investment from both parties. Egg donation is an utterly selfless gesture, but as you can guess, there are issues that can complicate life, that’s why counselling is demanded before proceeding ahead. When tragedy strikes, the previously agreed upon stipulations change, as the worlds of both the egg donor and the receiving couple change in unmitigating ways. Nature vs nurture comes into play. Biology’s pull can be very powerful. I’ll leave it at that, as I don’t want to give away too much of the plot.The Greatest Gift was emotionally charged and very touching.

Ben Hobson's debut is a coming of This is another Australian novel with a kid/teenager protagonist that I didn't enjoy as much as everyone seemed to. Ben Hobson's debut is a coming of age novel about Sam Keogh, thirteen, who recently lost his kind and loving mother. Therefore, his gruff, temperamental father, a Vietnam war veteran, has to look after him. The novel is set in 1961, Queensland, Australia. A big chunk of the novel takes place on Tangalooma Whaling Station. Sam's father works there for many months of the year, butchering the whales. It's hard work, unrelenting, no days off. He takes Sam with him, so he can learn a skill, ""to make a man"" out of him. Because it was 1961, I was able to let slide a few more things that I normally wouldn't, such as the presence of a thirteen-year-old boy around knives and other perilous endeavours, without any training, safety gear etc. It advanced the narrative. Descriptions of whale butchering are aplenty. They didn't affect me in a visceral way, others may find them more confronting.I expected to like this novel much more, especially since its main theme - what makes a ""real man"" - is very contemporary. It was its delivery that didn't work for me. Unlike other similar novels, this is a third person narrative from Sam's perspective. I usually enjoy third-person narratives, in this case, though, I was kept at a distance. Also, there was too much telling, overanalysing of feelings and overexplaining. I found some of the statements unbelievable and also, some of them felt too contemporary, too modern. Basically, what I'm trying to say not very eloquently, I could see the puppets strings, so I couldn't get fully immersed in the story.I am the outlier on this one, so take my  with a grain of salt.

I've noticed it in other thrillers/mystery/suspense novels I read recently, the main characters never seem to get much sleep. It's the case here as well. Of course, they're busy solving crimes.

These days, due to my huge TBR list, I rarely read books made into movies that I watched. BTW, I thought the movie was pretty good, despite Josh Brolin (he's a good actor, but I'm not a fan). I hadn't read Maynard and upon seeing this audiobook at the library it called to me.Henry, the narrator of this novel, remembers the events of the Labor Day long weekend, 1987, when his mother and he took home an injured man, named Frank. Henry was thirteen at the time. He lived with his mum, Adele, who's almost a complete recluse. His father remarried and Henry sees him once or twice a week.Maynard's writing was very atmospheric. I could feel the heat, the literal summer heat, and the figurative one between Adele and Frank, who had a very unlikely relationship. But was it, really?The poor Henry has mixed emotions, amplified by his puberty.I don't want to give away too much. I absolutely loved this book. The characters were well drawn. Frank was quite the man, maybe a bit too good to be true (if I keep my cynical hat on), but somehow I bought it, or better said, I allowed Maynard's writing and Wilson Bethel's beautiful narration to transport me, and I appreciate that.A gorgeous little book!

As I'm busy with other reading commitments, I've listened to the audio of this book, which was read by Winton himself.I was made to believe that this was a memoir, but it's more of a collection of essays, with some childhood recollections and other issues. Unsurprisingly, the Australian environment and the landscape are prominent in this book. If you'd seen Winton on TV or had heard him interviewed on the radio, you would have noticed a softly spoken, unassuming and very uncomfortable to talk about himself individual - so unlike many of the famous, prestigious male writers. So I expected this book not to be that revelatory, in a very personal, show all your dirty laundry kind of way. What I didn't expect was to feel like I have read some of the essays before. True, a couple of months ago, I had listened to another sort of biographical collection of essays Island Home, so many of the themes, essays on the environment seemed very similar to that book. Or it could just be that I am so very familiar with Tim Winton's writing and the themes closest to his heart?Of course, the writing is excellent. Given that so much is about Western Australia just makes this book even more appealing.Regardless of my fan girl status, I will say that this book was poorly edited, the essays could have been arranged better so that the last essay was not the one on Winton discovering art at the National Gallery of Victoria. It looked like a money raising exercise. Luckily, Winton can get away with it. Or maybe I'm just blinded by love?This book counts towards my Aussie Author Challenge 2017 on http://bookloverbooks.com/readi... ...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Aug 26, 2017",Sep 2017,"Aug 26, 2017",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/35166329-the-boy-behind-the-curtain

These rivers meet in Salisbury, England, where thUnequivocal 5 starsFive Rivers Met on a Wooded Plain is the debut novel of playwright Barney Norris. These rivers meet in Salisbury, England, where the five characters of this novel live. The beginning is beautifully lyrical. I had no idea what I was in for, as I hadn’t bothered to read the blurb.Five ordinary people are impacted by a car accident, either as observers or participants.One by one, we get to meet each of them through first person narrations.First, we meet Rita, middle-aged, flower seller in the market and small-time drug seller on the side. Rita is a simple woman who’s made some bad choices. Now she finds herself alone and lonely and estranged from her only child. She doesn’t blame anyone for her failures. Rita comes through very realistically, her narration was so well done. I never judged her, I actually felt very sorry for her. The next character we get to meet is Sam, a high school boy, who’s a bit shy but somehow manages to find love. Unfortunately, his kind and unassuming father is dying of lung cancer. This personal tragedy throws Sam’s world upside down. Sam’s anxieties and struggles to find his identity are more or less universal. Again, Norris did a fantastic job with this character as well.The old farmer George Street is driving his car coming from the hospital where his wife of many decades had succumbed to cancer. I was deeply touched by farmer George’s story, by his love for his wife. His thoughts on love and marriage, children or better said lack of children, regrets and especially on memory made me shed a few tears. One of the better-realised characters was Alison. She’s the wife of an army man, so they've moved around a lot. Their only child goes to a boarding school, so Alison finds herself desperately lonely, depressed, without any friends and purpose. She’s hopelessly anxious and tries hard “to pull herself together”. She’s got a bit of an addiction to pills and the occasional drink “to take the edge off”. A very familiar story. Again, I was impressed with Norris’s ability to create such a complex and layered female character. I’ve looked Norris up, he was in his late twenties when he wrote this, so, I can't help but be impressed. The last character we meet is Liam, who’s a security guard at at Old Sarum hill. His story is the shortest but that’s not to say it’s not well done.As it’s the case with many literary fiction novels, this is about the characters and their stories, not so much about the plot, although I loved how the characters and their stories interweaved. The little details and coincidences are exquisite. Even the title is beautiful and meaningful.Despite being a small novel, its themes are big: the meaning of life, regrets, choice, purpose, belonging, love, loneliness, loss, and grief.Besides the beautiful writing and the terrific characterisations, the humanity and kindness that transpired made me appreciate this novel so much.Bravo, Barney Norris. Looking forward to your next novel.Highly recommendedI’ve received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

Many thanks to Little, Brown Book Group UK for granting me access to this ARC.The Dry was a slow-paced novel, perfectly suited to the hot, dry conditions of the Australian summer. Force of Nature is even slower, although this time the atmospheric conditions are completely different: it's wet and cold, and there are lots of trees around. Well done Jane Harper for changing the setting.Aaron Falk is still our protagonist, he's still working for the Australian Federal Police, chasing white-collar criminals. When one of their whistleblowers, Alice Russell, doesn't come back from a treck in the Giralang Ranges, Aaron and his partner, Carmen, head out to the bush. So what happened to Alice? Where is she and why did she leave the other four women in her group? The mystery unravelled very slowly, sometimes, painfully so. This would explain why it took me so long to finish this book. The structure is similar to The Dry, as there are alternating chapters between current events, where Aaron Falk is involved, and what happened on the track, how the women lost their way in the bush. Unsurprisingly, towards the end, the novel's pace increases towards the reveal.I quite like Harper's writing style, I think she's very talented, particularly apt at creating three-dimensional characters. While I enjoyed reading this novel, I wasn't as taken with the story as much as it was the case with The Dry, something was missing for me. I did like that there were no violent crimes and no gory details.So this gets 3.5 stars, rounded up.I've received this ARC via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

She'd left Australia sixty-five years ago. She's still doing fine for her age, but she knows her time is limited, so she decides it was time she went back to Ireland, to the place where she lived for the first twenty years of her life. Through recollections, we find out about Lola's life, which wasn't the easiest. Her parents were cold and strict. Her marriage with her only son's father lasted less than a year. Lola's kept things from her son and she thinks it's the right time to tell him the truth.While the trip back to Ireland is not what Lola thought it would be, it was still beneficial. It's liberating to have no more secrets.Monica's McInerney writing is very natural. The characters come alive, their stories are very relatable. Lola is the heart of the family, she's a loving, charming figure, but that doesn't mean that everyone loves her. The major themes of this novel are escaping the confines of family and society, love, family, loss and grief, regrets, melancholy, and immigration. At over 15 hours, this was a pretty long audiobook, but I never got bored. It made me ponder, it made me smile and weep. While the story has been done before, McInerney's writing style and very realistic characters made this novel worthwhile my time.This novel goes towards the Aussie Authors Challenge 2017 on http://bookloverbooks.com/readi......more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Aug 18, 2017","Aug 21, 2017","Aug 15, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/34655731-the-trip-of-a-lifetime

The two start a relationship when Morgan starts to read to Elizabeth her father's old journals that reappeared after decades. Elizabeth's recollections fill in the gaps about what had happened.

The moonshine production seems to be the main source of income. Ignorance, illiteracy, teenage pregnancy and incest, domestic violence, alcoholism and extreme poverty paint a pretty bleak picture of the region.The principal character of this novel is Sadie Blue, who's an innocent seventeen-year-old married to a total loser. She's pregnant and is beaten by her new husband often. People look but don't do anything about it as Roy Tupkin is a scary fellow.There are quite a few characters whose points of view we discover in different chapters. This way we get to know them intimately.I appreciated that Weiss gave a voice to the less savoury characters, such as Roy Tupkin - Sadie Blue's husband, and his sidekick, Bill Barnhill, and Prudence Perkins, the pastor's spinster sister, who's mean and resentful. My favourite character, besides Sadie, was the new teacher, Kate Shaw, who's unusual looking, an atheist, and loves learning and teaching. She's an outsider who doesn't fit in the community but she's no quitter and makes the most of what's on offer.It's worth mentioning that the language and tone are probably the best things about this novel, as they felt quite authentic (bear in mind, I'm no linguistics expert). It took me a chapter or two to get used to it, but then it was all smooth sailing.The ending is one of the best endings I've come across. To conclude my ramblings, this is one hell of a debut novel, well, one outstanding novel, full stop. Looking forward to reading more from Leah Weiss.

I should probably wait a little longer and ponder before I write my , but that's not really my style. This is a relatively complex novel, deceptive in its simplicity. It's filled with symbolism and it's wonderfully rich in characterizations and vivid descriptions. Twenty-five year old Sofia is the carer of her sixty-four-year-old, hypochondriac mother, Rose, who's lost the ability to walk. She rules over Sofia and pushes her around. Sofia is an intelligent young woman, who's abandoned her anthropology PhD, devoting herself to looking after her mother. She works in a cafe and sleeps in a room above the shop for five nights and lives with her mother the rest of the time. She's got nothing to her name. She's clueless, extremely passive and trapped.The trip to the South of Spain to a very expensive private clinic run by Dr Gomez is the last resort for Sofia's mum. While there, Sofia has opportunities to explore her sexuality and discover things about herself. She also pays a visit to her Greek father and his new family. They haven't had any contact in over eleven years. Sofia is fascinated with memory. She's an observer with an anthropologist's observational skills. She's not particularly skilled at applying those skills to herself, which is not unusual, most of us tend to look outwards more than inwards. The time in Spain, the people and relationships that develop there bring on revelations and prompt Sofia to seek escape and change. Will she manage to pull herself out of this emotional entrapment?I really liked this novel. Levy did a terrific job describing the complexities of a mother-daughter relationship and other types of connections.

He's quite the character, as he's outspoken and set in his ways. He's always been selfish, and he's well aware of it. He's also unable to tell his two kids, Sveva and Dante, that he loves them just the way they are, because he's old school and doesn't do touchy-feely. Cesare has always been a womanizer. He reminisces about his long lost loves, and the failing to be a good husband. As it's the case for all human beings (unless one is a sociopath), the old man has lots of regrets: for staying in a job he hated, for staying in a marriage after he'd stopped loving his wife, for not having gone after what, better said who he wanted. The novel is filled with witty observations and self-deprecation. It's somewhat short on plot, but that shouldn't put you off. I like a book with an unlikeable character. Cesare is not the worst, but he's no angel either. He's determined to make the most of what's left of his life. And in order to enjoy life, one has to appreciate the small pleasures.There seem to be a plethora of grumpy old men novels out there. I have no problem with that.

I expected it to be light and amusing, and it was occasionally those things, but mostly I found it very life like, therefore not that amusing.A somewhat despondent, late fifties man, Graham, is married to Audra, his second wife. The two couldn't be more different - Graham is a placid and a somewhat beige kind of man. Even his name suits him (no offence to Grahams out there). He earns a good living as a consultant for medical acquisition in an investment firm. He's an excellent cook. He's a good father to his ten-year-old son who's got Aspergers and an obsession with Origami. And that's pretty much it. His wife, Audra, is his complete opposite: she's fifteen years younger (how many men left their first wife for a woman same age or older?), vivacious, a dynamo who never shuts up. Audra's constant talking and gossiping were extreme. But then, she knew everyone and anyone, for someone so easily distracted she sure remembered a gazillion names and personal stories. She also had a habit of inviting all these random people to live in their apartment or just come for dinner. She didn't have a mean bone in her.Graham wonders how his life ended up being like that. Occasionally, he feels like a guest in his own apartment, and life. This novel is short on plot. But it's very life like. Heiny's somewhat microscopic look at Graham and Audra's marriage is like holding a mirror to many of us, who have jobs, kids, and especially kids with special needs. There are many things to appreciate about this novel. It's very well written and accessible while being very realistic. It'll make you smile, and you're likely to shed a tear or two.Standard Deviation is an accomplished debut novel, I'm looking forward to see what Heiny writes next.

Of course, one could easily spot contemporary behaviour, mentalities and humour, even the bedroom scenes felt way too modern (not that I know how things were working in the bedroom in the eighteenth century, still, it felt all too contemporary, I'll spare you the details).

Anyway, I saw a few GR friends had rated it high, so I thought I'd it give it a go. Enter the library audiobook.This memoir was a mixed bag. I confess I have a bit of a problem with memoirs as I find them self-indulgent. It was the case here as well. My initial instincts were correct. I mean the author, Cheryl, is an intelligent and at the same time incredibly idiotic woman. In some ways, she's more idiotic than the every-day-clueless and idiotic people out there. She'd lost her mum to cancer, so she grieves. She's married to a wonderful guy, yet she cheats on him and sleeps around with whoever happens to have a penis at the ready. Alright... Not judging. One of the penis bearers she happens to sleep with wants to try heroin, and the very accommodating Cheryl gives it a go as well. Heroin addiction follows. Intervention from the ex-husband, and Cheryl quits. She made it sound so easy, like giving up wearing high-heels or something ... Anyway, moving on. A few years later, disillusioned and lost she decides to track the Pacific Crest Trail. No, she's never backpacked or hiked before, but how hard can it be? Well, it turns out, pretty darn difficult. Should one so inexperienced track by herself? Why the hell not. Where there's a will, there's a way... (*Rolls eyes ...)So she stumbles through the PCT. On and off it. She's ill-prepared but obviously very lucky not to have perished. It got repetitive quickly. The writing was very accessible as it was simple and simplistic. Nothing awe inducing or revelatory. I'm afraid for most of the book I found Cheryl irritating. Did I learn anything? Not really. Not sure Strayed did either.

Truth be told, there aren’t that many prestigious writers, artists or scientists who came from Western Australia. While it’s the biggest state in Australia, it’s what I would call a mainly blue-collar state, where mining, agriculture and other primary industries prevail. It’s conservative and a bit backwards. I say this with love. Anyway, Tim Winton is a Western Australian treasure. (I cringe as I write this, but I can’t come up with a better expression). This was the first non-fiction book by Tim Winton that I’ve read.Island Home  is an ode in prose to Australia, in particular to Western Australia. How timely that I read this book, just as I am about to turn fifteen years of living in Perth, Western Australia. The land and the ocean, the environment, have been protagonists in all Winton’s books, because geography shapes us. Tim Winton has the uncanny ability to make me feel me homesick for Perth, for Western Australia, a feeling that’s usually reserved for one’s childhood environment/country. I’m afraid I don’t have the ability to fully convey how his books make me feel, except that I’m always enthralled.This collection of essays was another example of Winton’s craftsmanship and proof of his love for the land and the ocean. Tim Winton is an ardent supporter of the marine environment, of protecting the environment, so much so, he’s put aside his obvious apprehension of being in the spotlight to become a spokesperson for different environmental causes. I admire him greatly.I enjoyed learning some more things about Western Australia’s history and I particularly liked Tim Winton’s childhood recollections. And the fact that I know most of the places, although many just by name, made this book even more special. Partly a memoir, partly “a call to arms” as the  in the Guardian called it, Island Home is informative, memorable and enlightening.David Tredinnick, the narrator of this audiobook, was superb!Last year, a dream came true: I got 7 of Tim Winton's books signed by him. Even he was impressed with the number of books I brought to the signing. :-) https://images.gr-assets.com/photos/1...I've read this to go towards the Aussie Author Challenge hosted by Book Lover Book Reviews at http://bookloverbooks.com/readi... ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Jul 17, 2017","Jul 19, 2017","Jul 17, 2017",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/28683940-island-home

The beginning was intriguing, I was convinced I was going to love this book, not only because of its Frenchness but also because one of its protagonists was a precocious twelve-year old called Paloma. Paloma is the daughter of a French Minister and lives with her parents and annoying older sister in a very rich apartment complex. Paloma has a huge disdain for everyone around her. She finds everyone irritating, fake, stupid and/or ignorant. She's given to philosophising. A lot! I usually enjoy philosophy and philosophising, but many times it was too much and apropos to nothing. So I started getting irritated. The other main protagonist is Renee Michel, the concierge of this building. She's an average looking woman, but she's not average in her knowledge and appreciation of literature (I loved that she was obsessed with Tolstoy), film, music and art in general. But she keeps all that hidden from everyone else, as to not appear to ""give herself airs"". One must stay within one's social constraints and social class. I really enjoyed the art, literature and music references. But le piece de resistance for me was the special relationship between Madame Michel, the concierge, and one of the apartment owners. The ending took me by surprise, which is great, although I wasn't that keen on it. The Elegance of the Hedgehog was a mixed bag of some excellent passages, some interesting characters, too much philosophy and an unexpected ending.3.5 starsI've received this book via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

After all, I was raving about how amazing his writing was, how intelligent etc.Unfortunately, from the very beginning, I had an issue with the narrator of this audiobook. He wasn't terrible but not quite to my liking.I had no idea what the book was about before I started it. I liked the short alternate chapters corresponding to the two protagonists: George Edjali's and Arthur Conan Doyle, respectively. The two grew up in different parts of Britain and had different trajectories.Of course, Arthur Conan Doyle became Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, famous for writing the Sherlock Holmes novels.George Edjali became a solicitor who went to jail for harming a horse. It was all a huge misconduct of justice, at the beginning of the XXth century. The two finally come together towards the last quarter of the book, when Edjali asked for Conan Doyle's help to exonerate him. There's more action happening as we Conan Doyle takes on the task of discovering who was the actually quilty person. Truth be told, it was interesting enough, I've learnt a few things about Doyle, but it didn't have the wit, intelligent observations or even the elevated language I've come to expect from Barnes.

Being a man, he doesn't do anything about it, unless you count avoidance and dismissing emotions and thoughts as doing something.The love of his life, Kat, is in and out of contact. Their relationship is complicated. At least his relationship with his former drug addict brother, Anton, is going well.This time, Caleb finds himself embroiled in another complicated mystery where a young woman who sought his help got killed in front of him, as she was running away from a man chasing her. The leads point back to his home town, Ressurection Bay. So he drives back there. Things become complicated. Bikies, drugs, violence and property destruction, racial turmoil and the summer fires made this follow-up novel more complex or convoluted. His former business partner, Frankie, who's on the run, makes an appearance a couple of times. I confess, I found her appearances and motives a bit random.Also, Caleb's obstinance, lack of danger awareness were infuriating. This second novel had more threads. Unfortunately, some of them were unfinished and unresolved and I didn't think they were all necessary. I'm guessing Viskic is planting the seeds for a third novel in the series.I still enjoyed Emma Viskic's writing, despite And Fire Came Down suffering from a case of too many ingredients that resulted in some loose ends and occasional confusion.As I conclude this , I just want to say:for goodness' sake, Caleb, put your damn hearing aids in!!!

Manal Al- Sharif has The recent announcement that Saudi women are finally! allowed to drive prompted me to read this memoir sooner rather than later. Manal Al- Sharif has become (in)famous for getting arrested for driving while female. For most of us around the world, this is beyond ridiculous.Well, show me a religion that doesn't discriminate, oppress women in some ways. Then add to that a tribal society, with extreme, fanatical religious beliefs and customs and you've got Saudi Arabia.Besides Al-Sharif's troubles for driving, I've learnt so much more about the Saudi society. I'm afraid, I can't think of one positive thing. I was seething reading about the million and one injustices and hardships bestowed upon Saudi women. I was both calmed and annoyed with Al-Sharif's somewhat detached, elegant and delicate writing. I'm not sure if it's the translation or that's just how she wrote or it could just be a cultural thing, after all, Saudi women have been taught for many generations to keep quiet, to hide in plain sight. They're not even referred by their own names, but by their male guardian's! (Insert very unladylike words).Al-Sharif's strength and courage are to be admired and praised. As it's, unfortunately, the case for the people who push the societal boundaries, she paid a huge price, including losing custody of her son from her first marriage. As I was saying, I was seething while reading, which is nothing compared to what Al-Sharif and the Saudi women have to suffer through. As it's often the case, education more often than not means liberation. Financial independence means freedom. You don't have to be very smart to realise why in so many less developed countries women are discouraged from getting an education. Although Al-Sharif came from a very poor family, with both her mum and father being almost illiterate, she, her older sister and younger brother got a tertiary education. With that came knowledge, learning of different views, and not in the least, the ability to get a job. Al-Sharif's travelling for work to some Western countries, including living and working in the USA for one year, opened up her mind even more. The Internet, for all its drawbacks, is without a doubt one of the most important factors that contributed to many people's liberation through information and, most importantly, by providing the means for communication. Facebook and Twitter allowed Al-Sharif to organise other women and then communicate with the world about her plight. Without the world knowing about her, she would have probably perished. I'll conclude by saying that Daring to Drive was well worth getting me fired up against religion and/or men - Neanderthal men, that is.

The conflict between loving your family and wanting to be there for them and the mind-numbness of the constant chores. Even the sex is a chore.

Anyway...Winter is the second offering in the SeasonS quartet. As it was the case with Autumn, it's quite interesting, very contemporary and a bit confusing at times. (I'm not 100% sure I understood the symbolism, especially when it came to a child's detached head seen by sixty-something-year-old, Sophia. Was it mental illness, loneliness, dementia? Not sure I elucidated that aspect of the novel, if any of you did, do let me know. I guess it can be interpreted in many ways.)Sophia's son, Art, is a twenty-something, kind of clueless guy who's very contented with himself, one of those people who doesn't stand for anything, he doesn't hate anything, but neither cares or loves anything. He's got a blog, Art in Nature, and works for a copyright company, being paid to dob in copyright infringers he discovers while surfing the internet.His girlfriend, Charlotte leaves him, so in order to avoid explaining to his mother about his now ex-girlfriend, Art hires Lux, a girl he met at a bus stop, to pretend to be his girlfriend. Lux is a very interesting girl, who turns out to be very intelligent, knowledgeable and resourceful. She's Croatian-Canadian, but had to interrupt her studies after running out of money. Thanks to the instability brought on by Brexit, she's unable to find decently paid jobs, so she sleeps wherever she can find shelter, including in libraries or on friends' sofas. Lux challenges the oblivious Art, who despite writing about nature, never goes in nature. Art's nature is all fake. It was obvious in Autumn where Smith stands when it comes to Brexit. It's plenty apparent in this novel as well, although in a more subtle way. Again, Smith brings to our attention another female artist, this time, the sculptor, Barbara Hepworth. While the name was unknown to me, when looking up her sculptures, some looked familiar. There's plenty to analyse and chew on in this novel, despite its small size. It's not perfect, but it's oh so interesting.

This is not a whodunit, but rather why. And it's incredibly well done. First of all, I was impressed with how well Robotham drew the female characters. The two protagonists, Megan and Agatha, are worlds apart, although they live relatively close to each other. Megan is an upper middle class, yummy-mummy of sorts, with two kids, a TV sports commentator husband and another baby on the way. She writes a mummy blog, has friends, does yoga - she seems, at least to Agatha, to have it all.Agatha is divorced, works in a small supermarket. She's alone and lonely, and desperately wishes she had a baby, ""a baby would make everything better"". Agatha has been obsessed with Megan for a while. She stalks her. She wants to be her. But most importantly, she wants Megan's third baby.

Her debut novel, Love at First Flight, was very good and different, so5 ♥♥♥♥♥Beautiful Messy Love is the sophomore novel of Perth writer, Tess Woods. Her debut novel, Love at First Flight, was very good and different, so I was eagerly anticipating her second novel.After fifty pages or so I knew I loved it, but was it going to be a 5 star read?As you can see, it made it to five stars. Honestly, I loved everything about this novel. The characters were realistic and very interesting, and there was no over-the-top drama. Two love stories make the bulk of the novel. For Lily, a five year medical student, and Toby, a building supervisor and aspiring photographer, was love/lust at first sight, when they came across each other in a café. The only problem was that Toby’s wife was dying of cancer in the same hospital Lily was about to begin her medical rotation.Anna, a nineteen-year-old Egyptian refugee, works in a café, where she meets the football superstar, Nick Harding. She’s got no idea who he is, as she’s too busy working two jobs, looking after a refugee boy in hospital and volunteering at Asylum Assist, while also looking after her depressed mother. Nick is, or better said was, your stereotypical football star – attractive, cocky, and full of himself, a womaniser, who only thinks about football and his next lay. But he’s unexplicably drawn to the kind, not-his-usual-type Anna. Their relationship won’t be easy as they’ll have to face lots of obstacles, including the pressure of being in the media spotlight and prejudice as Anna is a Muslim girl.Without a doubt, my favourite character was Anna. Her backstory was heartbreaking. Through her, Tess Woods, brought to our attention the plight of refugees, and re-affirmed that each person has a story, more often than not, a very traumatic one. The refugees are not statistics! They deserve compassion and help, not the awful treatment that our heartless government bestows upon them. It’s outrageous and I am disgusted. Don’t get me started … Beautiful Messy Love is a women’s fiction novel, but it’s an outstanding one, as it manages to be relevant, funny, occasionally sad, and overall it made for an enthralling read.I can’t fault it in any way. I ♥ it!

On one hand, it deals with the life of Euridice Gusmao, who finds herself stuck into the role of model wife and mother, but is bored and wonders if there's more to life than cleaning, cooking and shopping. Throughout the book she takes on with gusto different endeavours: gourmet cooking and creating her own recipes - but her dull, unimaginative husband kills her aspirations to publish it, because who'd read something written by a ""housewife"". Later on, she becomes a very good seamstress. Again, due to the husband's disapproving she sets that aside. Eventually, she takes on writing. You see, whatever Euridice does she does well and with passion. Imagine all the things she could achieve if only she had free reign. There were many things that rang true. Some of the writing was quite cheeky and playful, I found that quite endearing. But then, I sort of became disenchanted with the novel, because of the too many side stories of many secondary characters. Some were more interesting than others. There were quite a few stories that felt like fillers to me. And ultimately, they all distracted me from Euridice's story and, for a good part, her sister's story.I had a hard time making sense of when the main part of the story was taking place. Apparently, it's in the 1940s. But why is it that I remember a TV? I've just Googled: TV transmissions began in Brazil in September 1950. Anyway, that's not that important - what I'm trying to say is that it was difficult to say when the contemporary action was taken place, especially given all the many side stories from back in the day etc. So while this novel had lots of good things about it, I felt it was uneven and lacked cohesiveness. Nevertheless, the writing sparked enough to make interested to read Batalha's next novel.I've received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

Javier decided to finally stop working as an escort and concentrate on his writing, as he’s a successful writer. Now that the many years of being what women expected him to be are behind him, Javier has some sort of crisis of confidence, as he is unsure of who he is and what he truly wants.Luckily, he meets Steff Finch, an art therapist, who works with men who had been abused. Steff, like Javier, is bisexual. But while Steff had had relationships with other men, Javier is pretty much a virgin. Without a doubt, their attraction is out of this world. Steff is a great guy and so is Javier. They dance around each other and take their time, trying and experimenting, advancing and withdrawing and finally, coming together.Suanne Laquer writes love epically. It’s the little details that make things seem real and touching.Another important part of the novel is the story of Geronimo (Geno) Caan, who had gone through an unimaginable ordeal.

The title itself couldn't be better because this novel is mostly about love and relationships and other things, that come under the umbrella of etc. Barnes takes a magnifying glass and points it at love, especially as its manifestation between a man and a woman. He does this very well through several unreliable narrators, but ultimately, this is the story of a threesome that's made up of Stuart and Oliver, best friends, and their wife, Gillian. Yes, that's right: Gillian was married to both of them. Not at the same time. First, she was married to Stuart and then divorced him for Oliver. Ten years later, Stuart comes back from the USA and gets back in touch with Gillian and Oliver, who now live in a shabby house and have two daughters. Gillian is an art restorator, and Oliver is ... I'm not sure what. Stuart is a successful business man. Slowly, he makes himself very useful by becoming their landlord, and eventually Oliver's employer. Is Stuart still in love with Gillian. Does he love today's Gillian or is he just thinking of the person he had fallen in love with all those years back?This novel had an unusual structure that I don't remember coming across before. The narrators addressed the reader directly. Incredibly enough, but not surprising given Barnes' talent, it worked really well. There was a playfulness about it and it had a certain rhythm that kept things interesting and moving along at a fast pace. It worked brilliantly as an audiobook, especially since three different narrators were reading the three main parts. Each voice was distinctive and contributed in different ways at putting the puzzle together. There were quite a few quotable passages, unfortunately, one of the disadvantages of audiobooks is that you can't keep track of them easily (I usually do chores when I listen to the audiobook, I rarely/never stop to take notes.)This was yet another fantabulous, brilliant, enlightening book from Julian Barnes.

The room was packed with people who had already read The Choke . It was a riveting session, so I couldn't wait to get stuck into this book.This novel is set during the early 1970s, in a small rural town in Victoria by the Murray River. Our narrator is Justine Lee, who's ten. She lives with her paternal grandfather, Pop, as her mum had left when Justine was three and her father, Ray, is a drifter. Pop has undiagnosed PTSD, following years working the Burma Railways as a PoW. He's also an alcoholic and is a bit clueless when it comes to looking after a girl, especially since he can barely look after himself. I guess he does the best he can. Justine is shy and doesn’t make any waves; she has no idea about hygiene, as her Pop only makes her have a bath occasionally. She's also dyslexic and a bit slow to understand things.I've read many books written from a kid's perspective, more often than not, it's obvious that an adult had attributed his/her own thoughts to a child. This is not the case with The Choke. Laguna did a fantastic job showing us the world through Justine's naive eyes. As far as I'm concerned, that was the stand-out thing about this novel. It felt very authentic. And it also had a distinct Aussie feel about it.i>The Choke is very readable - it has beautiful descriptions of the rural area and the dialogues are plentiful. Speaking of dialogue, at times, I was getting annoyed with the many ""I said"", ""he/she said"" after, what it felt, like every sentence in a conversation. It got better eventually or I got used to it.The story was somewhat familiar. Most of the men in the novel are pretty horrible: drunks, selfish, incompetent, and violent. Justine has no good role models, male or female. At times, it was heartbreaking witnessing Justine's naivety. She's an unjudgemental observer and almost invisible to most, except to her good friend, Michael. Their friendship was very touching. Times flies by. Justine is now thirteen, going to high school, although she can’t read. Unfortunately, her difficult life gets even more complicated as she finds herself having to deal with grown-up issues for which she’s completely unprepared. I’m glad I finally read Sofie Laguna. I must say I had very high expectations, which I guess made me feel somewhat deflated that I didn’t love this novel. The story was somewhat familiar and it never really hit me in the gut.

A beautiful, young teacher is found dead close to the local highschool. The main police investigator is a former school mate of hers - Gemma Woods - who's a detective at only twenty- eight years old. I liked that the main character was an imperfect police woman, with some dirty laundry in the closet. Unfortunately, despite her being the narrator, I never really warmed up to her. There was something off about the voice. Around the 26% mark, I had an inkling on who the killer was. I'm annoyed that I was right, although I didn't try to figure it out.

I like unr3.5 stars is a better representation of how I ended up feeling towards this novel.Initially, I was so taken with the language and the tone. I like unreliable narrators, Maurice Bendrix was excellent. I also found him infuriating.This novel is the kind that readers will grasp at different aspects.What did I get out of it? Passion is often confused with love, love can easily turn into hate. Passion is an obsession, a compulsion, an exalted state that burns everything in its wake. Despite hearing Maurice's lamentations and thoughts on things, I never quite got to know him or the object of his desire, Sarah, a married woman. She was beautiful and that is sufficient to drive one man or two mad with desire. Religion, particularly Catholicism, is a big part of the novel. Initially, I was taken with the narrator questioning god and the purpose of life. But towards the last quarter got on my nerves big time with its Catholic fervour and interpretations of coincidences and other unexplained happenings as acts of God. The novel lost big points because of that and I couldn't wait to be done with it. I had no idea that Greene was considered a ""Catholic novelist"". It never occurred to me that a Brit would be so focused on religion and god. I guess there are all kinds everywhere and anywhere. The man could write, that is obvious. I will probably attempt to read other novels by him, I shall avoid what is referred to as his ""Catholic novels""....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Dec 06, 2021","Dec 10, 2021","Jun 02, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29641.The_End_of_the_Affair

The conversations felt real and natural. The issues of class, race, good police vs bad police were dealt with in a balanced way, imho.

I've never heard of it, but then again, I hadn't heard of Julian Barnes himself until two years ago.I've picked this up without reading the blurb, solely based on the fact that it was written by Barnes. The only other book of his I read was Levels of Life which blew me away.Metroland is a coming of age novel of sorts. Christopher Lloyd is the main protagonist and also the narrator. Most of his ruminations are about his high school years, alongside his sidekick, Toni. When high school ends, they part ways as Christopher moves to Paris, where he finally loses his virginity at twenty-one. Fast forward to when Christopher is thirty, with a stable job, which he's surprised to enjoy, a mortgage, a wife and a child. Has Christopher become the epitome of what he and Toni used to deride. If so, is that necessarily that bad, especially when one finds himself unexpectedly happy and content. I so enjoyed this little novel. It's incredibly smart, so well written, deep, and at the same time, sardonic and sarcastic. It breathes intelligence, with a slight affectation, from the very first pages. Every sentence is perfect. As if all that weren't enough, Barnes throws in some French and some art, just to kill me. The narrator of this audiobook, Greg Wise, nailed down the voice, including the French accents.

She's been having a seven-year amorous relationship with Paul Sheringham, an upper-class young man, who's soon to marry for convenience. On that particular day, a day when servants were given the day off to go visit their mothers or families, Jane goes into Paul's house, for yet another hanky panky session, this time in his bedroom. This book is all about Jane's thoughts on her lover, their love-making, her situation, and a few observation on her employers. I wouldn't be able to say if Jane loved Paul, although she was aware that their relationship was mostly carnal. Nothing much happens. Except that, on Mothering Sunday, a tragic event occurs that will change the course of Jane's life, who'll become much more successful than ever thought possible, especially for a woman who was an orphan.The last third of this very short novel is about Jane waxing lyrically about her own life, few memories here and there, and the importance of books - especially of Joseph Conrad in her discovery journey of good literature, that ultimately pushed her into wanting to become a writer herself.This was a pleasant enough novel, but nothing mind blowing or life altering. I'm not sure what the message of this little book was. Swift can write very well.

It turns out, it's romance novels set in the Victorian era. I've been watching a lot of Victorian era movies and series lately, including Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Jane Eyre, so I thought why not read something lighter over the Mother's Day weekend.I've got a friend who's into romance books, so I asked her to lend me some regency ones.This was one of her favourites.For what it's worth, it was quite enjoyable. I pretty much read it in one sitting. As it's the case with most historical novels, contemporary tastes, attitudes and mannerisms seem to permeate. But one doesn't necessarily read this kind of novels for historical accuracy. From my limited experience with this genre, the Duke seems to be the Billionaire equivalent of the contemporary romance novels. Of course, this is formulaic: rich, powerful dude + ingenue young lady + sexual tension made even more exciting by being improper and not the done thing. Oh, the excitement!

Elise Diaz and Jamie Hyde are the protagonists of this passionate affair. Elise is a girl from the 'hoods', who's unsophisticated, uneducated, and doesn't have a plan or agenda. She develops a crush on Jamie Hyde, a preppy, rich, white boy, who lives on the same street, while he attends Yale. Eventually, they get together, and there's a strong, animalistic attraction between them. The sex is out of this world. They go at it, all the time. As others have stated it before me, there are a lot of sexual encounters in this book. You get used to it. Or you don't. This novel, set in the 80s New York, is an interesting study of contrasts, between the haves and have-nots, but in an observational, non-judgemental kind of way. The interesting thing for me was that neither the abjectly rich nor the very poor came out as superior beings. I guess the extremes are never good.I liked a lot of things about this novel: the writing is stellar at times. The characters are fully formed, and I liked that they weren't perfect, far from it. Then there's a lot of minutiae about the two protagonists' daily life. It got a bit repetitive, so I got a tad bored.Has anyone else imagined Elise as an African American/Puerto Rican girl? I know she was supposed to be white, but those cornrows made me image her as a non-Caucasian. It was interesting to note that once she moved in with Jamie she never changed her style, not even when she got a job, presenting off-the-plan apartments to potential rich buyers. It seems unrealistic to me, but not a huge issue.Anyway, White Fur was interesting, but I wouldn't say I loved it, and I can't quite explain why not. 3.5 starsI've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

I’m flabbergasted, after all, there I was declaring 2017 The Julian Barnes year. Given that this novel won the prestigious Man Booker Prize in 2011, it’s not completely unreasonable of me to have had high expectations. As it was the case with the previous seven Barnes books I read (actually, listened to), this was short and very concise. Unfortunately, in this case, its brevity contributed to my detachment, as the secondary characters were very under-developed.The story is told from Tony Webster's perspective, who's now in his sixties. He's one of those middle-of-the-road people, middle class, university educated and very average. He doesn't stand for much, is amicably divorced from the mother of his only child. He doesn't like to take chances or create any waves. I really admire authors who write about ordinary, average people. Let’s face it, the majority of us are average. Most of the times I’m content in my ordinariness, other times I get restless and discontent. But it’s all about perspective. And memory, isn’t it. As far as I’m concerned, the best parts of this novel were the philosophising paragraphs. I confess I’m one of those people who fall prey to them. “History is the lies of the victors … it is also the self-delusion of the defeated.”“History is that certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation.”“How often do we tell our life story? How often do we adjust, embellish, make sly cuts? And the longer life goes on, the fewer are those around us to challenge our account, to remind us that our life not our life, merely the story we have told about our life. Told to others, but – mainly – to ourselves. “The above were some of the paragraphs I highlighted. Oh, I should mention that this was the first Julian Barnes I actually read and not listened to, as it was the case with the previous seven of his books. Although I know it’s slightly illogical and very unlikely, I couldn’t help but wonder – what if I didn’t enjoy it because it wasn’t read to me? Then I told myself “don’t be ridiculous, it’s the novel”.My main gripe with this novel is the plot. The secret is not that big of a deal and getting to the reveal dragged a lot. When the book is as short as this one, it irks me even more. Had the other characters had more of an involvement in Tony’s life and had we known more about them, I would have been more invested. I know, it’s not fair to compare books, but so far, this is one of my least favourite Barnes book. In saying all that, the bar is very high, especially when you write as well and you are as intelligent as this author is.3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Jan 08, 2018","Jan 09, 2018","May 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10746542-the-sense-of-an-ending

I applaud her candour about her sexual relationships, bad relationships, abortions, drug taking, and motherhood.One of the most powerful chapters/essays is the last one, where she reads messages she received via email, blog comments, twitter, facebook and other social media outlets. The amount of vitriol and threats she's received is astounding. It's somewhat incomprehensible that most of us womenfolk are still heterosexual (stupid mother nature and all that reproduction bs...).

In some ways, this novel reminded me of The Rosie Project, without Just announced: Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine is a Costa Book Awards winner. In some ways, this novel reminded me of The Rosie Project, without a doubt, because of the main character, Eleanor Oliphant, is an odd one, a recluse, who doesn't fit in.Eleanor is thirty and has been working in an ad agency as accounts receivable officer for over nine years. It's the only job she's ever had. She's a loner, set in her ways - she's one of those people that you pass by and never notice or if you do, you avoid them. Her weekends are the worst, as she stays at home, all alone, drinking vodka into oblivion. Eleanor's routines change when one day, walking from work alongside her IT colleague, Raymond, they come to the rescue of an elderly man who has a dizzy spell and falls onto the street. What ensues are a series of events that discombobulate Eleanor but also thrill her in unexpected ways: she visits someone in the hospital a couple of times. A first for her. She goes to a bar for drinks. Again, a first. She's invited to a party. She's shown unexpected kindness and finds herself enjoying other people's touch, be it for a hug, or when she finally gets her hair cut and styled professionally - for the first time in her life. Things start getting better for Eleanor. Until a seemingly small incident triggers some very bad thoughts.I'll leave it there for fear of spoilers. Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine was an exceptionally touching novel. It was also charming, smart, funny and very well written. It's impressive that this is Gail Honeyman's debut novel. I loved the language. There were many words that I needed to look up. As I professed before, I dig that big time. Hopefully, I'll remember some of those words. This novel was full of heart! A big, beautiful heart! I so needed to read a book like this. HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDI've received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

You see, Lillian is a walkerIt's the last day of 1984 and the octogenarian Lillian Boxfish is walking around New York, as she'd done for six decades. You see, Lillian is a walker. Walking has saved her life.While going from place to place, Lillian retraces many of her life's milestones: moving to New York, in search of adventure and to escape her parents; her much loved job at Macy's, writing copy; her marriage and motherhood; her subsequent divorce; losing her job because of impending motherhood, and a major nervous breakdown.It's impossible not to love Lillian Boxfish, who was vivacious, loquacious, intelligent, creative and hard-working. She was ahead of her time and didn't care for conventions, while still fitting in and making a successful living as the highest paid female in advertising.Because it was told in the first person, this novel had the feel of an autobiography. At times it got a bit dull, but then, life can be dull, and it seems to get more and more so as we age. What can one do? ""The point of living in the world is just to stay interested."" If only it were that easy. One can be interested in the world, but it's painful as hell when the world is no longer interested in us. I wonder if men feel this as acutely as women do? While I liked this novel a lot, I would have liked to get to know more intimately some of the people who played an important role in Lillian's life. Even when it came to her relationship with her husband, Max, I never quite felt the love, although Lillian told us how much she loved him and that he was the love of her life.

Samuel Andresen-Anderson is in his early thirties, a University English ProfessoThe Nix is an epic and quite ambitious novel, in both scope and size. Samuel Andresen-Anderson is in his early thirties, a University English Professor and a failed writer.He feels stunted, disillusioned and uninspired. He spends many hours playing a virtual reality game called Elfscape, a way of escaping some unhappy emotions and thoughts. He's still affected by his mother's family abandonment when Sam was only eleven years old. Twenty years later, faith reunites him with his long-lost mum, as Faye is now an infamous ""liberal terrorist"", following her outburst that involved throwing pebbles at a Republican presidential candidate. Sam wants to write a memoir about Faye, which it'll absolve him of his contractual obligations with a publishing house. And so, he finds out quite a few things about his mysterious mother. The chapters move between 2011, the eighties and the sixties. There are many themes and threads that make this debut novel epic: family and secrets, feminism, today's entitled youth, the academia world, first love, videogame addiction, politics, the sixties' radical movements, today's culture and subcultures etc. As I've said in my opening sentence, The Nix is very ambitious. I won't lie, while being very readable, occasionally, it felt overwritten, and I thought it could have done with a good trim.One scene involving freshman Laura Pottsdam, whom Samuel fails because her paper on Hamlet was plagiarised, is poignant and very amusing, honestly, it deserves standing ovations, it was that brilliant.What transpires, in the end, is the universal truth that we're all screwed up to some extent. Our early experiences and relationships shape us a great deal. We are complex, complicated, and multifaceted. And we have the power, many times unwillingly, to destroy or alter someone's life.""What Faye won't understand and may never understand is that there is not one true self hidden by many false ones. Rather, there is one true self hidden by many other true ones. Yes, she is the meek and shy and industrious student. Yes, she is the panicky and frightened child. Yes, she is the bold and impulsive seductress. Yes, she is the wife, the mother. And many other things as well. Her belief that one of these is true obscures the larger truth, which was ultimately the problem with the blind men and the elephant. It wasn't that they were blind - it's that they stopped too quickly, and so never knew there was a larger truth to grasp.  ... Seeing ourselves clearly is the project of a lifetime.I am glad I finally got the courage to start reading this novel. I confess its size made me put it off several times. Let's hope Nathan Hill didn't exhaust all the good ideas and writing craftsmanship in this debut novel. I'm really looking forward to his sophomore project.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

Nevertheless, despite a complete lack of affection, Cyril is pragmatic enough and appreciated them for not being cruel or abusive. Cyril realises early in life that he's attracted to boys. In fact, he's got a huge crush on his best friend and boarding school roommate, Julian. They have adventures and become very close, still, Cyril never shares his secret with Julian. The secrecy and shame drive Cyril to commit some unpardonable acts, that cause a lot of grief.In his mid-thirties, after leaving Dublin for Amsterdam, Cyril finally finds love with a doctor, Baastian. Circumstances bring to their door a sixteen-year-old sex worker boy, whom they rescue, so they become his guardian of sorts. New York, 1987, full-fledged AIDS epidemic and paranoia - Cyril and Baastian live in New York, as Baastian works as a doctor in the AIDS department at Mount Sinai Hospital. After a few good years, things happen in New York that change Cyril's life once again.Years later, we find him back in Dublin, working as a librarian in the Parliament. He's now almost fifty. But he's making amends with some of the people whom he'd hurt in his youth.Sprawling over seventy years and almost six hundred pages, this novel was fantastic; it made me laugh, get angry, and cry. I also got a bit grossed out, because, eww, young men ...Issues of identity, parenting, Irish society are at the forefront of this novel. I'll admit that it pretty much preached to my biases, and I loved its antagonistic views on the Catholic Church which had such an influence on the very patriarchal Irish society. [How wonderful it is that gay people can marry in Ireland and other predominantly Catholic societies!Hopefully, Australia will catch up with the rest of the world when it comes to same-sex marriage because even the Irish managed to do it ... Anyway, I digress (can't help myself).]Read this! It's a big book, but it's truly excellent.

Without a doubt,Winner of the Man Booker Prize (It was my pick as well).Without a doubt, this was one of the most original novels I've ever read. Without a doubt, Lincoln in the Bardo messed with my head - with its unusual structure, formatting, and plot - it turned me upside down and inside out. Was it challenging? YES! And No...If it weren't for other GR friends' raving about it, including the only Book Club on the Australian TV, I wouldn't have bought it, because ... Lincoln - excuse me my American friends, but you sort of fetishized him and I tend to run away from such idols (unless they're musicians and/or writers, but I digress). Don't worry, the Australians do it as well, and they have even less history to choose and pick from. Anyway...As it was kindly suggested by the lovely Iris P (https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2...), I also bought the audiobook, and, honestly, it was such a great idea. I think this book should be sold as a package deal. It helped me a great deal to differentiate between the many narrators, which there are so many of (166!!!!). I didn't always listen and read consecutively, but I should have, as occasionally when only listening, I would get distracted and lost. Midway through the book, my curiosity got the better of me, so I went online searching for George Saunders interviews. Those interviews made a huge difference. After listening to him talk about this novel I had an ""I get it now"" moment. Of course, one could argue that a piece of art should stand on its own, without the extra props. I had those discussions with myself as well. But then I thought, wait a minute, this is like when you love a painting or a piece of art, yet, if you find out interesting tidbits about it, then you look at that piece of art in a different way, you appreciate it even more. I don't know if I'm making much sense, I'm writing this as I'm drinking my second glass of wine ...So, what did I think of this little novel? It was:- very original- it took some time to get used to its structure, voices ... my brain was trying to make sense of what was historical fact or artistic licensing. (Once I listened to Saunders explain that Lincoln was just a conduit for telling a story about grief, loss, memory and a few other things, I relaxed much more and just went with it).- it's not for everyone - nothing is - but this time if I see people's negative s - I will understand and won't think ""What's wrong with you?"" :-) - this book should be studied - probably not in high school, on account of the ""f_ing and f_k"" encountered quite often in this little novel (my problem wasn't with the words, but with ""people back then didn't say those words"" - but see above my second bullet point) and on account of the students's reduced capabilities and knowledge. But I can see it being studied at University level. Now comes the difficult moment: how do I rate this? In so many ways, this was a 5, but then I have to ask myself if I enjoyed that much? I can't remember the last time I had such a difficult time deciding how to rate a book. But I certainly am very happy to have read it. This will become one of those ""badge of honour"" type of books. Or maybe not. What do I know?Rating - 4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"May 07, 2017","May 17, 2017","Mar 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

When in Paris, she decides to finally take her life into her own hands and do what she wants for once - kill herself by throwing herself into the Seine.Since she's the main character, obviously, she didn't succeed. She's rescued. She ends up in a hospital. She speaks no French. But takes off and makes her way to the quaint little town of Kedruc in the Brittany. All that because of a beautifully painted tile that she found in the hospital. Kind strangers help her to get there. She ends up working in a restaurant in Kedruc where the young chef starts teaching her French. She must be a genius because she seems to go from no French to expressive French and some Breton in no time at all. And she sure seems to have lots of time and energy to share. She works in the restaurant during the busy season; she takes to cleaning, washing sheets etc in the rooms of the empty hotel where she was given a room. She meets some older people suffering from Alzheimer and Parkinson and she takes to redoing their garden, keep them company etc. Also, she loves to explore the area, take very long walks etc. As I was saying, she's very energetic, not only for a sixty-year-old. She finds love. All good, right. I was... you go, girl. There are many characters in this novel and they had their stories to tell. I don't think all of them were necessary or that they added that much to the novel. (hide spoiler)]I'm dumbfounded that I didn't enjoy this novel more, as it had all the ingredients I enjoy: French settings, older characters, love stories, starting over, happy coincidences, smaller quaint communities, food - you get the idea. Still, in spite of all these nice ingredients, the resulting mix was dry and boring - you know, like eating to survive, instead of savouring and being taken to another place by the extraordinary meal. This novel needed some seasoning, I'm not quite sure which one, as the resulting ""dish"" was edible but not memorable. Ok, I'll stop with the food analogies, you get the idea.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

So, I'll just write down a few thoughts.When I borrowed this book, I had no idea what to expect, as I didn't read the blurb, I just saw it was available, and since Barnes was on my TBR, I downloaded it.I enjoyed this audiobook from the very beginning, as Julian Barnes' narration was music to my ears - I love his proper, educated, English accent. Barnes is a wonderful narrator, who managed to keep my interest, even when the story was getting a bit drier, with ballooning terms and other technical aspects. I must confess, I knew almost nothing about ballooning, so it was interesting to learn a few things. If it makes any sense, I was fascinated with his fascination for ballooning, and that he had obviously thought about and researched it. In this first part, we learn about the British Frederick Barnaby who managed to cross the English Chanel in 1882 in a hot air balloon. Also, the earlier days of photography and aerial photography come into play, through Nadar. I guiltily admit that I had no idea who Barnaby or Nadar were. But that's one of the amazing things about Levels of Life, it made me look up more information on the people mentioned in it.Masterfully, in the second part, Barnes managed to move on to the relationship between Barnaby and the famous French actress, Sarah Bernhardt (I did know who she was). Bernhardt had been extensively photographed by Nadar, who had also flown in a hot air balloon with Barnaby. We learn about Barnaby's infatuation with Bernhardt and their brief relationship.Without a doubt, the pièce de résistance is the last part, The Loss of Depth, which is autobiographical and reveals Julian Barnes astounding grief following his beloved wife's death in 2008. I cannot remember ever reading anything about grief and a partnership that was so beautifully articulated, so raw, and so heartwrenching. I had to take a couple of breaks, as it was too much to take in. The fact that Barnes himself was narrating it, made me sob even more. That last essay is mostly about grief, but also about memory. Just thinking about it makes my eyes fill up with tears. As far as I'm concerned, The Loss of Depth is a masterpiece. Before I got to the last essay, I was contemplating a 4-star rating, but The Loss of Depth elevated the entire book to 5 stars +. I am convinced I have found a new favourite writer in Julian Barnes. I am looking forward to reading more of his books....more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Mar 08, 2017","Mar 10, 2017","Mar 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262198-levels-of-life

Oh, the pressure … Occasionally, I indulge in romance novels. Country romance is not necessarily a favourite subgenre, but knowing that this was Rachael Johns’ tenth full-length novel, and given that it was available on NetGalley, I decided to give it a go.Talk of the Town is set in Walsh, a small town in Western Australia. It’s always nice to read a novel set somewhere familiar (relatively speaking).Twenty-five-year-old Megan McCormick is running away from her past, so she bought a derelict big house, in Rose Hill, a ghost town, near Walsh. A flat tire causes a chance encounter between Lawson Cooper-Jones and his eight-year-old son, Ned, with the reclusive, Meg. Lawson is a dairy farmer and a widower. He’s quite good looking. Of course.Both protagonists are attracted to each other. Both are reluctant to start anything, Megan even more so, because she’s got an unsavoury past.I enjoyed this novel a great deal. The characters were well-drawn and realistic. The plot is straightforward, although there were some interesting, unexpected twists, which I appreciated very much. I like it a lot when I am surprised, especially when it comes to romance, a very formulaic genre. So, for what it’s worth from this reluctant country romance reader, this was an accomplished, thoroughly enjoyable read. I’ve received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

I read three of your novels and thought I had you all figured out. But then you wrote Beartown and managed to surprise me. Big time!Beartown is a small town on the decline. Fewer jobs are available, the property values are decreasing, there isn't much to lift this town or keep it together, except for hockey, junior hockey. The hockey fever has overtaken Beartown, as the junior team is playing in the league semi-final. Imagine being a high school kid and having to deal with so much: the pressure of the competition that you’d naturally feel, the pressure of the club through its board members and sponsors, also, the parents' and town’s expectations. Hockey is an obsession. It’s also a way to get validation and a get-out-of-town card.We are in many ways influenced by our environment. This small town in the forest, with its endless cold and dark months, feels claustrophobic, more so for some of its inhabitants. Most people are simple, set in their ways, not very accepting of people who are different or have aspirations that are different to their own. The double standards that still apply to women are even more discernible in a small town. I appreciated Backman’s ability to portray the inner turmoil that goes inside so many women who have aspirations and needs beyond those of just being wives and mothers. Unsurprisingly, nobody’s life is simple. Everybody has hang-ups, inner struggles or real struggles, regrets and disappointments. For many, life didn’t quite turn up as they’d imagined. ”Bitterness can be corrosive. It can rewrite your memories as if it were scrubbing a crime scene clean, until in the end you only remember what suits you of its causes.” Beartown is quite the departure from the previous Backman novels, which were inhabited by many quirky characters. This novel is darker, grittier. The writing style is different as well. What’s not different is Backman’s ability to create realistic, complex characters, regardless of their age, gender or backgrounds.This novel has a huge cast of characters. The protagonists are the hockey players and their families, the coaches, the general manager and his wife and kids. Teachers, bar owners, businessmen are also part of the cast. Some of the characters are given more air-time than others, still, none of them is redundant. Incredibly enough, I never got confused about who’s who, which only demonstrates, again, Backman’s incredible skill.Great writers are also great psychologists. They speak life’s truths in a way that allows us to connect, relate, and understand. They also hold up a mirror to ourselves and society. Backman’s craftsmanship accomplished all that and more in Beartown.  I’ve received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

The more I think about it the more I'm impressed.This is the story of an old Vietnam Veteran, David Granger, who finds himself under the doctor's knife to have a brain tumour removed. Slowly, we begin finding out about David's life, as he starts telling us his story. You see, Dave did some ""bad shit"" when in the jungles of Vietnam. He was a good soldier did what he was told, no questions asked. Following his discharge from Vietnam, he managed to integrate into society pretty well, becoming a very successful banker. His life wasn't the easiest though. As a gun crazy Republican, he has a very strained relationship with his very liberal, art-loving, only son, Henry.Dave is a thing of beauty. He's so damn opinionated and politically incorrect -the liberal snowflake in me was a bit put off, but only for about five minutes.Dave's observations are acute and astute - I ended up really digging him. He doesn't mix his words when it comes to expressing his opinions, but he's got a problem expressing his love, admiration and all those fuddy-duddy feelings. His actions speak more than his words.For the first half of this short novel, I was wondering where and if the story was going anywhere, but I still enjoyed reading it, because it was bang-bang-bang, penetrating line after line of witty observations, recollections and other life tidbits. The tone and language were perfect. There were lots of expletives but they fitted perfectly the character's personality and the story. It was so natural, so life-like. This is the second book by Matthew Quick that I read. They couldn't have been more different as far as the writing style and subjects are concerned. But that only makes me admire Quick's skills even more. I am keen to read more by him. RecommendedI've received this novel via Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest .

The forests are inhabited by lyre birds. A year ago, a big fire destroyed most of the community – people and animals perished, properties were destroyed. One year on, having witnessed the big fire, Annie, a veterinary who lives in the city, is unsettled, depressed and suffers from PTSD. Her six-year-old daughter, Pip, is also affected by last year’s experiences and she’s acquired quite a few challenging behaviours. Annie and her husband, Tom, try their best to accommodate Pip. But Annie can’t deal with the city life anymore. To Tom’s dismay, she quits her job and goes back to the mountain, where her mother, Susan, is struggling to cope with her own mother’s death. Their relationship is not easy, as Annie’s grandmother, Gladys, was more a mother figure to her than Susan ever was. The only male presence in Annie’s life was her uncle, Len, now a veterinary, who loves lyre birds. I really liked Len. He was such a caring man.Returning to the devastated community and to her now partially destroyed childhood home is challenging. Locals are still trying to put their lives together, some with more success than others. There’s animosity, bitterness, depression and hate. The mountain still hasn’t recovered from the fires. Everything is burned, grey and dry. As in her previous novel, the characters are very ordinary people, people who aren’t particularly charming or good looking or rich. Their relationships are simple, yet complex. These relationships are stretched to their limit by traumatic events. This novel starts off slowly and builds speed progressively. Henry-Jones unravels the story with back and forth stories in time – the structure very similar to In the Quiet. I loved the writing, the characters and the settings. It’s a simple story, about ordinary people, who have to find a way to move forward. I was enthralled, so much so, I stayed up till 1 am to finish it.As excited as I was to read this, I was also apprehensive fearing disappointment. Phew, I’m so glad when something lives up to my expectations. Ache is a tender, heart-warming novel with a distinct Australian feel. I’m looking forward to reading whatever Henry-Jones comes up with next because her writing is special and full of heart.

I also love stories that deal with racism, small town mentalities. This novel was labeled (literally, on the cover) ""an Australian To Kill a Mockingbird"", so I went into it expecting greatness. The American masterpiece is mentioned several times in the book. And also a few other books by Mark Twain, Faulkner.

To begin with, why does Jasper Jones want Charlie's help, when they weren't exactly friends? Jasper Jones is fourteen and he's considered the troublemaker of the small, mining town of Corrigan. Another thing that bothered me was how little Charlie was affected by the gruesome discovery of the body of a girl he knew, who was the sister of Eliza Wishart, the girl Charlie fancied. Jasper Jones is a survivor, who pretty much raised himself, as his father is an alcoholic and doesn't care about him. He's probably not very well educated. Yet, he's philosophical about the human nature, about how insignificant human beings are in the universe, about geography and God: ""I reckon people are fools to be claiming this or that for themselves, drawing lines and territory. Just like they're fools to be thinkin that some big bearded bastard gives two shits how much money they throw in a tin tray or if they eat fish on a Friday. That's all rubbish"".  Well, I know we have a problem, when even though I'm completely in agreement with the statements, I still have a hard time believing that these sort of thoughts came out of Jasper Jones or even Charlie. I could easily see Craig Silvey's hand in it and it wasn't the first time. Charlie's best friend, Jeffrey Lu, the child of Vietnamese refugees, is one of the most endearing characters. His cheekiness, optimism and blind determination to make it into the school's cricket team were heart warming. I really enjoyed reading the parts when they were interacting and their banter was quite cute. Also, the adolescent love story was touching.As for the writing, I thought it was uneven, brilliant at times and then clunky; even the beautiful passages felt too forced, especially since the narrator is a thirteen-year-old. The novel could have done with some editing and some cutting of some of the filler passages in the middle. I am disappointed I didn't enjoy this more. This time, I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with my mood. At least now I can go watch the movie.I've read this book for the Australian Writers Challenge on Booklover Book Review Blog (www.bookloverbooks.com ; http://bookloverbooks.com/readi...)...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jan 27, 2017",Feb 2017,"Jan 27, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8407173-jasper-jones

I wasn't sure what to expect, as I didn't bother to read the blurb before I got stuck into it.Our narrator is Paula Vauss, a mid-thirties, successful, divorce lawyer. She is the stereotypical successful lawyer: cut-throat, manipulative, determined. She's got a softer side to her, but she's good at hiding it, even from herself. Also, Paula has a big aversion to commitment, not hard to grasp why, as Paula had had a very unusual childhood, raised by her city and men hoping mother, Kai, who's also very fond of Hindy stories. When Kai went to jail, Paula spent some time in a group home. Needless to say, that was not a pleasant experience.One day, Paula's predictable life begins to unravel. First, she hears about her mum's imminent death. Then new people come into her life. Before it's too late, Paula has to find her mother. To do that, she hires Birdwire, a very good private eye, but who's a bit messed up, not to mention that he's got a thing for Paula. I'll leave it at that.This novel is not a what I'd call a light read, due to the issues it addresses: unfit mother, abandonment, regrets. The thing that it impressed me was the light tone of this novel. The mix of irreverent and serious worked its magic on me. The characters were very well drawn.My  is not doing justice to this novel.

The result was a concoction that felt too diluted, sort of like multivitamins (lots of ingredients, but not enough of any compound to make a difference).While I love lyrical writing, in this case, it was overdone and repetitive, and I thought the author was trying a little too hard. If I'm being honest, I thought the magical realism element was an unnecessary add-on to make the book more whimsy. Good whimsy and magical realism are difficult to pull off. There are some interesting plot twists. Secrets. Mean, beautiful girls.

It was different, mesmerising and slightly unsettling.I seem to have read quite a few novels set in remote, desolate and very cold places. This time, it's the woods of Northern Minnesota. The narrator of this novel is Linda, a lonely fourteen-year-old, who lives with her somewhat recluse and atypical parents in an ex-commune. When she meets the owners of a newly built house near-by, she has a reason to get out of the house, make some money as a babysitter to four-year-old, Paul and hang-out with Patra, the boy's young mother. The father and husband is a professor, 13 years Patra's senior. We are told quite early on that something had happened. So I kept reading with anticipation.There's another thread in this story concerning Mr Grieson, the new history teacher, who's attracted to Lily, the most beautiful girl in the class. Linda is watching their interaction and also watches Lily for signs of change. Mr Grieson is not at school for long, as he is accused of inappropriate behaviour. This novel is hauntingly atmospheric, almost ethereal. Fridlund can write very well. The structure though, especially in the last quarter, discombobulated me at times, as it became more jarring, going back and forward in time. There are quite a few things that are ambiguous and upon reaching the conclusion, I was none-the-wiser. If anything, the ending is one of the most discorncerting endings I remember reading, as I have no idea what it meant and I didn't see it coming, and it made no sense. I will re-read the last pages, but if you understood it, feel free to enlighten me.This is a novel about loneliness, the need to belong and be loved, and especially about the choices we make and we take or don't take based on our beliefs. It's a good novel, despite its flaws.I'll conclude by saying that I liked this more than the other Man Booker short-listed novel, Elmet and less than Autumn.

I had seen Trevor Noah on British Comedy shows on the Australian TV before he took Jon Stewart's place on The Daily Show. I thought he was funny and smart. And good looking. My opinion hasn't changed. As I stated before, I struggle rating memoirs, as it feels like I'm rating someone's life and choices, which is far from my intentions.It was fascinating and enlightening to read about life in South Africa from the perspective of a biracial or, as they're called it in South Africa, colored person. He reaffirmed to me how ridiculous the whole race thing is. Most of us have heard of Apartheid and that it was bad. I was riveted to read about the day to day life, about the many languages and ethnic groups, about the ridiculous rules, the classifications based on the visual assessment of white clerks of someone's melanin levels. Things seem so complex and complicated over there. Noah's mum sure is an interesting, full of contradictions character. She is determined and obstinate. And extremely religious, attending three Sunday services at three different churches. If that is not enough to put you off religion/church, I don't know what is! Anyway ...This was an easy read. I confess I didn't find it particularly funny, but I didn't mind. Without having the first-hand experience of South Africa, I thought Noah was very balanced in his accounts. It's hard to tell if it's because he's mixed race, or because he was very young when the Apartheid was abolished, or just because he's experienced lots of different things and he's a smart, open-minded individual. It's probably a combination of all of the above and more. He never came across as bitter or angry. I guess because those feelings are being perceived as ""negative and undesired"" most memoir writers disguise them. Fair enough.After reading this, I feel like I know a little bit more about South Africa. I have a couple of close white South African friends. They have quite different views when it comes to South Africa, Apartheid, I'm pretty sure their opinions are informed by their experiences, upbringing, British vs Afrikaans heritage etc - I find it fascinating....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Apr 21, 2018","Apr 27, 2018","Jan 15, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime

It has a few things in common with A Kiss from Mr Fitzgerald: it’s set mostly in the interbellum New York; the main heroine, Leonora (Leo) East is a young woman ahead of her times, who’s determined to make it, no matter what. Leo East is the only daughter of the chemist in a small English village. She works in her father’s shop, and in her spare time, she mixes rouge and mascara formulations. She dreams to make them mainstream. November 1918 brings the good news about the end of the war, but also the dreaded Spanish influenza, which kills lots of people in the village, including Leo’s beloved father. Orphaned and only nineteen, Leo sells everything and makes her way to America, to start a new life, unencumbered by the past and small village mentalities.A powerful storm delays her passage to America. While waiting in an inn for the storm to pass, Leo meets the charming Everett Forsyth, heir to a department store empire. They fall for each other and a passionate night of lovemaking ensues. But unforeseen events take place, which prevent Leo and Everett’s new love to bloom. Everett, being a true gentleman, is forced by circumstances to marry someone else. Leo is determined to forge ahead, to make her dreams come true. She has two jobs, a place where she can mix and trial her concoctions. There is a hic-cup in her plans. But she deals with it the best way she knows how, helped by her Australian friend, Joan, and the Chinese American, Jia.Leo eventually marries Benjamin Richier, who provides her with the funds and production facilities to start her cosmetics line. Because of that, she’s in the same circles as Everett, but they manage to stay away from each other. Twenty years on, we meet Alice Forsyth, Everett and his unpleasant wife’s daughter. She’s a ballerina, with the potential to become the prima ballerina in Balanchine’s latest production. At rehearsals, she meets the new gorgeous lead man, Jesse Valero. The chemistry is out of this world, but he’s not the type of man Alice’s mother wants her to marry. What will she do? I so loved this last part of the novel, as it’s fair to say I have a soft-spot for anything ballet.I think I’ll leave it here, I’m afraid I’ve already given away too much.Her Mother’s Secret was even better than A Kiss from Mr Fitzgerald, in my opinion, anyway. It has the required ingredients for a good historical romance fiction: interesting lead characters, the required adversaries to make life difficult, passionate love, secrets, coincidences, great settings.Natasha Lester managed to add the right ingredients to concoct a beautifully packaged novel that will enthral you to the very end.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I’ve received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

Admittedly, it was a busy time of the year and it was probably not the wisest choice of reading material for this period. I'm surprised to see that it's only about 320 pages long, I was under the impression that it was around the 500-page mark.What can I say about Idaho since I'm not completely sure how I feel about it. The only thing that I'm certain about is that Emily Ruskovich is a talented writer, who can do prose and atmosphere beautifully. There are pages and pages of gorgeous, dream-like writing. The novel has an interesting and, at times, confusing structure, going back and forward in time, including to the future, in a non-linear way. One of the aspects that added to my confusion was the multiple points of view, especially from relatively small, insignificant characters. I kept waiting for them to reveal themselves as important pieces of the puzzle. Speaking of reveals, unfortunately, while I am not one to demand everything to be tied-up nicely with a bow, there were way too many questions left unanswered, even when one keeps in mind that not everything has an answer, not every behaviour can be explained.(view spoiler)[Why does a seemingly normal, loving mother kill her daughter, May? We never find out. I kept waiting for the reveal, so when the novel ended I was still as confused. What had happened to June, the older sister?

I really wanted to, not to mention I felt some pressure to love it, as most of my GR friends did.I liked it some, while being very keen to be done and over with it.As many others have said before me, this is an ambitious novel. Nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work for me. Given the subject matter, I didn't feel as engaged, heartbroken or enraged as I normally do when it comes to slavery, imperialism, and women's struggles.I couldn't keep track of who was who and what the family relations were. I think that had something to do with the fact that so many life stories were packed into a relatively short novel, by the time I got to know them, we moved on to someone else's story. Rinse and repeat. Also, my ARC had absolutely no space between chapters, if there were any. I would have loved proper chapters, preferably starting with a date and location, so that my brain could turn the switch on or off.The nonlinear timeline messed up with my brain even more. I've read many novels with a similar structure and didn't have any issues, but in the case of Homegoing it was a major drawback. Some of the stories, vignettes, made me feel more than others, to be expected, I guess.I had forgotten that the British and the Dutch were involved in the slave trade. Also, and it makes sense, some of the African tribes had something to do with it. So it's not just white people being evil, correction, white men being evil (which they were), it's men with power, period. I don't know why it surprised me that much, all you have to do is think of the genocides happening in so many parts of Africa, where Africans kill other Africans.In saying all that, I don't recall reading other novels about the beginning of African slavery who ended up in America. I am not sure if there are many novels written on the subject and from the African perspective. So, that makes Homegoing important. I do appreciate it because of this. I am just a bit disappointed it didn't impact me in a more visceral way. So, I'll conclude my ramblings by saying that Yaa Gyasi is a talented writer; I appreciated her skill and ambitious project. Without a doubt, we need more stories like this.

I loved the somewhat older, educated British way of speaking, in total contradiction with the modest social status of the main characters. I can't remember a better writer of dialogue. There's plenty of dialogue in this novel, which makes it a very quick read.Divine writing!

I'd forgotten how lush the language was, and what a great writer Dickens truly was. Ghosts, spirits, and supernatural creatures are not something I particularly enjoy reading about. Of course, while A Christmas Carol is about ghosts, they are employed to show Ebenezer Scrooge the right way. The moralisation is clearly obvious, after all, Dickens was a devout Christian, who was extremely charitable. But, there's nothing wrong with that. It was a bit sentimental, but if you can't be sentimental around Christmas, when can you be?I should definitely make more of an effort to read at least 2, 3 classics a year.

This is a psychological thriller, a classic ""who's-done it"", that kept me reading compulsively.Our unreliable narrator is twenty-one-year-old, Australian Eleanor, who's moved into her uncle's townhouse in London, to start a new life. She's temping as an administrative assistant in a publishing house, where her aunt, Susan, is a powerful executive.But something awful has happened. One of the marketing executives, Arabella Lane, was found drowned in the Thames. Her death is suspicious. Eleanor is one of the last people to see her at the previous night's work party. Eleanor though has huge gaps in her memory, as she had drunk with Arabella, who had also slipped drugs into both their glasses.Eleanor is full of anguish and doubts, as she can't remember much from the night of the party, while memories of something that happened in the past also resurface. Things unravel quickly. She soon realises that all is not well with the marriage of her uncle Ian and Susan. Their kids, thirteen-year-old, sulky, Neave, and the seven-year-old, Savannah, are disconcerted and upset about Arabella's death, who was a family friend. Eleanor is determined to find out what happened. I will leave at that, as I don't want to give away spoilers.This is another beautifully written, psychological thriller. Sara Foster does descriptions very well, I could feel the cold sipping into my bones, as I was reading about wintery London.I also enjoyed the Australian settings, as Eleanor reminisces about what happened in the past.Besides the great characterisations, I appreciated the story's plausibility. I often struggle to suspend my disbelief with some aspects encountered in thrillers. It was never the case with The Hidden Hours>/I>, which gets extra brownie points for this. The new Sara Foster thriller is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, which I highly recommend.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

Apologies for starting my 2016 on Goodreads with a platitude. I still remember writing last year’s reading , though.In 2016 I didn’t read as many books as in 2015, but considering the shitty year 2016 turned out to be, I’ll have to say I still did OK, managing to read 80 books. So what were the standouts this year?Most of you following my s already know the answer: A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles was, without a doubt, my favourite book of the year. I adored Count Rostov. I can’t wait to read Rules of Civility by the same author.Other favourite books: My Name is Lucy Barton by Elizabeth Strout, The Waiting Room by Leah Kaminsky, Fortune Smiles by Adam Johnson, The Portable Veblen by Elizabeth Mackenzie, An Exaltation of Larks by Suanne Laquer, Brit-Marie was Here by Fredrick Backman, The Sea by John Banville, The Girls by Emma Cline, Our Souls at Night by Kent Haruf, The Light Between Oceans by ML Steadman, Commonwealth by Ann Patchett, Words in Deep Blue by Cath Crawley, Autumn by Ali Smith.Sure, there were a few duds, but that’s to be expected.I am very grateful to NetGalley and the publishers for approving me for so many wonderful books. Sure, I am behind in my reading, but that’s because I am greedy and can’t bear the thought of missing out on a masterpiece. This year I was lucky enough to get lots of printed books from publishers, via giveaways and competitions. I haven’t read many of them. I also bought many books and was lucky enough to have them signed by the authors: got two signed by Jonathan Franzen, whom I haven’t read yet, had seven books signed by Tim Winton, one of my favourite contemporary writers, had one book autographed by AC Grayling and also had The Undermajordomo Minor signed by Patrick DeWitt. This has been the year I met some wonderful writers from Perth. Some of them I had read and had no idea they were placed in Perth. The only problem with meeting the real person writing a novel is that it becomes harder to be genuine and authentic with your s. As many of you know, I’m not very diplomatic. The best thing about Goodreads is the community. I’ve made some wonderful new friends this year and also developed a closer relationship with many I got to know last year. I am totally inspired and in awe of many of you. Had it not been for your wonderful s and recommendations I wouldn’t have read A Gentleman in Moscow and so on. I don't have many friends who read, and I only know one person who reads literary fiction - how depressing, right? They say most readers are introverts, which is probably true, but while I've been called many things, introvert has never been one :-) I need like-minded people to connect with. Which is why this community has come to mean so much to me. So, as it’s traditional, I shall wish you all a Merry Christmas/ Happy Hanukah etc and may 2017 be a great year. (I am not optimistic about it, but hey, I won’t mind if I’m proven wrong.)Best wishes,Bianca...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,not set,not set,"Dec 08, 2016",,,view (with text),/book/show/33232571-2016-on-goodreads

It's fair to say this is one of the most, if not the most, descriptive novels I've ever read where bodily functions, from excretions to periods, hygiene, and smells are extremely prominent but work perfectly to convey the decrepitude of Eileen's world, both inner and external.

I've definitely never read anything that involved pest relocators/controllers. That was quite new and interesting. Unless you suffer from insectophobia, in which case, stay away. The main character, Katya Grubbs, is a Painless Pest Relocator, who's attempting to get rid of what's considered vermin, by catching and releasing in other places. She's an unusual woman, a bit of a loner, partly due to her rough upbringing. She's become a pest controller, just like her father, whom she is estranged from. This is a somewhat allegorical novel, with an environmental message, about the destruction man causes to the environment and to the many creatures, big and small. South Africa's dysfunctional socio-economical structures and functions are apparent. There are some beautiful descriptive passages and the writing has merit. At times, though, the novel sags and lags, nothing happens, and you wait and wait for Katya to discover those insidious bugs that she was hired to find in Nineveh, a new housing development that apparently swarms with some mysterious insects. Nineveh seems fantastical and surreal. Some strange things occur. Nineveh is an interesting novel, with a gripping premise, setting and characters, and some excellent writing, but uneven in parts.

I loved MyI saw a new book by Elizabeth Strout on NetGalley, and I instantly clicked the request button, without bothering to read anything about it. I loved My Name is Lucy Burton so much, I’m happy to read whatever else has Strout’s name attached to it. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter Lucy Burton again and some of her relatives and people from her past.The interconnected short stories are about people who knew Lucy Barton back when she was a little girl in Amgash, Illinois. We meet again Tommy, the school janitor, who had been kind to Lucy back in the day. Some of the protagonists are the Pretty Nicely Girl, Patty and her sister, who had chosen very different paths in life. Other characters are Dottie and Abel Blaine, Lucy’s cousins and Mary Mumford, who had five girls and left her fifty-one year marriage to go live in Italy with her much younger new husband. Lucy Barton is making an appearance as well, when she visits Amgash, two decades after her father’s passing. Her poor, lonely brother, Pete, still lives in the derelict family house. He’s happy and nervous to see Lucy again. Their sister, Vicky, is not so pleased. She’s envious, bitter and can’t get over the fact that Lucy left and never came back. When old memories resurface, Lucy suffers a terrible panic attack. It’s astounding how certain sorrows from our childhood can still hurt us so much even decades later. Some people had very rough starts in life. Poverty is a huge disadvantage, but the lack of nurturing, loving relationships in early life seem to cause even more inner turmoil. Regardless, one way or another, we all are damaged. Certain stories I liked more than others, better said, they touched me more than others, but as a whole, the entire book was gripping, touching and, sorry!, so depressing. Strout has created a very complex cast of characters, full of warts and pain. Her writing is simple, yet it conveys a huge array of human emotions, especially when it comes to sorrow, loneliness, and resentment. It all feels very real, almost voyeuristic. Human relationships are complicated. No matter what you do and don’t do, what you say and don’t say, somehow, eventually, probably, someone will get hurt. Even though we speak the same language, we don’t really hear each other. We all have regrets, but we have to carry on.Anything Is Possible was another compelling read from Elizabeth Strout.

But there is one big secret that's been driving Felicity crazy.Emma is divorced and the mother of three teenagers. She's struggling and is constantly exhausted. Genevive, aka Neve, is a make-up and hair artist and a single mum to Will. She's been lying to her son and parents for a long time.

Lots of things happen while they're in New York.I can't say too much more because it will spoil it for you.I will just say that the characters' struggles are relatable. The power of female friendship is at the centre of this novel. I enjoyed reading a novel set mostly in Perth. The writing is accessible, without many flourishes. Each friend is given relatively equal air time, so we get to become very familiar with their inner thoughts.

It was like a journal with entries stating: we went there, we did this, we met this person and that person, we went to this bar or this restaurant and so on for most of the novel. Of course, I persevered. I didn't particularly like any of the characters. I didn't care about any of them, not even Katie, our main heroine and narrator. I found her cold and soulless.

The last eighty pages or so it did get better, although, a bit too many knots are unknotted. Despite all that, certain threads had unsatisfactory conclusions.I thought Rules of Civility was extremely uneven, with the beginning and the ending being pretty good, albeit not outstanding. The bulk of the novel though didn't excite me at all. The characterisations were lacking and when that happens, it's impossible to get invested in what I'm reading.

I'm glad to report I've picked a very enjoyable novel, that I gobbled up over two days.Young, feisty Evie Lockhart, wants to do more with her life than just be a wife and a lady of society. There weren't many options for well-to-do girls in the 1920's America. Fate has a way of showing Evie what she should do with her life. With the help of her nice neighbour and potential mother-in-law, Mrs Whitman, she ends up going to New York where she attends summer school in order to become suitably educated to get into medical school. She encounters all sort of obstacles, starting with her family's disapproval, society, male students and teachers and not in the least, her would-be fiance. But Evie is determined. One of her biggest supporters is Thomas Whitman, her boyfriend's older brother. Despite only meeting a few times, they develop a great relationship, as Thomas seems to really get what she's about. Of course, life is never that easy. All sort of complications ensues. The relationship has ups and downs. You won't be surprised to hear that there is a happy ending. Unsurprisingly, the thing I enjoyed the most about this novel was that our main heroine was a woman ahead of her time. Also, like many others, I enjoy reading stories set in the crazy 20's. The love story was nice, but I didn't quite feel the passion. Regardless, this was a great companion over two long summer days.

Thief of Hearts is nowhere near as charming.

I don't live in the UK, but I do know about something ""small"" called the NHS - free medical cover.The male character is Stuart, thirty, recently out of jail for car robbery. Stu is very hot. And of course, brooding. That doesn't stop him coming onto her quite aggressively, despite Andrea being his teacher. This is supposed to add extra tension because of the teacher-student forbidden liaison. Stu seems to have some dyslexia type problems, yet, he shows extraordinary talent when it comes to mathematics. Andrea is our narrator. I found her tone annoying at times, with too much telling and over explaining things.The plot was kind of drawn out and, at times, too convenient, the chemistry missing, despite some graphic sex scenes.

I am so happy to have, at last, made her acquaintance. Because this novel is so god damn good. It's also challenging. Or at least, I found it challenging at times. But I like this type of challenge. Most of the time, I was just blown away by the observations and the wonderful prose. Occasionally, when the story took a somewhat esoteric, fantastic turn, I wasn't sure I was getting it or what Smith was trying to convey, but I enjoyed the ride anyway. I've highlighted so many passages, I wanted to share them on Goodreads, but my modest Kindle touch doesn't allow me to.This is a very complex, multi-layered novel. And it's very contemporary, some knowledge of the current British socio-politic environment would allow for a better understanding of what Smith is writing about. I like to think that most people who'd pick up a literary fiction novel are quite knowledgeable, so I shouldn't be worried. Through her characters, especially through Elisabeth Demand and her mother, we get to know about England post-Brexit. I've highlighted entire pages. I'll give you a taste: All across the country, people felt it was the wrong thing. All across the country, people felt it was the right thing. All across the country, people felt they'd really lost. All across the country, people felt they'd really won. All across the country, people felt they'd done the right thing and other people had done the wrong thing. All across the country, people looked up Google: what is EU? All across the country, people looked up Google: move to Scotland. All across the country, people looked up Google: Irish Passport Applications. All across the country, people called each other cunts. All across the country, people felt unsafe. All across the country, people were laughing their heads off. All across the country, people felt legitimised. All across the country, people felt bereaved and shocked. All across the country, people felt righteous. All across the country, people felt sick. All across the country, people felt history at their shoulder. All across the country, people felt history meant nothing. All across the country, people felt like they counted for nothing. All across the country, people had pinned their hopes on it. All across the country, people waved flags in the rain. All across the country, people drew swastika graffiti. All across the country, people threatened other people. All across the country, people told people to leave. All across the country, the media was insane. All across the country, politicians lied. All across the country, politicians fell apart. All across the country, politicians vanished...  There's more, but I'm tired and running out of space here. My American GR friends, this may be about contemporary Britain, but how very American at the same time, right?There are some funny and absurd scenes as well. There is a great friendship story between a very old man, Daniel Gluck and a young, lonely, precocious girl, Elisabeth Demand. I am particularly fond of stories of friendship between the young and the old. Autumn has a strong feminist vibe and commentary on how the art world perceives and expects female artists to be. It was really interesting to learn about the forgotten British pop artist, Pauline Boty. Her tragic story broke my heart. Kudos to Smith for giving her a voice. Of course, I had to Google images and read a little more about the 60s' artist.There is so much in this novel that can be discussed and analyzed. It's definitely not for everybody, but what is? So, if you like something different, smart, creative, read this, you may love it, or at least find it interesting. I personally can't wait to read more of Ali Smith's works, as I'm intrigued by her.I've received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

In the beginning, actually, for more than half of it, I thought it was clinical and cold. And boringly mundane. But it could have been Tremain's intentions, to portray the somewhat more cerebral, colder nature of the Swiss people (apologies for the generalisations)? I don't know.Our main protagonist is Gustav Perle. We first get to meet him when he's five years old, right after the war was over. He's a sweet, sensitive and considerate boy. He lives with his mother, Emilie, in a very small apartment. Their life is hard, as his mother is working a low paying job in a cheese factory. She's bitter and depressed, and never shows Gustav any love. At kindergarten, Gustav makes a new friend, Anton, who's a very anxious Jewish boy. His family is very well off. The two boys strike an unlikely friendship, which Gustav's mother is unhappy about, as she dislikes Jews. The novel moves forward and backwards in time. I thought the childhood period was given unnecessarily long attention. I got bored and couldn't wait to move on. Other aspects were more interesting, such as the chapter about Gustav's parents.We skip forward decades to when Gustav is in his 40s, then his 50s and his 60s. Poor Gustav, he's managed to make a comfortable life for himself, but his life is completely devoid of pleasures, relationships and nothing exhilarating ever happened to him. He was a very dull person. I guess there are people like that, but I don't know if I wanted to spend that much time in his company.It wasn't all bad, but it could have been better if it had a bit more focus and, dare I say it, if the characters were slightly more interesting and or animated. The last quarter had a much faster pace, more revelations come to the surface, things happen to Gustav and his friend, Anton. Arguably, the ending is a bit too tidy, but I didn't mind it too much.So, in conclusion, this was a decent novel, but not the life altering, illuminating experience that I was told to expect.3-3.5 starsNB: The audiobook was pretty good....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 20, 2017","Apr 27, 2017","Sep 30, 2016",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/29902113-the-gustav-sonata

Australian Charlotte de Chastenet was in a coma for two weeks and has amnesia. She finds herself living in a huge, cold Chateau, with a husband and daughter, whom she doesn't remember. She doesn't remember her very cold and proper mother in law, either.Charlotte is confused and can't trust anyone. Somehow she remembers her best friend, Susannah. Luckily for Charlotte, Susannah visits and is trying to help Charlotte put things together. Charlotte is under an almost permanent fuzziness, which seems to make her even more confused. Did she have an affair with her handsome, next door neighbour, Ryan? Her mother in law seems to imply so. She also seems to go out of her way to bring Charlotte and Ryan together. While Charlotte can't remember Henry and their life together she can't believe that she would have cheated on him.Told in the first person, Ridout did a good job conveying Charlotte's confusion and frustrations. The descriptions are vivid. Le Chateau is a very sensory novel, with the visual, olfactory and auditory senses fully fledged and beautifully expressed. This novel even has a soundtrack of sorts, most of it, David Bowie's songs. I guess you can't go wrong with that. Amnesia is a good device for creating suspense and intrigue. I usually grumble about it, as I find it too convenient and most authors tend to make it too over-the-top and I have trouble suspending my disbelief. In this case, Ridout showed great restraint and I didn't have any ""yeah right"" moments. So that in itself is a great skill that I appreciate.This was a very accomplished debut novel.

I don't think I enjoyed this as much as my other two GR friends, who'd read it before me.The blurb says a lot about what this novel is about. It's basically Livia's Lone quest to find her little sister.She's also seeking revenge for all her suffering.I feel like I should have liked this much more than I did, especially given that the main character is a strong, take-no-prisoners young woman. I would like to say that I was bothered by the fact that she killed/murdered some very bad guys, but I had no qualms about that. The author made sure that we knew how bad and deserving of the supreme punishment they were. I won't deny, the sexual abuse was difficult to read. I sort of skimmed over certain parts of those recollections. I did think there was too much of that, although I get it why Eisler would do it: so that it makes us know how bad sexual abuse and human trafficking are. I dare say most normal, non-sociopathic people get it.There were a couple of things where I had to suspend my disbelief, but it wasn't too bad, compared with other novels in the genre.So despite loving to read about kick-ass women, and bad guys getting punished, I didn't feel emotionally engaged.

On one hand, it's brilliant, on the other hand, it infuriated me.How come, you ask? Well, for starters, what's with all the Latin? There was so much of it in the beginning. I have a basic understanding of Latin as I studied it in school a long time ago and my native language is of Latin origin. Still, I thought it was excessive. Then there are the run-on sentences. So convoluted, filled with metaphors, truisms, sarcasm, neologisms, and many other isms, I found myself finishing a phrase and not getting it. I felt bombarded with too much smartness, too many language twists, analogisms, some obscure (to me) references - I got dizzy. True, I'm in a rather funky reading mood, and I've been quite busy/tired, still, I can't remember the last time I struggled to follow the meaning or ideas of a text I read.So, yeah, I got really annoyed and tired, while at times finding some spot on observations, some cheeky remarks and being in awe of his talent. But it got too much. I missed the point, so I won't be reading it past 50%.Maybe I'm not smart enough for this book.

Nobody is completely evil either.The writing is smooth and it meanders on its tip-toes through different periods of time and memories, making wonderful vignettes of life.There is an unfortunate incident, you think it's one thing but only towards the end, we find out what actually happened.I'm going to think about this for a while.

For the first quarter I couldn't understand who was who and what was what. The writing was competent, but the structure and the characters confused me.The timelines messed up with my head as well. For quite a while, I couldn't quite figure it out when the novel was set. It begins with seven-year-old Teresa who found a Steiner violin in the tip, where she was scavenging with her mum for things to sell on. Initially, I thought maybe it was set in the nineteenth century. They were doing it rough, food was scarce, mum was making a living from sewing. There were very few modern elements to give us a sense of when the story was taking place. Later on, another character's pov, there's reference to the falling of Berlin Wall. Aha! 1989. And then it moves back in time, another character's pov, another setting.I got dizzy and a bit annoyed. As you know, I love music of all kinds.

I knew from the very first pages that I will like it. I just had to read it all to find out if I will love it.Amor Towles has created one of the most endearing, charming and wholesome male characters ever. I know, one shouldn't use absolutes, but that's how I feel. Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov is an aristocrat, a true gentleman, who's erudite, worldly and genuinely kind. In 1922 the bolsheviks sentence him to house arrest in the Metropol hotel, he takes it all in his stride and tries to make the most of it.The Metropol becomes his entire world. He continues to dine in the luxurious restaurant Boyarsky, where the cuisine is top class. He usually has a night cap at the bar. And having lived in the hotel for so many years, he knows everyone working there. The Count treats everyone kindly, including those beneath him. As they say, if you want to see someone's true colours, watch how they treat those with a lower socio-economic status. Over the years, we see the Count adapt to different situations, while still remaining perfectly poised and well mannered. Some people he meets over the years alter and touch his life in unexpected ways. For instance the vibrant nine-year-old, Nina, ""with a penchant for yellow"" (I loved this description), who challenges and enchants the Count. Alongside her, he gets to know all the nooks and crannies, and the hidden rooms of the Metropol. They become the best of friends. Occasionally, the Count is visited by his university friend, Mishka, with whom he shares some wonderful memories. Also, the Count becomes a tutor/mentor to a high-ranking party colonel, who's looking to learn French and English, manners and about different Western cultures. And then, when he's forty-six years old, the Count becomes an unwilling minder of a 6-year-old, Sofia, Nina's daughter. That sort of turns his routines on their head, but he gets a grip and deals with the situation with grace and tries his best. This novel is so rich and layered; it's full of witticisms, of quotes from novels and poems, and lots of small but touching moments. It's a novel that needs to be savoured - slowly. I loved the many Tolstoy references from War and Peace and Anna Karenina, two of my favourite novels of all time. I loved the music (I'm listening to Chopin's Opus 9, No. 2, while writing this ) and the movie references. I thought the historical aspects were quite interesting as well.But above all, I loved the Count. Can you even imagine knowing, meeting someone like that? Sigh...The writing is just sublime. It's musical, cheeky and smart and just special. The devil is in the details, and oh, the details and the little gestures were like hidden gems that shine suddenly when the light is just right. To say that I appreciated those is an understatement. Honestly, I could go on and on about this novel. I won't.I will just end by saying that A Gentleman in Moscow is one of the finest novels I've ever read. It's going straight to my Favourite Books Shelf, right next to Tolstoy's masterpieces. And, of course, I'll be heading out to the bookshop to buy me a printed copy.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

It's great to discover that there are adult graphic novels that have depth and deal with ""real issues"", not superheroes and god knows what other fantastical creatures. I really enjoyed reading this book. Especially because I learnt something new about Iran. In all honesty, I didn't know much about this country. One forgets that Iran used to be quite a progressive country. But then the Islamic fundamentalists came to power, and the rest is history. Revolutions and wars are no fun and Satrapi's family and friends suffered quite a fair bit. This was a candid portrayal of what it was like to be a girl in Iran during the Islamic revolution and the war with Iraq; what it meant to be an immigrant and feel out-of-place, being both grateful to have freedom but also missing your family and your homeland.When she finally returns home, she feels unsettled and it takes work to adapt to the new realities post-war and under the strong Islamic rule. Persepolis was a fascinating read, an intimate look at Iran and the Iranian's private vs the public lives during a difficult period, which, as we know, hasn't gotten much better.

So what if it's labelled ""young adult"". If it's good, it's good.  Our protagonists are Rachel Sweetie and Henry Jones, both eighteen. They've been best friends for many years, with a three-year gap, when Rachel moved away to another town and stopped all contact with Henry. When Rachel moves back to town, she finds things are not the same, as Henry is dumbfounded that Rachel hadn't missed him. Or had she?Rachel starts working in Henry's parents' second-hand shop, cataloguing their books. Howling Books is a very special place, where many beautiful memories have been made. Where books are special. People leave messages and underline special passages in books. All those special books are held in the Letter Library; those books are not for sale. Of course, books are the centre of this novel. As a book lover, I am somewhat an easy prey when it comes to books about books, although, I've read plenty of novels about books that didn't quite do it for me. This one had references from contemporary and more classic novels and poetry and a few other genres. I never got the feeling that Crawley was just name dropping for the sake of ... whatever. Of course, this novel is about more than just books. It's also about loss, grief, and love. It's also about finding your crowd, who accept you for who you are, even if you are a ""freak"". The books are the conduit when it comes to confessing love, learning about love, and moving on with life despite grieving the loss of a loved one and the loss of places and objects. Crowley is a terrific writer, who managed to engage and transport me from the very first page.Honestly, I loved everything about this novel. The writing is superb, all the characters, including the secondary ones, are well developed and real. Despite having shed some tears (shhh, don't tell anyone), this was uplifting, calming, and optimistic. Ah, another thing I should mention, this novel has a great filmic (is that a word?) quality about it. I could easily see the scenes as I was reading. I hope somebody grabs the rights for its adaptation and makes it into a movie. Who doesn't love coming-of-age movies?Of course, now I'm keen to read more of Cath Crowley's novels.

She's not a show-off. The stories, essays, recollections, journal entries were varied, ranging from moving house - which she did countless times to living abroad, looking after grandchildren, writing, movies, books, friendships, including her decades-long friendship with Tim Winton. Now in her seventies, it makes sense that many of her stories, touch on getting old, on the indignities of getting old, on loneliness, on dying etc. Garner mentions her three marriages, but we never heard any details about her husbands. I guess it's her right to keep things private, besides she's got kids with one or two of those men and they're probably still alive.But as far as I'm concerned, I spent a few hours in the company of a woman who's had an interesting life, who's intelligent and an excellent writer and astute observer.

The main character is Yukiko Oyama, the daughter of a Japanese executive who's working in the 60's New York. Yukiko is a teenager and feels split in two between her Japanese heritage and living in America. She feels horribly lonely, ugly and stupid.She's not a ""good Japanese"" and definitely not an American, as she doesn't look like anyone else. She is either bullied or completely ignored at school. Odille is the new kid at school. She's blonde, very slim and very beautiful. She's worldly and sophisticated. They become friends. Well, friends is a broad term, they hang out together, Odille is the leader who teaches Yuki to dress, drink and takes her to bars, where they meet men. They're the most unlikely of pairs. Being outliers has brought them together. But there isn't much complementarity or sharing or secrets. It's a very strange relationship. But the only one Yuki has ever had with another girl.Through the years, we see Yuki being left by Odille, who moves to Italy to model; Yuki getting a job as a receptionist, and Yuki moving in with a man twenty years older, who has a temper and doesn't shy from hitting her. It was heartbreaking to read Yukiko's justifications and her ability to let it slide. Her self-confidence was so low, she wondered why would anyone choose her.Yuki's only ambition, aspiration is to become an artist. She really needs to be one. She's not terribly talented, she doesn't know which way to go. She takes some classes, where she reacquaints herself with Edison, whom she had met years before. Edison is a nice man, who cares for Yuki and through the years becomes her somewhat secret, supportive friend. I'm trying really hard not to give away too much. Although, ultimately, this is not necessarily a novel where lots of things happen. This novel is about belonging, or better said not belonging anywhere, about loneliness, low self-esteem, depression, finding your calling, making bad choices or just doing the best you can with what you've got. Rowan Hisayo Buchanan is a competent writer who managed to bring to life a very un-interesting and hard to love character. I liked that Yuki was extremely ordinary and unsophisticated, and, sorry!, awfully blank. We rarely read about such characters.

I've never read anything before where the AIDS epidemic was such an important element of the story. You would think given its scare factor, it would be more prominent in literature. I expect there will be more ""AIDS stories"" popping out soon, following the success of this novel.Besides AIDS and everything around it, this novel is about family, relationships, adoption, sexual identity, hard drugs, mental illness. I appreciated Christodora, but I wouldn't say I loved it. It took me a while to get into it and for some time, I couldn't keep the characters straight in my head, due to the back and forth jump in time and between different characters. Eventually, I got things right in my head as far as the characters were concerned, although I never got emotionally invested with any of them. Admittedly, it could have been a case of ""it's not you, it's me"" type of situation. It happens.

I should probably start this  by saying that if you expect Graeme Simsion's third novel to be anything like The Rosie Project 3.5 starsRight... I should probably start this  by saying that if you expect Graeme Simsion's third novel to be anything like The Rosie Project and The Rosie Effect you'll be disappointed. Especially if you expect any laugh-out-loud moments.The Best of Adam Sharp is about an almost fifty-year-old British guy, Adam Sharp, reminiscing and longing for his ""big love"" - an Australian soap opera actress he met when he was twenty-six and working in Australia. The first part of the novel is pretty much dedicated to Adam and Angelina's affair. We get to learn how Adam and Angelina met, fell in love, and subsequently, broke up.Twenty-two years later, unexpectedly, Angelina gets in touch via email. Of course, this brings back memories and sort of re-energises the somewhat dormant Adam to slim down and get a job. It also makes him realise that his twenty-year relationship with his partner, Claire, has come to an end.Coincidentally, Angelina suggests that Adam should come to her house in a French village, where she's going to stay for a week. With her husband. Angelina's husband is an accomplished acquisitions lawyer, a great cook and wine connoisseur. Angelina is an Equal Opportunity Commissioner and the years have been kind of her, she's still beautiful at 46. Adam is in a middle of a marital crisis of sorts. Things happen. Will Adam get his second chance to be with Angelina?Read and you'll find out.I am a little bit conflicted about this novel. First of all, my emotional investment in the characters and their stories was pretty much zero, zip, nada. I just didn't feel it. Not even the young love, supposedly passionate affair, didn't raise my temperature or made me go mushy in any way. I don't know if it's because of the first person narration, which I thought was kind of dry and a bit too analytical, which I guess is in keeping with both Simpsion's and Adam's backgrounds in IT.You probably don't know this about me, I am a huge music lover, from opera and classical to oldies, dance music, latino, rock (pretty much everything, but trash metal and country music). This novel comes with a soundtrack of sorts. Music is an integral, essential character in this novel. So, I am kind of bummed for not having enjoyed this novel more, especially since I'm also pretty close to the characters' age. On an intellectual level, I had no objections to anything Simpsion wrote about: relationships are complicated; people are complicated; the everyday living has a way of numbing relationships.It's just that I lacked an emotional connection, and I think I should have been more engaged given the many reasons, mentioned above. When it comes to this novel, more than other times, it could easily be a case of ""it's not you, it's me"" situation.What can I say? You feel what/how you feel. And my problem with this novel is that I didn't quite feel it.I'm looking forward to finding out what others think about The Best of Adam Sharp.It was a good novel, but somewhat sparkless.3.5 starsCover: 4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Oct 03, 2016","Oct 06, 2016","Aug 04, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30136324-the-best-of-adam-sharp

At times, voices, subplots changed abruptly, which I found jarring, but after a little while, I understood what was happening. Somewhere in the middle, it got a bit tedious, as there were too many details about the teenagers and their friendships and relationships, it went on and on. That's not to say that there weren't some great observations to take in. I just wanted a little less of that. The diversionary tactic was too obvious.Koch does psycho very well. Actually, he's terrific at showing people's worst sides, including the unpalatable, the unuttered. I dig that. At times it gets uncomfortable, but sometimes uncomfortable is good. The bits about the ageing writer, with his way-too-young wife and very young daughter were the most interesting for me. Koch allots a lot of time to bring to our attention aspects about the writing process and all the hoo-ha that goes with readings, going to awards ceremonies and publishers' parties, the rivalries between writers and so on. There's philosophising about literary vs bestsellers. As I've said, there are many themes to get your head around.A big chunk of the book is dedicated to the group of high school friends, which had a large cast of characters. While the names were familiar, at times I had trouble remembering who was paired with whom, and who loved whom, because, as always, things are complicated. Then there's a youngish history teacher who falls head-over-heels with one of his seventeen-year-old students, Laura, who plays with him and then breaks it off. This is one of the main plots, because of the teacher's disappearance.That disappearance was the subject of one Mr M's bestsellers. That's what connects the different parts of the novel. The ending came out of nowhere, as you'd expect. Sorry for the long drivel. While this novel was imperfect and it could have done with some trimming, it was nevertheless fascinating and compelling.

But it was available to download, so I took the plunge. I knew early on that this was not going to be a 5-star novel for me, but it had the potential to make it to 4 stars.I liked the premise. Who hasn't wondered if they were happy, happy enough? What if they made different choices, took different paths, would they be happier? When you add a partner and kids to the equation, the happiness concept becomes even more tricky to quantify, especially when the drudgery of the daily life gets in the way. So what better way to discover that you should be happy and grateful for what, and especially, who you have, than to actually be given the opportunity to discover how your life would have been had you taken the path that you've always thought you were destined to take. Dark Matter is like a magician's act, who distracts you with some shinny glitter or other things, in order for his manoeuvrings to go unnoticed. The distractions in this novel are some pseudo-scientific concepts related to quantum mechanics - something so out of the grasp of most people, one pretty much can say anything and go unchallenged. I didn't expect a science book and honestly, my brain was half switched off, due to doing chores, nevertheless, I could spot some things that didn't quite add up.Dark Matter was written in the first person, from Jason Dessen's perspective. Jason is a physics professor at a second-grade college in Chicago. He's married to the beautiful Daniela and together they have a fifteen-year-old son, Charlie. Jason has some regrets about not having fulfilled his potential, due to choosing to get married and becoming a father. Then things change and it puts things in perspective.Dark Matter is an extremely fast-paced novel. The writing is utilitarian, besides a few scientific-sounding words and concepts, it's all basic. There's a lot of repetition in this novel, such as: get into the building where the box> was, inject yourself, be in the box, enter a slightly different world to the one you knew, rinse and repeat. Jason was doing many of these sliding door scenarios with the help of a psychologist, Amanda Lucas, who had initially helped him escape from the lab where he was being experimented on. The two of them go through different life-threatening experiences. Sexual chemistry develops, brought on by the situation. Then, suddenly, Amanda disappears. I personally didn't buy the reason for it. Dark Matter  asks some important questions about choice, identity and happiness. The answers are simplistic and fed to us on a platter through the eyes of Jason Dessen. I like more nuance in literature. The fancy concepts, most of them inaccurate or implausible, weren't enough to make me overlook this novel's shortcomings.So, I'll put myself in the box ""I don't see what all the fuss is about"".

I finally got my hands on it, as I anticipate seeing 4.5 starsI wanted to read The Museum of Modern Love since it came out a couple of years ago. I finally got my hands on it, as I anticipate seeing Heather Rose this weekend at the Perth Writers Festival.I'm not the biggest fan of books that bend the line of non-fiction with fiction. But I am a huge art lover and I find Marina Abramovic fascinating, intriguing and quite extraordinary. The first time I came across Abramovic's name was by reading an article about her performance piece Rhythm 0 (1974). My jaw dropped to the floor. Anyway, back to the book.I've read this cover to cover including the preface and the acknowledgements. Most of the names have been changed, with a few exceptions: Abramovic, Ulay (one of her former husbands) and a couple more. The story centres around Abramovic's The Artist is Present - a 75 day event that took place at MOMA in 2010.Rose weaved beautifully this real artist's story and her art exhibition with the lives of other characters. One of those characters is Arky Levin, an ageing New York movie music composer, who finds himself shunned away by his dying wife. Uninspired and aimless, he finds himself at MOMA, where he’s reluctantly mesmerized by what he sees inside the square, where Abramovic sits for hours on end having eye contact with whoever sits on the opposite chair. No words are exchanged, just eye-contact. Some people can only seat for a few minutes, others for half an hour or longer. As time goes by, Levin recognizes some of the faces in the crowd, people who come back again and again to see this extraordinary event. He also makes the acquaintance of a recent widow, an art teacher from Kansas. Together they discuss what makes something art, what is its role in society. Both contemplate their own relationship with art and with their life partners. Another important character in this novel is the ghost of Dina Abramovic, Marina’s mother, who was a WWII hero and a very strict parent. Through her, we hear some details about Marina’s childhood and some thoughts on the former Yugoslavia. Those of you who, like me, are not into ghosts and other such apparitions, need not worry, as it’s not over-done, it just adds some context to what and who made Abramovic. Obviously, one has to remember this is a fictionalised account, so we don’t know the truth. I personally plan to read much more on Abramovic and I’m going to watch the documentary The Artist is Present very soon (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcmcE...).Those of you who are somewhat reluctant to read a book about a performance artist because you feel you don’t get it or know much about it, let me assure you that this book is not highbrow in any way – it’s incredibly accessible and very readable, while managing to inform and transport us into an artist’s mind and also managing to convey the importance of art and artists even when their art is not everyone’s piece of cake.

She's also a very creative and modern writer. ""The Sudden Appearance of Hope"" (great title, by the way) is a wondrous, thought-provoking novel.It is kind of genre-less. Scratch that. There is a genre called 'urban magic'. Forgive me, I'm kind of ignorant when it comes to all these subgenres. When I saw that some people categorised it as SciFi and/or fantasy, I was kind of dispirited, as those are not genres I enjoy reading. But for those of you who might have the same apprehensions as me, let me assure you that you shouldn't worry.Sure, the main heroine, Hope Arden, is forgotten by everyone who sees her within one to two minutes of not seeing her. But other than that, it is in many ways a contemporary novel, about present day issues. Hope Arden's forgettability affords her to get away with stealing, which she has to do in order to survive. She's become a professional thief.Through Hope, Claire North is taking a good look at some of the new social matrices related and regarding the internet; the apps; the quest for perfection as deemed by the media and Hollywood; at the increasing divide between the rich and the poor. But all these things ultimately relate to identity.What is wrong and what is right? How would you behave if you could get away with everything? Can you be your own person without the influence of parents, siblings, teachers, societal norms etc? There are lots of things to ponder.There really is a lot packed in this novel, a very ambitious project. I do feel it was a tad too long, it could have done with a tighter editing. But other than that, it was a brilliant, original and a very compelling novel.I will definitely read more novels by Claire North/Catherine Webb/Kate Griffin because I'm intrigued. (Really authors, what the? Way to confuse us. I can deal with an author writing different genres, I totally can. I have more of a problem remembering names. Rant over.)

This was mind-blowing, original, compelling and just out of this world. To be honest, I didn’t expect to like it, but I was trapped into its web of beautiful, smart language, intelligent observations and playful metaphors in the first minutes. My mind is full of expletives, the good kind, which express incredulity and admiration and wonder “how does he do it?”Suspending my disbelief was unbelievably easy to achieve. A foetus as the narrator? Why the hell not. What a crafty writer, intelligent being McEwan is for coming up with such an original idea. Some of the foetus’ smartness comes from listening to conversations and to his mum’s many varied podcasts. The foetus is extremely observant. And very opinionated. He loves his mum, Trudy, after all, he lives inside her. Not that he's unable to see her failings. And she’s got many. For one, she’s taken with her husband’s brother, Claude, after kicking her husband out of his own house, claiming she needed distance. The foetus’ father, John Cairncross, is a struggling poet and poetry publisher, an incurable romantic and a terrible bore. Trudy likes a drink or two and is not much of a cleaner. She doesn’t seem to stand for much or form opinions on many things; one of those pretty women with not much in the way of an interesting personality – you know, many men’s ideal woman.The foetus is bewildered and appalled by the lovers’ plotting to kill his father. The house they live in is valued at about 8 million pounds, so the temptation is huge. Things unravel steadily. Meanwhile, we get to hear all sort of interesting musings about the state of the world, poetry, Britain, and sex. I found the descriptions of the sexual encounters amusing because they were so … literal, yes, literal, not literary, but visceral and matter-of-fact and perversely devoid of beauty and mysticism but mostly short-lived, with funny groans, bodily fluids and so on. ""Not everyone knows what it is to have your father’s rival’s penis inches from your nose""  Bloody brilliant! I can't finish this  without talking about the writing. As my writing skills are limited and for lack of better words, as not all of us are gifted like McEwan, I'll just say, it's orgasmic.In a nutshell (sorry, not sorry), NUTSHELL is a masterpiece. I so needed to read something this good. And I am happy that I finally got around to reading (well, listening to) an Ian McEwan book. I am looking forward to reading more by McEwan. I’ve got Solar and Atonement on by bookshelf.Confession: I had forgotten that this was a retelling of Hamlet by Shakespeare. And thank the literary gods for that, as my previous experience with a Shakespeare retelling - Vinegar Girl by Anne Tyler - was one of the biggest disappointments of 2016.

It's been consuming my time for the past five days, as it's extremely dense.Of course, it's like nothing I've ever read before.I'm not the biggest fan of memoirs/biographies, so I was reluctant to read it, especially since I already had a million books I needed to read. A few days ago I was on youtube, watching an interview with John Banville and one of the videos that were suggested I should watch was one with Karl Ove Knausgaard. So I thought I'd better check this guy out, see what all the fuss was about. Well, after watching it, I checked out the online catalogue of my local library and saw that Book 1 of My Struggle was available. So I had to go get it.So what do I make of it? It makes for a compulsive reading. It's sort of addictive. As a literature reader, I'm familiar with character driven stories and very descriptive narrations. Knausgaard sure takes it to another level. He meanders his way through different periods of his life, with his teenage years and his father's death being at the centre of this first book. There are some beautifully descriptive passages. And a whole lot of ordinary, common writing. Not terrible but somewhat unpolished. That is incredibly enough refreshing and original. The thing that I liked/appreciated the most about this fictionalised memoir was Karl Ove's vulnerability that so clearly transpires. I've never read any stories where a boy/teenager/man cried so much like Karl Ove seems to be doing in this novel. Also, there are things he says, admits to that are uncomfortable and that many of us think, may have thought of but never dared to say and felt guilty for even thinking. Like wishing your dad dead. Like being in a relationship and knowing you don't love your partner. Like finding raising children terribly tedious and not necessarily fulfilling. Etc. Obviously, given the immense success of the novel, many people must have, for one reason or another, empathised and, or sympathised.I've read a few s on Goodreads. There are some amazing s, some of them, extremely articulate and very well written, and somewhat much more literary and better written than the book they were ing, which I found amusing/ironic.I can see why some people would wax lyrically about it; I can also see why some people would absolutely hate it. I tried to read it without (much) prejudice, although my expectations were raised by the hype. I managed to enjoy it for what it was, I read each and every god damned word and I'm pretty sure I want to read the rest of the books - call me a masochist. I confess, I may have watched 10 or so youtube interviews. What can I say, the guy is very charming, and I dig his accent.So do I think it's a masterpiece? No. Is it interesting and different?

I was planning to read the ebook I'd purchased a few months back. Then I came across an audiobook at the local library and I couldn't pass the opportunity.I am so thrilled to have managed to finish my first audiobook. There I was stating loud and clearly that audiobooks weren't for me. Maybe the problem were the books and/or the narrators? Or timing? Regardless, I'm thrilled to bits. The Last Painting of Sara de Vos really appealed to me in all aspects. As I stated before, I love art. In my early twenties, I used to be quite taken with the Dutch and the Flemish painters. So it was really nice to delve back into the Ducth art world. Smith's descriptions were so gorgeous and so rich, I could easily imagine the locations and the paintings.The novel switches between the XVII century Netherlands, where Sara de Vos is the main character, and the late XX century and the beginning of the XXI century, where we encounter the Australian, Ellie Shipley, an austere woman, a talented painter, who becomes an art restorator, curator, and teacher. The travels between different eras are easy to follow, as each chapter starts with the year and location, so I was never confused as to where I was and whose story I was listening to.While the plot is interesting and well done, what I enjoyed the most about this novel were the superb characterisations, which captured so well the inner worlds of Sara de Vos, Ellie Shipley and some of other secondary characters. Yes, this is about art, but also about so much more: about creating art, about the art world, about the struggle between the creative and the every-day life, and not lastly, about the double standards when it comes to men and women.I can go on and on about this novel, but there are so many better s out there.I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful narrator of this audiobook, Edoardo Ballerini. My, what a talented narrator. His voice is splendid, his intonation and accent renditions are just wonderful.

Now, I'll be honest and admit that knowing it was written by Garcia Marquez influenced me. It's hard to say how much. The writing is phenomenal, it has a great flow, beautiful descriptions and great characterisations.The subject, well, that one was a bit disconcerting. I suspect Garcia Marquez intended it to be so.So our unreliable narrator is a ninety (90!) year old man, who's never been married, never been in love and only had sexual encounters with prostitutes. He lived a petty, ordinary, boring life. He's been nowhere, has no relatives or friends. On his ninetieth birthday, he gives himself the gift of a virgin girl. Because, why the hell not? Right? I told myself to get over it, it's Marquez, be open minded, Bianca etc. So, honestly, I really tried. I tried to believe that he could do all the things he was doing in the book, chasing a girl, being on a bike and many other things very unlikely for a ninety-year-old. I also managed not to visualise him getting naked next to a drugged up teenager. Grrrr... I sound so square and unsophisticated, but that's how I felt.I've read some s, some people saying that it's a quest for finding love, no matter how late in life. I so wish I saw that. All I saw was just an old, creepy man's carnal infatuation with somebody so young.Other than that, I liked the exploration of old age, although I've read better. So I think it's fair to conclude that my personal prejudices, views might have caused me not to gush over this little book. On the other hand, knowing that it was written by Garcia Marquez, may have caused me to be more lenient. This time, it's more difficult to gauge. So I'll give it 3 stars.

That must be a feat in itself, so I guess that's something.I've been aware of Alain How can a book be enlightening and, at the same time, irritating? That must be a feat in itself, so I guess that's something.I've been aware of Alain de Botton for years. I've watched most of his documentaries, TED talks, I even follow him on Twitter. So when I saw that there was a new book, a novel, I immediately requested it.This book is definitely different. It's penned as a fiction novel, but is it really? The fiction part, the story of Rabih and Kirsten, was more of a conduit for the author's thoughts on love, relationships, sex and marriage. And those thoughts, for the most part, were absolutely spot on. I've highlighted many of them. I sort of want my husband to read it, actually, I want everybody to read it. Because so many bits are enlightening. As even de Botton says ""the start receives such disproportionate attention because it isn't deemed to be just one phase among many; for the Romantic, it contains in a concentrated form everything significant about love as a whole. Which is why, in so many love stories, there is simply nothing else for the narrator to do with a couple after they have triumphed over a range of initial obstacles other than to consign them to an ill-defined contented future - or kill them off. What we typically call love is only the start of love."" You can't argue with that. Just look at the movies and most novels, especially the romance ones, the majority of them focus on the beginning of a relationship. I guess, in some ways we know it goes downhill from there. But that's the thing that I liked about this ""novel"". It explains why in a very matter-of-fact, logical way (I love logical anything). As the saying goes - familiarity breeds contempt. Learning to navigate that is not easy, as we all know. I liked the having children chapter, how children have no use and yet we love them so much, which teaches us about loving without expecting something back. ""A well-loved child is set a challenging precedent. In its very nature, parental love works to conceal the effort which went into generating it. It shields the recipient from the donor's complexity and sadness - and from an awareness of how many other interests, friends and concerns the parent has sacrificed in the name of love."" Of course, there's much more than that, as the kids grow up, and more challenges ensue. Look, most of it is relevant and pretty much spot on. It's just that it is so didactic, it was as if I was attending a lecture. Our hands are held throughout the novel, and at times, I wanted to yell: I get it, you don't have to explain everything to me! It felt as if I were in lab, hidden behind a one-way mirror, analysing, comparing, contrasting and taking notes. While I could relate with the protagonists in many ways, I didn't feel connected, if it makes any sense? I think the tone had something to do with it. Had it been just a book of essays, thoughts on love, marriage, sex, parenthood, relationships, it would have been much more satisfying. As I said in the beginning, despite irritating me at times, I think it's well worth reading and that everyone could take something out of it - be it useful, enlightening, compelling or just reassuring.I've received this book via NetGalley.

I can read them, occasionally, even enjoy them, but it’s not something I seek or buy for myself. I’ve been meaning to read The Dry for some time, mostly to see for myself if the hype was deserved. I was hooked from the very beginning. The writing is terrific, it’s atmospheric, the characters are fully formed, and the plot and the investigative procedures were credible, which is something I always pick on and complain about. And how about those transitions between the present time and the past? They were so well done!I’m a city girl, through and through, yet, the characters, the setting, the small-town mentalities and issues were familiar and I felt they were captured accurately. We are all aware, especially in Australia, about the many issues faced by farmers. We hear in the media about the escalation of suicide in the farming communities. And the horrendous thing that some men do: kill their family members and then themselves. It’s incomprehensible and it just shakes one to the core. Jane Harper managed, with subtlety and great skill, to show the impact such horrific crimes have on an entire community. Anyway, there are lots of s for this book, so I’ll keep mine short(er).The Dry is such a well-written mystery/suspense/thriller, it really belongs in the literary fiction category.NB: AUDIOBOOK – top notch.

When I saw that it was set in Western Australia, I had to request it.A kick-ass, no messing around police woman? Yes, please. Her name is Harriet (Harry) Blue, she's a sex crimes detective. Honestly, there aren't many things to be complimentary about, unless being a quick read counts as a compliment.There were quite a few things that made me arch my eyebrow and scratch my head, figuratively speaking, I can't really arch my eyebrow. ;-)The action takes place in the Western Australian outback, at a uranium mining site, where Sydney-based (thousands of miles away, different state - for those unfamiliar with the Australian geography) Blue is sent to investigate the death of a miner. Because why not send a sex crime detective, from another state, investigate a murder (*arching my brow). She's joined by Detective Whittaker from Perth. As it's the case with most thrillers, there is animosity between the two. Speaking of Whitaker, his characterization is just awful. He's got no personality what-so-ever, he's scared and the way he dresses is so out of the norm, especially with people working in the field, it left me puzzled. (I'll tell you a little secret: Australians, especially Western Australians don't have much of a dress sense - shorts and flip-flops (thongs in Australia) are the norm. Don't shoot me!) The little background story about him was cliche and unconvincing. Then there's the mine site, where apparently there are no supervisors, everything goes, there is an abundance of drugs and prostitutes. I just didn't buy how the gang of drug dealers got away with so much, including abducting a police officer. The mine sites in Australia are strictly regulated, the occupational health and safety are paramount (damn, I almost sound like someone who is keen on mining - which is the exact opposite - but I like to be fair), yet detective Harry Blue was able to just wander in the mine whenever she felt like it. Although she had a partner, who shared a room with her, somehow he was never around or detective Blue just had to do things by herself because she ""didn't trust him"". Alrighty ...There were many other things that didn't ring true. I would go into details, but that would make this  too spoiler-ish.We are obviously set up and manipulated. It's not subtle at all. I didn't believe many aspects of this novel, the characterizations were either cliche or unconvincing, the descriptions were dismal and the whole thing just felt unpolished and hurried. And hey, it's only #1 in the series ... Who's to blame? Mr Patterson or Ms Fox?

Really, publishers, enough is enough! So much for being creative (*insert sarcasm). Rant over. For now.Anyway, some of my Goodreads friends read it and raved about it, so I (reluctantly) put aside my annoyance with the title and made a request.This novel was a fascinating read. I got hooked from the very beginning. I'm known to complain about the first person narrative, but in this case, it was extremely well done.Our narrator is Evie, who in her later years reminisces about when she was fourteen. We have sort of two viewpoints, two voices, although they both belong to Evie. Grown-up Evie is very different to the fourteen-year-old Evie. And thank goodness for that.Evie is the only daughter of two middle-class people from Northern California, who recently divorced. Evie ends up living with her perpetually-reinventing herself mother, who's gone back to dating and is too preoccupied to pay much attention to her daughter. Evie is an average kind of teenager, not terribly brilliant, nor stupid, there just isn't anything exceptional about her. She's only got one girlfriend, Cassie. When things become cold between the two long-time friends, Evie finds herself bored and aimless, without much to fill up her summer vacation days.She stumbles across some different looking girls, barefoot and bin diving for food. Eventually, she meets their leader, Suzanne, whom Evie finds fascinating and intriguing. She's taken to the ""farm"" where she meets some other girls, Russell, their leader, a couple more guys and some children. Evie is so lonely and longing for company, touching and belonging, she wants to be part of the group. She ""wants to be seen"".For me, the best thing about this novel was Evie's observations. I've highlighted quite a few paragraphs. I can't remember when somebody was so spot on, so abruptly honest about what it is to be a teenage girl. I have nothing in common with Evie, so I didn't identify with her in that way. But she speaks some universal truths. “That was part of being a girl - you were resigned to whatever feedback you'd get. If you got mad, you were crazy, and if you didn't react, you were a bitch. The only thing you could do was smile from the corner they'd backed you into. Implicate yourself in the joke even if the joke was always on you.” Hmm, this hasn't changed that much.“I waited to be told what was good about me. [...] All that time I had spent readying myself, the articles that taught me life was really just a waiting room until someone noticed you- the boys had spent that time becoming themselves.”“Poor girls. The world fattens them on the promise of love. How badly they need it, and how little most of them will ever get.”“They didn’t have very far to fall—I knew just being a girl in the world handicapped your ability to believe yourself.” Honestly, these quotes and other similar ones made me go OMG, who's this writer? Then I read she's only twenty-six and I am impressed. I'm very relieved that the odious crimes, a la the Mansons, only make an appearance towards the end. I don't read ""real crime"" and avoid it as much as possible. Obviously, that case is too famous not to have heard about it. I know a few things, but not the nitty-gritty. This is a novel about the perils of teenage years, about how easy it is to go the wrong way, how everyone is desperate for love, connection, and affection, which leaves one vulnerable, but it's part of our genetic makeup. Also, it's about how girls/women colour between the lines and see things about boys/men that aren't really there.  ""... to think that boys were acting with a logic that we could someday understand. To believe that their actions had any meaning beyond thoughtless impulse. We were like conspiracy theorists, seeing portent and intention in every detail, wishing desperately that we mattered enough to be the object of planning and speculation. But they were just boys. Silly and young and straightforward. Emma Cline must know herself very well. I am in awe of her observations, her ability to voice some truths that are uncomfortable, unpopular, best kept unsaid. She articulated some things I had been thinking and feeling but never quite got them out or articulated, even to myself. The writing is superbly crafted, yet very accessible. Also, at 355 pages, the novel's length is just perfect.I'm not envying Emma Cline having to write a second novel, especially given the hype. Regardless, I am certainly looking forward to reading her next novel, short stories etc.4.5 stars, rounded to 5Cover: 5 stars, for both versions I've received this novel via Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

It was the case with Faithful as well.This was my second Alice Hoffman novel, the other one was The Marriage of Opposites, which I enjoyed a great deal. Faithful couldn't be more different.Some could call this young adult novel , it does have a young adult feel about it, but don't let that deduct from this novel's worth. One of my favourite novels in 2016 was a young adult novel (Words in Deep Blue by Cath Crowley). Shelby Richmond is nineteen and ridden with survivors guilt and deep depression. Her best friend, Helene, has been comatose for two years and she's never going to come out of it. You can feel Shelby's pain and agony and you can't help but symphatise and, of course, wonder how would you cope if that were to happen to you. Shelby is pretty much a robot, who barely eats, and lives in a drug-induced stupor. Shelby's pot supplier is a Ben, who used to go to the same college, but, unlike Shelby and Helene, he was never a member of the cool and popular clique. Ben is adrift and very shy, so Shelby just hangs out with him sometimes. Eventually, things progress to more. Some time later, the two of them move into a tiny New York apartment. Ben is kind and so supportive, yet Shelby doesn't feel the same about him, and she's not very nice to him.Following months of drifting about, Shelby gets a minimum wage job, shelving food in a pet shop. She also makes a friend at work. When she comes across mistreated dogs, she steals them and takes them to her tiny apartment. Life and living have a way of creeping in. Shelby is still unhappy and feels unworthy of anything good. She gets tired of Ben, whom she dumps a few years later. Her next choice of partner is unfortunate, but, fortunately, she realises she made a mistake. For some years, she lives alone. Sure, she's busy volunteering at a humane shelter and with her studies. She sees her only friend and her kids often enough. Yet, Shelby is acutely lonely. So lonely she takes to chatting to all the boys who deliver her food orders. I found this part heartbreaking. But then, Shelby's kind mother gets terminal cancer. Bring out the tissues. I may have sobbed. Just a little bit. There's no one to whom she's the most important person in the world. This simple sentence just about killed me. It probably encapsulates what we all want from life - to be the most important person to someone. Most of us were lucky enough to be that person to our mothers. Some of us are even luckier to be that person to someone else that we're not blood-related to. Yet, so many people can't state that about anyone. How sad is that?Through the years, since the accident, Shelby was getting cute cards with one word or a short message. I loved those. Shelby was looking forward to them as well. Eventually, Shelby finds her man. An unlikely partner. Shelby is not one to judge. Anyway, I've said too much. Alice Hoffman is one super skilled writer. I love her writing, her way with words. This novel is beautiful and you're very likely to be touched by it. Hoffman does a wonderful job conveying guilt, grief, loneliness. Faithful wasn't perfect, but it was so damn good and it made feel a lot. 4.5 starsHIGHLY RECOMMENDEDI've received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

Laqueur wrote Give Me Your Answer True, a sequel that managed to crush my “I hate sequels, different pov- same story novels”. Suanne succeeded what very few managed before: to surprise and delight me with, what I thought was unlikely, a better novel, which only improved and added more layers and nuances to The Man I Love. The third novel in the series, Here To Stay, was a thoroughly satisfying conclusion to one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever read! I am happy to notice that the circle of fans is getting larger and larger. I am unabashedly one of those fans, who is lovingly stalking her on Facebook, Twitter, and here on Goodreads. Besides being a terrific writer, Suanne is an incredibly interesting person, smart, witty but also nice. So, The Ones That Got Away, is, in many ways, Suanne indulging her many fans who wanted to know how The Man I Love came to be.It is fascinating to see how much the story has changed, including the names of the main characters. I am one of those people who are intrigued by the behind-the-scenes and I often wonder about processes, how one got the idea for this and that. Well, The Ones That Got Away, showed us the puppets’ strings. So I am very grateful and appreciative of being privy to all the background stories, deleted scenes, characters, plot arcs.

There's no macho, bull-shit jock type male character - and I dig that! I adored both Natasha - a Jamaican born, highschool student, and Daniel, first-generation American with Korean parents. The two young people couldn't be more different, both racially and personality wise. Natasha is a pragmatic and a bit of a cynic; Daniel is an incorrigible romantic, who wants to be a poet, but is interviewing to enter Yale to study medicine, to appease his parents.Random events line up to bring together Natasha and Daniel. Can two people fall in love in a few hours? Yes, they can and they will. I know ... I've been complaining over the years about insta-love, but that's because they were the badly written kind. In this case, I bought it all, even got some popcorn and a drink listening to see what happens next. The structure of the novel was very interesting, as we get little snippets into other secondary characters. There are also the obligatory alternating chapters with the two protagonists' viewpoints. The ending was surprising, haven't quite made up my mind whether I like it or not, but it doesn't affect my overall enjoyment of the novel and my appreciation for Yoon's writing skills.

I’m fascinated by our ability to suspend our disbelief for some stories but not for others. Even though I could see the puppet strings, I still enjoyed this novel very much. Even though there were things that I thought were a bit too cutesy, too convenient, and, at times, unlikely, I still got immersed into the story. The majority of the plot takes place in 1976 Lime Street Train Station in Liverpool, United Kingdom. I must confess that I am extremely fond of railway stations and trains, especially of those big, old-fashioned, European Railway Stations. I must also confess that even though this is set in England, all along I imagined the place looking like the movie set of HUGO and other similar movies. (I just image googled the place, and it looks pretty close to what I was imagining – go figure! :-) )Our unreliable narrator is sixteen year old, Martha Lost. She works at the Lost and Found Office in Lime Street Station. Well, her mother is the employee, but Martha does most of the work. According to Mother, she was found on a train from Paris and since nobody claimed her for 90 days, Mother claimed her as her own. Also, Mother raised her to believe that if she was to step outside, the Lime Street Station will perish. Poor Martha. She believes what she’s told. Despite her mother’s strictness, Martha makes lemonade out the lemons she was dealt: she loves to spin around; she loves putting on a French accent. Also, despite her Mother’s disapproval, she loves to read and reads everything and anything that lands in the Lost and Found Office, because “if a book’s been found, the least I can do is read it. Then it won’t feel lost any longer”.Mother is a religious nutcase who believes everything is the work of Satan. She's manipulative, cold and abusive.Luckily for Martha, her tormentor perishes. So Martha’s left to figure everything out. Martha longs to find out her real identity and her birth parents. She’s got help from her dear friend, Elisabeth, who minds the next door café, and who’s always been there for Martha. Other people come into Martha’s life. The lanky eighteen-year-old, George Harris, is also an orphan. There is also William, a homeless man whom both Elisabeth and Martha take under their protection. It turns out William is an orphan as well. The four become real close friends and help Martha on her journey of (self) discovery.Adventures take place as Martha steps outside her comfort zone. The story wouldn’t be complete without a villain, this time, an Aussie wannabe writer who’s trying to find the lost ashes of Mal Evans – a friend/roadie of the Beatles.I'll leave it to that, as I'm afraid I already gave away too much.Caroline Wallace is a very clever writer. I loved the way the story was written, the tone of the narration, the book and musical references, and even the Liverpudlian slang/colloquialisms.One could argue that the characters were a bit too black and white but just think of it as a fairy tale where the good wins. Let’s face it, we all need these stories now and again.Endearing, whimsy, with a touch of magic, ""The Finding of Martha Lost"" is a feel-good coming of age novel, well worth your time.

I didn't hate it either. It was readable but I became tired of the forty-two year old Ted obsessing and waxing lyrically about his dachshund, Lily. Lily is twelve years old and at the end of her life. She's got a tumour on her head - the Octopus. The majority of the novel is about Ted either reminiscing about Lily as a puppy, or talking about their mundane, tedious life or he's agonising over what to do about Lily's 'octopus'. There is conversation going on between Ted and Lily. And between Ted and the Octopus. I know I'm supposed to find it quirky and endearing; for whatever reasons, I didn't. Somewhere around the 75% mark, the novel takes a fantastical turn, and I had to go back to check if I'd skipped any pages because it discombobulated me.I probably sound heartless. I do love animals, and I did cry at the end of the book. But I usually cry when there's death.This is also a novel about loneliness and about being numb and purposeless.Look, it's not a bad novel, especially for a debut.

This is better than a 3-star.The Loner was a mixed bag for me. I'm not sure how to rate it. Teddy Wayne is a competent writer, there's no doubt about it. If he meant to create one of the most unlikable characters I've ever read, then kudos to him, he succeeded. Because, David Federman, eighteen-year-old Harvard freshman is a sociopath. He's sex-obsessed, like most young men. He wants to change his social status, from a loner to a more popular student. Nothing wrong with that. He's very articulate and his grasp of the English language is far above everyone else's. I like when authors use big words, I like to learn new words, yet for the most of the book I wondered ""who talks like this""? Do any eighteen-year-olds speak/think like that? Even the very smart ones? It felt like too much. I also had many ""yewww"" moments. Let's just say that one is best kept in the dark when it comes to a young man's thoughts and observations on sex, intercourse etc. If Wayne tried to make David unlikeable through this, well, he was brilliant.In saying all that, I'm glad I didn't abandon the novel and read it to the end. Because, around the 85%, it got really good. I can't tell you why, because I don't want to spoil it for you, should you decide to read it. I forgot to mention, that, throughout the novel, Wayne switches from the first to the second person narrative. David is an unreliable narrator, who's obsessed with Veronica, a very beautiful, privileged freshman. The second person narration reminds me of You by Caroline Hepnes, where another sociopathic guy is obsessed with a young woman. So in conclusion, I appreciated Teddy Wayne's writing skill. He managed to create a very unlikable character, who's beyond redemption. I was so irritated with him, not even his nerd status endeared him to me (I usually go for the underdog). Again, if that's what Wayne intended to do, he did it very well. Come to think of it, I'm so ... I don't know what I am with this novel - because David is so real, he could be or is like many others we've met or could meet, which is scary. None of the scenarios are far fetched, so that makes the whole thing even scarier.There is more to this novel than a freshman's obsession with a beautiful girl. The Harvard setting is a good background to talk about social status, the obsession with succeeding, at all cost. Sexism, feminism, elitism, sexuality, relationships are addressed as well, some in more depth than the others.I'm guessing this is going to be one of those novels you either love or hate. While I hated the character, as you should, there's no denying Teddy Wayne wrote a good novel. I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

It so wasn't - serves me right for not reading the blurb.'We're All Damaged'  reads like a women's fiction novel, but this time, it's written by a man and the main character is Andy Carter, a recently divorced thirty-one-year-old, who's kind of lost. Andy is from Omaha and is a kind man. Albeit he's kind of boring, without much charm or an interesting personality. As his maternal grandfather is close to dying, Andy returns to Omaha, where he has to deal with his newly reinvented, right-wing, radio personality mother, his recently retired accountant father and his brother and his family. Still in Omaha is Andy's ex, Karen, who now lives with the man she left him for. Luckily for Andy, he meets his total opposite, Daisy, beautiful, dark, tattooed Daisy, who's working on reinventing Andy.There are a few dramas and epiphanies. Will Andy manage to forget, forgive and just move on?I thought this novel was pleasant, although not mind-blowing. I do like nice guys as main heros. While I didn't hate Andy, I didn't care that much about him either. He was very beige. I do not like beige.

I loved this personal account, it made it all very relatable. Then we move into how we came to discover the gene. It was fascinating to move to different countries where several people were studying and discovering, in their own way, heredity. Some papers got lost or forgotten, to later be discovered. Some discoveries were accidental. Some of the pieces of the heredity puzzle were in the hands of different people. I've highlighted so many paragraphs. Lots!Of course, you can't discuss heredity and genes without mentioning Darwin. But while he was very important he wasn't the only one. Others, less known, at least to me, made tremendous contributions: Mendel for one. By the time we get to the discovery of the gene, we've gone through a lot of history. I won't deny that certain parts are easier to read and understand than others. Nevertheless, this is compelling, fascinating, extremely well-written non-fiction book. While it answers some/lot of questions, as we all know by now, a lot of questions have been raised and are being raised, mostly related to ethics. So in conclusion, this is a terrific non-fiction book, worth spending your time mulling over. I'm in awe of Mukherjee's writing talent as well. I've received this novel via NetGalley.

The first two novels' protagonists were young adults. ""Practically Imperfect"" is definitely not in the new adult romance category, as both protagonists are around thirty, have well-established careers, and there is no over-the-top drama and angst, which are so prevalent in the new adult genre - all pluses as far as I'm concerned.Gemma is a policewoman, who's got injured on the job and is having medical leave. Sam is a partner in an architecture firm. While Gemma can't find a guy who'd be OK with her job, Sam can't seem to stay in a relationship for too long, and he's at a loss as to why. They've known each other for a long time, as they lived next to each other during their childhood. But for whatever reason, they never got along. When Gemma's attacked in her parents' home, where she was convalescing, Sam inadvertently saves her. They end up hiding in Sam's house. As expected, feelings develop.Meanwhile, Gemma's work situation is getting stranger; reports are being modified and evidence is disappearing. The police mystery/drama/suspense (not sure how to categorise it) added an extra layer to the story. As for the love story, it's pretty straight forward, without too much conflict or build-up - if anything, and I can't believe I'm saying this since I often complain about the over-the-top drama and misunderstandings, the love story could have done with a bit more something in that department. But other than that, it felt very realistic and natural, like most normal, functional adults would/should have. So, I'll conclude by saying that this was a quick, enjoyable read, that would be the perfect on a rainy day (as it was the case for me), or on holidays.

This one sentence is, in some ways, the epitome of this novel.  I'll just come out and say it: Every Exquisite Thing is a fantastic young-adult novel. A fantastic novel. Period. This was my first Matthew Quick novel. It won’t be the last as I was impressed with his ability to develop and embody a teenage girl, a very complex one at that. Because who can understand them, right? Oh wait, I used to be one. True, I was lucky enough not to have too many existential dilemmas the way Nanette O'Hare, our main protagonist, does.  Somewhat spoilerishAnd poor Nanette, she struggles so much with finding her place in the world, and making decisions about her future is agonising, especially when she doesn't know what she wants to do. On paper, Nanette is the perfect teenager: she’s got loving parents, albeit they don’t really get her; she's the star of the soccer team, has good grades, doesn't drink, doesn't party and, unfortunately, doesn't really have any friends. Her favourite teacher gives her a book out of print, The Bugglegum Reaper, and she reads it compulsively again and again. This novel triggers unexpected emotions and thoughts in Nanette. She becomes friends with the elderly, reclusive author, Booker, who lives close by. The rule of friendships states that We Do Not Talk About The Book. Through Booker, Nanette meets Alex, a fellow fan of The Bubblegum Reaper. Alex is a poet, a non-conformist, and Nanette finds him fascinating. I loved this part of the novel because it reminded me of simpler times when you connected with someone via books, ideas, music.Things start unravelling for Nanette. She becomes really depressed. She sees a therapist. She tries for a little while to be like everyone else in high school: partying, wearing fashionable clothes and make-up, even getting a boyfriend. But it's all pretend. Matthew Quick has created very interesting characters, who are imperfect and very realistic. There is a lot packed in less than 300 pages. This novel resonated with me and I found it riveting, despite not having much in common with any of the characters. ""Every Exquisite Thing” is a novel that's both sad and optimistic, both inspirational and non-committal. I suspect different people will take out different things out this novel. Ultimately, what it came to light for me was that nobody has the answers, we all stumble through life, making mistakes, trying things, most of the time pretending to have the answers. But nobody really does. And that’s Ok. If you have teenagers, have them read it. I’m sure it will resonate with them on a different level. Regardless of age, Every Exquisite Thing  is well worth reading.I’ve received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

I'm very familiar with L.H. Cosway and Penny Reid's novels, as I read many/most of them.

I am happy to report I didn't roll my eyes once. The characters were well drawn and interesting. I may even start looking at rugby players differently, as in they're more than just muscled brutes. ;-) Generalising here, but, what can I say, I'm not into sportsmen. In saying all that, Union rugby (there's also rugby league - different, but very similar) is still one of the few games I still watch, especially when Australia plays New Zealand, South Africa or England (not at the same time :-) ).This book was a bit surprising in that the macho, 6'8"" rugby player wasn't very skilled in the sack. I don't remember ever reading this scenario where the guy wasn't beyond amazing when it came to the horizontal play. I guess we don't read romance books for their realistic portrayal of men and women, or relationships, or life in general.The writing is fluid and well paced, and there was no dialogue that made me cringe, so I didn't mind the first person, alternate POVs one bit. Good job, L.H. Cosway and Penny Reid. I couldn't tell who wrote what parts, so that means it was another successful, smooth collaboration.

True, I've been doing other stuff, and I seem to have gotten back my photography mojo, which had pretty much deserted me in the past year or so. Right, back to the subject at hand, 'Hester and Harriet'.First of all, I felt like such a dufus for assuming that Hester was a guy's name. Hester and Harriet are two widowed, retired sisters, living a quiet and comfortable life in a village in England. Their life is uneventful and has been like that for many years. All they've got is each other, as none of them had children. But all this coziness turns on its head when, on Christmas Day, they come across a very young foreign woman with a baby, hiding in a disused bus shelter. Upon realising she had nowhere to go, they take it upon themselves to offer to give them shelter in their home. As if they didn't have enough to deal with, their fifteen-year-old nephew, Ben, shows at their door seeking sanctuary from his overbearing, well-intentioned parents.And so, they were two, but now they are five. The sisters are puzzled by Daria. They come to discover that she's from Belarus, and they are ashamed that they don't know much about that country. But they have the best intentions where Daria and her adorable baby, Milo, are concerned. As for the nephew, grunty, pimply, attached-to-his-mobile phone Ben, they're not that keen on him, but they don't have the heart to renege on their sanctuary. Of course, things become more complicated. Some bad guys come into the picture. Is Daria who she says she is? Now the sisters embark on finding out if Daria told the truth, and how to help her stay in the UK. I'll leave it at that as I already said too much. You can think of the two sisters are Ms Marple x 2, but in more contemporary British setting.'Hester and Harriet' is a delightful novel. There were so many things that I liked about it. It was refreshing to have heroines who are past their prime. I love it when ordinary people become heroes through circumstance and/or through their actions. The writing is really good and has a great flow. It's detail oriented, but I didn't mind it. Also, the vocabulary used is elevated, nothing to be scared of, I needed to use the Dictionary a few times, but as I said it before, I enjoy learning so I appreciated the opportunity. I loved how both sisters were correcting Ben's grammar incessantly. I thought Hillary Spiers did a great job at presenting one of the issues Britain grapples with these days - immigration. One can have set ideas about what/how things are or should be but ""... how the sands shift once matters become personal. At a remove, there would be no doubt as to the correct course of action. Now, however, those certainties have been shaken by events, of greater significance, by their growing attachment to Daria and Milo.""I'll close my  by saying that 'Hester and Harriet' is a novel that accomplishes being fun yet serious, irreverent, sardonic yet touching, with a good dose of realism. The character development was absolutely fantastic.

This novel begAn Exaltation of Larks is Suanne’s Laqueur new, stand-alone novel, following the terrific Fish Series books, which I absolutely adored. This novel begins in Santiago de Chile, with the eleven years old Alejandro, who’s hiding in his parents’ closest and waits for many days for their return. It’s 1973 and Chile has undergone a coup’d’état. This chapter was awfully emotional. You can feel the tension, the apprehension and the agonizing wait. Luckily, via the American Embassy, Alejandro is able to make his way to his uncle, who lives in the United States of America, in the quaint town of Gueslisten. Here, he befriends Lark kids, Val and her brother, and finds a second home with the Larks. Eventually, Alejandro, now Alex, becomes one of the Larks. I loved the Larks. In another part of New York, the teenager Javier deSoto is shunned by his family for something that the Dominican community finds abhorrent. Javier has to find his way by himself. Survival kicks in. Given his extremely good looks, he becomes a high-class male escort. He gets to meet both Alex and Valerie Lark who were studying and working in New York. Many years later, Javier, now known as Javier Landes, becomes the legal guardian of his teenage nephew he never knew he had. When he moves to Gueslisten to look after him, he reacquaints himself with both Alex and Val, who are now married and the parents of a teenage daughter. Jav, Alex and Val make a formidable threesome, as they enjoy each other’s company, while their teenagers form a special bond. But life is never that easy. A secret threatens Val and Alex’s rock solid marriage. Also, Javier has certain feelings that, if divulged, could break the strong bond of their friendship. All this tension had me on the edge, (virtually) biting my nails. And the sexual tension … oh my … Is it hot in here? More like … caliente!!!! I'm trying not to say too much.So if you’re after a sweeping emotional, family saga, filled with passion and some tragedy, but also full of tenderness and lightheartedness, this novel will more than deliver. If you’ve read anything else by Laqueur, then I don’t need to tell you much more, except: enjoy the ride.I’ve received this novel from the author, in exchange for an honest .Cover: 5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2016","Mar 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29637128-an-exaltation-of-larks

Luckily, Out of the Ice was much more interesting than I expected it to be.I've learned a fair bit about the research stations and their operations. Also, I've learnt some things about the fauna. That was all absorbing. Ann Turner's views on the environment and the destruction caused by humans are apparent. That won her some brownie points. Brownie points were given for bringing to light the misogynism and double standards prevalent in the academic world. Why would the smart men be any different to the not-so-smart men, right? The writing is kind of uneven, swaying from beautiful descriptive language to information dumping. At times, I found the first person narration grating and, occasionally, a bit mechanical, which I guess matched the academic brain of our marine biologist narrator, Laura Alvarado.Also, there are some far-fetched scenarios and too convenient coincidences that I couldn't quite come to grips with. I would get into more details, but that would give away too much, and I don't want to spoil it for you.The last third of the novel picks up the pace a great deal, and lots of things happen, in my view, a bit too many. Laura Alvaro seems to not get much sleep throughout the novel, while in Antartica or when jetting around the world, from Antartica to the USA, then to Italy and back to Antartica. The ending is a bit too tidy and too happy-ever-after-ish, which I'm sure many will find very fulfilling. My cynical brain was a reluctant buyer. Nevertheless, I'm glad I read it, as it was engaging enough, I just wish I had been able to suspend my disbelief a little bit more than I did. 3.5 starsI've received this novel via Netgalley.

But things take time. Desperately lonely, she's taken under the wing by a rich couple, Ava and Swift Havilland - who are very charitable. Helen is so charmed by them, her entire life revolves around them, around what they say and think.

I loved everything about it. The characters are endearing, quirky, weird, but very interesting and complex. The main protagonist is Veblen Amundsen-Hovda, a thirty-year-old woman, temping as a secretary and also doing Norwegian translations in her free time. Veblen's hero is the unknown and forgotten thinker Thorstein Veblen. She lives modestly, within her means and is content. One day, she meets Paul Vreeland, a neurologist, about to patent an instrument for relieving pressure in the skull following a traumatic injury. Paul proposes to Veblen after only a few months of dating. In many respects, Veblen and Paul are opposites. He's the high achiever, determined, purposeful man, Veblen is a bit of dreamer, talks to squirrels, sees the best in everyone and doesn't have much of a plan. Both Veblen and Paul have  interesting families and have had unconventional upbringings. But while Paul is determined to succeed and is eager to acquire all the paraphernalia proof of one's""success"": a big house, expensive cars, boats etc, to be as far away from his off-the-grid family, Veblen resists all that as she's not interested in stuff.This book was so up my alley in so many ways, it was uncanny. I'm very interested in medicine, so I quite enjoyed reading about medical research and medical trials. I am sure that this aspect of the novel will put some people off. Another thing that I loved, but could annoy other readers, is all the talk about Thorstein Veblen. I am grateful to Elizabeth McKenzie for introducing me to the economist/thinker who came up with the expression ""conspicuous consumerism"" and who, amongst other things, criticised the capitalist model of making a profit for the sake of profit. I was flabbergasted that I had not heard of him and that we hadn't studied him at university (economics degree). I'll make sure to read more about him and his ideas.Elizabeth McKenzie's writing is masterful. Some people may have an issue with the extensive use of neologisms and medical, research, and military jargon. I was happy to have read it on kindle as all I had to do was tap and the dictionary came up. As I said before, I love it when authors teach me something new. This novel is the perfect candidate for a book club read, as there is so much to discuss and analyse. I can't speak for everyone, and I haven't read other s, but I think this will be a polarising novel, that you'll either love or find too cumbersome and/or too quirky.I'm in the ""I loved it"" camp.'The Portable Veblen' is a very ambitious novel, that looks at relationships between parents and kids, between lovers, between people and nature. It also has a good look at society, at what it means to be successful, and at consumerism (I personally would have liked more of that aspect addressed). There's also commentary about what it means to work for the big pharmaceutical corporations, which can be corrupt and heartless.I was so impressed with this novel, and obviously with its writer, I'll have to do some research to find out a bit more about Elizabeth McKenzie and her writing process.While this was not perfect, arguably nothing is, I will give it 5 stars for originality, quirkiness, and most importantly, for having the audacity to not dumb it down for the masses, while still remaining very readable.

I love novels where different characters's stories/lives intersect either serendipitously or on purpose. Antoine Laurain is very good at putting together such stories.In the ""French Rhapsody', Alain Massoulier, a general practitioner (doctor) receives a letter 33 years later. The letter could have changed his and his friends' destinies when they were in their early 20s and were trying to make it in the music world as the new wave, cold wave band the Holograms.So Alain is trying to get in touch with his former bandmates, to see if any of them still have the recording that could have propelled them to fame. While doing this, we come to meet many other characters. It's interesting to note how all of them had chosen different paths: an economist, a hotel owner, an extreme right wing nut-job politician, an art/antique dealer and a large-scale sculpture artist.Some of the characters were more interesting than others. I must confess I found it hard reading the extreme right-wing's character's incessant speech and hate monologues, so I kind of skimmed over that part. Another character that plays a big part in this novel is JBM, a very accomplished businessman. It's obvious that Antoine Laurain, like most people, is disillusioned with the state of the French politics and the career politicians who don't have much of a backbone. So he created JBM, who's too good to be true, short of a fantasy of what a good politician should be. As with all previous Antoine Laurain novels, nostalgia is present throughout this book. While this novel wasn't as charming and well put together as 'The Red Notebook' and 'The President's Hat', it was still a very enjoyable read. Looking forward to reading 'The Portrait', which comes out in July 2017.I've received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

Many thanks to the publishers, Gallic Books, for allowing me to read it.The President's Hat is about the French President, Francois Mitterand's hat. I've grown up hearing about him. He was the French president for a very long time (14 years!). The story takes place in 1986. Daniel Mercier finds himself in a brasserie, enjoying a quiet dinner by himself. At the table next to him sits Francois Mitterand and two other people. The President and his entourage leave, but Mitterand leaves his hat behind. Daniel decides to keep the hat as a souvenir.Unbeknownst to him, things start changing for the better. He gets a promotion at work. The unthinkable happens: he forgets the hat on the train.I will try not to give too much away. I will just say that the hat changes owners from Daniel Mercier to a young woman, Fanny Marquant, then to Pierre Aslan, a perfume maker, and to Bernard Lavalliere, an affluent Frenchman, part of the rich, conservative elite. The hat seems to influence and provoke changes in the lives of all those who have it in their possession. They know it's the hat. Besides Daniel Mercier, none of them knows of its provenance. I'll leave it at that.This is a short novel that reads like a fable. I especially enjoyed the 80s references. While I'm not French, I recognised many of them. Antoine Laurain's writing is deceptively simple, but it flows beautifully. Obviously, the translator (I couldn't find who it was) did a wonderful job translating it. I thought the story was very original and very well written and its conclusion was very satisfying. Antoine Laurain's writing and stories have a ""je ne sais quoi"" quality to them that really appeals to me. I read that this novel/novella was turned into a movie. I wouldn't mind watching it, especially since I'm a French movie fan.Très agréable!4.5 starsI've received this book via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

But I had t**spoiler alert** I promised myself not to read new adult novels anymore because I was getting more irritation than enjoyment out of them. But I had to read this one. If you read the book blurb, you’ll find out (almost) everything there is to know about this novel. I hadn’t read it before I started it, as I like to be surprised. It’s got the usual new adult threads:-	One or both protagonists had had bad things happen to them;-	They’re misunderstood, pariahs of sorts;-	Unexpected new hardships come in between the two lovers.-	But in the end, love prevails.What made this novel different, besides, the competent writing, was that the male protagonist, Evan, had some sort of paranormal abilities. Paranormal stuff is not exactly something that I believe in, or am interested in; I mostly avoid books that dwell on that. But rest assured the paranormal aspect doesn’t overwhelm. While I was happy about it, because it made the novel feel more contemporary, ironically, I thought that aspect of the novel was kind of half-baked. It’s fair to say that I enjoyed the first part of the novel much more than the second. There’s poetry and there’s the getting together of the protagonists, albeit it was kind of short lived. I did like that, unlike in most other new adult novels, Jo was the sexually experienced one and that Evan wasn’t.In the second part, I had problems reconciling the tough, take-no-crap Jo, with the Jo living with a druggie, who was abusing her. I didn’t buy the justifications for it either. Unfortunately, throughout the novel I had issues with different scenarios. From the inconsequential quibble - a town with 1341 population, had a high school with 311 students? Very unlikely. Other plot elements were much more important, but I didn’t quite buy them. For example, Evan gets beaten up on the school corridors, bullied consistently, yet nobody interferes – where were the teachers? Surely, even in the States, non-bullying measures/programs exist? The same thing happens in Evan’s adoptive parents’ house, where two of his brothers pick on him and get physical, but somehow his adoptive parents are completely oblivious? It just didn’t make sense. When the prom night’s huge scuffle happens on the driveway, where was the mum who, just moments before, had taken photos of the boys? Another thing I had a hard time believing was that Evan got five years jail for a first time offence, an accident that didn’t kill his brother. I know that the US legal system is very unbalanced, and many poor people get unfair sentences, but still, I felt that was undue. Then there is the prison escape – one year before he was due to be released (so not only was he given a somewhat long jail time, he couldn’t have early release on probation?) There wasn’t much detail about how the prison break happened, which was a little too convenient. Also, I couldn't help asking: if Evan could see Jo’s dire situation, why wait four years, why not escape earlier?A few other things were incredulous: being attacked in the motel room by the desk clerk looking to steal their money?!? The ending felt kind of rushed and tidied up too quickly and a bit too conveniently. I found it incredulous how towards the end of the novel, suddenly, everything became so easy for our protagonists, when before they couldn’t get a break. Do you want to disappear? Easy! $500 will buy you very legit looking identity papers. Reading fiction involves some sort of willing suspension of disbelief. In some cases, more willingness is needed. Because of all the above unbelievable scenarios, I had a hard time suspending my disbelief in order to connect with the characters, so much so, I felt completely detached and didn’t really feel their pain, nor their love for each other. So, I’m sorry to say, that while I appreciate the writing, this novel was a miss for me. I’ll put it down to “it’s not you, it’s me” kind of situation, which I guess can be argued about everything and anything.Cover: 4.5 stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 04, 2016","Mar 05, 2016","Mar 04, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28398690-how-to-save-a-life

I'm so taken with his writing style, but especially with his humanity, which transpires so clearly in each of his novels. Backman has an uncanny ability to connect different generations. What I like and appreciate the most is that he sees people past their prime. Britt-Marie Was Here is a good example of Backman's ability to build a story around a sixty-three-year-old woman, who isn't the most obviously interesting person. We first met her in My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She's Sorry and she was one of the most irritating characters, although very familiar, as I'm pretty sure we've all come across people like her.Britt-Marie has had enough of not being seen by her philandering husband of forty years. She has had enough of being taken for granted. So she packs her bags and leaves without a word.Britt-Marie wants to have a job, so she goes to the unemployment office. But you see, she hasn't had a job in forty years, and she doesn't have much of a formal education. The global economic crisis has struck everyone hard, so there aren't many jobs out there.The thing about Britt-Marie is that she's persistent. And so she ends up in Borg, as the caretaker of the soon to be closed recreation centre. Borg is a place Britt-Marie would have never passed through, let alone live in. It's run-down, depressing and not very clean. Britt-Marie does what she knows best - cleans. Again, and again, and again. Unbeknown to her, she befriends some of the teens playing soccer in the parking lot. Unexpectedly, she becomes their coach. But wait a minute! Britt-Marie despises soccer! But she does know how to look after people. And the kids need looking after. Slowly but surely, Britt-Marie meets everyone in Borg. She even befriends a rat, whom she feeds every evening at 6 pm, because that's what ""civilised people do, eat dinner at 6 pm"".Anyway, I do not want to give everything away. I strongly encourage you to read this novel. ""Britt-Marie Was Here"" is a novel about second chances, about finding meaning in life, about one's search for ""self-actualisation"". Everybody wants to be seen and needed and everybody has a story. Yet again, Backman is masterfully peeling the many layers that make a person. He sees the good in people, and, through his characters he addresses and dismantles many of our prejudices, misconceptions, and selfishness, while managing to make it quirky, funny and, at times, heartbreaking.I can't wait to read what he comes up with next....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,Jun 2016,"Jun 05, 2016","Mar 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27406704-britt-marie-was-here

It would have been a meah regardless of the author, but given that Tyler is a Pulitzer Prize winner, I expected more, much more.The only thing I wanted from this retelling of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" was that the main heroine, in our case, Kate Battista, were a feisty, spirited, opinionated woman. While Kate wasn't the demure, pretty, blonde, every-man's-fantasy kind of woman, she was far from being feisty or spirited. If anything she was kind of boring. Her only hobby was gardening. She's 29! She doesn't listen to music, doesn't read, doesn't go out, doesn't have any friends, but she does have a job that she doesn't really like - she's an education assistant to preschool kids. ""Vinegar Girl"" read like a chick lit novel; I'm sorry to say, it's like a bad, boring chick lit novel. There was no romance or chemistry, no sexual tension, the conflict between Kate and her Russian suitor, Pyotr, was minimal and she sure didn't put much of a fight when it came to getting married. The novel ends with a terrible epilogue! The writing is very simple and uninspired. So are the plot and the character development. Honestly, this was a very average novel.

It's got a Jason Bourne feel to it (I presume the books were pretty similar to the movies?), but there's nothing wrong with that. I liked it a lot and read every page, even the ones about vodka types (I don't drink it) and the very descriptive fight scenes. I wouldn't say it was groundbreaking original, but that's OK. What appealed to me the most was that our main hero, Evan Stoak, aka Nowhere Man, a highly trained killer, was using his considerate skills and resources to help innocent, helpless people. I'm a sucker for good guys/people. Sure, he seemed a bit robotic, but I guess a brainwashed, trained killer would be. A little bit of humour would have helped, but then, without knowing anyone in the field, I assume trained killers don't have any.I also liked the third person narrative. Gregg Hurwitz is a very competent writer, his writing style appealed to me and it fit this type of novel.  I was after something easy to read, but not stupid, and this one fit the bill.

The premise, and especially its delivery, are original. Eli and Charlie Sisters are hired killers, who travel from Oregon to California to kill someone. While travelling they have adventures all over the place, some involving killing people, others having the eye of a horse removed and many other little vignettes. Because the narrator is Eli Sisters, we get to see different shades of the men, who kill quite a few people, but don't appear to be complete cold-hearted killers. The writing is good. But from the get-go I had issues reconciling the way Eli and even his more brutish brother, Charlie, were speaking, they were too articulate, too knowledgeable and it didn't feel true for the era, especially for two simpletons. While being no expert in the language of the late XIX century, the language did sound too contemporary. But ultimately, I just got bored with the whole thing. I'm glad I've read it, but I didn't get much enjoyment out of it. Here's hoping that the Undermajordomo Minor will be more my thing.Cover:>: 5 stars. So clever!

Just making sure that the first one wasn't a fluke...""Six Years"" is more recent. But it's not too different to the previous and first Harlan Coben novel I read, Deal Breaker. The main character, Jake Fisher, is another very tall, handsome man, this time, a politics professor. He can't get over the love of his life, Natalie, who he had a three-month relationship with., during a writers' retreat, six years earlier. When he spots an obituary for the guy whom Natalie married, he is intrigued and attends the funeral. But interestingly enough, the widow is not Natalie.

Lots of names are thrown into the mix, former professors and students - nothing, better said, nobody is who you expected, thought they were.This novel is very fast paced, it only took me a few hours to finish it. Coben is a good writer, who knows how to keep you hooked. I like that he uses fancy words. I love that the main characters while hunky and handsome are also very intelligent, nice people who are quite principled. As with the previous novel, I love the self-deprecating comments and observations. To be honest, the suspense, who-done-it bits are my least favourite. It's the characters and the smart-ass comments that draw me in. I'll have to check if Harlan Coben wrote any other type of books. Cover: I don't like the covers for this genre of novels.

A very young work colleague was reading one of his books. I don't know about you, but when I see people reading a book, I must find out what book they're reading. Anyway, long story short, this young dude said that the only books he's read and will ever read are Harlan Coben's novels. I asked, what happens if the author dies? He said he'd stop reading. I kid you not! So, since I didn't think very highly of that dude, I thought Harlan Coben must be a crap writer. Yep, I'm judgemental like that. Mea culpa.Anyway, a lovely GR friend, (Hi Suzanne!) was raving about this author, so I thought I'd give it a try, hoping for a page-turner, that wasn't gory (I can't take extreme violence and/or gore). And I'll confess that I quite enjoyed this first novel in the Myron Bolitar series. Myron, despite his silly name, which, by the way, he hates himself, is drool worthy: handsome, tall, smart, educated, funny as hell and kind - perfect, as far as I'm concerned. The things I liked the most were his self-deprecating comments and his one liners. His sidekick, Win, is strange but intriguing. He's kind of violent and enjoys causing bodily harm. The suspense/thriller bits were well done and I couldn't find any obvious plot holes. The only thing that somewhat detracted from complete enjoyment was the fact that it felt a bit dated, but that's because I'm reading this 20 years too late. ;-)Anyway, now that the Harlan Coben cherry was popped, I'll be back for more. :-) Besides, I've got the whole series to finish. BTW, I couldn't help but think that this book/series would make for a great TV series. Does anyone know if it's been adapted into a TV series, or maybe a movie?

Regardless, I know what/when I enjoy read4.5 starsI rarely read books in this genre - suspense, thriller(?), so I don't have much to compare against. Regardless, I know what/when I enjoy reading something and this novel was a great read.All That Is Lost Between Us is more of a contemporary, psychological novel, where every member of the Turner family is thoroughly dissected. The Turners are a middle-class family, who have slowly been drifting apart. Not unlike in many other families, the mum, Anya, is the glue that holds them together, she's the nurturer, the worrier and the warrior, but lately she feels like she doesn't know her kids, Georgia, seventeen, and Zac, fourteen. As for her husband, Callum, she barely sees him anymore, as he's never home, having become a volunteer rescuer, on top of his day job.I loved how Sara Foster went about giving each and every character a voice, we really get to know them so well, as the novel is made up of chapters of each character's point of view. What I thought was quite different was the fact that Anya's point of view was written in the first person, whereas all the other member's of the family speak to us via the third person narrative. This novel is extremely realistic. What the Turners go through is relatable. The minutiae and busyness of life make it so easy for people to live together but actually live very separate lives. Anya's fears of losing connection with her kids and husband are palpable, it's hard not to empathise and worry alongside her.It's so much more difficult raising kids these days than it was a few decades before when there were no social networking, no mobile phones with cameras. We've all done silly things in our youth, but we got away with it, as it wasn't posted on the internet for perpetuity and for the whole wide world to see and comment on it. Sara Foster does a great job of showcasing some of the dangers of social networking. One unintended mistake can have dramatic consequences. I won't say much more, as I don't want to give away too much. If you have the opportunity, do read this as it's well written, compelling, realistic and relatable, and the suspense/thriller bits are also very well done.

I don't know why it took this long, as it was very readable and well written, despite feeling a bit slow in the middle.The novel takes place in England, 1976 and it's hot. Very, very hot.At the centre of the story are Grace and Tilly, ten year old, best friends, from the same neighbourhood. When Mrs Creasy disappears, the inquisitive Grace takes it upon herself to find her and while she's at it, she wants to find God, because he's supposed to protect and know where everyone is. So, together with her second in command, Tilly, they start visiting the houses and neighbours on the street. While they're searching for God, we get to know each of the neighbours and some of their secrets and motivations.I quite liked the astute observations that both Grace and Tilly were making. I dare say the chapters written from Grace's point of view were the best. It was interesting to discover the neighbours, although, it did take me a while to figure it out who was who.Most of the people on the street dislike one of the neighbours because he looks different and has longer hair and likes to take photos of kids. The mob mentality is at its ""best"".While the novel dragged at times, I still read it all, as I wanted to find out what happened. Cannon is a very good writer who came up with an original novel structure which mixed Grace's point of view via the first person narrative and chapters where each neighbour's house and its inhabitants are introduced via the third person narrative. There are also chapters that go back in time, when certain crucial events took place in the lives of those on the street.In conclusion, The Trouble with Goats and Sheep is an impressive debut novel and Joanna Cannon is a very promising writer. I look forward to reading her second novel.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

I consider myself a staunch feminist, so I am perplexed by my apathy, especially given how easily I get fired up. Yes, this novel was brutal, horrific things happen to these ten young women, who are clueless as to why they're imprisoned on a secluded, derelict property somewhere in the Australian desert/bush.Besides the fact that I never cared for any characters, there were way too many questions left unanswered, and  I do not like that! Maybe if the novel were set in a completely dystopian time, I would have had fewer issues with this book. But with the exception of the lawlessness of the women being imprisoned and their mistreatment, everything else was contemporary and known to me - therefore it was more difficult to suspend my disbelief and just go with it. In some ways, this book reminded me of A Little Life, which was filled with torture and misery. Of course, this was nowhere near as gratuitously sadistic, but because of the many questions left unanswered, I couldn't help but think that Wood tried to dazzle us with some shocking imagery without putting together a cohesive, credible story.This novel goes towards Aussie Author Challenge on Booklover Book Review. http://bookloverbooks.com/readi... ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Aug 14, 2017","Aug 15, 2017","Feb 03, 2016",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/35679467-the-natural-way-of-things

I don't like grim and I have a very low thresh-hold for descriptive crimes and gore. Luckily, there wasn't that much of it, most of it towards the end. Moore is a good writer, there were some beautiful descriptive passages. The MO of this type of novels is fully employed, it builds and builds and we are taken on side roads and diverted from the obvious. There are secrets. And a few convenient events. But nothing too over-the-top.So, for what it's worth, while I didn't love this (I can't remember ever loving a thriller), this was pretty good. I liked the set-up, the descriptions and the psychological aspects. I also enjoyed the scientific tidbits. I've received this via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

This is very apparent in ""Look at Me"".The narrator is Elizabeth, a struggling actress, almost thirty yearThere's no such thing as ""a perfect family"". This is very apparent in ""Look at Me"".The narrator is Elizabeth, a struggling actress, almost thirty years old, still living at home with her former hippy - now kind-of-burgeois father, Julian, and her reiki practicing brother, Ig.There's a new person taking residence in their big London house - Eunice, a daughter of Julian's from a short-lived, extra-marital relationship. Eunice is twenty-three and has been longing all her life to find her real parents. Now that she's found her father and half-siblings, she's become very clingy. Elizabeth is quite reticent and wonders what her motives are, but she's too nice to say or do anything about it. Elizabeth is lost. She still grieves her mum, three years after her untimely passing.Slowly but surely, Eunice insinuates herself into their lives, cleaning and cooking for them. She loves the house, the life-style, the restaurants and the parties. She probably tries too hard to fit in, to be accepted still feeling like an outsider. There isn't that much happening in this novel. Look at Me is a character driven novel. The main characters and some of the secondary ones are well fleshed out, although I didn't quite connect or feel much for them. The writing was relatively simple, not overly descriptive. Look at Me is a good debut novel about grief, relationships, belonging and feeling accepted. 3.5 stars I've received this novel via NetGalley.

While waiting for his brother and his wife to arrive, Paul, our narrator, makes all sort of interesting observations about the restaurant, about his wife and especially about his brother whom he seems to resent greatly. The most unsettling thing, for me anyway, was that these characters were upper middle-class people, who in theory, should be better than what they were.

The Grass is Greener was a total page-turner, I finished it in two seatings.The main characters, Bronwyn and Claudia, are best friends who find themselves stuck in unwanted situations: Bronwyn is an unhappy lawyer, who's following in her parents' footsteps, despite not being that keen on practicing law. Claudia, on the other hand, would love to be doing exactly what her best friend was, instead she had spent the last two years helping her family's failing Yallingup winery.But the situation will change, as Bronwyn decides she'll take Claudia's place at her family's winery while she arranges for Claudia to be interviewed for a position at her uncle's Perth law firm.

I enjoyed the fact that both friends get similar ""air time"" and that their stories are so different but eventually they intertwine. Loretta Hill's writing is quite simple, without any flourishes.

I've heard of her, but somehow I associated her name with historical fiction, not a particular favourite of mine (anything that's earlier than late 19th century, anyway). ""Miller's Valley"" is a character-driven novel, which managed to suck me into the story of Mimi Miller and her family, who've lived in Miller's Valley for generations. Mimi is the narrator of the story. In many ways, this is her life's story, starting from when she was around ten years old, in the 1950s.I loved the simple writing and tone of this novel. It felt very authentic and real. Miller's Valley is an unaffected and unassuming novel about coming of age, rural life, and most importantly, about families. While I love big words and literary craftsmanship, lately, I've come to admire and appreciate stories that are not overwritten.Anna Quindlen's ""Miller's Valley"" manages to draw us in and keep us interested without the big, fancy words and metaphors, and I really dig that.I've received this novel via NetGalley.

There's an increasing number of women joining the ranks. I'm all for equality, but not when it comes to this.This novel showcases how easy it is to become an alcoholic in the modern world, where drinking and getting drunk are seen as cool. I thought Prowse showcased very well Romilly's struggles with alcoholism and how that affected her life and of those who love her. At times I found myself being judgemental and asking Romilly why the hell wasn't she giving alcohol up, I guess a typical reaction of someone who never struggled with addiction. But I realise/know that we're all different, and some people are more prone to vice, addiction than others. And it's possible to be perfectly adjusted, functional, determined in many aspects of your life, but you could still have something that could be your Achilles' heel.""Another Love"" is a well written cautionary tale.

The blurb of the book is very comprehensive, so I won't go over it myself.I will just write down a few opinions/impressions.From the beginning, I was impressed with the beautiful, descriptive language. Nadzam is an incredibly talented writer, with an uncanny ability to make you feel, see, smell a place. Lions is, without a doubt, the main protagonist of this novel. Most people are deserting the place. A place where nothing grows. A place too bright, too dry, too empty. The few people still left in town seem to be under a spell. Speaking of spells, there are some mystical, mysterious elements and characters in this novel, but they weren't developed enough and didn't go anywhere, so I felt a bit let down.At some point, towards the middle, I sort of lost interest. It picks up towards the end, but still, there were quite a few loose ends that made me wonder if I'd skipped any pages. I hadn't.So while I wasn't totally satisfied with this novel, I am very glad I came across Bonnie Nadzam's writing. I will definitely look up her previous novel, Lamb.3.5 - 4 stars.

I hadn't read the blurb, so I was completely taken by surprise.The main characters are four women: Susan Frobisher, middle class sixty year-old, stay at home wife; her best friend, Julie, who's lead an adventurous life, but who now barely scrapes by, working as an aide in a nursing home where she meets another one of the protagonists, Ethel, overweight, wheel-chair bound eighty-something year old lady. Another one of the characters is Jill, a Christian woman, who's very worried about her grandson who suffers from a debilitating life-threatening condition.When Susan's husband dies unexpectedly, she's left with a multitude of debts and is about to lose her home. So Susan and Julie decide that they've got nothing to lose, so they might as well rob the local bank.They meet an old friend of Julie's who had robbed banks. Then they co-opt Jill and Ethel to help with the job.As you can imagine, things don't go quite so smoothly. This novel reads like a movie script. It's packed with action and situational humour. The characters are all different and compliment each other very well. I personally thought it was very refreshing and wonderful to read about women who are past their prime and who are so bold and adventurous. There's nothing like desperation to push people to do things out of character.The humour is mostly provided by a very stupid, yet very determined, sergeant, who gets himself into all sort of troubles - think Inspector Clouseau from the Pink Panther and The Genderme' seies with Louis de Funes - but in this case, the policeman is British. So in conclusion, this was a very enjoyable, competently written novel - perfectly suited for being made into a movie. Think ""The Italian Job"" with a splash of ""The Pink Panther"", but better, as the main characters are women in their sixties, with nothing to lose.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

I didn't come to it expecting a literary masterpiece, I was just expecting a light, entertaining chick-lit novel that will make time pass quickly. While the plot wasn't terrible, the first half of the novel was extremely drawn out. And I blame that on the writing. There was a lot of dialogue; much of it was redundant and absurd. I can't believe I'm saying this, but there was so much effusiveness, it drove me nuts. Morrissey does a lot of- too much- telling and not enough showing. Honestly, the writing is bad.

SThe Waiting Room is a small novel that feels like a big book, as it grips you and never lets you go.Dina is a 8 month-pregnant general practitioner. She's an Australian Jewish, a ""galutnik"", who lives in Haifa with her Israel-born husband, Eitan, and their son, Shimo. She's on the edge, as she's coping with the last month of pregnancy, her home duties, her job, and the ghost of her mother always present.Most of the story takes place in one day, more like one morning, in May 2001 in Haifa. The authorities are issuing constant warnings about an imminent terrorist attack. This makes Dina even more apprehensive, while her husband is very blase about it. Dina is feeling suffocated and anxious. She is having doubts and concerns about living in Israel and her marriage is on rocky ground. But what is she to do? So many things pull her in different directions. She's unable to decide. Besides, she's about to have another baby. What was she thinking? The inescapable feeling of doom doesn't leave Dina. Having grown up with her parents' Holocaust stories, Dina feels like she can't listen to one more sad story. She just can't! One gets the sense that pretty much every adult in Israel has a tragic, sad story.I couldn't help wonder why would anyone choose to live in the melting pot that Israel is if given other (better) options?Leah Leminksy is a very talented writer, who interweaves Dina's present with her mum's past stories and also with other people's experiences. The writing is exquisite and very polished. There are a lot of Idish and Arabic words, some would probably be put off by that, I personally thought it gave the story a more authentic feel, not to mention I enjoy languages. I hope I'll remember at least a few of the more common words.The Waiting Room is intimate, raw, heartbreaking and very realistic.Highly recommended.I've received this novel via NetGalley in exchange for an honest .

A fifty-something mother of one very smart girl, Bee, married to an engineer, who works long hours for Microsoft. Bernadette and her family live in Seattle, atop a hill, in a decrepit, old house. Bernadette is high strung, somewhat agoraphobic, and highly critical. Bernadette's interactions with other humans are minimal, most of those relating to her daughter attending a private school. Bernadette detests the parents or the gnats as she calls them. She also detests Seatle with its multitude of five-way intersections and has an unreasonable dislike of the Canadians. Bernadette avoids doing a lot of things, so she hires a virtual assistant from India, someone whom she never met, but somehow Bernadette has no qualms about confiding into a complete stranger, whom she also provides with all her family's personal details, bank accounts, passports etc. Another thing that made me dislike Bernadette a little bit more was the fact that she was paying the assistant only $0.75/hour, when they were able and willing to pay $45,000/annum for Bee's tuition fees.Early on we understand that something bad happened and that triggered her withdrawal from society. So I tried to be more understanding, tried to keep an open mind and not hold it against her the fact that she was privileged, that she was sending her daughter to a private school, that she was so self-involved.Once I found out what had actually happened, I was less sympathetic, albeit not completely against Bernadette.For me, the novel's strength and, strangely enough, its weaknesses, lie in its very original way of conveying the entire story via emails, letters, fax messages, a police report and few other ways. Initially, I was awestruck by the alternating points of view, by the fast rhythm and I thought it was quite quirky. But once my virtual reading glasses defogged, I became disgruntled about a few things that I thought were far-fetched and unrealistic. First of all, nobody writes those long emails or even letters.Kudos to Maria Semple for conveying the narrative in such a modern, original way, although she didn't quite pull it off.Generally speaking, it was an interesting, fast-paced novel, which I didn't find as funny as others did, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't or that I regret reading it. 3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jan 03, 2016","Jan 05, 2016","Jan 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13526165-where-d-you-go-bernadette

Also, this novel has been praised so much, that I dreaded being disappointed. My reading year has been underwhelming, quantitatively and especially qualitatively speaking, so in my desperation, I reached for this novel, hoping that I will finally read a 5-star novel. I get now what people are saying. The writing was sublime and quite affecting.First of all, kudos to Williams for daring to write a book about such an unassuming character with such a small life. Stoner gets the award for the most passive character I have ever come across in literature. Honestly, I wanted to shake him up and tell him ""just do, say something, you wimp!"". I mean the guy had no sense of preservation, no fight in him. Isn't it incredible how someone who knew the big words and could analyse the hell out of literary works was incapable of carrying on normal conversations to get to know others? And how little self-knowledge he had. Stoner the stoic. Why didn't Stoner get the full 5 stars? Because of Edith, the wife. I didn't get what was going on. I wondered if maybe she was bipolar, but why did she loathe him so much? I felt something was missing from the puzzle, things weren't quite adding up, even though I know and accept that people's actions and reasons for doing things are not logical most of the time.Other than that, this novel was on another level.

Lucy BartonI'm having a good run lately, as this is another 5-star read.My Name Is Lucy Barton is an incredibly well written, character driven novel. Lucy Barton ""came from nothing"". She grew up in Amgash (grr, the name alone!), Illinois. The family was poor. So poor the five of them lived for many years in an uncle's garage. They never went anywhere, they never did anything. They had no TV. Their hygiene wasn't the best, so the Barton kids got picked on at school.In order to escape the cold of the garage, Lucy stayed behind at school and finished all her homework and also read whatever books were around. All that studying helped Lucy get a college scholarship, paid in full. So, she was the one that got away. Her dreams were coming true.Lucy got married young and promptly had two girls. Life was plotting along. In the 1980s, Lucy got sick and spent many weeks in the hospital. Lucy's worries over her daughters and general anxiety were raw. We never find out what was wrong with Lucy, but it doesn't really matter.While in the hospital, unexpectedly, Lucy gets a visit from her mum, who had never flown before. Things had always been awkward and tense between the two of them. Lucy realises she doesn't really know her mum at all. She wonders: do we ever know our parents? Should parents burden their kids with stories of their past? But one thing is certain, parents should make sure their kids know they're loved, and Lucy's parents never told any of them they were loved. Lucy has it in her to become a writer. And she eventually becomes one. We don't get the feeling that, although her debut novel is received very well, Lucy is ecstatic or particularly happy. I got the feeling that Lucy was never able to feel those feelings. Many women will understand Lucy's feelings of heartache when her daughters leave for college. And the disappointment and heartbreak of them taking their father's side following their divorce. But Lucy doesn't hate them for that. It is what it is. While reading this short novel, do we get to really know who Lucy Barton is? Yes and no. While reading this, I felt like I knew Lucy, like I was having an intimate conversation with her.Lucy Barton could be any of us. Lucy Barton is me. And you. My Name Is Lucy Barton is a compelling, touching, introspective, contemplative, simple and very realistic novel - one that will make you contemplate your own life, your upbringing, your parents, your friendships, your loves and your relationship with your kids.I'll make sure to look up more of Elizabeth Strout's novels because I really connected with her writing and characters.

It's like the author had all these ideas and decided to fit them all in one novel.We have art, lots, and lots of art -which I love. I also enjoy learning about painters; I enjoy history and art history; I enjoy learning new words and jargon. While all these aspects were plentiful, at times, it became too much. I can't believe I'm saying this, but there was way too much information dumping, so much so, at times, it reminded me of school, when I pored over the text books. Food, and the pursuit of perfection and authenticity, play also a prominent part in this novel. Initially, I enjoyed this part. But then, it became too much. Who eats twenty courses? Apparently one of the French kings and a few other kings. I got bored with the food and food preparation bits as well.There are also some secrets, and Nazis and Jews. Also, there is a love story. There are way too many characters in this novel. In the beginning, we learn about some sheik and his wife, some Russian oligarchs, some very rich and very snobbish Brits, socialites, art dealers, and academics. Also, one of the main characters is Annie, a thirty-one-year-old single woman, who finds herself penniless and alone, in a tiny apartment in London. She works as a cook for a film director, but she doesn't get to cook often. Other prominent characters are Rebecca Winkleman, the daughter of Memling Winkleman, very rich, well-respected art dealers and owners of a prestigious gallery. There are so many story lines in this novel, so many threads and subthreads, I'll have to write a much longer , and honestly, it's late, and I'm tired, and I don't feel like wasting another hour writing this .So, I'm going to try to summarise.The novel is not bad. It has merit and is quite interesting. It is very readable, albeit there are a lot of foreign words (which I love), art jargon (I hope I'll remember the meaning of some of it) and some rare words (thank goodness for Kindle dictionary).I did feel like the author was trying too hard to impress us (I read that she's heavily involved in the art world, so probably that's her vernacular).There were way too many characters, who were given too much air-time, they should have been dropped or just mentioned briefly, as they didn't add much to the story. I get that the author was trying to paint a broad canvas of the characters and the type of people who get involved or play a role in the art world. I totally get it. That's where an editor becomes very useful. My personal opinion is that the editor(s) failed this novel. It could have easily been a 4-5 star novel, but as it stands, I'm only giving it 3-3.5 stars. It's the novel that had lots of the things that I love, yet, it failed to impress me.Cover: 1 star. This has got to be one of the ugliest, most boring and uninspired covers I've seen in recent times. Honestly, I could have requested it on Netgalley, but I saw the cover and immediately dismissed it. Yes, I'm that shallow, I judge books by their covers. I find it ironic that this novel is mostly about art and its beauty, and how it affects us, and yet the cover is so damn ugly. I see there are a couple different covers. Amen!

One of them was with Ben, a nice guy who was just right for Brook, except that she broke up with him.Unexpectedly, Brook finds herself between a rock and a hard place emotionally wise, when Michael returns to town and makes amends and also with Ben wanting to rekindle their relationship.What's Brook to do?As far as women's fictions goes, this wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional either. I had no idea it was part of a series, but it doesn't matter as it can be read as a stand alone. The novel is a quick read, but I just didn't feel anything nor cared a great deal about anyone.

From the very beginning, I was taken with the beautifully descriptive language. Antti Tuomainen is a fantastic writer. Obviously, the translator did a great job, too. The novel is narrated by our main character, Aleksi Kivi, now thirty-three years old. His mum's disappearance, presumed killed, has defined his past twenty years of life. He's become obsessed with finding what had happened to her. He's suspecting the millionaire, Henrik Saarinen, as the one who's taken his mum from him. So when the opportunity presents, he takes a job as a caretaker on a big, secluded estate owned by Saarinen.Aleksi becomes involved with Saarinen's daughter, Amanda, who's strikingly beautiful but seems out of sorts. This novel is in many ways a classic mystery/thriller novel. I personally loved the descriptive language, it made for an atmospheric novel, which had a distinctly Scandinavian feel to it. While I haven't read Stieg Larsson's novels, I did see three of the movies. The Swedish ones. In many ways, this novel seemed similar, as far as the secrets and twists, but without the torture, rape etc.At about 240 pages, this is a relatively short novel, but it felt just right. Dark As My Heart is a classic mystery/thriller novel with a distinctive Scandinavian feel to it, perfectly suited for a movie adaptation.Highly recommended.4.5 starsI've received this novel via Netgalley.

I almost didn't pick it up, because I saw the 2.96 rating (sorry, but what the...?) and thought it must be horrible.Well, I'm glad I gave it a try, because it was pretty good. The Invaders is a character driven novel. Our main protagonist and narrator is fourty-four year-old Cheryl, who sees her marriage disintegrating and is at a loss on what to do. She's spent ten years with her much older husband, and their relationship has slowly become glacial. Despite being a part of the community for over ten years, Cheryl still feels like an outsider and she knows she's never been fully accepted. When her step son, Teddy, returns home, after being kicked out of college, things start unravelling even more.While this novel wasn't perfect (I didn't get why Teddy was the other narrator in this novel), I found Cheryl's observations and ruminations quite captivating and some of them relatable. There are no likeable characters in this novel. The women are dissatisfied and work hard to stay desirable to the men, whereas the men, work long hours and have affairs with younger women.The Invaders takes a good look at relationships, marriage, at the people living in those perfect beach communities and their ""perfect"" lives. Despite the affluence, nobody seems to be happy. Everybody is pretending. And aren't the afluent, white people entitled assholes or what?

Running Against the Tide is a women's fiction novel with some suspense/thriller thrown in. The last part was unexpected. The main character of the novel is Erin Travers who's moved to Eyre Peninsula, South Australia to start a new life with her two sons: Ryan, a sulky, quiet fifteen-year-old, and Mike, a handsome and confident nineteen-year-old.They can only afford to rent a run-down, mouldy house in an oyster farming community. While Mike deals with the changes in a seamless manner, his brother Ryan doesn't have it that easy, having to attend a new high school, where nobody likes him. Their mum has to adapt to a new life as well, which she doesn't find particularly easy.Little by little things start falling into place. But a few things are unsettling Erin. She's being followed. Her art shed is burned down. Then, at the end, an unexpected call makes Erin drive to Adelaide to see her very sick mum. Things unravel. Finally, Erin knows who was following her. But it could be a little too late. I'll leave it at that, as I don't want to give away too much.I quite liked the description of the Eyre Peninsula, and I feel like I learnt a lot about oyster farming. The characters were well flushed out and credible.I wasn't that keen on the mystery/suspense part, although it wasn't terrible. In my view, it was a bit rushed and dealt with too quickly, but it doesn't matter that much, as it was my least favourite thing about this novel.Ultimately Running Against The Tide was a novel about starting over, about family, small communities and about belonging.3.5 starsCover: 4.5. stars...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 27, 2016","Jan 27, 2016","Dec 15, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26875064-running-against-the-tide

And what a happy accident that was, as I was instantly enthralled and kept reading through the night. Erik Friskare is, without a doubt, my favourite male character of all times. Incredibly enough, her parallel novel, Give Me Your Answer True, was even better. The first 4-5 months of the year were spent reading mostly women’s fiction and romance – or in other words – guilty pleasures, not that I feel guilty.In May, I joined NetGalley and I mostly requested books pertaining to the literary and women’s fiction genres. I’m so grateful to the publishers on NetGalley for allowing me to read books before they are published. Some of them were superb.So, my outstanding books of the year were:-	The Man I Love, Give Me Your Answer True and Here to Stay, all three by Suanne Laqueur - I was consumed by the writing and especially by the extraordinary love story. CONSUMED!-	My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman - how I loved these books. I got My Grandmother... via Netgalley, but loved it so much I immediately purchased it in paperback. - The Blue Guitar by John Banville - the writing absolutely blew my mind. I know it may be presumptuous and rushed, but I have the feeling that John Banville and I will have a very passionate (reading) relationship. I plan to read more of his novels in 2016.- In the Quiet by Eliza Henry-Jones was so elegant and tender, it absolutely broke my heart.- Dear Mr. You by Mary-Louise Parker was utterly surprising and original. Not quite a memoir, but not fictional either, it was a delight to read.- The Life and Death of Sophie Stark - extraordinary, original and it stays with you for a while.High praises also go to Days of Awe by Lauren Fox, Whispers Through A Megaphone by Rachel Elliott, Duet for Three Hands by Tess Thompson, True Vines by Diana Strinati Baur. All these novels were received via NetGalley and all of them 5 star reads. This was also the year I discovered Rainbow Rowell’s novels. I quite like her writing style and the fact that her characters are quite ordinary yet extraordinary. I've read all of her novels, although I struggled getting into her latest (to be expected, since it is a fantasy novel).The biggest disappointment of the year was A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. I had such high expectations from this novel. It sounded like a book I would love. Everybody praised it. I barely shed any tears, and given the amount of tragedy piled on poor Jude, I should have been gutted. But hey, you win some, you lose some. I haven't ventured much outside my comfort reading zone. I did read an amazing fantasy novel by Catherynne Valente, a stupendous writer, who I so wish wrote contemporary novels. I've read so much in the past two years, and yet when I look at my To-be-read list, I feel discouraged. I haven't read any classics this year :-( Next year I'm hoping to read at least one Dostoevsky, Orwell, hopefully re-read some Maupassant and a few others that I've been meaning to read for years. And then there's the plethora of books received via Netgalley that I need to read and . I wish I did audiobooks. I'll have another go next year, who knows.

WOW!What a bloody original, simple yet complex novel! It was so unexpectedly good, actually, Great! I’m just blown away by it.I’ll have to do some digging, because I’m very interested in finding out more about the creative process and inspiration behind “The Life and Death of Sophie Stark”.I’m even more annoyed than usual with my limited writing skills, but I’ll do my best to articulate what I felt about this novel. It would probably be best if I let it sink in a little longer, but knowing me, if I don’t get on with it, I’ll just forget about it, or post-pone it to eternity.“When Sophie first saw me, I was onstage”.Simple introduction. But wait. It’s told in the first person by another character who’s not the presumed central character of the novel. Puzzling… I was instantly intrigued. As we read on, through Allison Mieskowski we find out about Sophie Stark. The two of them met in a bar, where Allison told a story. That story will be turned into a movie - ""Marianne"". Allison and Sophie embark on a creative relationship, which quickly turns into a love/sexual relationship.Sophie is like no one Allison has ever met. Sophie’s mystifying. She’s small, quiet and unassuming. She’s also blunt and dominant.With each chapter, through different characters’ perspectives, we get to know more and more about Sophie: Robbie is her brother; Jacob is just a guy in a band whose musical video she directed and who’ll become her husband; Daniel is Sophie’s first college crush and the subject of her first movie/documentary; George is a movie producer. As if closing the circle, the story, the novel’s first and last chapters are Allison’s musings. Anna North is a very skilled writer. With each chapter we discover more about Sophie, but we also learn so much about each narrator. I thought that was exceptionally clever.So what about Sophie Stark? Who is she?She’s mysterious. She’s straightforward. She’s unfeeling. She’s shy. She’s direct. She’s a genius. She’s a robot. She’s gay. She’s straight. She’s distant. She’s obsessive. She’s a recluse. She’s manipulative. She’s relaxed. She’s tense. She cares. She doesn’t care. She’s unique. Etc.Is Sophie a sociopath? Was Sophie on the Autism Spectrum Disorder? Some of her traits, such as her tone of voice, and arguably, her inability to relate, fit the profile. Does it matter? So many questions… so many things to ponder.Some of those questions refer to art, artistic expression and even critique.When asked what it felt like to have people talk about your movies, this is what Sophie replied: “It’s like having everybody mispronounce your name, every day. And at first you try to correct them, but they keep fucking it up, and then you start to wonder if maybe you’re the one who’s wrong and that really is how to pronounce your name. And after a while you start to wonder if you even have a name. Are you even a person? Do you even exist? Who fucking knows?”One could psychoanalyse the crap out of this novel. There is so much to take out from it, so much to interpret, which, in my opinion, makes this a brilliant novel. I’m beyond impressed. People, pay attention! We may have just read the work of a future Pulitzer, Man Booker Prize winner.Anna North, I'm looking forward to reading your next novel.

I almost considered not requesting and looking up short stories, as the ones I read in 2015 weren't that satisfying. ""Fortune Smiles"" is definitely on another level. The first thing that comes to mind when thinking back to the six stories is the incredible diversity of both subjects and writing style.""Nirvana"" is about a husband trying to deal with his young wife's Guillaine-Barre syndrome - a debilitating disease. The story takes place in the recent future where holograms and driverless cars are the norm.""Hurricanes Anonymous"" is about a man, Nonc, who finds himself in the post Katrina New Orleans with a toddler, who may or may not be his, and a girlfriend. He drives a UPS delivery van, so in many respects he's doing better than most. But while dealing with the hurricane's aftermath, he's trying to find the child's mother. Also, his good-for-nothing father is dying in California and wants to see him. Interesting Facts - without a doubt the story that touched me the most, is about a fourty-five-year-old woman, who had a double mastectomy and who now imagines how her husband and kids will go on without her. Initially, I was a bit annoyed at the author for embodying a woman, as in how dare he, but I have to say he did a brilliant job which makes me conclude that Johnson must be a very intuitive, observant man. I loved the way this story was written, the tone, the medical titbits, the brutal honesty. LOVED IT! ”George Orwell was a Friend of Mine” - this was such an interesting story, a subject that I’ve never come across before. The story takes place in 2008 Germany, and the main character is Hans, former manager of a STASI (the East German secret police) prison, where dissidents were locked up. I thought this story was very well researched. By having Hans as the narrator, we have a difficult time hating him completely. Was he a bad person or was he just a willing participant, with no better options? As he claims relatively often “somebody had to run the prison”. Of course, Hans is in complete denial of his role or of the fact that people were tortured and imprisoned for no other reasons but for wanting to escape, or showing opposition to the dictatorial regime. Having lived myself in a Communist country and having experienced the transition from a totalitarian regime to democracy, I can vouch that some of the things addressed and expressed in this story felt very authentic. I thought Johnson did a great job in showing the upheaval of change and how some people adapt to it easier than others. There are so many things to draw and learn from this story. This was definitely another favourite. Dark Meadow - being the story of a paedophile who’s also the narrator, I immediately thought of Nabokov’s Lolita. But the similarities stop there. First of all, the story takes place in our modern times. Our narrator is an IT expert, who lives by himself in LA; he works hard at staying away from temptation and not acting on his impulses. He knows all there is to know about the trading of kids pornography. He also knows that some paedophiles are born, some are made and some just choose. While the subject matter is hard to digest, I, for one, commend Johnson for having the “audacity” to write this story and also kudos to the publishers for including it. It’s a very good story. Fortune Smiles is about North Koreans defectors, who now find themselves in South Korea, where they have freedom and choice, and food!, and the ubiquitous internet, yet, they miss home. How can that be? This was a very interesting story, that explored, amongst other things, the power of brainwashing of a totalitarian system where not even famine makes people question things. Also, it seems to be a case that “the devil you know” is better than the unknown. This was another terrific short story. I enjoyed learning new things. It’s obvious that Johnson researched the subject greatly. Actually, all the stories, while extremely varied, were very well researched and felt very authentic. I’m in awe of Johnson’s versatility, imagination and research skills. His writing style appealed to me a great deal. It was relatively simple, yet beautiful, and original, and it felt very modern. A good author creates three-dimensional characters, who are not completely bad or good, they're somewhere in between, like most of us. Johnson is a great writer, managing to show nuances of grey in all the characters.Speaking of research, I’ll have to find some more articles and interviews on/with Adam Johnson, because this is how I roll – when something intrigues me, I research and read extra.ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SHORT STORIES!

How masterful Ferrante's writing is, managing to unfold the complexities of life in a poor neighbourhood of Naples in the early 60's, but most importantly, the human complexities, especially of the two female protagonists, Lila and Elena (Lenu). This second instalment picks up where it left off in the previous volume, with Lila being married at only sixteen with the grocer's son, Stefano Carracci, who's rich. Now Lila has what she and Lenu were dreaming of as kids - wealth. Will that bring her that elusive happiness or at least contentment? Nobody is more twisted, brilliant and difficult to understand than Lila. The fact that she's so beautiful only amplifies those traits. Women are jealous and hate her. Men want her.

The author set out our heroine, Maeve O’Brien, to be so annoying, superficial and vacuous, it took a long time for me to get over my dislike for her. While I understand why O’Neill chose to do that, it didn’t quite work for me. For the first 20-30%, I was contemplating whether to drop it, because I couldn’t stand the first person narrative and the novel had a distinctive new adult flavour (not a favourite).Things start to move along and change as Maeve is sent to a small, isolated island, Hy Brasil, to obtain the signature of a land owner, needed in order to build a bridge that will connect the main island to Hy Brasil. Simple enough, right? Wrong. The islanders are not very welcoming. Strange things keep happening. There’s something off and very usual about Hy Brasil.As the man whose signature Maeve is chasing is nowhere to be found or when found refuses to sign the papers, she has to spend much longer on the island than planned.After a week or so, Maeve starts meeting a few friendlier islanders, who were some of the newer people on the island. One of them is the very charming teacher, Killian, who is completely her opposite and, shock horror!, he doesn’t have a Facebook, Twitter or Instagram account. I must say the novel got better as I read on. The added mythological, paranormal elements made it different, although they’re really not my cup-of-teacoffee. Through Maeve we learn that we should stop the constant business, we should put the technology away and just stop and smell the coffee, or tea. Nothing we haven’t heard before.

I mean, damn high expectations!After seeing Lauren Groff at the Perth Writers' Festival, I was really keen to read 'Fates and Furies', as it sounded very interesting and right up my alley. For one reason or another, it took me a few months to get to it and now I'm left somewhat disappointed because I didn't love it. And I really wanted to love it.The first part was hard going. I couldn't really get into it. Although I love third person narration, the tone of this novel didn't quite work for me, especially in the first part, the husband's point of view. I didn't get a connection with any of the characters. I felt like an outside observer throughout the entire novel. Good thing I stuck with it as I found the second part much better, in keeping with the fact that the wife, Mathilde, was much more interesting, despite being presented as a cold, skinny, striking looking woman, without much going on. The novel is original in the way it's set up. The writing is good, in a choppy kind of way, with lots of incomplete sentences. I wasn't awed by it, and I only highlighted one paragraph.'Fates and Furies' is not a feel-good novel. It takes a look at marriage, at Lotto's and Mathilde's marriage, which seemed a marriage-made-in-heaven. In some ways, it was a good marriage. Lotto loved his wife, despite not knowing her at all. And worst of all, he didn't even try to know her. Based on my observations, I thought that was very true in many heterosexual relationships. Mathilde is the pretty, doting wife, working hard and making it happen for her oblivious, self-centered husband. She was happy with her role, as she loved Lotto, who was a bit of a big baby, who couldn't do anything for himself. Groff created very realistic, fully developed characters. No-one is perfect. I didn't think they were unlikeable or bad people. They were people, with warts and all.Towards the last quarter or so, the novel gets lots of twists and turns. Quite unexpected ones. That made the novel more thrilling. In some ways, I wish the first part was shorter, at least, without the plays (I skimmed over many of them). I'm seeing very mixed s about this novel. That makes me feel better about not loving it. I didn't hate it, on an intellectual level I appreciated it.So, this one gets 3.5 stars.I've received this via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

I love Erik, but I would so punch him for tormenting Daisy and himself in that way. And Will and Lucky. Oh wait, this is not real, this not real… it’s just a book. Relax… Ever since I first read The Man I Love, I’ve become so invested in these characters’ stories, I talk/think about them as if they were real. I know, I should get a grip.But that’s the thing about Suanne Laquer’s writing - it’s so real, so authentic, you feel connected to the characters, you feel like you know them so well. So what can I tell you about this novel without giving too much away?Erik finally reaches out to Daisy and makes amends. Erik’s tormented and deeply regretful about the wasted years. How will they work as couple, now that they’re in their thirties? Erik recoupling with Daisy is tender, passionate and almost seamless.""A strange thing to find a lost lover in your hands again. Like finding your childhood baseball glove in an attic box of memories. You’re sure it won't fit. But the heat of your palm, a flex and a bend, a cautious knead of the leather and a tentative reach into furthest recesses... and it knows you. It remember you. It fits you.""Erik’s reconnection with Will and, his now wife, Lucky, is awkward at first, but in the end, they’re back on. After all, there’s so much history between them.Erik not only reconnects to the love of his life and his best friends, he also reconnects with his past, more precisely, with his father’s side of the family. He discovered some of the missing pieces in the puzzle his father was/is. Erik finds himself having to deal with a new set of emotions. Erik and Daisy rekindled relationship is not without hardships. While they fit so well together, life throws them a few curve balls. How will they cope? Read and you’ll find out.As with the previous two novels, Suanne Laquer puts us through a spin cycle of emotions that range from amusement to exhilaration and all the way to heartbreak. Tissues will be needed. But all these emotions are organic and so real, it’s uncanny.Here to Stay is wholesome and wonderfully satisfying. I am so going to miss Erik and Daisy, Will and Lucky.

He's not well known in Australia. My local library has a few of his novels in ebook form, but I don't use that service. They managed to find me a print copy of this novel and they're purchasing Kent Krueger's latest.I can usually tell early on if a book will be at least a four-star read for me. It was the case with Ordinary Grace as well. I found the style of writing very evocative without going over-board. I like coming-of-age stories, but occasionally, I've had problems with the voice and suspending my disbelief could be problematic. It didn't happen here. Frank Drum was very convincing. Truth be told, I loved looking at the world through his eyes. The summer of 1961 was a traumatic, life-changing summer. The small town of New Bremen, Minnesota, is consumed by grief, as several people, mostly young, die unexpectedly. Frank Drum is privy to a lot of information, given that his father is the only minister conducting services in three communities. The Methodist Minister, Nathan Drum, is married to the beautiful Ruth. Together they have Frank, thirteen, his stuttering brother, Jake, eleven, and Ariel, who's about to live for Julliard to study piano. Their family is relatively ordinary. The parents are consumed by their jobs and pursues. The boys do what boys did back in the day. Ariel went out with friends and her boyfriend, Karl and also helped transcribing the memoir of her beloved piano teacher. I probably shouldn't divulge much more about the plot, as it's a mystery.I thought Kent Krueger did a fantastic job painting the small community. All the characters were credible and interesting enough. Very early on I had the strangest sense of deja-vu, better said deja-read, I had to check if I'd read this before. Ordinary Grace is, in many ways, similar to other coming-of-age novels and movies. I even had an inkling who the ""baddie"" was. Regardless, this was a satisfying reading experience. I can see why so many loved this novel....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Oct 03, 2019","Oct 05, 2019","Oct 20, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15803059-ordinary-grace

Another protagonist is Mike's ex, Christie Simmon.Mike Anderson suffers from undiagnosed PTSD and depression, following an attempted murder, which left Mike's partner gravely injured and killed another policeman.

Because ... ""F*ck Feelings"". I know, I know, it's a (relatively) new marketing/selling strategy, but I saw this on NetGalley and I had to request it. Because ... ""F*ck Feelings"". I know, I know, it's a (relatively) new marketing/selling strategy, but it's so up my alley. Mary Mary quite contrary and all that. And I don't know about you, but at times, I found myself thinking ""fucking feelings, I wish I didn't have them..."" or something like that. Intriguing introduction: ""Buying a self-help book is usually the second-to-last step to surrendering to a crisis of self, the last step being therapy and the first step being a gym membership, or at least a Zumba DVD or a pamphlet on the Learning Annex."" . What the? I kept reading though.I also had a big chuckle when reading that despite of what Oprah and Deepak Chopra might tell you, ""just because you're prepared to sacrifice whatever is necessary to improve yourself doesn't mean you can do it"". BANG! Just like that, on the first page, the authors are telling you that not only you're a dimwit for buying this book (I'm only half so, because I got it for free from NetGalley ;-) ) but no matter what you are willing to do to improve, it won't really matter much in the end. So, probably because of my somewhat contrary personality, I continued reading.""Neuroscience seems to show that many emotional and behavioural problems we thought were caused by bad parents or trauma are also caused by wiring that isn't reversible. This explains why self-improvement is hard and sometimes impossible, even when we're strong willed and well guided. In other words, we're often fucked.""""We're often fucked""! How does one deal with that statement and its perceived meaning? Do you feel relieved to hear that things are as they are and there's not much you can do to change them, or just keep at it, trying to improve, better yourself, because surely, there's always potential for better and more? A dilemma. I'm in the always improving oneself camp, which can get exhausting! I've read my fair share of self-help books, especially when I was young(er), but - Shock Horror! - I'm still as disorganised as ever, and still haven't learnt the art of saying things in a more subtle, diplomatic way. But enough about me, you're here to read about the book and what I thought of it. There were lots of things I highlighted. There were things that didn't interest me that much, such as the chapters on addiction, but that's not to say that they weren't good.What I liked the most was its practical, matter-of-fact, at times sarcastic (but not too much) approach to it all. I don't care for yadi-dadi-da, pseudo/spiritual, a la the Secret and Depak Chopra bs philosophies, so, yes, F*ck Feelings appealed to me a great deal. Certain chapters, tidbits were enlightening. I loved the F*ck Parenthood chapter. And F*ck Serenity! F*ck Communication was such a revelation. There's also F*ck Self-Esteem, F*ck Fairness, F*ck Helpfulness - all well presented and argued. Other chapters, sub-chapters on addiction, therapy, love were very informative and different. Ultimately, this book is not teaching you to ignore feelings, but to adjust your expectations, to take a more pragmatical approach, to have achievable goals. And ""... remember that there's no such thing as ""fair"", feelings are stupid, life is hard... and you're going to be relatively okay, even if you won't be happy, because your goals are realistic and your efforts to reach those goals will make you proud. Then, the next time life gives you a shit sandwich, slather that puppy in ketchup and enjoy. They're on everyone's menu. Even at the fine dining halls at Harvard.""F*ck Feelings is the self-help book that is the antithesis to every SH book and shrink drivel and clichés you've ever read. And I f*cking (mostly) loved it! 4.5 starsI've received this book via NetGalley.

I thought to myself, could this be another Banville (a great Irish writer, for those not familiar with his name)? Not quite, at least not based on this collection.Thirteen Ways of Looking is the longest story and it was my favourite. All because of the octogenarian retired judge, Mendelssohn, who is a very interesting character. His ruminations on being old, his recollections of his youth and life with his beloved, now deceased, wife, were touching and amusing at times. I can definitely say that Mendelssohn’s voice was my favourite part of the whole collection. The story has a tragic ending. A relatively big part of the story shows how the police go about finding the assailant. To be honest, while I wanted to find out who the attacker was and his reasons for doing what he did, I was bored with the police procedurals and the trial. And the ending didn’t have a clear resolution. As a matter of fact, none of the stories, some very short, had clear resolutions. As much as I admire Mccann’s writing, I can’t say that I was completely satisfied. I wanted more. And another thing I noticed, I didn’t get emotionally connected with any of the characters. I’m trying to articulate why this collection of stories didn’t quite awe me that much. For me, this was more of an intellectual exercise, that didn’t quite hit my emotional responses. Given the subject matter of most of the stories, I feel I should have been very touched, but I didn’t shed one tear – and that’s very unusual, as I am the biggest crybaby. Only when it comes to books and movies! But shhh, don’t tell anyone, OK? I’ve got a reputation to maintain. So, while Thirteen Ways of Looking wasn’t a 5-star for me, it did trigger my interest in reading more of McCann's writing.I've received this book via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

Unique! Fun, but definitely not stupid! But first, let me just say that Freya Being Freya is not an erotic novel or This was unexpectedly delightful. Unique! Fun, but definitely not stupid! But first, let me just say that Freya Being Freya is not an erotic novel or erotica (not sure if there's a difference)! Just because it has a few sex scenes (nothing over the top), it doesn't make it erotic fiction. Categorising it that way, I feel it devalues it, and that's a shame.Because Freya being Freya is a wonderfully quirky, deliciously irreverent novel, with wonderful feminist undertones - well, actually the feminist message is right there on the page, no under anything about it:""But I am here mainly for us women. I have witnessed many things in my long life.”.. “and have seen how women have grown strong in the last few decades, especially in these, my own lands. But we must not rest on our laurels as men, powerful men resent our power. They will always love our power of beauty and love and kindness and sex. … “But they will not allow us to be equal to themselves and certainly never more powerful. We must always be who we are without ever having shame or seeing ourselves as second class citizens. I am here today, not to make you hate men but to love yourselves more …to be proud of what you are, girls, women, mothers, temptresses, sirens, the people with more empathy, more gentleness and more love to give. With this love I ask you, maybe even command you to stand up to men’s lust for power. Those who lust for power are those who must not have power. I ask you always to point out what you think is wrong in the world. Your intuition will be wise. You need to speak out and then act upon this intuition. Powerful men speak too much.""So who says the above? It's Freya, a Viking goddess of love and sex, who's brought to life into this word by a mere mortal thirty-something Swedish guy. He's in deep with Freya, because no one and nothing can resist her. Her beauty and presence are astounding. But she's more than just beautiful. She's intelligent, kind, smart, shy, assertive, daring, demure, silly, friendly and altogether amazing. And no push-over! She won't let men dominate, tell her what to do, who to be! (When was the last time you've come across a similar female character?)Anyway, I don't want to give too much away. I will just say that this was beyond surprising. The writing is excellent! It's so good, I even enjoyed the first person narrative, which, if you've been reading my s, you'd know I'm not too keen on it. So, yeah, this was an unexpectedly enjoyable read. Whoever Thomas Ullman is, he/she (I'm leaning towards she) is a great writer. While I'm not a big fan of cliffhangers, I'm going to read the next novel (I was intrigued and I googled the author and I came across the fact that there's a sequel).Thanks so much to Suzanne for reading and ing this.

Bill Bryson, you're one of a kind! How I love thee. I love your sense of humour and I am grateful to you for making me laugh out loud. I love your sarcasm; obviously living in the UK for over forty years has made you more sarcastic, because, let's be honest here, Americans are not known for their sarcasm. I love your appreciation of museums, trains, nature and your lack of pretences when it comes to expensive cars, clothes and other typical signs of affluence people like to display. I love how you're so interested in all sort of facts, many of them, obscure, and you resurrect some of the people that history had forgotten and that you bring to my attention facts and tidbits that I never thought I would find interesting. And yes, I love that your statements are supported by data, statistics and facts. I love that you're self-deprecating. You're one special kind of person. We need more people like you. Britain is lucky to have you. And we are lucky to have your books.I know, this is not exactly a book . I'll summarise: it's what you'd expect from Bryson. And thank XYZ for that (one of the sucky bits about being an atheist is that I can't find any supernatural beings to be grateful to). Ah, one thing I noticed is that Mr Bryson swears much more, or at least, I don't remember him cussing so much in previous books. I loved that as well. :-) NB: I've listened to the audio for this, although I have the paperback on my bookshelf. Nathan Osgood was OK, I would have preferred Bill Bryson himself as the narrator.

Come to think of it, all characters have mother issues.- There are long, convoluted life-stories for the main characters, which I guess should endear them to us a little bit more, since we get to know them so intimately, too intimately, in all their ugliness, including their most secret thoughts, sexual fantasies and proclivities. And, man, I've read erotica that had less sex than this novel. - There are many threads in this novel: relationships between parents and children, especially between mothers and children; marital unions; the internet; agriculture and animal welfare, fame; Communist East Germany; money; liberalism; and many others.- As many other ers seem to have noted, Franzen comes out as quite the misogynist, given his description of women, who are either extremely attractive and/or young or, if they're not so, they're somewhere in the frumpy, invisible, unattractive and insignificant realm. - Sure, the men are no saints or anything like that, but somehow, their issues seem to be caused by women, be it their mothers or lovers. Poor, innocent, delicate men! - Without a doubt, there are some very well articulated ideas, a lot of smart writing. I love smart, intellectual anything, so why is it I didn't love this novel? It's not because the characters were unlikeable. I know! It's because it was soulless and bitter, and quite depressing. That's why. So, for now, I'll rate this 3 stars.

Loneliness, injustice, race relations, poverty are some of the themes that appear in this novel that takes place in a small mill town in Georgia, during the 1930s. It would have been an impressive novel if it had been written recently, by a well versed, experienced author. To think that it published in 1940, and that it was the debut by a twenty-three old Southern woman makes this all that more impressive. There are even discussions about fascism, communism, education, and religion, there’s even a black character who’s a vegetarian. The varied cast of characters in this novel we meet via the deaf-mute John Singer, a most gentile and kind person, who becomes a sounding board for several characters. There is a lot to take in, ponder and admire about this novel, which is still relevant today. Obviously, McCullers was a woman ahead of her time. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is must-read.

It took me a while to get into it, although I never truly got into it, which was strange, as it wasn't a difficult novel, nor was it too slow or too fantastical. The novel is about three displaced young people, who find themselves in the interbellum Sydney. One of them is Ari, a Jewish young man, who's escaped the Russian pogrom and is living in Sydney with his very strict, rabbi uncle. Ari is fascinated by magic and by Houdini. The other male protagonist, who's also one of the narrators in the novel, is Billy, a WWI veteran, who's cocky, sneaky and a ladies' man of sorts. Then there's Lily, who's a young albino woman, with a mysterious past. She's got a way with birds. So Lily and Ari decide to create a magic act, so they gather few birds. The innocent, shy Ari develops feelings for Lily. But there's competition, as Billy is convinced that Lily is his, so she's caught in the middle. A love triangle of sorts. What will happen? Read and you'll find out. You'll have to be patient, though.So why wasn't I completely charmed by this novel? I think it was the tone, the alternate POVs, written in the first person, that didn't quite do it for me. I never really felt the magic, pardon the pun, I didn't feel connected or too engaged with the characters, where I should have, but for most of it, I felt completely detached. It could have been just me, as the novel is competently written, although something felt amiss.

The Blue Guitar was one of my favourite reads of 2015 and has become one of my favoDiscovering John Banville last year was an amazing occurrence. The Blue Guitar was one of my favourite reads of 2015 and has become one of my favourite novels. Period. So I was both excited and apprehensive to read the Sea, Banville’s Man Booker prize winner, because I feared being disappointed.I’m relieved to say that I LOVE JOHN BANVILLE! So much. Unequivocally. His writing beguiles me. His writing consumes me. His descriptions and metaphors are works of art. His way with words, the turn of phrases are surprising and oh, so wonderful! I’m awed. I’m mesmerised.Every phrase is polished, sometimes to a blinding glare, and it hits you and you’re left wondering - how does he do that!?! Fair or not, Banville has become the yardstick against which I'll measure literary fiction. As far as I’m concerned, Banville should be studied. Because he’s unique, and surprising, and a wordsmith. I retract everything I’ve been saying about not being a fan of the first person narrative. Had I read Banville sooner, I wouldn’t have made such a preposterous statement. The Sea is a character driven novel. The narrator is Max Marden, a dilettante in his fifties. Following the death of his wife, Anna, the mother of his only child, Claire, Max is unable to move on. He’s dazed and mostly lives in the past. A certain summer of his childhood, when he met the Graces, is remembered in great detail. He remembers the smells, the tastes and the feelings of those times, in the little town by the sea. Banville weaves his way between the present and the past in a seamless way. Current and past happenings intermingle. The mind wanders and certain memories and feelings resurface. How the mind wonders, even at the most concentrated of occasions."" Happiness was different in childhood. It was so much then a matter simply of accumulation, of taking things - new experiences, new emotions - and applying them like so many polished tiles to what would someday be the marvellously finished pavilion of the self.As in the Blue Guitar, Banville’s way of describing people, especially people the narrator loves, made me go - Oh, no, you didn’t just say that! You see, Banville doesn’t wax lyrically about one's beauty the way we’re used to reading. His descriptions of people are like no other writers'. Take Claire for instance, Max’s daughter. “What age is she now, twenty something. I’m not sure. She is very bright, quite the bluestocking. Not beautiful, however, I admitted that to myself long ago. I cannot pretend this is not a disappointment, for I had hoped that she would be another Anna. She is too tall and stark, her rusty hair is coarse and untameable and stand out around her freckled face in an unbecoming manner, and when she smiles she shows her upper gums, glistening and whitely pink. With those spindly legs and big bum, that hair, the long neck especially … Yet she is brave and makes the best of herself and of the world. She has the rueful, grimly humorous, clomping way to her that is common to so many ungainly girls. … Dear Claire, my sweet girl.”  See what I mean? Max isn’t any kinder with his own description. How about this extraordinarily accurate, I thought, spot on description of one getting startled by his/her own reflection? “There was a time when I quite liked what I saw in the looking-glass, but not anymore. Now I’m startled, and more than startled, by the visage that so abruptly appears there, never at all the one that I expect. I have been elbowed aside by a parody of myself, a sadly dishevelled figure in a Halloween mask made of sagging, pinkish- grey rubber that bears no more than a passing resemblance to the image of what I look like that I stubbornly retain in my head.”  And there’s much more of that. This novel is, to a great extent, about grief. About dying and loneliness. Because ""perhaps all of life is no more than a long preparation for the leaving of it.” There is so much to say and analyse about this novel.There are better, more eloquent s out there. I am just a mere mortal who is completely and utterly spellbound by John Banville’s writing. Again, I take a bow. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jul 07, 2016","Jul 09, 2016","Aug 24, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21290308-the-sea

The luxury hotel she is supposed to run has a 3-star Michelin restaurant, and the restaurant's patissier is Luc Leroi, a 30-year-old beautiful man who created incredible desserts. Too bad Summer doesn't ever eat dessert though. I can't believe I'm going to say this, but the main characters had way too much inner torment. Their love story just lacked charm, warmth. There is not much humour in this novel. Luc Leroi was one humourless, uptight dude.So yeah, not much more to say, mainly I didn't engage with the characters, especially when most of the time I found them irritating.

I’m not sure I can come up with a half-decent way to articulate how good it was. It’s one of those slow-burning, slowly unravelling novels, where the main characters are ordinary yet exceptional. They’re people you know yet they’re like onions with layers that peel off slowly as the novel progresses. Whispers through a Megaphone is charming, somewhat quirky but not in an obvious way. I loved the tone. I loved the writing. I didn’t mind the many flashbacks because they were seamless. There are lots of POVs, but in the end, they all make sense.

For the past three years, Miriam has not left her home, with the exception of her back garden. She decides it’s time to try the outside world again. Not far from where she lives, Ralph Swoon, 37 years old, psychotherapist, married father of two 16 year-old twin boys is having some sort of midlife crisis and takes off to the woods. That’s where he meets Miriam, on her first day out of the house. An unusual friendship ensues. Will they get together? Yes, they will. But in what capacity?

What were the chances? This is a novel about relationships, between children and parents, between partners, be it heterosexual or same-sex partners. It’s about connecting, about belonging and about love. It’s about finding yourself when you feel lost. I for one was charmed, intrigued, pleasantly surprised and awed.

Ah, and a prologue and epilogue. Why do so many NA novels have them? Never mind, it's a rhetorical question. Our main female character is Charlotte, who's a violin prodigy in her last year at Julliard. The first chapter didn't appease me much, as there was too much information dumping. It got a bit better from then on, although Charlotte's circumstances and misery a year after her brother's death felt kind of contrived. A year later, Charlotte is not auditioning because she couldn't ""feel the music"" anymore. So she works two crappy jobs waiting tables and bartending, barely making enough to make rent. The first chapters did feel contrived, but I went with it.Things got better from then on. Because Charlotte meets Noah Lane - former extreme sports legend and writer for an extreme sports magazine, who's now blind, due to a diving accident. And as you can imagine, he's obnoxious and grumpy as hell. After a chance encounter with Noah's family solicitor, Charlotte ends up as Noah's assistant and also gets a room to live in the same villa. Can you guess what happens next? Despite all the cliches and the formulaic everything, this wasn't horrible. But not terribly enticing either. I felt emotionally disconnected. On a side note: why is it that it's always women saving guys from themselves, why is it that it's always women falling in love with guys with disabilities and not vice-versa? This thing has got to be one of the few believable aspects in a romance novel. Just for something different, I would love to read a novel where the situation was reversed. It's fiction, after all.

I should have loved it because it addresses racism, antisemitism, tribalism; it shows some disdain for religious beliefs while praising the power of knowledge and education - all these aspects, and more, should have made me go ga-ga over this novel.The Power of One  is pretty aptly named, it's also my main issue with this novel. You see, the protagonist of this novel, Peekay, whom we meet as a five-year-old and whose adventures we follow until he's eighteen, seems to possess many powers: excellent ability to learn different languages; ability to learn to play the piano; sporting abilities which turn him into a champion boxer; high IQ, which allowed him to outperform everyone at school etc. With the help of mentors he runs clandestine letter exchange services for the mostly black men in prison; at sixteen he establishes an after-hours school to teach black kids, in spite of the law which prohibited black schools in white communities.And of course, he always wins his boxing matches, even though he was facing taller and heavier opponents. Speaking of boxing, there's sooooooo much of it. I personally find boxing reprehensible.There isn't anything Peekay can't do. He's perfect! He's the best at everything. He sees no colour, has no prejudices, no hang-ups, he's selfless and incredibly empathetic, breaks barriers, enlightens and helps so many. He's a saint! A white knight with no armour.Another problem, The Power of One is too long, even though it's easy to digest given it's dialogue rich and action packed. I don't know why I somehow expected it to be more literary. Overall, I enjoyed and appreciated this novel and can definitely see why so many love it.The lack of restraint when dishing out Peekay's virtues and because its somewhat simplistic portrayal of race and tribal relations, I'm only giving this 3 - 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Aug 23, 2019","Sep 02, 2019","Aug 08, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/122.The_Power_of_One

Her background in psychology and grief counselling has given this novel a very authentic feel. The novel is set on a horse farm in rural Victoria, Australia. The Carltons are reeling because of Cate’s sudden death. The husband, Bass, and their twin teenage boys, Rafferty and Cameron, and their sister, Jessa, are in shock and are stumbling through the everyday minutia of life. They’re helped by good friends, Laura and Steve, and Cate’s sister, Beatrice, who themselves have been affected by Cate’s untimely death. In the Quiet is deliciously slow-burning. I cried quite a bit in the beginning, as the family’s sorrow was palpable and Cate’s need to be there and do all the many things a mum and wife does was absolutely heartbreaking. Slowly, the pain subsides, everyone learns to deal with life, to make plans and build new relations. Living has a way of creeping in, although the pain is still there.I liked so many things about this novel. The writing is excellent and a bit different. I thought it was interesting that there were no chapters, although there were paragraph breaks between what could have been chapters. I was very impressed with this novel; it's real, relatable and very gentle.The title is absolutely perfect.This was a quietly beautiful, unassuming, slowly unravelling novel, which will make you ponder about life and your own relationships.

I felt totally self-conscious because I don’t have the skills to write a  that is worthy of such a tremendous novel. So bear with me as I stagger through writing this .This was my first John Banville novel. To be honest, I hadn’t heard of him, but when I saw that he’s a Man Booker Prize winner, the literary snob in me I decided that I should request it on NetGalley.I’ve read some great books in my life, but I can’t remember the last time I was awed by somebody’s writing to this extent. My poor brain was exploding with enchantment, incredulity, and admiration. It starts like this:“Call me Autolycus. Well, no, don’t. Although I am, like that unfunny clown, a picker-up of unconsidered trifles. Which is a fancy way of saying I steal things.”The Blue Guitar is about Oliver Orme. He’s a famous painter, who can’t paint anymore, and who likes to steal little things of no use, just for the thrill of it. He’s pushing fifty and is having some sort of delayed mid-life crisis.“Childhood is supposed to be a radiant springtime but mine seems to have been always autumn, the gales seething in the big beeches behind this old gate-lodge, as they’re doing right now, and the rooks above them wheeling haphazard, like scraps of char from a bonfire, and a custard-coloured gleam having its last go low down in the western sky”.This is a character driven novel. It’s Oliver’s musings throughout the entire novel. He’s not a particularly charming character, something that he’s well aware of and admits to it with an uncanny honesty. He’s simple, yet complex. He’s a famous artist who can’t create art anymore. He’s not unhappy but not particularly happy either. He just is. Many times you feel like yelling “get over yourself”! He knows it, too.  Banville has created a complex, three-dimensional character. Oliver is as real as they come. Through him Banville is asking what’s real. Who are we? What is our “true self”? Is there such a thing as a “true self”? Oh, there are so many things to contemplate and think about, it can get a bit exhausting. But don’t let my statement detract you from reading it. Because, while it’s not a fluffy, feel-good novel, it’s filled with humour - smart, sarcastic humour. Banville’s way with words is astounding. I’ve never had to look up so many words as I had to do while reading The Blue Guitar. Don’t get dispirited by this, because you don’t really have to, you’ll understand the gist of it all, but why wouldn’t you? When was the last time you had the opportunity to learn a new word? I personally was mesmerised. And awed. And gobsmacked. And many other things I don’t have the vocabulary to express, at least not eloquently enough. In this world where the “lowest common denominator” is the status-quo, I feel grateful and lucky to have come across an author who raises the bar, without being cumbersome or arrogant.Many novels these days include books and music references. The Blue Guitar brings up art, mainly painting references. That was another aspect I truly enjoyed about this novel. Oliver’s irreverence and self-effacing ramblings made me smile on many occasions. For instance, here’s how he describes himself:“The fact is, whenever I made an overture to a woman, which I seldom did, even in my young days, I never really expected it to be entertained, or even noticed, despite certain instances of success, which I tended to regards as flukes, the result of misunderstanding, or dimness on the part of the woman and simple good fortune on mine. I’m not an immediately alluring specimen, having been, for a start, the runt of the litter. I’m short and stout, or better go the whole hog and say fat, with a big head and tiny feet. My hair is of a shade somewhere between wet rust and badly tarnished brass, and in damp weather, or when I’m by the seaside, clenches itself into curls that are as tight and dense as cauliflower florets and stubbornly resistant to fiercest combings. My skin – oh, my skin! – is a flaccid, moist, off-white integument, so that I look as if I had been blanched in the dark for a long time. Of my freckles I shall not speak.”John Banville is a wordsmith. Every phrase is painstakingly crafted, as if it were precious glass that he’s carefully blown into art objects, but his are beautifully constructed phrases. His writing has a certain musicality, a cadence that’s quite unique. And he never ceases to surprise, amaze and delight. This is definitely a novel that’s going on my Favourites shelf. I can’t rave enough about it. While it’s not for everyone, if you love good literature, then I wholeheartedly recommend this splendid novel.I’ve received this novel via NetGalley in exchange of an honest .

Hear me out: I have aThis was one of those novels that I really wanted to like and that I should have enjoyed tremendously, yet, I struggled with it. Hear me out: I have a thing (a bit of an obsession) with everything and anything Spanish and/or Latin American. I love Madrid and I am terribly fond of museums, have spent quite a few hours in the Prado museum and am familiar with Diego Velasquez's works. All these elements were present and had centre stage in this novel.I should have been very fond of our main hero, Englishman Anthony Whitefields, a thirty-something art historian, specialised in Spanish paintings. He has a great fondness of Spain, especially of Madrid and is absolutely obsessed with Velasquez's paintings. He finds himself inadvertently immersed in the pre-revolutionary Spain, where he encounters different echelons of the Spanish society, from old money noblemen to new fascists and dirt poor women, who have to prostitute themselves for survival. Through all these adventures, Anthony Whitefields is a hapless observer, whose main and only focus is to bring to England a newly discovered Velasquez painting. This novel is a comedy of errors and absurd of sorts, at times satirical and where there's an intense sense of adventure and history happening. Many aspects of the novel didn't quite gel well and felt contrived. I love art, painting and history, but Whitefields' incessant monologs on Velasquez's paintings and his life were so long, so tedious, even I got bored and skipped over them at times. Many secondary characters burst into long speeches with lots of unrelated anecdotes, which, after a while, became tedious.I don't know if it was the translation that failed it, I thought the writing and the tone felt old-fashioned, but not in a good way. It's not even very literary, in the wordy, sophisticated, complex writing kind of way, at least I would I would have admired that. There were no quotable paragraphs, no ""wow, this is some good writing"" moments. I've looked up this novel and its author and I was shocked to read that it won one of the richest literary prizes around - the Spanish Premio Planta - worth 600,000 Euro (approx $675,000 US)! Quite incredible, because while this is not terrible, and some aspects are interesting and well researched, it's no literary classic, nor is an easy, funny, quirky read.This is a novel that could have been great, but it felt to impress and/or entertain.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Sep 28, 2015","Sep 30, 2015","Aug 08, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25865320-an-englishman-in-madrid

So they eventually find out about Alma’s Japanese lover, Ichimei Fukuda.Alma and Ichimei’s love story was quite touching and interesting, especially taking into consideration that race and social class stood in the way. I applaud Isabel Allende for bringing to our attention the harsh treatment of the Japanese immigrants by the US government during and after the World War II. It’s not something that it’s mentioned often. The only other time I read about it was in David Suzuki’s memoirs. Isabel Allende is a competent storyteller, employing simple and fluid writing. The novel is narrated in the third person and the characters are well drawn. As they say, getting old is not for sissies. Allende makes that perfectly clear, in a very matter-of-fact manner, which I admired greatly. It's been quite a few years since I last read a novel by Isabel Allende. It could be my memory playing tricks on me, but I remember her writing having a different ""feel"". Regardless, it was an enjoyable read, that I found heartbreaking and sad at times. I received this novel via NetGalley, thanks to the publisher, Atria Books, for the opportunity to read and  this novel.

It had all the elements of such series: monstrous head of the family, drunk/drugged matriarch, kids who hate their father, marriages of convenience, adultery etc, you get the idea. So yeah, if you enjoy watching that type of TV, you'll probably love this novel. I stopped watching such series a long time ago because they're stupid over the top. The main dude, (Tu)Lane, was kind of blah as well. He's your typical rich, spoiled brat, who hasn't worked a day in his life. And he's a coward. And the chemistry between him with Lizzie is missing. Also, insta-love situations kind of irritate me, especially since the protagonists are past their teen years.Anyway, I know many will love this novel. I didn't hate it, hate it, like say, Beautiful Bastard and the likes, but I felt duped and cheated. Especially since there's a bloody huge cliffy. I hate those! But something tells me that many won't mind forking out a small fortune for a very average, run-of-the-mill series.

My first impression was good, I liked the first chapter, so I kept reading. But as I read on, it became somewhat tedious and I felt disconnected. Our heroine, Evelyn Beegan is 26, living in Manhattan and working for a new internet social networking company. She attended an elite private high school, where she didn't quite fit in, although she made a couple of good friends, Charlotte and Preston. She wants to belong desperately, although she's not as rich as her friends and the people whose circles they attend. Evelyn often feels like she's not good enough, as obviously, she's not as rich as her friends. Keeping up is not easy, although she gives it a good shot.This novel is exploring aspects of the society relating to the top echelons; questions are asked about what's class, what's new/old money and how do you fit in when the social etiquette and rankings are somewhat arbitrary?I should have liked it much more than I did, so why didn't I? Evelyn is an unlikeable character, needy and desperate and she lacks a backbone. That's fine as I don't have to always like the characters in books. Not everyone is likeable, there are plenty of people like Evelyn out there. I just felt that the novel was quite disjointed, jumpy, one moment we're reading something about a party or a shopping trip and then the chapter ends abruptly and we move on to something else. Most of the characters are very unlikeable, that includes Evelyn's mother and I didn't care about any of them. The novel does get better towards the end. But by then, I was so annoyed with Evelyn, I didn't care anymore. So in conclusion, not a bad debut novel, but I just didn't connect as much as I'd expected to.Cover: 4 stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 18, 2015","Aug 19, 2015","Aug 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23605009-everybody-rise

And what a tremendous novel this was. I must say, when I first saw the cover, I instantly thought of Gabriel GaThis was my first Alice Hoffman novel. And what a tremendous novel this was. I must say, when I first saw the cover, I instantly thought of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende, probably because the model looks South American. And true enough, the tone and the mystical aspects of the novel gave it a Marquez-esque and Allende-esque flavour. I wonder if others thought the same.While I'm not the biggest fan of historical fiction, especially when it's got fictionalised actual historical figures, I thoroughly enjoyed the Marriage of Opposites as there were so many things I appreciated.Where do I start?Hoffman has a beautiful writing style, I thought her description of St. Thomas was fantastic, I could almost feel, smell and taste the place. The novel is mostly about Rachel Pomie Pizzaro’s life, the mum of the impressionist painter, Camille Pissarro. Rachel is a force to be reckoned with. She’s feisty, intelligent, outspoken and very stubborn. She dreams of escaping to Paris. She questions her place in the world, she questions why she has to obey silly rules, why women have no rights. Unfortunately, when her father’s business is failing, she feels obligated to marry a man much older, who already had three children. So she becomes Rachel Pomie. She adores her new husband’s children and has four more with him. But by the age of twenty-nine, she’s a widow with seven children. According to the rules of the times, all her family’s possessions will be passed onto a nephew of her husband’s, who is to arrive from Paris and take over the estate. And that is Frederik Pizzarro, who’s just a young twenty-two years old man from Paris. He falls in love/lust with Rachel the moment he sets eyes on her. He’s a pious, hardworking, intelligent and principled man. Rachel finally has a chance at love. Rachel and Frederik’s love has to overcome lots of obstacles imposed by their culture and the times. There are quite a few characters in this novel, some get more “air time” than others. One of the more prominent characters is Jestine, Rachel’s best friend. Her story is full of love and heartbreak, but happiness finds her later in her life.It’s worth mentioning the unique structure of the novel, which is made up of eleven chapters, five of those consisting of Rachel’s narration in the first person. When we get to meet Rachel's second husband, Abraham Gabriel Frederick Pizzarro, Hoffman switches to the third person narrative. Three chapters are dedicated to Jacobo Camille Pizzarro, Rachel and Frederick’s youngest son. I thought the author’s use of the first person narrative in one of those chapters and then the third person narration for the other two chapters was quite unusual. I can’t say it bothered me, although it’d probably have made more sense to just stick with the third person narration when it came to Camille Pissarro, but what do I know? I just don’t recall ever encountering this type of leaping between first and third person narratives within one novel, which it doesn’t mean it’s not a viable novel structure.I appreciated that the author gave us some background history on how the Jewish people came to live on that remote, tropical island. I like learning something new when I read. I thought the first part of the novel, which was mostly about Rachel, was better, as it was more layered. The last two-three chapters felt a bit rushed and crammed, but it seems to me that’s the norm with most novels these days, as the authors seem to rush to the resolution. Regardless, this was a beautiful, lyrical novel. It is a novel about love, and family, and responsibilities; it’s about women’s rights or, better said, lack of rights; it’s about Jewish traditions and customs; it’s about the power of friendship; it’s about secrets and loss, and moving on. It’s about the agony and, occasionally, the ecstasy of life. 4-4.5 starsI've received this novel via NetGalley in exchange for an honest .

To be honest, I was ready for it to end, one, two novels ago. That's the problem with series, authors/publishers just milk the proverbial cow and sometimes I feel duped, a feeling I don't enjoy that much. Sure, many times, the pressure comes from the readers to keep going, because we get so enamoured with the characters and stories, we don't want to let go, we want more and more. In saying all the above, even though I was frustrated by some of the repetitions and the going back and forth, and a few other niggling things, it was still an enjoyable read. I remember how shocked I was when I first read one of Ms Reisz's books in the series. But I kept reading because Tiffany Reisz is a good writer, who has created very complex, imperfect, extreme characters. And there's humour and sarcasm. You've got to love Eleanor Schreiber, aka Nora Sutherling, aka Mistress Nora. She's not afraid to go after what and whom she wants, she's smart and funny and extremely sexual (she's never ever not in the mood for sex!). Everybody loves/wants her. How exhausting.The conclusion of the series was not unsatisfying. It did feel like everyone was getting older and mellower and there is a happy-ever-after.Good bye, farvel, au revoir Nora, Soren and Kingsley.

She meets Jarvis and they start an email affair. Luisa conjures a plan to get rid of her husband, Luke and thinks that if he was to have an affair, at least he’d be more amicable in case of a divorce. So she begins looking for a suitable candidate, who should also make for a good stepmother for their eight-year-old son, Max.This was a “be careful what you wish for, as you may get it” sort of story. A cautionary tale of sorts. I thought that Rowena Wiseman’s portrayal of a marriage, that wasn’t horrible, but not great either, was very realistic. The writing is eloquent and fluid, without unnecessary flourishes. (view spoiler)[I do like contemporary fiction about relationships, about struggling with choices, with what ifs, with responsibilities and obligations. While this novel was about all of the above, I wasn’t as enthralled as I thought I’d be. More than likely it had something to do with the fact that Luisa came across as a self-centred, and calculating woman, which normally would not bother me, as I don’t expect perfect protagonists. But I felt that given that she was the narrator and it was told in the first person, I should have been more invested, more on her side, especially since I am the right audience for this type of novel. To be honest, I felt somewhat detached.I also thought that the author rushed us through Luisa’s relationship with Jarvis. There wasn’t enough “meat” to the relationship, there was too much telling and not enough showing. I completely understood why Luisa was unhappy with her husband, Luke; whatever we were supplied as a testament to Jarvis’ infatuation for Luisa didn’t feel convincing enough. Had they had a physical relationship, it would have felt more realistic, especially since they both lived in the same city and had the time and opportunity to act on their attraction. Obviously, that was just my opinion, but I really didn’t feel the passion.  (hide spoiler)]Besides the few grumbles mentioned above, it’s still a well-written, insightful novel. It just didn’t quite grip me as much as it should have, given the story.

The first thing that piqued my interest was the unusual title. Then I saw it mentioned by many. So, of course, I had to see what the fuss was all about.Well, as much as I like to be contrary and different (Ha!), I quite enjoyed this young-adult novel. I didn't even have an issue with the fact that it was written in the first person. I guess my issues with the first person narrative are with badly written ones, most of them encountered in new adult novels.I've come to the realisation that I like/prefer young adult novels to the new adult novels, which are so incredibly formulaic, even I could write one. The character development in young adult novels is so much better than in most new adult novels combined. Which is strange. But anyway, I digress.So, despite not being the target audience, and not having anything in common with the characters, I quite liked this novel.Aristotle, is a fifteen-year-old Mexican American or American Mexican. He's sulky, very sulky. And lonely. He prefers to be alone. He can't/won't connect to anyone. He's got no friends. Never had any. That all changes when he meets Dante at the local pool. So they start a friendship. And it's complex, as much as two different boys can have a complex friendship.As they grow up, sexuality comes into play. Dante knows himself well. Aristotle - or Ari as likes to be called - doesn't think that much about it, he's got some hang-ups about sex. They also have their family issues to deal with. And the whole identity thing that sprung from having Mexican parents but being born and living in the USA. Dante felt and acted more American than Mexican. Ari looked more Mexican and was speaking better Spanish, but he didn't feel that Mexican either, but not American American either.So anyway, I liked this book a lot. Sure, Aristotle is incredibly inscrutable but I guess there are people like that. The ending is great, although I didn't buy it 100%, but I won't say why, as I don't want to ruin it for you.If I liked this book, I can only imagine how much the younger readers would. So if you have teenagers, let them read it. Especially if they're boys (do teenage boys read?

A young man sits alone in an airport lounge. The seat beside him is empty. Someone sits down. This is how it starts and every time it starts like this. In every universe. In every dimension. In every possible version of this story, this is the start. It starts like this because life is nothing but a series of tides and waves, the constant movement of a vast ocean propelled by the sun, the moon and what scientists swear to us isn't magic. Most times they trickle, sometimes they surge, and every so often the earth realigns and the ocean responds in kind.""I was captivated. The first few pages are beautiful. ""There are no tsunamis in this story - no seismic vibrations or geological cataclysms - but there are waves"". This phrase describes this novel perfectly, as it's not about any major dramatic twists in the main characters' lives, but it's about life and its occasional waves. The Bit in Between is the story of Oliver and Alison, both in their mid twenties, both going through some sort of life crisis. Oliver is an anxious writer, whereas Alison is impulsive and doesn't really know who she is or what she wants.Their first encounter is very amusing, albeit, not for poor Oliver. Their accidental meeting in an airport lounge turns into a relationship. So Alison ends up following Oliver to the Solomon islands, where he is going to write his second novel.Life in the Solomons is slow; Oliver is trying to write and for weeks he doesn't come up with anything worth keeping. Meanwhile, Alison just wonders around, exploring the area, shopping for food. Little by little, she immerses herself into the local culture, thanks mostly to her new local friend, Sera. Meanwhile, Oliver makes friends with an American expat, Rick. Life drags on, Oliver and Alison start having little squabbles here and there. Oliver seems to have found inspiration, which is mostly drawn from Alison and his life in the Solomons. Oliver has a feeling that Alison is going to leave him. Will she? Claire Varley's debut novel is very well written, funny at times and insightful. I loved that Ms Varley's painting of the Solomons is done without prejudice and at the same time there's no painting over with bright colours where there shouldn't be any. The character development is expertly done. Both protagonists are incredibly realistic, their struggles felt authentic, and many will probably identify. Even the title is extremely well chosen.Why I'm not giving this 5-stars? It's because I was kind of puzzled by these back stories for many of the transient and inconsequential characters: a cab driver, an aunt, a lady in a cafe etc. I really couldn't see the point. The only thing I could come up with was that the author wanted to show that everybody has a story, which is true, but still, I thought they were distracting and a bit annoying, especially once I'd realised I was never going to come across those characters again. Regardless, this is an impressive first novel, from a very talented writer. Looking forward to reading the next novel from Claire Varley.Recommended: To readers who enjoy realistic, finding yourself stories.Cover: 5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 19, 2015","Jul 21, 2015","Jul 19, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25568213-the-bit-in-between

I sort of 1-clicked it by accident, and since the book I was reading was not appealing and a bit tedious, I decided to give this one a try, thinking it would be a romance novel. I was intrigued from the very first page, but then, on the second page, I came across this:""Outside the window, broken and abandoned husks dotted the landscape, set against the gray, dishwater sky. Scarred and beaten, the perfect metaphor for the people who lived within its forgotten neighborhoods, Detroit was like an abused kid, just waiting for the day someone would come along and give a fuck about it. The third world city of America."" I had to go to back the beginning to check what book I was reading because, really, that was one beautiful, evocative paragraph. I am trying to do this book justice. There are plenty of aspects of this novel that are somewhat cliche: it's got the damaged, muscly, hunky, tattooed guy. His name is Nick. The main heroine is Aubree Cullin and she's, of course, hot and damaged. And you've got the expected sexual tension/conflict between the two, before the hot sex scenes ensue. And there's a lot of sex scenes, many were quite gritty, and I thought, at times, a bit over-the-top, but that's a matter of taste, I'm sure many will find them very hot.Another character in this novel is Alec Vaughn/Achilleus X, master hacker, an hacktivist. Nick and Alec have been conspiring for three years to bring down Michael Culling and his wife, Aubree, for having ordered Nick's wife and son killing. Nick ends up kidnapping Aubree. They fall for each other. Will they end up together? Will Nick get his revenge? This novel is dark. There's abuse, torture, extreme violence, rape, bad language etc. We're dealing with the most depraved and heartless. Even the main hero is very dark.I'm not going to say that this novel was perfect, as there were a few things that bugged me:- the young age of the protagonists: Nick is 28 and Aubree is 24. I found that disconcerting because that would have meant that Nick got married/had a child when he was 19-20 years old, and Aubree got married at 19? Speaking of ages, Aubree's husband was in his 30's but (view spoiler)[ he was a childhood friend of Aubree's, so they would have been closer in age, so it didn't make sense that he was so much older - just saying (hide spoiler)]. In my opinion, it would have been more credible if Nick was in his early thirties and Aubree in her late twenties. Also, for someone who didn't finish high school, Nick sounded very articulate. Regardless, this novel is not bad, I didn't even mind the first person narrative, with alternate POVs and lots of flashbacks, because they were well done. Honestly, this was unexpectedly well written and gripping and it kept my interest to the end. There were a few unexpected twists and turns that I didn't see coming so I enjoyed that very much. It's such a shame that Keri Lake doesn't write novels that'd be more up my alley, as I really don't care for paranormal, fantasy, shape-shifters, warevolves etc. Here's hoping that this novel will be followed by others that can be labelled as contemporary/women's fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jul 19, 2015","Jul 19, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25816447-ricochet

Total amnesia doesn't really happen and if it does, it doesn't last for too long unless there was major brain trauma, which would leave someone physically/mentally incapacitated. But I was willing to let that go, for the sake of being entertained. There's a lot of swearing in this novel, but it didn't bother me. But plot holes do bother me, so do inconsistencies and unrealistic scenarios. And this novel abounds in all of them. I didn't think much of King, our main hero, although, like most xx chromosome beings, I was looking for redeemable, likeable characteristics. True, I do not like bad guys, and I can't stand tattoos, so even his physical appearance wasn't that enticing to me. But no problem there, I'm more interested in character development. I really am! :-) The fact that he's attracted to someone who was emaciated and looked underage just speaks volumes of what a creep he was. And the way he was talking to and about women, that didn't agree with me. And I thought it was ironic since he was the father of a little girl, whom he claimed to love.The author threw in some titbits that were supposed to make us like and understand him: bad upbringing, his willingness to get his daughter back no matter what; he's even got a bachelor's degree; apparently he's a great friend and few other bits and pieces. So all those things should really make us like him, no matter that he left his mum burn to death, no matter that he killed people, not to mention the drugs and the guns. But hey, he was a hunk, so that makes everything OK. Right? As for the main heroine, Doe, she's amnesiac, and full of contradictions. She left the foster house because of perverts, but then she's willing to sleep with bikers for food and shelter. Yeah, that makes sense.There were too many things that didn't add up and a couple of really strange scenes that didn't make sense and were unresolved.The editing, if there was any, was subpar. For instance conscious and consciousness are not the same thing. ""... I could get back to the thing that used to be important to me without this lingering sense of dread looming in my conscious"". Conscious is an adjective, not a noun. Fortunately, this wasn't the worst book I've read when it comes to grammar mistakes and typos. With better editing, this novel could have been better.

She articulates things much better than I ever could: https://iamreadingthereforeiam.wordpr... _____________________________I've just finished reading this novel. I don't want to dwell on it for too long, I want to move on quickly, preferably onto something light, fluffy and optimistic as this was, as you all well know, depressing.Right, where do I start?I had very high expectations from A Little Life, given the praises of so many here on GR and in the literary world. Many called it ""the book of the year"", some even said ""the book of the decade"". So, I thought it must be an astounding piece of literature.I wasn't impressed. I'll try to articulate it here, mostly trying to make sense to myself, why it didn't work for me. Advanced apologies for the blabbering.  Spoiler Alert: the  contains spoilers. The beginning:""The Eleventh apartment had only one closet, but it did have a sliding glass door that opened onto a small balcony, from which he could see a man sitting across the way, outdoors in only a T-shirt and shorts even though it was October, smoking. Willem held up a hand in greeting to him, but the man didn't wave back.""I had to re-read this to make sure I didn't skip any words. That didn't make for a favourable first impression, but I thought, don't be hasty, there are 700+ pages to come. So I continued, anticipating enlightenment, passion, awe and literary mastery.Well, I struggled with the first 20%+, as the characters' introduction was tedious, and it took me a while to get used to the names and who was who. As I progressed, it got marginally better and better. But it was still in the realm of ""it's OK, but something's missing; where's the literary masterpiece""?The novel is about four men, who become close friends in college: Willem, JB, Malcolm and Jude. Relatively early on we realise that Jude St Francis is the sun and his friends are like planets who orbit around him, some closer than others. Slowly, we learn a little more about Jude. Everybody loves Jude, but I struggled understanding why they cared so much. Men, especially young men, (I apologise for the generalisation), mostly care about sex and power. Given that there was no sex involved and that Jude was not particularly useful to anyone - the blind devotion and friendship didn't quite make sense. Especially, when there was no meeting of souls, there were no shared confidences, as Jude's completely secretive about his past. Yet, his friends just let him keep quiet, never ask him any questions? Incredulous! Another aspect that puzzled/irritated me was Jude's reluctance to take pain medication, in spite of his ""episodes"" that left him incapacitated and very embarrassed. Then, there is Andy, an orthopaedic surgeon, who becomes his doctor, practically at his beck and call. That was one of the most unrealistic relationships. Andy had a family of his own, yet he seemed to barely sleep, always trying to help Jude, always concerned about him, always treating him for a multitude of ailments. I thought to myself, surely, he must be in love with Jude. But no, he was just being a good doctor and friend. I'm no expert, but I know doctors have strict rules and regulations, where they need to report certain things.And poor Jude just doesn’t get a break. He’s surrounded by wonderful people, all very giving, all caring for him. Yet he still can’t talk about what had happened to him. I can (try to) understand why he wouldn't tell his closest friends or his wonderful adoptive parents about his past, but not speaking with a psychologist/psychiatrist, not doing anything to try to get better was too fatalist, too selfish, I thought quite incomprehensible. For somebody who was supposed to be so extraordinary smart, he sure was the biggest idiot. There! I've said it. I had issues reconciling the hours he was putting into work with any social life what-so-ever, no matter how minuscule. Especially given the multitude of health issues.Look, I didn’t hate Jude. But I don’t know, he was a caricature of misery. I don’t quite know how to put it into words. While reading A Little Life, I felt like a voyeur, looking from outside in, without getting too involved, even though my heart should have been broken, which it was, in a cerebral and perplexed way, but not a visceral one. I guess my main problem with this novel was that Jude’s relationships were not believable. Call me a cynic. Most situations were not believable. A Franciscan monastery of men given a baby to look after? Oh, I didn't realise the book was taking place in the 18th century or earlier. Also, there is no way in hell he could be so proficient/masterful at so many things, especially when he'd been abandoned and abused at a very young age. Those things happening in early childhood tend to mess up one's brain neurodevelopment, one would be lucky to be average. (plenty of scientific lit on it, read it, if you don't believe me). The writing wasn't terrible, it wasn't exceptional either, as little is shown, most is told to us. Again and again. I didn't underline any paragraphs. Given its length, it didn't take me long to finish it, so I guess it had a relatively good flow, although many parts were boring, repetitive and at times I was screaming in my head ""can we get on with it""? This novel could have been tighter by getting rid of 100 pages or more, but its length wasn't the biggest problem. So, while I appreciate the hard work Yanagihara must have put into writing this novel and while I really wanted to like it, I just didn't connect with the characters, I found them cartoonish and there was no character growth. Some sort of redemption, even some revenge would have made this novel a little better.Also - nitpicking here - I found it extremely disappointing that given his profession and affluence, Jude never really did anything to help kids in a similar situation with his. Even if it was from a distance, he could have done more, much more. Had Yanagihara been more restrained when dishing out the tragedies and/or the virtues, the novel would have been so much more potent, as it would have been more credible. All that misery bestowed upon poor Jude made me think of some of the worst new adult novels I was reading a year + ago. I expect more from literary fiction....more",Notes are private!,2,92,1,"Oct 19, 2015","Oct 27, 2015","Jul 12, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22822858-a-little-life

This novel was filed under Women's Fiction/ Literary Fiction category in Netgalley, but it's a mystery/thriller. The main protagonist is Casey Edwards, who's spent 10 years locked up in a mental institution. She's got a usual case of total amnesia. One comes across amnesia in soap operas and books relatively often, as it adds to the drama. But the thing is, amnesia, especially total amnesia is extremely rare. So I had to work on suspending my disbelief.Since I haven't read many books in this genre, it's a bit difficult to compare and contrast. It was an easy read, that got better after the 10%. The writing was simple and the pace was fast, at times dizzying, with multiple narrators in play. There are lots of flashbacks and dreams, which I guess it was to be expected given Casey's amnesia.Things were quite twisted, but nevertheless it was relatively easy to guess who'd done it. I'm sure many readers of the genre will find this novel quite good.

Vân Uoc Phan is the Australian-born daughter of Vietnamese refugees. They're poor and live in a government-owned, high rise apartment in Melbourne, Australia.Vân Uoc Phan, whose name means Cloudwish, has a scholarship at a prestigious, private high-school, where she makes herself inconspicuous as to not attract the unwanted attention of the rich, mean kids. She's a top student, excellent oboe player and a wanna-be artist, despite her parents' wishes that she'd become a successful/rich lawyer or doctor. From a distance, and in spite of her better judgment, she fancies Billy, top alpha, good looking male specimen, who's on the school's prestigious rowing team. She knows he's arrogant and a bit of a bully, but she's also seen a better side of him. She daydreams/wishes that Billy would fancy her and suddenly, out of nowhere, he starts falling for her, which she finds disconcerting. I thought Fiona Wood did a wonderful job describing Vân Uoc's struggles to fit in, while staying true to herself. But who was she? She felt caught in the middle between her Australian-ess and her Vietnamese heritage.I loved that Fiona Wood brought forward a very relevant and current issue/situation - that of refugees and of what is abysmally called by our disgraceful government, boat people. Reading about Vân Uoc's situation and especially about her parents' horrific story was heartbreaking.This was a very well written, enjoyable, yet compelling novel, that's got teenage angst relating to fitting in, achieving, making decisions and first love. On top of that, there are a few extra layers about class, about opportunities, about immigrants'/refugees' issues and about post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). And I couldn't help but love all the many Jane Eyre references and the fact that Vân Uoc considered her a role model of sorts.I received this novel via Netgalley.

I enjoyed this new installment in the Hearts Series, I finished it in one day.CharactersI liked our heroine, Alexis, she was spontaneous and didn't mix her words. She's a working-class girl who's got a job in the City, working for the stiffs of the financial world. I approved ;-) of her opinions on the banking/financial system as they pretty much match mine. Of course, our hero, Oliver King (love the name) is hot, smart and a nice boss, which made for a nice change, as in the majority of the romance novels the hot bosses are always grumpy and overbearing. And he kind of lacks tact, especially when it comes to Alexis.LH Cosway's writing is fluid and well paced. She does first person narrations very well. For me, the best part about Ms. Cosway's books is that her characters, especially the female ones, are a bit different, not cookie cutter beautiful and most importantly, they usually have sparkling personalities. In saying all the above, I did have a few little grumbles that nagged at me from time to time:- I've never been to Rome, but I'm pretty sure there are no beaches within walking distance. - I didn't find it believable that a skilled professional like King would make comments on Alexis' appearance in the interview, especially when others were present.- I doubt that somebody as busy and important as King would have both assistants go for lunch at the same time. From experience, that doesn't really happen.- the modelling session, while cute and all, again, I had trouble believing that someone of his standing would allow photos of him, with his PA!, be published. In the business world where appearance is everything, somebody as driven as King, who wanted everyone's approval, would not be so silly. Just saying.- I did struggle a lot with Oliver's disappearance and I thought it was out of character and not very believable that he wouldn't have heard that his mum was still alive and that he didn't kill his father like he assumed. Surely, given the high profile of all involved, that would have been in the news? So, yeah, while I appreciate that we needed the drama, that aspect of the book, didn't sit well with me. I struggled to believe it.But in saying all the above, I still enjoyed this novel. I thought it was better than the previous ""Hearts of Fire"", but my favourite in the series is still ""Six of Hearts"". Will I be reading the next book in the series?

It's got all the ingredients that usually work on/for me: a precocious child, family problems, older people, a refugee, unexpected acts of kindness and it's even written in the third person. In many ways, it's very similar to one of my favourite books-  My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry by Fredrik Backman. But I didn't like it as much as the one mentioned above. Milo, our protagonist, is 9 years-old and he suffers from a degenerative eye disease, that will eventually render him blind.He's a bit of a loner; he lives with his unhappy, recently separated mum, and his father's 92-year-old grandmother, whom Milo loves dearly, but who's not easy to look after. After a fire incident, Sandy, Milo's mum decides to put Gran into a nursing home.  Things start to unravel from them on, as Milo misses his Gran very much and is determined to bring her back home. His eyesight may be diminishing, but he's very good at noticing things that most people don't. And he notices that things weren't quite as they seemed at Forget Me Not - the nursery home where Gran was living. Will Milo be able to get Gran back home? I thought the writing was strong and very competent. The narration alternates between Milo, who's the main storyteller and Gran, Milo's mum, Sandy and Tripi, the Syrian refugee cook at Forget Me Not.In my opinion, Sandy and Gran's POVs didn't add too much to the story and weren't terribly insightful. I think, if taken out, the pace of the story would have been a bit better, as at times, it felt a bit sluggish. A couple of times I did think that Milo sounded way too grown-up. I also had a bit of an issue with the pet pig, as I didn't find it very believable that Milo would be able to get away with hiding it under his coat without anyone noticing at the nursing home. Also, he leaves Hamlet, the pig, with Gran and for a couple of days nobody notices anything? A bit hard to believe. How about its bodily functions? How about food, don't they eat a lot? Hamlet sounded more like a cat. It's probably just me, I'm sure many won't have any issues with the pet pig.While visiting Gran, Milo meets Tripi, the cook. A friendship of sorts ensues. Other secondary characters come on board, one of them being Al/Clouds, a relative from Scotland, who's an undercover journalist and who's paying rent to live in Gran's room in Milo and his mum's place.Things get worse before they get better.This is a good novel.Many will find it heart-warming and emotional. But that's just the thing. Given the plot and the characters, I should have been an emotional wreck, because it really had themes that really tug at my heartstrings, but ""What Milo Saw"" didn't quite manage to do that.Nevertheless, it's still a 3.5 - 4 stars novel. Looking forward to seeing other readers' opinion.Recommended: If you liked  My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry and if you like feel good stories with precocious kids.Cover: 5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 06, 2015","Jul 09, 2015","Jul 06, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25434787-what-milo-saw

Ruby, a seventy-eight-year-old and her granddaughter, Tulsa (grr, the name), twenty-seven, live by the river and run a business renting out canoes and a few chalets. Their business is struggling. But somehow the bank is lending them six hundred thousand to buy a neighbour’s property. Right, it's fiction. The new loan puts even more pressure on them to get enough clients in order to make repayments. Tulsa is feeling stressed. Despite her grandmother’s pestering, she’s got no time or disposition for romance. Besides, she still remembers her now deceased mom’s heartbreak following the breakup of several relationships.This novel is not just about Tulsa and her grandmother. Pearl, Ruby’s friend, is a deeply religious widow, who struggles to accept her grandson's homosexuality. Then here's BJ, who used to be Tulsa's mum’s best friend when they were young. Her son, Guy, is now working with Ruby and Tulsa and is thought to be Tulsa's half brother.And Jen, Tulsa’s friend, a twenty-nine-year-old manicurist, who has dreams of getting married and starting a family with her boyfriend.We get to learn about each character in separate chapters. All the women come together to a romance novel book club initiated by Ruby. Somehow, the romance novels the women are reading propel them to make changes with their lives or look at things differently.There was one line in this novel that I highlighted; when BJ, a hypochondriac, sees the doctor yet again, he recommends her to get a life and find a man. Astonished by the suggestion, she says: “Jesus loves me.” The doctor’s reply: “Jesus loves everybody, …, you need someone less promiscuous.” Reading the Sweet Oak is a charming, well-written novel, with endearing female characters of different ages and backgrounds, who grow and change, as the novel comes to its conclusion. 3.5 starsCover: 4 starsI've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest .

Sure, this is not a novel you like and I dare say want to re-read, but was it a good one?First of all, a warning: it's gruesome! The violence is astonishing. There is lots of it but because of the way it was presented, it sort of became cartoonish, and I felt somewhat desensitised or rather not as affected by it as I would normally be. It takes a lot for me to become desensitised to violence, as I avoid consuming it via the media.All Involved is written in the first person, from many different perspectives, the majority of them, Latino gang members. The Los Angeles riots of the 1992 serve as the background for the gangland wars that ensue, following the brutal killing of a civilian young man, Ernesto, the sibling of two members of one of the Latino gangs. To be honest, the first chapter discombobulated me, because here we had Ernesto, rambling on about his job and dreams and as he was walking home and then we read his report of the violence that he himself is subjected to. And then, bam, he dies. I didn't see that coming, the death of a narrator that is. Ernesto is killed. We move on, to another character's narration, and that's Lupe, aka Payasa, Ernesto's sister, who finds out about Ernesto's demise. So, revenge and retaliation are planned while Ernesto's body is left in an alley for the police to find. Except that police and other authorities are too busy with the riots.And on and on it goes. More characters, more violence.Look, the narrative structure was unusual, given the many first person POVs.Many a times I found myself thinking that it didn't sound genuine, that no Latino gangster would sound/think like that. I know, it's silly and presumptuous of me to think like that, given that I'm your stereotypical middle-class white woman, who has never had any encounters or known any gang members, not to mention that I live in Australia. But without knowing anything about the author and his background, I just felt like here we have yet another white person trying to give voice to a person diametrically different to his background and race. What I'm trying to say is that I just didn't connect and didn't sympathize at all with any of the characters because they didn't feel authentic. Sure, Ryan Gattis threw in some swearing and some Spanish words, but I was still not sold on the authenticity front. I thought ""All Involved"" was more of a voyeuristic exercise in gang violence, without much depth. Ryan Gattis missed the mark when it came to creating fully developed characters, who would lead us to some sort of thoughtful analysis on the society, on race relations, gangs, and even the riots, especially when the blurb is putting the LA riots front and center.Recommended: Sure. It's an interesting novel, albeit extremely violent.Cover(s): 4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 29, 2015","Jul 31, 2015","Jun 27, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22756871-all-involved

This novel is about women; it's about sisters and sisterhood. Our protagonists are four very different women, who come together after one of them had placed an ad in the local book store's newsletter. What makes them similar is the loneliness and the search for something else, for more. There were many good things about this novel. I liked that the women were very different, in age, occupations and backgrounds. I liked that none of them was perfect. I liked that it wasn't overly sugary and that there was conflict. And I loved it that they overcome the misunderstandings and resentment to stay friends.Regardless, at times I felt disconnected, like I was looking in from the outside. I didn't care much for the first person alternate povs of each of the ladies. Occasionally, I thought I was reading somebody's pov, but few paragraphs in, I'd realise it was somebody else's. I hope that's just the case for the draft version I received, and that more obvious delineations between the different characters' narratives will be introduced for the published work. Each of the main chapters starts with the name of the each of the women and a novel next to it. Which I thought it peculiar, since there are no other references to those books. So that was kind of pointless, because there's no way someone would have read or heard of all those novels, especially since they're all contemporaries. I love stories about women, women's issues, about women coming together and sticking to each other through thick and thin. But although this novel was about all that, I didn't connect emotionally with any of the characters. So for that reason, I'm giving it 3.5 stars.Cover: 4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 23, 2015","Jul 25, 2015","Jun 27, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25559694-the-sisters-club

This was quite a gripping page turner. To be honest, I hadn't paid attention to the blurb, so it sort of took me by surprise. In a nice way. Especially given that it was a psychological suspense-thriller, which is not something I indulge in very often.The Mistake I Made is very well written. It's tight, without any unnecessary flourishes. While I've confessed I'm not the biggest fan of the first person narratives, in this case, it was necessary and very well done. This way, we got to understand our heroine better. Roz is very relatable; she's an average single mother, who struggles to pay her debts, in spite of working hard as a physiotherapist. Speaking of her profession, I appreciated learning a few things about the body from the physiotherapist's point of view.I thought it was quite accurate and detailed. It turns out Ms Daly had worked as a physiotherapist. Talk about writing about what you know. But do not worry, it's not a physiotherapy manual and it's not going to drown you in too much jargon. I noticed it and wanted to mention it. Moving on. What I enjoyed the most about this novel was the psychological aspects and the character development. Also the tone was quite different. It felt as if you were having a candid, straight forward conversation with someone close, while being empathetic but also somewhat detached. I can't quite articulate it.I liked Roz. She wasn't perfect, but she wasn't the worst person either. Just like most of us. I'm sure many people will have issues with the infidelity/prostitution in this novel. It wasn't the case for me. After all it's an important part of the plot. Actions have consequences. And Roz sure gets to pay for her actions. Luckily, it's not all gloom and doom. There's redemption and hope.While I don't have much to compare it against, as I rarely read this genre, I enjoyed reading this novel and I thought it was very well written and edited.Recommended: To the lovers of suspense, thriller with great psychological insights.Cover: 4 stars  ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Jul 2015,"Jul 04, 2015","Jun 27, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25110726-the-mistake-i-made

Thanks to the publishers, Bookouture, for the opportunity to read and . Here's my honest . This is a novel about family and connections to both people and places. It's a relatively slow paced novel, but it suits the occasion and the relaxed beach feel of a summer holiday. The narrator is our protagonist, Faith, who's a bit unsettled and sad about the strain of her relationship with her sister, Casey. But their grandmother's upcoming 90's birthday brings them back together, back to the beach where they spent many wonderful summers. Now all the women are together: Faith and her sister, Casey and her daughter, Isabella, their mother and their grandmother, who's about to turn 90.Faith meets Jake Buchanan, who was putting the final touches on the place they were renting. Jake is charming and kind and Faith feels an instant attraction and connection to him. I thought Jenny Hale did a great job articulating Faith's anguish and hurt in relation to her sister. Also, those initial ""butterflies"" of love were beautifully conveyed.While Faith was a very well developed character, the others could have done with a bit more polishing. At times, I thought things were a bit too convenient and slightly unlikely, although, I guess that's to be expected in a romance.But overall, it's an enjoyable novel, a perfect beach book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 25, 2015","Jun 27, 2015","Jun 25, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25744466-summer-by-the-sea

Ah, and he's a computer expert/hacker of the highest calibre.Ian begins giving cash furtively, after seeing Kate on TV making an appeal for donations. Kate is fascinated and wants to see who was the mysterious cash donor. And so they meet. Initially there's some animosity, as Ian is very cocky and forward. Kate is no push-over, though. Their attraction is very strong.Kate is falling for Ian, but can she be with someone who doesn't have boundaries when it comes to her privacy, but who wouldn't even tell her his last name? I absolutely loved the banter and teasing between the two protagonists.The writing was very smooth, the dialogues realistic. And.... it was written in the third person!!! Love that. Sure, both Kate and Ian were a bit too perfect, but hey, it's f i c t i o n, as much as I like realistic literature, sometimes one needs to indulge in something light, charming and totally removed from ones reality.Heart-Shaped Hack was the perfect escapist read!

I only heard of Baldwin a few years prior, viA few months ago, I was blown away by the documentary I Am Not Your Negro, which featured James Baldwin. I only heard of Baldwin a few years prior, via other GR friends' s of his books. I had his books on my TBR list, but they were there with six hundred other books ... Anyway, that documentary pushed me to seek some of his books. It didn't occur to me when watching the documentary that Baldwin was gay. The poor man, being black and gay, during a very reprehensible period in US history. Not only he had to fight against the white people, against the system because of his race, he had to hide and fight his own community's homophobia. No wonder he escaped to France for a while. Anyway, I had to remind myself that Giovanni's Room is not autobiographical, although it must have drawn inspiration from his personal experiences. I plan to read a bit more about Balwin and this novel.As I was reading Giovanni's Room I had to remind myself several times that the main character, David, an American in Paris, was a white man. David is in the closet and is ashamed by his one time encounter with a male friend. As the only child of a nice man, he feels it's his duty to be the ""right"" way. It's not only that, it's the 1950s and earlier, homosexuality is illegal. Paris though is more relaxed. While the cat was away, in this case, Hetta, David's fiancee, he has a dalliance with Giovanni, a beautiful and passionate Italian bartender, whom he met in a gay bar. The two have a passionate affair for a little while, even sharing Giovanni's small room. Giovanni's small, cluttered, dirty room is a metaphor of sorts for David's complex feelings, especially when he knows the time is approaching when he has to make a decision - to have a respectable life that includes a wife and kids or to give in to his preferences?It's important to remember that this was published in 1959. That's quite a feat in itself. The fact that it was written by a black man, way before the Civil movement, makes this novel even more significant.Baldwin's writing is beautifully lyrical and packaged tightly. You can sense the doubt and dread, the fear, the self-loathing. None of the male characters is likeable, that includes David himself.

Thanks to the Random House UK for the opportunity to read and . Sara from Sweden ends up in Broken Wheel, Iowa, after years of corresponding with Amy. Sara is a very plain twenty something year-old, who prefers books to people. This novel was slow churning, especially in the beginning. But that conveyed very well the slow pace of a half-dead town, and the despondent outlooks of our heroine and most people in Broken Wheel. On top of that, everyone is pretty sad about Amy's death, especially her handsome nephew, Tom.As you can guess from the title, the books are an integral part of this novel. Most books mentioned are familiar, popular titles. Most of titles are American, with a few Jane Austen and the Bronte Sisters thrown in. I personally would have liked to hear about some more Scandinavian authors, besides Stieg Larsson. Look, the book was a bit dull at times. I don't know if it was deliberate, but it was fitting. After all, Broken Wheel is a dying town. Its inhabitants don't have much to look forward to. There are no jobs, most young people had moved to bigger cities. Sara is a bit lost, with no one really carrying about her or vice-versa. All she's got are her books. Sara's arrival gives the good people of Broken Wheel something to talk about and something to do, because they want to make her feel welcome and maybe have her stay in town. The pace picks up once Sarah settles more and gets to know the people of Broken Wheel.This is an interesting novel, that talks about books and the importance of books. It's no The Shadows of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, but it was an easy and enjoyable read. More than about the books, it's a novel about small towns, about finding meaning and being able to connect. I liked it because of its different tone. Also, I liked that most people were ordinary and plain, none more so than our heroine. I find that stimulating, just because it was contrary to the established ""beautiful heroines"" that you find in most women's fiction novels.

I love how she comes up with plots that make you wonder what you would have done had you been in the same situation as some of the characters. The moral conundrums abound.

And her little bit of sass was very unconvincing. There are quite a few situations that felt contrived or over-the-top and I found myself rolling my eyes on many occasions or simply not caring one way or another. The book suffers from some sort of double personality, as towards the end in changes and becomes over-the-top dramatic. And the ending is very sudden and there is a dreadful cliffhanger.

He's overweight, divorced with no children, no job, no place to live and no friends who want to hear from him. There's nothing worth living for, so he decides to kill himself. But that's yet another thing to add to his long list of failures and disappointments, as he wakes up in a hospital. While in hospital, he realises that he could do something useful for once by donating a kidney. So he embarks on a quest to doing just that. Things sort of line-up for Sully, as he finds a flat to live in, in exchange for looking after an old dog, whose owner had passed away. The deceased's daughter, Natalie, is happy to have someone to look after the dog, while she arranges for the apartment to be sold and someone to look after the dog.It turns out that becoming a donor is not easy, and Sully has to have psychological assessments and a multitude of medical tests before a committee decides if he's fit to donate. While going through the process of becoming a donor, Sully starts a new life, because he's got a purpose. We get to meet different characters: Natalie, a 35 year old radio producer, who's a divorced mother of an 8 year old boy and living with her overbearing mother. Tim, Sully's childhood friend, is a very rich and successful banker, whose marriage is on the rocks. The other more secondary characters are well drawn and they all have a role to play in Sully's story.This was a well written book, where all characters are everyday people, not exceptional but not ordinary either - people we all know. Everybody's got a story. Also, nobody's life is really what they hoped it would be. People do and say shitty things. But most people need to be heard, seen and need to find a purpose in life. I didn't find this book humorous in any way, which doesn't mean that it wasn't a good book. I liked that most of the characters were flawed, especially Sullivan. Thank goodness most things work out, and that Sully redeems himself, because otherwise I would have been a bit depressed. But don't let that put you off reading it, because it's a good novel.Recommended: Sure.Cover:: 4+ stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 07, 2015","Jun 08, 2015","Jun 07, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23984348-useful

The writing is simple but has a beautiful flow. The main characters, Laurent and Laure, are well drawn and interesting. It was refreshing to read a romantic book with middle-aged protagonists. The plot was lovely and romantic, in a realistic way.As you can imagine, since the male protagonist owns a bookshop, books and authors make an appearance. C'est incroyable!

It would make for a great script for a cute chick-flick (preferably in French).I'll be making sure to read Antoine Laurain's other novel.If you're after something light and romantic, but not stupid, sweet but not saccharin(ny), the Red Notebook is the perfect novel.I've received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest .

I only requested it on NetGalley because I liked the cover and this one was also under the Women’s Fiction/Literature category so I thought why not. Many thanks to Atria Books for providing this ARC. So I came to read this book without having any preconceptions or expectations, as I hadn’t heard of Fredrik Backman or his previous novel. And how I love it when I am pleasantly surprised! The title alone is quirky and different. I’m pretty sure it’s one of the longest novel titles I’ve ever come across.“Every seven-year-old deserves a superhero. That’s just how it is. Anyone who doesn’t agree needs their head examined.” I was hooked. Almost instantly. And it only got better and better after that.The story is told in the third person (and how I love this!), from the precocious Elsa's perspective. She loves words, correct spelling, and “she knows she’s different”. Also, she’s a very lonely girl, whose only friend is her seventy-seven-year-old maternal grandmother. Her unorthodox, politically incorrect, retired doctor grandmother likes to smoke indoors and to cause mischief at every opportunity. They both adore each other. Grandma encourages Elsa to stay different. At night, she tells Elsa stories, in the Land of Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas, where everybody is different and nobody is normal.Unfortunately, grandma dies. She leaves Elsa a quest of sorts: delivering letters to different people to say sorry for past grievances. And this is how Elsa gets to know all her neighbours and she also learns some valuable lessons. I don’t want to say too much because of spoilers. You should really read it for yourself. It’s magical, quirky, funny, charming and very well written. I loved the tone of the narration, the mystical fairytales intermingling with reality. Elsa’s observations are just precious, candid and wonderfully endearing. Certain parts of the novel made me think of the French movie, Amelie, and also of another marvellous book, Sophie’s World, written by the Norwegian, Jostein Gaarder. I can only imagine how amazing the Swedish version must be, but kudos to the translator, Henning Koch, for doing such a great job.I loved so many things about this novel. There’s so much one can draw from it. But ultimately, it’s about daring to be different, about being seen and heard, about love, redemption, and forgiveness. It’s also about the importance of grandparents. I had a wonderful grandmother, who was a bit unusual.And because I love this book so much, I am going to buy the paperback, as this is a book that I want to re-read and give special friends. I believe in gifting good books. This one is definitely in the ""great books"" category. Recommended: ABSOLUTELY!!!! If you’ve had a special grandparent; if you like whimsy; if you like smart and most importantly, different, than this book is for you.

Disgrace was quite a challenging read, not because of the writing, which was excellent, but because of its content.Arguably, it wasn't the best time to read this kind of novel. This is a complex novel about post-Apartheid South Africa, where things are changing at a fast pace. This is about race relations, about men and women, fathers and daughters, about city vs country and so much more.Professor David Laurie is fifty-two, twice divorced. His dalliance with a twenty-year-old is his professional undoing, as he is fired from the University. He takes refuge on his daughter's farm, in the East Cape region.I disliked Laurie a great deal. He's an intellectual with no depth, no self-awareness, a misogynist, who sees women exclusively as sex objects. And doesn't he go on and on about women's appearance, the entitled white, swine man. Because a woman's beauty does not belong to her alone. It is a part of the bounty she brings into the world. She has a duty to share it.  I found myself saying ""FU, Professor"" many times and wishing all kinds of misfortunes come upon him. And they did come. Some horrendous things happen to him and his daughter. His relationship with his daughter is tenuous and strange. He doesn't really know her. He's such a shallow man, he couldn't even see his own daughter past her looks. FU, Professor.He did try to help her once they went through the horrific event, but it wasn't easy, as Lucy is stubborn and unrelenting - to be honest, her choices didn't make sense to me in any way, I couldn't find any logical justification to her action or inaction, as it may be. Let's just say that she lacked that primal instinct that makes one run away from danger.There is so much to unpack and analyse. The fact that Coetzee managed to fit so much in such a short novel is quite the accomplishment. It sure made my blood boil at times, so I guess that makes it a good novel, even though my reactions were unpleasant and uncomfortable for the most part....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Jun 09, 2018","Jun 18, 2018","Jun 01, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25618722-disgrace

He's just on another level, isn't he? Deeply observant, realistic, and interesting, his writing is sublime. Fiona Maye is an almost sixty-year-old High Court Family Judge. She's well suited for the position: she's intelligent, pragmatic, patient and calm. When her husband of twenty-something years decides he needs a break to have a new sexual encounter with a twenty-something-year-old, Fiona finds herself experiencing a variety of feelings: shock, incredulity, distress, anger and so on. McEwan masterfully unpeels Fiona's quandaries. As if her personal life being in turmoil wasn't enough, she's supposed to give a judgment in a rather tricky case, where an almost eighteen-year-old boy and his parents, devout Jehovah Witnesses refuse blood transfusion which is absolutely necessary in order to have a chance to cure his leukemia.Besides this more important case and its consequences, McEwan introduces a few other cases, with different degrees of detail. Occasionally, I got a bit bored and I thought they were excessive and could have been cut without affecting the story. Regardless of the above-mentioned grumble, The Children Act was compelling, sophisticated, and awfully realistic.4.5 starsAUDIOBOOK: Excellent audiobook, narrated by Lindsay Duncan...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"May 03, 2017","May 05, 2017","Jun 01, 2015",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/23686229-the-children-act

First of all, I can't get my head around this being a debut novel. I was captivated from the first paragraph. The writing has such a beautiful flow, the descriptions are so vivid. The third person narration is used masterfully, there are no unreliable narrators, we get to know the inner thoughts, feelings and history of most characters.Our main hero, Tom Sherbourne, is an actual World War I hero. Like most men who have returned from the war, he's struggling with living and not letting his demons consume him. So he focuses on living simply, day by day. He'd rather be by himself, which makes becoming a lighthouse keeper the perfect occupation for him. When he gets to travel all the way to the South West of Australia, he meets a beautiful and very lively young woman, Isabel Graysmark. She takes a liking to him, and he's fascinated with her, and can't quite comprehend that someone like her would be interested in him. Isabel knows what she wants: she wants to marry Tom and have a big family. She's never been on Janus Island where Tom is a lightkeeper, but she's not afraid to live life in isolation. Unfortunately, the poor Isabel suffers three miscarriages. She's absolutely distraught about it. One day, a boat with a dead man and a crying baby drifts onshore the island. Isabel takes to looking after the baby, while Tom buries the man. She's besotted with the little, sweet baby girl. She persuades Tom not to report it and raise the baby as their own. The baby enriches their life and gets under Tom's skin, melting his cold and broken heart. (view spoiler)[But when they find out that the baby's mother is still alive and looking for Lucy, Tom grapples with their decision. His conscience tells him to rectify their wrong, but Isabel won't hear about it.A few years go by. Eventually, Tom and Isabel are apprehended and Lucy returned to her biological mother. (hide spoiler)]There is so much angst, and pain, and worries and most people involved are suffering. The situation is dreadful for all concerned. At times, it's absolutely heartwrenching. M.L. Stedman crafted such a beautiful novel, which, I dare say, will become a classic. The writing, the plot, the characters are exquisite. The setting enhances the sense of loneliness, doom and gives the decisions a different weight.Tom Sherbourne is one of the most wholesome male characters ever created. Even his name sounds wholesome.

And so unique. For starters, the protagonist is a man who's almost 60 years old; he's quite unlikable. He's one of those grumpy old men, that we've all encountered. He's taciturn, abrupt, very strict when it comes to rules and regulations. But he's actually a very modest man, a hard worker, a man of few words, a man who's always done what's right. He was a devoted husband to the love of his life, Sonja, but now he's a widower. And he's kind of had enough of living. I love Fredrick Backman's writing. It's succinct, without many flourishes yet it does the job. Backman is a masterful user of the third person narration. As for his characters, many of them are unique and imperfectly quirky.Backman is a fantastic storyteller, with a keen understanding of the human condition. He believes in inter-connectivity and community, he believes in family, in whatever forms it may come. You can tell that Backman has a high regard for people past their prime. I dig that. Big time! 'A Man Called Ove' is a splendid novel. It's poignant, heart-warming and compelling.

It deals with themes that are a bit uncomfortable for many of us - adultery. But we all know it happens. I thought it was a well-written book. Both protagonists, the 37 year-old General Practitioner (GP) Mel and the 28 year old physiotherapist, Matt, alternate telling their story. It's a story about insta-lust, that quickly becomes love. Mel and Matt feel like they're soul-mates. But, life is complicated: Mel has been married for 14 years to a very nice man and has two teenage kids. Matt is engaged to get married. Add to this the age difference and living thousands of kilometres apart, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster. They both become obsessed with each other. So Matt breaks up his engagement and travels to Perth to track Mel down. What ensues is a passionate encounter over 6 days. But Mel is torn between family and intense, passionate love. The author is very good at conveying her anguish and desperation.I don't want to say more because of spoilers.But I will say that this novel is different and that the ending is unpredictable, but I thought that made the novel even more realistic. Looking forward to reading the next Tess Woods novel.

I think this was the first ""Australian outback"" book I've ever read. To be honest, I didn't think I'd like it, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a feel-good, heartwarming story, set in the central New South Whales, Australia. The male protagonist, Ewan Mackenzie, is a hard-working man, who's trying to save his farm and help his brother's widow, Trish, and her two twin boys. He thinks he's undeserving of love because he feels guilt over his brother's untimely death. But a beautiful American girl, Kree, shows up in their part of their world, as Ewan and other locals are looking for her brother who got lost in the bush. They're both attracted to each other, but for different reasons, they try to deny it. But life comes full circle.Alissa Callen writes well and the novel had a good flow and it's an easy read. The characters are interesting and believable. In saying all that, the plot and the ending were predictable or shall I say a bit too in the end, everything fits together perfectly , but I guess that goes with with the genre. Recommended: For those who enjoy a feel-good rural story that is un-challenging and has a HEA ending.Cover: 3+ stars...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 25, 2015","May 27, 2015","May 25, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24916833-down-outback-roads

I read the blurb and thought: this is right up my alley. I like realistic contemporary fiction about women and women's issues. I have very mixed feelings about this novel. I have no idea how to rate it.The writing wasn't terrible. But it felt like reading a journal, or better said, a calendar, filled with the everyday mundanities, without much introspection or charm. Of course, that felt very realistic, and I could empathise, but it just felt dry. I found myself getting bored and reading the novel felt like work. It was just like having someone tell you every detail of one of their day, which is very similar to yours. And when you think your own life is not that interesting or exceptional, why would you want to hear about the minutiae of their day.So I don't know, maybe there was a case of too much realism and not enough escapism?I should have loved this book, but while I didn't hate it, it didn't grab me as much as it should have, in spite of its relatability.Recommended: To those who want to read something very realistic and very relatable.

The main protagonist, Shawn, is a 24 year old IT programmer, who's got high functioning Autism. He dreams of getting married and wants somebody to look after him when his grandma passes away. He tries online dating, but his social awkwardness, unfiltered observations don't do well with the ladies. I won't describe the book any further, as you can read the blurb. What I will say is that it's a very easy read, but very enjoyable. Shawn is an endearing character, his innocence, inexperience and awkwardness are amusing and heart warming. This is a book about redemption and love. And a great reminder that behind every prostitute, there is a lost person, who's abused, sold, demeaned and who's trapped. I commend the author for donating part of the proceeds to charities that fight against human trafficking. So go buy the book!

Thanks to Simon&Schuster for the opportunity to read and  Quicksand.This was an unusual novel, like nothing I’ve ever read before. I’m not even sure if I liked it or not. It’s the story of two unlikely friends: Liam, a failed writer and policeman and Aldo, a very unlucky man, who’s more of a criminal entrepreneur. They’ve been friends since highschool. Quicksand was an interesting read. On many occasions, I thought “this is brilliant”. There is a lot of humour, mostly dark. Aldo’s fast-paced quips are entertaining and depressing at the same time. He’s a master nihilist. True, life hasn’t been very kind to him. Unfortunately, on too many occasions I felt disengaged, and I had to concentrate to keep up either with some of Aldo’s never-ending musings or the very detailed and mundane descriptions of inconsequent life snippets, that were going nowhere in particular. I thought some of the chapters could have done with some polishing and, especially, condensing. There were lots of witty observations. I wish I’d highlighted some of them. ""I'm nobody's muse"" comes to mind.Quicksand was dazzling and very infuriating at the same time. It was humours and also depressing. It was fast paced but also slow churning. At times I loved it; sometimes I struggled.It’s obvious that Steve Tolz is a brilliant writer. I'm somewhat annoyed that I didn’t enjoy this novel more. It has so much potential but didn’t quite pull it off. I’m very intrigued by Steve Tolz’s writing. I can’t wait to read A Fraction of the Whole.

I've heard of it, I wanted to read it, so when I saw it on NetGalley I had to request it. The blurb sounded very interesting. The cover is absolutely gorgeous, IMHO. This was an impressive debut novel. Kudos to David Arnold for having the guts to write a teenage female character. Did he pull it off? I didn't think so. I thought the writing was pretty good; there were quite a few quotable phrases, which I forgot to highlight (ops). Then, there is the annoying 1st person narrative. And the flashbacks.And there's a road trip.I do like books about road trips. So why wasn't I totally charmed by this novel? Afterall, Mary Iris Mallone, aka MIM, is a witty, quirky, angsty sixteen-year-old girl, and I love those characteristics in a female character. The problem for me was that I just didn't find her believable. There is no way anyone, let alone a sixteen-year-old, talks/thinks like that. Nobody goes around making those kinds of observations that Mim expulses throughout the novel. I didn't connect with her at all. I had the same feelings about Beck, the guy she noticed on the Greyhound. He was too good to be true. He's only twenty-one, he's gorgeous, educated, kind hearted, principled, and totally in-tune with Mim. Mim wasn't totally in tune with herself, so I didn't find Beck credible, albeit, he was adorable and I usually dig books with nice male characters. Also, Mim's attachment to people she only just met seemed over-the-top. The interactions and few other situations seemed contrived and far-fetched.For all the novel's faults and inability to make me connect with the characters, I appreciated David Arnold writing skills and think this was a worthwhile novel to read. I am looking forward to reading his next novel because I think he's a talented writer. And I'm definitely going to look up a few of the artists he mentioned in Mosquitoland, such as Elliott Smith.Cover: 5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 18, 2015","Aug 20, 2015","May 21, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18718848-mosquitoland

Disclaimer: I haven't read a fairytale since I was 9 or 10; I don't usually read fantasy, I don't even read vampire books. But anyway, I decided to give this one a try. I was grabbed, charmed and mesmerised from the very first paragraph. Lots of ""holy shit"" and ""wow"" were going through my head (because I am ""articulate"" like that ;-) ) as I was reading my way through the story. Since I don't have much experience with fantasy, saying that I have never read anything like this before won't mean much. But holy shit, the writing is amazing! I can't remember reading anywhere such long phrases, so abundant in adjectives and metaphors. You would have to work hard to find simple, ordinary sentences that are not embellished with lots of descriptive language.Catherine M. Valente's command of the English language is just uncanny. The playfulness, the imagination and quirkiness are absolutely incredible!But, towards the 75-80% I found myself getting so drowned into the language, that I couldn't quite tell what the story was about. So I can't believe I am saying this, but could this be a case of too much of a good thing? I feel extremely guilty for saying this. Very guilty, indeed.I noticed that some people put it in the children books category. They must have/know some exceptional kids, because I can bet many adults would struggle with this book. But there are enough books out there that appeal to the lowest common denominator. This is exceptional! Catherine M Valente's writing is singular!And how I wish she wrote contemporary fiction that wasn't fantasy or scifi. I would devour such books. Regardless, her writing sets the bar really high. I bow in front of such talent! Just because it's not my ""cup of tea"", it doesn't mean that I can't appreciate Ms Valente's talent and craftsmanship.WOW!Recommended: To those who like fairytales, fantasy and beautiful prose.Cover:: 5 stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 19, 2015","May 21, 2015","May 19, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11869878-the-girl-who-ruled-fairyland---for-a-little-while

So here it goes:This is the first ARC I've ever received. I read the blurb and I thought the novel sounded interesting. But, there were so many things that bugged me. The insta-lust/love between Kira and Grant, for one. The dialogues are contrived and very un-natural. I've known autistic kids for some time now. I didn't buy it for one second how Jared, Kira's 4-5 year old autistic son, was expressing himself. Not even neurotypical (normal) kids act and talk like that. Not to mention that autistic kids hate change, don't warm to strangers quickly, but somehow Jared is just besotted with Grant, and later with his family, because what? In many respects, given the dialogues between Jared and his mum or Grant's family, he sounded like a perfectly reasonable 10 year old not a pre-school kid, definitely not like a partially non-verbal kid, who mostly used sign language to communicate. It really irritated me how Grant went on and on about how Kira was such a wonderful mother, after meeting her a couple of times, not to mention telling her to relax etc. I've rolled my eyes numerous times. And after several meetings, not even dates, he confesses he loves her. They hadn't even had sex yet. There's also a lot of unnecessary dialogue, a lot of telling the readers how to feel instead of showing. And how was Kira, a stay-at-home mum, able to pay for a house-keeper? Now to mention why would she need her? That just didn't make sense. There's a lot of repetition going on, for example we are told several times what ""sensory therapy"" is. I got it the first time.The character development is lacking. I felt completely disconnected and disinterested in the characters. I couldn't even create an image in my head of their appearance.To end on a positive side: I didn't find any grammar mistakes and the punctuation was pretty good.Recommended: I do not recommend 2 star books.

It was very well written, and I liked the few snippets of conversations from the Narcoleptics forum. Why a Narcoleptics' forum? Because the main character, Dominic Christy is one, and he's coming to turns with managing this sleeping disorder, with losing his beloved job as a traffic controller and also trying to get over a relationship break-up. He's living in with his cousin and family. Reluctantly, he takes on his counsin's suggestion to try alternative therapies. And so, he comes across the beautiful reflexologist, Liza Reece. He feels an instant attraction, but he's rudely refused when he asks her out to dinner. Their paths will cross again in this small village. And then, they become business competitors. Liza is fierce and stubborn and won't take any shit from men. And given her bad break-up,she swore off men. But she's very attracted to Dominic, who's not only handsome and smart, he seems to be around when she needs help. It was very interesting to get a greater insight into narcolepsy. I loved both main protagonists and the secondary ones. The story had a good plot, and everything that happened was plausible. A great contemporary romance read!

From the very begging, this book sort of reminded me of that Julia Roberts movie ""Dying Young"". The book was very predictable, what ""saved"" it for me was that in the end (view spoiler)[ Will, the male protagonist, follows through with his decision to end his life  (hide spoiler)].Speaking of the heroine, I wasn't quite sure what to make of her. I didn't look down on her for not knowing what she wanted in/from life, because let's face it, many people go through that, at least sometimes. Sure, there was some self-deprecating humour and some sarcasm, but I thought that she was a bit of a doormat, although she kept stating (she's the narrator) that she was outspoken, which was completely contradicted by her actions: sticking with her boyfriend, who was totally incompatible with her; still living with her parents and extended family etc. Hey, but she had a very quirky way of dressing, as in very colourful, very out-there, which again, contradicts another of her statements that after a particular bad experience, which I won't mention, she decided to dress in a way so no one found her attractive, or something like that. Well, she was standing out and attracting attention. But that's not important, these were just some of the things that bugged me.Of course, the fact that she's completely unqualified to look after a quadriplegic, but yet she gets the job, based on a very short interview where she didn't do very well, it's another one of those yeah right moments. And Will, the quadriplegic male protagonist, is a grump, as he is well entitled to be. And eventually, he warms up to her, based on what... I can't quite remember... Anyway, they become close. Feelings develop. He pushes her out of her ""comfort zone"" to ""live life"" etc.... He tells her she can do more with her life! He tells her what she can become! And she does it because the man said it! Where would us women be without the men telling us what to do and showing us ""the way""?And wouldn't you know it, there's a happy ending of sorts for the heroine. I gave this novel 3 stars because assisted suicide is an important issue worth talking about and definitely worth pondering about. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 23, 2015","Apr 23, 2015","Apr 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15507958-me-before-you

I am so glad I stuck with it, despite my recently acquired dislike of overly long novels.This novel was shortlisted for the 2008 Man Booker prize, which in itself should have brought it more notoriety, especially in Australia. A Fraction of the Whole is a mammoth of a book, on another level. It's highly intelligent, original, funny and deep, philosophical, irreverent, and still so relevant. My husband happened to hear some passages and he asked if I was listening to a politician's memoir. On another occasion, he laughed out loud when hearing a character's musings. It's that kind of novel, that changes pace, direction, one moment is deep or mundane, the next it comes up with a funny observation or some sort of witticism. I'm impressed with Toltz's ability to maintain such a high level for over five hundred pages. I won't lie, at times, in the first half, I felt like I was being slapped over the head with the incessant philosophical meanderings of Martin Dean. But that was exactly who he was - a man prone to analysis, over-thinking, over-reading. Some of his observations were mindblowing and highly quotable.The main characters of this novel are the two brothers, Martin and Terry Dean, Martin's son, Jasper Dean. We mainly hear Martin and Jasper's point of views. They're fascinating and completely bonkers. A Fraction of the Whole is mainly about families, the ties the bound us, make or break us.

I've seen4.5 Incredibly introspective stars   Not recommended for those who are looking to escape This was the first Nick Hornby book I've ever read. I've seen some of his films, and I enjoyed them a great deal! I thought this book was extraordinary!!! I would normally be quick to shout ""what does a man know about a woman"", ""how dare he write in the first person, from a woman's point of view"", but Hornby is spot on! He must be a very perceptive person. I loved the tone, the British sarcasm and wit of the liberal, middle class doctor, Katie Carr, who's trying to figure out how she's ended up in a loveless marriage, with an over-bearing, enraged husband, with kids who aren't too bad, but whom she sometimes doesn't like that much. Basically, she's having a mid-life crisis, where she doesn't know what's the point to anything, or if there is a point. She's having an affair, after twenty years in a monogamous relationship, but she's not very enthused or sees the point of that either.And then, things change. More exactly, her husband changes. There's a case of be careful what you wish for, when David, Katie's husband, becomes a very altruistic, mild, ""save the world"" type of person, who no longer finds everything and everyone aggravating and worth of his disdain. There is a case of better the devil you know, when Katie has to adapt to different changes, that take even more energy. There is a lot of doubt, some outbursts, confused kids thrown in the mix. Will Katie and David's marriage survive? Is surviving enough? But is giving up and walking away the answer? I suppose this book is not for everyone. While there are some funny moments, it's a very realistic, therefore dry and depressing account of a middle aged couple and their struggles. But it is extremely well written, it's very introspective and I suspect one could draw lots of conclusions from it.

It's a truthful exploration of relationships, of changing without knowing, of just losing the spark and finding yourself in a place, both spiritual and physical, and not really knowing how you got there. What happened? Who am I? Who's this stranger I share my life with? Is that it? Lots and lots of questions. I am certain that many women will relate, or understand, or just draw some life lessons or just conclusions. Or maybe not. It sure made me introspective (not sure I wanted to go that way, but anyway... ;-) )Initially, I found the writing style quite terse. Simple and to the point, without many embellishments. But, it really suited our depressed heroine, Gillian. It suited her personality and her mood. But then, as she tries new things and starts writing her true feelings in a blog, the writing has a new, very different flow, and it becomes quite poetic. There is an unexpected twist in the story , which I thought was very interesting ( although I'd guessed it - *pats herself on the back :-)).Why I didn't give this book 5 stars:- I didn't connect enough with the characters, I looked from outside in. But in conclusion, this is a novel worth your time. In this overabundant market of women's novels, where many times you feel like you've read that book before, it's quite nice coming across something that's fresh and different.

I got that he was gorgeous and had the most incredible blue eyes, but there wasn't much else. The book felt a bit like a soap-opera. At least the ending was kind of realistic, albeit sad.Conclusion: soap-opera book, everything bad happens to the main heroine, and the writing is average....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 08, 2015","Apr 09, 2015","Apr 08, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18158270-rainfall

But: it was way too long for the genre, or it felt like it was too long. And unfortunately, this is another book that is on the ""bad grammar, syntax and typos"" shelf. For this reason, I had to deduct 1 star. What I liked: Tate, the male protagonist was quite charming, although there was no way he was only 21 years old and had all those experiences he had mentioned (being engaged for a 1 year, having slept with lots of women etc etc) they just didn't add up. Also, for a Swedish guy, he sure wasn't using any Swedish terms of endearment, and he spoke like an American. It's true, most Scandinavian people speak good English, but still, a Swedish term of endearment, or an Swedish expression here and there would have been nice. As for Audrey, Tate's love interest, she was stupid and way too insecure for my liking. Again, it's incredulous that this book is so highly rated. It's so full of cliches, and grammar and syntax mistakes. I definitely won't be reading any books in the series. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Apr 06, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17504941-empty-net

My excitement and impatience made me ask the author if she’d give me an ARC, and incredibly enough, she sent me one! So here's the disclaimer: I received this ARC for an honest .I am not a writer, so I’m afraid my attempt at writing a  won’t be able to convey how truly wonderful this novel is. I know it doesn’t sound very elegant, but I practically inhaled Give Me Your Answer True. I resented the everyday stuff that stopped me from reading it. I remember having a similar experience when I was reading The Man I Love.But that’s the thing about Suanne Laquer’s writing. She draws you in. You breathe and feel one with the characters. With all of them. Because all the characters in the book have so much depth, it’s uncanny. Erik Fiskare, whose voice we heard in The Man I Love, is just amazing! He is my new book dream man! Daisy Bianco, his love interest and the narrator in Give Me Your Answer True, is beautiful inside and out. And although she’s a fragile ballerina, she’s incredibly strong.(view spoiler)[But she’s hurting. Badly! Life was good. Her 3 year relationship with Erik was stronger and more passionate than ever. Their friends and roommates, Will and Lucky, were happy. But then life throws them a big bad one! Everybody changes. Moving on is not so easy. The hurt and the nightmares are just too much to deal with. Then Daisy does a bad thing. A mistake that will break Erik’s heart.All Daisy’s got left is the ballet. Will she be able to get over the heartbreak and depression? Will she forgive herself? Will Erik forgive her?  (hide spoiler)]Give Me Your Answer True is about Daisy’s journey for over 12 years. We fall in love with Erik, like she did. And then we’re travelling alongside Daisy for many years, while she’s working hard at forgiving herself, at moving on, at trying to be without Erik. Her pain and despair are almost palpable. Good writing will make you feel, and Suanne Laquer accomplishes this feat beautifully.There are no clichés. It’s all very realistic, without being banal. The book has a wonderful flow, and several story telling techniques are in play, including letters. Even the sex scenes are well written, they’re not too detailed, but not too generic either. They’re not gratuitous and thrown in there for cheap titillations. It’s not about mechanics, it’s about feeling and feelings.I thought the ballet/stage world added an extra dimension to the story. I also loved that Suanne Laquer (re)introduced me to new or some forgotten beautiful pieces of music. Whenever the name of a song or classical piece was mentioned, I’d go online and listen to it. It made the whole experience (even) more enjoyable.Given how much I adored The Man I Love, I had some trepidations about reading the same story from a different perspective, especially since I had been disappointed by other authors’ attempts. But Suanne Laquer manages the almost impossible – improving on something wonderful! I didn’t think that was possible, but she did it! And it didn’t matter one bit that I already knew the story.I truly enjoyed getting to know the secondary characters a bit better. Suanne Laquer is such a splendid writer, she manages to infuse realism and passion into all her characters. So, if you’re looking for something beautifully written, that’s realistic and passionate, than, welcome, you’ve arrived. Recommended: Absolutely! To anyone who enjoys beautifully written prose, with wonderful characters and a realistic plot.Cover: 5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"May 15, 2015","May 18, 2015","Mar 21, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25189303-give-me-your-answer-true

While I knew I enjoyed it, I couldn't remember that much about it, which is very frustrating, but it's happened before and it'll probably get worse. As I professed a million times before, Tim Winton is one of my favourite writers. His autographed books are some of my most treasured belongings. I was fortunate enough to see and hear him speak and have my books autographed on several occasions. My second taste of Dirt Music was via the e-audiobook. I didn't quite like the narrator and her delivery, but I persevered and finished it in record time. Things came back to me, especially certain details. Dirt Music is a quintessential Winton novel, in that the landscape, mostly the Western Australian coast, plays a big role in the characters' lives. Forty-year-old Georgie Jutland has been married for three years to the prosperous fisherman, Jim Buckridge. They live in White Point, a fictional coastal town. Luther Fox is thirty-five, lives off the grid and, occasionally, helps himself to crayfish and other sea creatures, despite not having a fishing license. Georgie feels restless and unsettled. She doesn't sleep much and she may have a bit of a drinking problem. Circumstances bring her and Luth together and an affair begins, so the big troubles start, especially since Luther Fox was already a persona non-grata in the community.I found the characters and their conduct irritating and odd at times. Some had more reasons than others to feel depressed, down on their luck, lost and self-destructive.But then it's only an illusion that people are logical or that they act rationally all the time.The last part was a bit unbelievable, it even had a dose of soap-opera to it, at least, that's how I perceived it this time around.Nevertheless, it was a satisfying read, even though I wasn't completely under its spell.So, I'm downgrading this to 4 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Sep 26, 2019","Sep 27, 2019","Mar 18, 2015",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/18745739-dirt-music

At the time, I had lived in Perth for less than two years, I was still discovering the city. For those outside Australia, Perth is the capital of Western Australia (WA), one of the most isolated capital cities in the world. The better known Sydney and Melbourne are ""only"" 4, 5 hrs away by plane. Those huge cities are where things are happening. Most publishers are located in one of those two cities. If I'm not mistaken, Winton is one of the first WA writers to make it big in Australia. Cloudstreet won the Miles Franklin Award, one of the most prestigious literary awards in Australia. Of course, that's not why I adore him, I don't do patriotism, I don't necessarily think that being from a place or another makes one better or worse, even though geography does impact one's views, opportunities etc. It's nice to read about a place you know personally. Long story short, Tim Winton is the best promoter of WA and isn't it wonderful that it's via culture - not via our usual primary industry exports.Anyway, it was wonderful to (re)visit with the Pickles and the Lambs, in their huge, rundown mansion on Cloudstreet, Perth over a twenty-year period (1943 - 63).

The book is written in the third person (a rarity these days) and we're witnesses to Erik's story. Erik and Daisy's love for each other is complete and all consuming. They are the perfect match up of two souls and bodies. The yin and yang, the soulmates. One day tragedy strikes. Erik and Daisy are affected deeply by the tragedy. They try hard to move on, but it's not easy, things are never the same. Then the inevitable happens, the melt down and (view spoiler)[ the break up. Erik can't forgive and feels completely lost, depressed, and anxious. He cuts any links with all his university friends, who had actually become his family. He just can't forget and forgive. Not being able to cope, he finally sees a psychologist and for a long time they dig and dig. Eventually, Erik gets married. But things don't work out, because he was still not over Daisy.  (hide spoiler)].This was a long book, it's dense and wordy, but it's beautiful and compelling! It's impossible not to love Erik and Daisy. It's worth saying that the secondary characters, Will and Dave, Lucky and others are very well written as well. It is a book about love, growing up, trauma, recovery, forgiveness, second chances. It is passionate, intelligent, emotional and raw! A truly incredible book! A favourite!  Recommended: To anyone who appreciates a well written novel, with amazing characters and realistic plot.

I was so frustrated about having to wait to find out what happens next ... Of course, once I realised my pre-order was ready for download, I quickly stopped what I was doing and started reading. And I had to finish it in one sitting, so now I'm tired and grumpy as I didn't get much sleep last night, but I'm also happy I've finished the novel. I have to say that while I thought Kaitlyn was magnificently awesome, I wasn't a big fan of Martin, as I wasn't that keen on his entitled, domineering personality, but his interest in Kaitlyn sure redeemed him somewhat.But in Capture, he becomes (almost) a new man, a better man, which let's face it, it doesn't happen in reality, but I guess that's why we read these books. What is it they say: women dream men will change, and men hope that women never will? :-) But Kaitlyn changes a bit as well, she becomes less sheltered and makes important decisions based on what's good for her and not on what everyone expects of her. In the process, she becomes happier and more self assured and she's got Martin's bluntness to thank for that. So yes, this was the perfect love story, where two perfectly imperfect people come together, and by being together they become the best versions of themselves. Big sigh... Thank you, Penny Reid for yet another wonderful love story. But PLEAAASSEEE no more books split in 2-3 volumes! With all due respect, I hate this practice! I understand the marketing/financial reasoning for it, but still, I am not a big fan! I don't even like it in movies, but it could also be because most movies that have 2, 3, 4 after them are ludicrous and hurt my intelligence (I noticed the Europeans and other non-Hollywood film makers never indulge in the practice). So, to conclude my /drivel: I love Penny Reid's writing style and the female characters she creates so much, I even endured the excruciating wait for each volume to be released. Also, Kaitlyn is now officially my favourite female character of all Penny Reid books!!! I can't wait for the next Penny Reid novel!

I liked that it showed a relationship that you don't see it described often, that between an older woman and a younger man. In a way, despite the age difference, both Caroline and Sebastian were much closer in age, as they were both lonely, insecure and just drifting along. This relationship was very effervescent. The forbidden relationship is exciting, obsessive and the consequences of being caught are far too drastic. It's hard to blame Caroline for falling for Sebastian. She's not predatory, if anything, Sebastian is the pursuer. The relationship is very intense. And there's a lot of sex. Lots and lots of sex. Also, the book is very dense, at times too detailed. While everything is happening in a very short period of time, 6-8 weeks(?), at times it felt like many months had passed. To be honest, I found myself rolling my eyes and wanting to slap Caroline for the unnecessary risks taken. And yeah, I dislike cliffhangers, even though I bought the book as a package, so now I'm reading the follow up - the Education of Caroline.It's not my favourite Jane Harvey-Berrick book, but it's still a good book, well written, with great insight into the characters....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 02, 2015","Apr 06, 2015","Feb 15, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16148137-the-education-of-sebastian

For example: at 72% the author uses ""loco"" which is Spanish for crazy, the Italian is ""pazzo"". 73% ""Mia amore"" is incorrect! It should have been ""amore mio"". The male character, Italian millionaire, Michael - such an Italian name - NOT, uses the word ""dios"" again and again. WRONG! That's Spanish for ""god"". The Italian is ""Dio"". Also, ""bambinos"" at 91% is Spanish for children/babies, in Italian they call them ""bambini"". I find it inexcusable that the author and/or the editor(s) could not be bothered to do a simple Google search. That just annoys the hell out of me. Since I'm on the language bandwagon, I found it very incredulous that Michael's entire family was so perfectly fluent in English, even his mum and the priest, and the nephews. If one visits Italy, one will discover that the majority of the Italians are not fluent in English, you're lucky if they speak any English at all. Besides the language issues, the book was all right. That is if you don't mind the clichés, and the marrying to fool the family thing, that's been done to death in romance books. So while I was reading this book, I had lots of ""yeah right"", ""WTF"" and eye rolling.

I wasn't dissatisfied with the characters, the plot or the dialogue, as I remember being the case with ""Truth and Beard It"". Our main protagonists are as different as they can be: Sienna Diaz is the A-list, Latina, Oscar-winning Hollywood actress. Jethro Winston - again, the name, grrr, but I already knew what his name was going to be so I should just chill about the names - is a park ranger and a former bad-boy, who's now has changed his ways. Jethro is a smooth operator, and so is Sienna. Their attraction is reciprocal and instant. Sienna loves that Jethro seems to be the only person in the world who doesn't know who she is. As per the well-established romance formula, misunderstandings and some angst ensue. I did notice that there was no slut shaming (Yay!), and I did like the feminist stand and the discussions over minority issues, the female body perception and the pressure to look a certain way. But even these issues that tickle my fancy big time were not enough to make me love the novel. The internal monologue was a bit too much, I felt we were told way too much, and given that it had alternate, first person POV's, we were told pretty much everything. It could have been my foul mood (reason for my decision to read this novel, so that I can relax), but the novel felt flat and I didn't quite get the spark.Looking forward to seeing what Cletus' story will be like.

I read that the author has a degree in Journalism???? Incredible!!!! I should really give it 2 stars, because typos and grammar mistakes piss me off big time, but I thought the book wasn't too bad. Yeah, nothing much happens, there's a lot of inner turmoil over nothing, and at times, I just wanted to slap the heroine, but somehow I still finished it. Sure, I've come to have very low expectations when it comes to new/young adult books, so that will explain the 3 star rating. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 13, 2015","Jan 31, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/23898456-the-mason-list

I found myself getting annoyed at times with both Elle and Oliver.The writing style was fine, although it had a lot of moving between the present and the past, and also between the two protagonists points of view - which seems to be the thing these days, especially when it comes to romance novels.

Remington St Germain was supposed to be sexy and mysterious etc, but in my opinion, the only thing sexy about him was his name. Although the book is very short, there are several things that just don't add up: 1. Selene is 26 years old. In the prologue she says she's been married for 6 years. Then, when talking to Remington, she tells him not only that she got married at 21 (21+6 = 27) but she says she's been divorced for 2 years. What the? Simple math, dear Autumn Grey, simple math. 2. There is no way that she couldn't have found a hotel room in Paris, the city that has over 17,000 hotels.3. The fact that Selene ends up spending the night in Remington's house is really over the top and unbelievable. Not only that, it turns out the dude owned a boutique hotel. 4. She meets his son in the morning after her first night staying at Remi's house, who was supposed to be away anyway. Not only that, the little boy, takes instant like to her and compliments her on her beauty and then asks his father if she can stay with them, because we all know that's what little boys do .The writing and dialogues are preposterous. Here's an example:""My drumstick-filled hand halted at my mouth. 'Why? What did he tell you?' He laughed: 'I've known him for five years. I've seen him treat his women with respect, literally laying his money at their feet to make sure they were happy' ( wow, imagine that, he was pasting banknotes in front of those women, because that's what literally laying his money at their feet means. ""However, allocating one of his precious expensive suites for any of them in his hotel? I never thought I'd see the day"".  Why is a hotel room so precious, especially since he was ""literally laying his money""? You get the drift.So in conclusion:- the writing is bad- the plot is over-the-top- the protagonists are bland- the sex scenes lukewarm______________________________________ONE AVERAGE BOOK, even for the genre.

Unfortunately, this novel didn't really do it forI'll have to start this  with a disclaimer: I love Penny Reid's novels, I've read all of them. Unfortunately, this novel didn't really do it for me. Were my expectations too high? Possibly.I've come to expect interesting characters, and I'm afraid, I didn't think much about our protagonists.Jessica James is a 22 year-old high school math teacher. She's also the daughter of the local sheriff and her brother is his deputy. And that's about all there is to say about Jessica. There were no witty comments or observations, no funny episodes. I thought she was plain and uninteresting. She sounded and acted like a teenager. And she was a bit of a horndogbitch(?)(not sure what's the female for horndog).As for the male protagonist, Duane, it was difficult to get over my dislike for his name. I like names. I think they're important. And Duane was too redneck-y for my liking. So were his other brothers' names. But I digress. I liked Duane more than Jessica. He's a 24, an auto-mechanic, part owner of an auto-repair business. He's a red-blooded young man, who's had a crush on Jessica for years. While Jessica is all over him, he won't take things too far because he ""respects"" her and wants a future with her. So let me get this right: fingering and oral sex is fine, but having intercourse is not ""respectful""? I don't get it. I've recently come across this in several books, most of them new adult romance novels. It must be a new thing, or it could be just me not getting the younger generations. Or could be the fact that I'm not American. But yeah, I find all these concepts perplexing. And no, I'm no prude. I'll stop my rant.I'm trying to articulate why I didn't gel with this novel. Could it have something to do with the setting? Possibly. More than likely it's because I didn't care much about the two protagonists. Jessica was too two-dimensional and was acting like a silly teenager. Duane sounded too articulate, too well-read (I know, I know his momma made him read), too level-headed and grown up for a 24 year old and I just didn't buy it, although those are attributes I like in a guy, unlike all the other hillbilly characteristics. The only brother who piqued my interest was Cletus (although, the name... grr). I'd like to know more about him. It looks like we'll have to wait for the third book in the series to read his story. As for the plot, it didn't really do it for me either. It felt contrived, at times too convenient, and I had a few quibbles here and there, but I won't go into them because of spoilers.So, in conclusion, was this novel terrible? Certainly not. Will I be reading the next one in the series? I sure will.

I should have liked it a lot, given that the male protagonist is supposed to be a very intelligent man (a big turn on for me). But I didn't buy it. Ford, a 26 yo rich, handsome and with an Aspergers diagnosis (for those unaware, that's a form of high functioning autism), keeps telling us that he doesn't care about anyone, and that he can't feel like most normal people do (relatively true for most people on the autism spectrum) etc. but man, his internal monologues, empathy, considerate behaviour are over the top, even for a neuro-typical man. Many things didn't quite feel right: Ford is only 26 yo and he has had a lot of work experience producing TV shows - how many people in their early 20s are producers? And the fact that a person with Aspergers syndrome would go for an arty degree (without being a prodigy) when he was supposed to be a savant, it's hard to believe. OK, I know, nobody gives a rats about these details, that's not why we read this kind of books. Unfortunately for me, I do pick up on such details. Both Ford and Ashleigh were apparently very educated, but they could have been farmers or high-school drop outs, their dialogues didn't seem too intelligent to me. I also thought that Ashleigh, a single mum of a 3 months old baby, who was both emotionally and physically drained, was over the top horny. I know, it's fiction, but still... Speaking of babies, that baby was the most sleepy baby ever!!!! How convenient! The story drags at times, and I found the first person narrative very annoying, as I stated in other s. Also, some editing is needed. So anyway, in conclusion: is this the worst book I've read? NO. Is it 5 stars?

I have no issues with cursing, but Moxie was crass, childish and it was impossible to imagine her as a kindergarten teacher. The dialogues between her and her best friend, Renee , another teacher, and her gay friend, Ryan, (how cliche is that?) are contrived and very crass. Moxie's exchange of insults with her arch nemesis, another teacher, in the teachers' lounge and other public places is just over the top. No teacher talks like that! Actually, no white, educated, middle class woman talks, thinks like that - how's that for generalisation? Her love interest, Miles, finds her irresistible, although their first encounter (view spoiler)[ was in a bar, where she was super drunk and crass and to top it all off, she vomits all over the guy's shoes. Claaaasssyyy!  (hide spoiler)] Speaking of Miles, he's a bore! Apparently he looks perfect, perfectly defined muscles and all - because that's how artists look like . Right, that's not important, I guess there could be arty guys out there who looked like that. But I found the way he was talking to her so unappealing. Another thing that bugged me was that she kept telling people she loved to be a kindergarten teacher, but throughout the novel she complains about the kids. Not to mention, that no 6 year olds talk/act like two of her students, one of them being Dillon, Mile's son. I could point out other things that didn't make sense or add up, but I won't bother. The ending was rushed and very unfulfilling.

I enjoy books with circus performers in it. But I must say, this book was a disappointment. It just didn't feel like a L.H. Cosway book. It was flat, at times boring, and the characters just didn't do it for me. The story is told in the first person by the heroine, Lille. There's a lot of internal dialogue and stating the obvious, and many times the author is telling us how to feel about certain people and situations. The dialogues were kind of flat and there was no banter or humour, or very little anyway. The book's flow wasn't very good. Even the sex scenes were, I don't know... not doing it for me, but that's one aspect that I'm least concerned with. Some things were a bit far fetched and didn't quite add up. Jack is supposed to have big gaps in his education, somewhat illiterate, but at times the words he uses and the way he expresses himself contradict that fact. The drama and plot were kind of drawn out. While I didn't completely hate this book, I couldn't say there was one thing that I loved.

All the Light We Cannot See sure has that “feel"", quality about it. I also think this would make a great book to be studied in high-school or college/university.I'm only going to jot down a few things, as there are so many wonderful s on Goodreads.There were so many things I loved about All the Light We Cannot See. This novel is so layered, so thorough and is also very touching without being sappy. The writing, while relatively simple, is exquisite. I loved the third person narrative and I didn't mind at all the alternate POVs or the very quirky, small chapters that were popping here and there. This novel is so high on details, it’s hard not to imagine yourself on the streets of Paris, or walking through the Natural History Museum, or strolling the streets of the quaint, seaside town of Saint-Malo.The descriptions were extremely vivid. At times, I felt as if I was suffering from synaesthesia – where senses get somewhat amalgamated and mixed up – you associate colour to numbers or smells to touching certain textures. Beautifully olfactory as times, Doerr manages to make us “see” what Marie-Laure was “seeing”. The character development is absolutely exquisite. You’ll be hard pressed not to love the two young protagonists – Marie – Laure, who’s a blind French girl, and Werner Pfennig– a German orphan, who ends up becoming a soldier in the German army, despite not being of age. Their innocence is taken by the war. They’re thrown into situations none of them would have ever imagined. The love and dedication of Marie-Laure’s father were quite touching. He was an intelligent man, a dotting single father, who was trying to make his blind daughter’s life as easy as possible. One of the things he comes up with is a miniature town that he painstakingly builds so that she can learn her way around their neighbourhood. I also enjoyed, or better said, appreciated Doerr’s take on the Nazis. By telling us about Werner’s history as a little boy, Werner enrolled in an elite school, Werner’s struggles during the war, Doerr humanised him, so he no longer was just a Nazi. Most books on the subject, vilify, make unredeemable monsters of all the Germans. Surely, they were not all bad. What they did as a collective was atrocious! But, most people, taken as individuals, are quite decent beings. Only when put together with others, that’s when things change. It’s an interesting, somewhat puzzling characteristic of human behaviour, that makes otherwise decent people act/behave like … I won’t say animals, as that would be derogatory towards the animals. Just watch young men (and not only) together on a night in town. Then add the will to conform and belong, circumstances, propaganda, patriotism, fear, youth and a few other things, and you’ve got yourself a group of monsters.I loved how music, and science, and reading sort of connected two people that were supposed to be enemies. Anyway, I’ll end this  by saying All The Light We Cannot See is deserving of all the accolades. I’m glad I got to read it. This is one of those books that begs to be re-read. I’ve received this novel via NetGalley. Many thanks to HarperCollins UK, HarperPress/4th Estate/The Friday Project for allowing me to read and  this tremendous novel.

The female protagonist, Lucy, is a genius, doing her PhD at the young age of 20. She's probably got Aspergers - a high functioning form of autism - although it's never mentioned in the book. She's socially inept, she doesn't have any friends, and doesn't know much about emotions, experiencing emotions. But when her grant to study emotion as a pathogen is under threat of being removed, she's forced to start making friends, to try to find out about emotions, about what makes people tick, about lust and sexual desire. Suddenly she notices her hunky neighbour, Jensen, who's a pre-law student and who has the reputation of a playboy. He's beginning to help her with her ""experiment/project"". Throw some over bearing parents in the mix and some misunderstandings and you've got the perfect recipe for disaster. But love conquers all.

In the beginning, I thought it was so cute, I loved the smart comments, the fast pace and the tongue-in-cheek observations. While all the young adult novels are very predictable, I thought that the dialogues felt very ""young adult"", and I was really enjoying the ride. But about 1/3 through the book, or maybe half way through, things started to decline for me. I found myself noticing things that didn't quite add up or that annoyed me: how would a 15 yo know so much about music? Ok, she's been home schooled for many years and had more free time, but how would a teenage boy, busy with sports and hooking up and being in school for most of the day, have had time to acquire so much knowledge about classic movies and music? Anyway, no biggie. One of the things that annoyed me, and it seems to be a constant, especially with the young adult genre, is when other girls are referred to as sluts. How Camie took an instant dislike to Teresa and became so nasty towards her after finding out that she was interested in the male protagonist - I found that disconcerting. Especially since she was supposed to be such a ""goody two shoes"", and god fearing blah blah... It's interesting to note that things hadn't changed a whole lot from when I was in highschool, especially about the double standards when it comes to girls. But the authors are grown ups, who should know better, what's up with this? Can't we get over calling other women sluts, tramps, while brushing off guys' behaviour? Speaking of Camie, she moved pretty quickly from never have been kissed to allowing Tristan unhook her bra, put his hands on her naked butt etc. Anyway, these are just few of the things that were bugging me. There isn't much going on in this book. There's a whole lot of dialogue, analysis of each and every glance, blink, body posture, clothes etc. ... I found myself skipping paragraphs as I was getting bored. So, let's just say that my initial excitement about the book quickly dwindled. And no, I will not be reading the other 2 books (Why???) in the series - which is another pet hate of mine of how authors these days make three books when one - well written and edited novel - would have sufficed! You know the old adage ""quality over quantity""? It's mostly missing these days. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 26, 2014","Dec 04, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/15706512-shark-bait

Really, I should have stopped reading earlier, but I was distracted watching TV while reading. First of all about the writing: it's bad! Besides the annoying 1st person narrative, the dialogues are irritating and unrealistic and the syntax is all over the place.The characters are clichéd and uninteresting, with the goody-two-shoes Scarlett being just... so uninteresting. And of course , two drop-dead gorgeous guys happen to instantly fall for her, because you know, she was the only good looking girl out there (yep, I'm being sarcastic). And for someone who's a virgin, she sure starts ""sucking face"" with a guy at her first ever party, after just meeting him. When she gets back to where she was staying, Ash, the other hot guy, invites her to go to his bedroom, and she agrees? What the? The irony was not lost on me, that at the party, she was referring to the two girls hanging with Ash as bimbos, although they were doing so much less than what she was about to do later in his bedroom.One of my biggest gripes with the romance genre, especially with the young adult/new adult sub-genre is the slut shaming. Authors, please stop slut shaming!!! Scarlett apparently was a ""book whore"" (I didn't know there was such a thing), because she read lots and lots of romance novels. It's interesting that her controlling parents didn't have much to say about what she was reading. Thank goodness I haven't yet gotten around to reading any sex scenes.

Cosway and Penny Reid, who recently have bThis is the first e-book I've ever pre-ordered, as I was very keen to get my hands on something new by L.H. Cosway and Penny Reid, who recently have become my favourite contemporary romance authors.So I got the book onto the kindle yesterday and finished it today. As with the other books written by the two lovely authors, it was hard to put down. The book is so contemporary, so vibrant and funny, you just want to read it all in one go, to see what happens next.It is the story of an Irish rugby player, Ronan, who is hiding in New York because of a scandal in his native Ireland. And amazingly enough, not only is he well built and gorgeous (looking like Colin Farrell), he's smart and well educated. I didn't think such a thing as an intelligent rugby player existed ;-)The female protagonist, Annie, is a socially inept hermit, who's working for a PR agency, as social media expert. Also she writes a very successful social/entertainment blog, under the pseudonym Socialmedialite. She's extremely intelligent and well educated, also beautiful, although she's trying her best to go by unnoticed by wearing unflattering clothes. As you can guess, Ronan and Annie get together. There are secrets. There is pushing and pulling. There is social pressure and work pressure. There is angst, and fear, and anger, and love. You've got it all in this book. I admire how the authors come up with such interesting characters, who have interesting jobs and tumultuous background history, but it is all believable, it's not all gratuitous soap-opera dramas like in many romance books. I loved coming across some of the Irish vernacular, although I would have liked more of that Irishness (new word ;-) to transpire. Thank goodness he wasn't the stereotypical happy drunk, or worse, happy Catholic drunk. Sooorrrrry The sex scenes were Caliente!!! I mean HOT! and somewhat different! So kudos to the authors for making that part interesting as well. The only problem I had was that the book finished. :-( Sometimes I really hate that I'm such a fast reader. So I'm really looking forward to reading the next releases: ""Elements of Chemistry"" by Penny Reid and ""Hearts of Fire"" by L.H. Cosway. 4.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 02, 2015","Feb 03, 2015","Nov 10, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23285659-the-hooker-and-the-hermit

While the premise was predictable - good looking, bad boy falls for the nice, shy, virgin girl - I didn't mind it too much. (view spoiler)[ Elle, the female protagonist, showed a bit of personality once Nero, the main dude, started showing interest in her. But that didn't last long. Which I guess makes more sense, since she had been viciously bullied for years, including broken bones and cut hair. I know, hard to believe that would happen in a private, upper-class high-school. There were quite a few things that didn't sit well with me: first of all: the good girl witnesses a man being murdered, so what does she do? She rans home and tells no one about it. Say what??? Nero is ""of course"" good looking, well built, with girls at his little finger, you know, the usual cliché in this kind of books. I didn't like him. He was overbearing, sort of abusive and always shoving her around and telling her what to do. Kind of a bully. Elle always gave in and did what she was told which I guess, in a way, would fit with her victim personality prior to Nero, but I found it disappointing and boring. Her devotion to her best friend - Chloe - was over the top. I needed more of a background, history to accept it. Elle's parents - apparently nice people - were completely oblivious to Elle's suffering. The ending was a total let down: with basically Nero more of less forcing her to move in with him into an apartment into his fathers casino/hotel. And his father and entire family are the big Mafia family in the city. Ah, and Nero forces her to go to University in the town, although she had been accepted to Standaford, where she was going to go with her best friend,for whom she sacrificed so much, but who suddenly was forgotten... So yeah, lots of things didn't add up and that annoyed me. (hide spoiler)]The writing wasn't the worst I've seen around, but yeah, the ingredients weren't quite right. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 12, 2014","Nov 09, 2014",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/22494969-nero

Besides the dreaded 1st person narrative, the book had a poorly structured plot, and it was badly written and edited. I lost count of the many times I've rolled my eyes and said ""yeah right"" to myself. Things just didn't add up or were unlikely. It felt like I was reading a conglomerate of bits and pieces from other romance novels. Cami - the heroine - must have had more hours in the day than most people: she was working at a bar till early in the morning, than working at a tattoo parlour, while also attending University - which barely features in the book. The macho, alpha, tattooed male protagonist (Why do all the alpha males in the romance novels have to have tattooes?) - Trent - apparently had been in love with Cami since secondary school, but he never had the guts to approach her. Say what? Wasn't he the macho, confident, very desirable guy? It just didn't make sense. Cami's family issues was contrived and and inserted to create some drama, but it just did nothing. There were so many things that annoyed me. All I can think is thank goodness I didn't pay money for the book - somebody lent it to me. It cost $10+. I don't get how book prices are set, but I've read free romance novels with better plots and characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2014","Nov 02, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18104607-beautiful-oblivion

So I was a bit of apprehensive about reading this new Don Tillman novel, as I loved 4 starsIt's a well-known reality that sequels usually disappoint. So I was a bit of apprehensive about reading this new Don Tillman novel, as I loved the Rosie Project. But quite early into the book, I knew that I was going to enjoy it, all I had to do was find out whether it'll be a five-star book, as the Rosie Project was.Professor Don Tillman is now married and living in New York with his lovely wife, Rosie. Life is relatively comfortable and they've settled in NY pretty well. But Rosie's unplanned pregnancy shakes Don's organised life. Will he able to be a good father? As with everything else, he's trying to be logical and methodical about it, so he embarks on a study project of sorts in order to prepare and establish himself as a suitable father. But Don's social ineptness causes misunderstandings and all sorts of grief, although his intentions are always so honourable.This wasn't as good as the Rosie Project, but nevertheless, it was very enjoyable. Although this is written in the first person, (not a favourite of mine) it's perfectly suited for this novel, as it was for the Rosie Project. Don's way of trying to make sense of situations is so endearing. Or it was to me. The guy is completely innocent and he doesn't have a mean bone in his body. And he tries to help everyone around him. I thought he was very charming.Graeme Simsion has created a wonderful character in Don Tillman and the secondary characters are very well written as well. I quite like the writing style and the rhythm of both novels, they're quite unique, or at least I haven't come across other similar books. Not a five-star book for me, but still tremendously enjoyable.Recommended: Absolutely.

Poisonwood Bible is the 3rI'm 20+ years late to the party, but I am happy to have gotten over my prejudice and to have finally read this masterpiece. Poisonwood Bible is the 3rd novel by Kingsolver that I read in the last four months. The only advantage to having discovered her writing later is that I still have her back catalogue to indulge in. I plan to.There are over 700,000 s and ratings of this novel on GR, it's astounding that it's got a rating over 4 stars, most literary fiction books tend to be an overall rating under 4 stars. Yes, I'm in awe of Kingsolver, she's one super intelligent woman, and on top of that, she's got an immense talent for writing. This novel can be analysed to death, there's so much to admire, dissect and learn. At its centre, we have the Prices, made up of the patriarch, the Baptist preacher, Nathan Price, his wife, Leah and their four daughters, Orleanna, Adah, Rachel and Ruth May. As was the case back in the day, and I'm sure it's still the case for some, when the man decided he was going somewhere and his family had to go with him, there was no considering the other people's wishes and hopes. So the Prices find themselves removed from their way of life in Georgia, USA, to some village in the middle of nowhere Congo, with no running water, no electricity, no comforts whatsoever. The learning curve was huge. The wife and the girls, by way of their personalities, and roles adapted to their environment, while the patriarch stayed the same, his only focus was to convert those lost souls (insert rolling of eyes). I mean the women did all the exhausting work, back-breaking work, so the man had the time to ponder about one's soul and god when he was provided with what he needed to survive. Did I know much about Congo? Not really. So learning more about that region was greatly appreciated. Colonialism, post-colonialism, self-determinism, and religious colonialism are some of the big themes, explored mostly via personal histories, which is how people experience history.Another big part of the novel is, especially in the first half, the lack of autonomy and self-determination that women and children experienced, some still do, I'm sure. Oh, how I hated the patriarch of the family, I couldn't care less that he might have had trauma from the war, his obsession/religiousness, the abuse of the wife and his daughters and the lack of self-reflection, gave me no cause to stop hating him. I would have to investigate why Kingsolver chose not to have him express his POV. I'm sure it's a good reason. :-) It didn't go unnoticed how the women became their own resolute and accomplished selves, once they escaped the shackles of religion and men.I'll need to re-read this in print. The audiobook was well narrated by Dean Robertson, but I would have preferred to have had different narrators for each character. Now I need to see what amazing titles beat this stupendous novel to the many awards it was nominated for....more",Notes are private!,1,43,1,"Jan 30, 2023","Mar 13, 2023","Aug 31, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7244.The_Poisonwood_Bible

I was in a bookshop looking at books, taking shelter from the rain. I spotted a table with heavily discounted books. I saw Lolita, saw it was written by a Russian, but most importantly, it cost the exact amount of cash I had in my purse, so I bought it. I started reading it and I was instantly mesmerised. Talking to a friend of mine about books, I told him I was reading this most disturbing book that was so well written, I couldn't stop reading. When I mentioned the name, he was surprised I hadn't heard of the book or the author before. It was the first time I read a book that made me feel extremely uncomfortable, where the characters were so utterly vile and despicable. The voice was like nothing I'd read before. It truly blew my mind away. Ah, I forgot to mention it was a translation.So, I was curious to find out if the novel will be as affecting two decades later, as a less naive woman, with more life experience, and a mother of a twelve-year-old girl. Most importantly, this time it was the original English version. Having Jeremy Irons read it to me was quite the treat.I won't lie, it took some work to separate myself as a young girl, my own daughter and Humbert Humbert from every male individual. The leering, the lusting, the manipulations, were difficult to absorb without vomiting. As time progressed, I got lured in by Humbert's musings. He's the suavest, the most enthralling wordsmith you'll encounter in literature. And he's pleading his case to you, the reader, and he makes you pay attention. His language is of the highest level, his analogies, metaphors, similes and wonderful wordplays trap you in. You might as well give in and ride along the libidinous, lascivious, sick Humbert Humbert. Oh, I can only imagine the outrage of the puritanical Americans. How gutsy were Nabokov and the publishers? I need to read more about its history and some interviews with Nabokov (I tried to watch the interviews on YouTube but I couldn't stand Nabokov's voice, so I'd rather read). Of course, I need to read more Nabokov. Lolita will keep its place on my My favourite books of all time/Masterpieces  shelf.Suddenly, I have a hankering to watch the movie, the Jeremy Irons version. ...more",Notes are private!,0,77,2,"May 17, 2018not set","Jun 02, 2018not set","Jul 08, 2014",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/2029081.Lolita

Ok, so here's the deal: I was in the mood for something light, non-challenging, romantic etc. So I went to Goodreads and found some lists. BB was rated highly so I downloaded it. I didn't expect a literary masterpiece, but even I could write better, much better, and I'm crap at writing and have no imagination, but apparently nor did Christina Lauren ,(I sure hope this is a pen name, as I would not dare ever publish such a piece of garbage). I just Googled the name. So, it's not just one ""brilliant"" writer but two.WOW! OMFG! I read a few s before I started writing mine. I had no idea what P2P was, nor fan fiction, so I had to look it up. Given the amount of books available, to think that women would waste their time with this piece of garbage, to think that some of you would rate this over 2 stars - it's absolutely incomprehensible. That trees had to die to have this thing printed is unfathomable.Apparently, this book had a publisher, which supposedly means an editor. Somebody who can read and write has edited this book? What a joke!!!!I could only read about 8% on my Kindle, as I just couldn't continue. I wanted a book to relax me, not to irritate the hell out of me. There was nothing remotely sexy or erotic. The dialogues made me twitch! The character development - non-existent. The first person narration is annoying as hell, but to have that back and forth between the two idiot protagonists is even more annoying. The dude is referring to the woman as a bitch when he's thinking about her? Really? That doesn't do it for me. Nor does cum swallowing. Yuck!!! I thought that was supposed to be written for women, unless the two ""brilliant"" authors watched too much porn - which is made for men - and got confused about what women like/want (yeah, I know, there are exceptions). Ah, and every single time there's an amorous encounter between the two fucktards, there's panty ripping involved. So much passion! (insert sarcasm). There's no time for removing one's underwear. But the thing that was the ""sexiest"" is that the male fucktard keeps the ripped underwear in a drawer. I'll stop, as really, it's not worth wasting any more time. Obviously, I shall refrain from looking at Goodreads as a source of suggestions, even when it comes to trashy ""literature"". There was not one redeemable thing about this novel. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm being dishonest: the cover is not bad. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2014","Mar 20, 2014",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/16102004-beautiful-bastard
