I read / skimmed mookay i technically didn't read the entire collection of poems but I am counting this because of how many hours I spent reading it. I read / skimmed most of the poems. Here are my notes:- Most of my favorite poems are in her first book,  To Bedlam and Part Way Back  (1960). not saying she peaked on her first book, buuuut those ones resonated with me the most (""You, Doctor Martin,"" ""Elizabeth Gone,"" and ""The Double Image"")- Favorite poems from  All my Pretty Ones  (1962) are ""Old,"" and ""From the Garden""- My favorite poem from her third book,  Live or Die  (1966), which she also won the Pulitzer Prize for (in 1967), is ""Imitations of Drowning""- The poems from  Love Poems  (1969) are all pretty sexual so I didn't analyze any of them (Ms. Abair would NOT appreciate that<3)- The poems from  Transformations  (1971) have a fairy tale theme and are generally quite long (most of the poems span 3-5 pages)-  The Book of Folly  (1972) has a whole thread of Jesus poems at the end and I may or may not have skipped over those . . . favorite poem from this book is ""The Ambition Bird"" (“I am drinking cocoa, / that warm brown mama”)- I didn't really like  The Death Notebooks  (1974), sorry- I liked ""The Dead Heart"" from  The Awful Rowing Toward God  (1975)I enjoyed reading Sexton’s poems in order of when they were written (in terms of when each of her books were published), because I could see a clear line of progression from each of her works. In her later years she definitely became more confident in her writing, branching out to different themes and experimenting with length and structure. I also liked that she devoted her poems in some of her books to one main theme. Sexton wrote much about mental health, postpartum depression, and thoughts of suicide. She herself struggled with all of these, and writing was a way for her to come to terms with these struggles. In terms of things recurring throughout her poems, there was a lot of mention of bells, moccasins, Spring, and even her daughters Joyce and Linda.

Stevens never knew a life outside being a butler-his dad was also one so it was just kind of expected for him to be one too. he devoted his entire life to being a butler and serving his lord or whatever and it’s kind of sad how oblivious he was in that he didn’t realize how little freedom he had. I thought it was really interesting though how Ishiguro chose the time period that he did, because it seems that the role of butlers and house servants is starting to become obsolete, so what does that mean for Stevens? Also I did not see the ending coming. I thought he was going to have an epiphany and retire his butler days, finally living his life as he wants to. But at the same time it makes sense because for Stevens at least, being a butler seems to be what he defines as his purpose in life and as long as he’s okay with that he can stay a butler I guess....more",Notes are private!,6,3,1,"Aug 25, 2023","Aug 30, 2023","Jun 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28921.The_Remains_of_the_Day

It contained some ""adult"" content, but was displayed in a fun graphic novel. The Complete Persepolis is a memoir written by Marjane Satrapi about herself, growing up in Iran during restrictive war times. She could not choose what she wore, and could not say anything that could possibly insult the government. In public, at least. At home she complained a lot about the society she lived in, and her parents eventually sent her to Europe to receive education. In Austria all by herself, Marjane was exposed to the world outside of Iran. Some people despised her because of her race and culture, but Marjane didn't let that get to the best of her. Marjane was empowering to me, because she had the courage to speak up for what she believed in.
