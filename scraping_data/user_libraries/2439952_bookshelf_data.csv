It was one of the first non-school books I read that made me the reader I am today. The summer before my Senior year of high school (1989), we had a reading list that was just a bunch of authors (no specific books). I went to a Jesuit high school in CT. The list of authors included the likes of Clancy, Ludlum, Clavell, Cussler, Follet, etc. They were all pretty much books that you'd never read in class but that you may read for fun. The point was not to get you to read something, it was to get you to read ANYTHING. Anyway, my dad helped me pick out Ludlum and I got The Bourne Identity. Re-reading it now was a little different in that my tastes have evolved and matured. I still liked it but am guessing I didn't devour it or love it with the same gusto as before (which is why now I only give it 4 stars). Ludlum's long-time editor passed away in the early days of Covid. I wrote his widow a note of condolence and in it told her the story above and let her know her husband (and Ludlum) were responsible for my love of reading which has shaped me as a person. She wrote me back a thank you note. Funny, because of my dad's job we moved/lived in 3 states (TX, VA, CT) when I was in high school and the one in CT was my last one (I moved there the summer before my Senior year). Strange, Ludlum and his editor both lived in the town next to where I lived in CT. Had I not moved schools, I'm not certain I would have been the same reader/person I am today....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 15, 2022",Oct 2022,"Oct 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7869.The_Bourne_Identity

All about his life both personal and professional. I really didn't know much about him, certainly not that he got his professional start in Advertising. He sounds like an interesting guy and down to earth but also with an edge if/when you get too close to where his passions lie. Overall, I liked the audiobook a lot and like almost all audiobooks that I really like, my only regret is that I didn't read it or have a physical copy to make notes along the way. I find it so hard to  an audiobook because I just can't remember all my favorite parts, I was too busy listening and enjoying. I have read two Patterson books, both collaborative efforts (no surprise) and like them each. I wrote down three of his that I want to check out after ""reading"" this book and hope to get a copy of his favorite books which he read aloud at the end of the audiobook. Some I shared on my own list but many I have to add to my TBR. All in all, a good memoir. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jul 2022,"Jul 04, 2022","Jun 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58231782-james-patterson-by-james-patterson

This aimlessness may have been a literary technique consciously employed by the author but I'm not sure.Anyway, the crime and its retelling during the hearings were heartbreaking and disturbing. The father/son bonding was a little wooden but then again the father himself seemed like a odd duck but a very compassionate and unselfish one at that, like it was his job/lot in life to defend awful people knowing he'd lose 90% of the time and then pick-up all the pieces they leave behind and try to put them together which he did with the administrative emotion of working at the DMV yet always being totally committed to his stewardship and service of life after legal justice is meted out.Supposedly, this book could be semi-autobiographical given it's Guterson's first book in over a decade and his father was also a public defender. Unlike that prescriptive Beatles song regarding love, in the end of this book it's more rhetorical in asking if there is anything else other than it. In the end this may all be about Guterson himself both mourning and reconciling what his father meant both to him and the world around him....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 20, 2022","Apr 23, 2022","Feb 25, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57800385-the-final-case

Joe McA detective’s five-year journey switching back between two continents and a world war to investigate and ultimately avenge a three-time killer. Joe McGrady, an American veteran of Korea and Honolulu cop, is handed his first case, a grisly double-murder, to solve as an acting detective. Just weeks before the invasion of Pearl Harbor, McGrady begins to untangle the threads of the case and in doing so is propelled halfway around the world. Set-up, stranded and almost left for dead in a Hong Kong jail at the outbreak of the war, McGrady miraculously finds himself rescued but still sequestered behind enemy lines in Tokyo for the entire Second World War. Stuck in time and pining for the life and love he left behind, McGrady discovers key clues about one of the murder victims that begins to break the case open but also indelibly links him to its resolution. All the while, the captive American immerses himself in Japanese culture and finds new love with his pacifist, captor’s daughter. The war epic, wrapped within this murder mystery, climaxes during the night of the Tokyo firebombing after which McGrady returns like a ghost to a Hawaii that has changed forever and moved well past his assumed death. Restless to both resume and resolve the case as well as to keep his promise and repay the kindness of his captor, McGrady finally untangles the last knot of the mystery. In the end and after a lifetime to McGrady and a half-decade to everyone else, he surrenders to an ultimate peace after having been caught too many times in the middle of a world constantly at war with itself. Parts mystery, espionage, procedural, romance and war epic, Five Decembers is the best kind of pulp fiction noir with a protagonist the reader witnesses morph from common man to hardboiled and then morph again to at ease. The writing style echoes that of Chandler, Clavell and Hemingway while McGrady is an amalgamation of Travis McGee, Robert Jordan and everyone in between. At first blush, Five Decembers may seem anachronistic but once the last page is turned its timelessness is clear. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Mar 25, 2022not set","Apr 02, 2022not set","Jan 25, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57522883-five-decembers

From the title of the book, to the main character's name and the overall message, this was certainly a ""thought-provoking"" book :-). Early on, the main character, Nao, reminded me a lot of Holden Caulfield but over the course of the book she matured beyond her years. The author did a very nice job peeling the onion back on her cast of characters and in unfolding their respective truths creating a shared understanding amongst all. The technique of telling the story across a continuum of time that switched back and forth and then became intertwined kept the pace moving and the mystery of the story fresh till the end.In the end, I think this book is a parable (aka ""a tale"") for the living (aka ""the time being"") to live in the now and do your best knowing that life is a journey with many bends in the road and that wisdom and knowledge come as time passes and experience is gained and that patience and understanding are required along the way to acquire both. And I think telling the story from the perspective of a teenager reminds adults at just how imperfect and fragile we are as humans (even though we may have tricked ourselves as being the smartest people in the room). Ah, if I only knew then (when I was sixteen) what I know now (at 49)...which is another way of saying in another 33 years, if I only knew then (when I was 49) what I know now (at 82).

The story was not too shadowy and was easy to follow and settle into. Much like the Daniel Craig 007 character, this Bourne emotes quite a bit more than his historical self. He second guesses and freezes sometimes which feels very un-Bourne like. Still I liked it more than not but give it was less opaque and more emotional it felt a little like an imposter (more so than the last one (first one) written by Freeman), which is a little surprising given he talked about bringing the old school Bourne back to life. All that is to say, the ending leaves a big question for me as to how the next book will unfold, if at all. Then again, maybe this installment was more shadowy and opaque than I originally gave it credit for being......more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 15, 2021","Oct 31, 2021","Oct 31, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56155832-the-bourne-treachery

They both seem to drag and the stories themselves just don’t seem that realistic. Box seems to sell about a gazillion books so I’m a little at a loss. I like slightly better the Longmire books which are a little similar in terms of Western based. I like the recurring characters a little more in Johnston’s books, it gives them a little more familiarity while the Box ones (at least the two I’ve read to date) seem to lack any real character, other than Pickett himself. And as for Pickett, he seems a little bumbling and righteous. I like his honor but he just seems like he’s kind of dorky. I’ll try one more (some day) and see if I change my mind, I’m hopeful and doubtful at the same time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 04, 2021","Oct 04, 2021","Oct 04, 2021",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/244105.Savage_Run

I got about half way thru and had no idea where it was going when I thought it should be over. Liked the second half better than the first, but both were enjoyable. The more I read King (as I'm older) I think more about what he's saying. In this case, this books almost seems like his salute to post 9-11 vets and the battles they've waged both on and off duty. Billy is a complex character. Killing for $ but only bad guys and doesn't really seem to care all that much about the $. Just pretty much on a mission to rid the world of bad people as if that's his life purpose and one he came to at an early age and then honed in Iraq. But then he finds a new life purpose in both writing and Alice but still can't seem to shake his old self in his need for revenge for his (and maybe others) having been wronged again coming full circle to his sister.
