I liked the portrayal of Jim in his younger years--his confidence and his attractive personality. I also loved his first wife. His second wife was too young but I think they did love each other. His third wife was a promoter and very strong so that gets in the way of whether they were in love or not? At that point, Jim got a couple of facelifts. I thought that was sad. It was also sad that it took so long for the Olympic medals to get returned to the family (after his death). Another tragedy is that he is buried STILL in Pennsylvania rather than Oklahoma which was his wish. The story is spectacularly complicated but Jim holds his place in history and that is a good thing. The author mentioned several times how Jim was an unreliable narrator, not even clear on his own birthdate. The author describes trying to decipher what was mythology while doing his research. The end of the book was very hopeful as Jim's descendants have all gone on to make their positive mark on the world. The condescension toward Jim and making him into a ""curiosity"" are heartbreaking. Still, Jim just kept on going and did the best that he could. He was a great man.

Thanks to Kim Leisgang for letting me know about it. It reminded me of other English books such as THE READING LIST and almost anything by Jojo Moyes. The book is fictional. It embraces multigenerational friendships and how being truthful will set you free. Julian is an elderly artist who is the impetus behind a notebook called THE AUTHENTICITY PROJECT. As the book lands in people's lives, they are willing to write down their truths in the book. Julian actually gets a new lease on life because the woman who finds the book (Monica) finds a way to have Julian teach art lessons in her restaurant. The chain continues with the remaining characters of the book. Then we return full circle to Julian who has closure because of the relationships he has created. Favorite quote from Mrs. Wu who I adored--she also grows in this book:""Tai chi is about the balance of yin and yang. If you use hardness to resist force, then both sides will break.

And somehow I missed this in the first book but she is only 19 years old!! How she uses math problems to ""clear her mind"" is charming! The Swami is smarmy and Kaveri picks up on this immediately.

The author brings in historical notes such as India's pending fight for independence from Britain. (This is set in 1920s Bangalore.) She also draws the pictures of so many women and their struggles but also their solidarity. This feminist enjoys how easily she does that! We also learn about the scourge of cocaine.

And yet our own mathematicians like Aryabhata showed how eclipses occur using principles of geometry 1500 years ago.
