HOWEVER, although the introduction by justin taylor - who is the recommender of THIS story in electric literature's 'recommended reading' project - claims that this story is NOT an excerpt from novic's novel Girl at War, a lot of it sounded very familiar, so i think he is wrong in this assertion, although correct in loving the story. Girl at War hadn't yet been published when he made this claim, so he can be forgiven, but it is most certainly published now, so you can read this story, or read the full novel, or both, but NOT none of the above. that is simply not an option, sorry. read it for yourself here:https://electricliterature.com/notes-...2022:DECEMBER 1: PORGEE'S BOAR - JONATHAN CARROLLDECEMBER 2: SKELETON SONG - SEANAN MCGUIREDECEMBER 3: JUDGE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING MANUSCRIPT - LAVIE TIDHARDECEMBER 4: QUANDARY AMINU VS THE BUTTERFLY MAN - RICH LARSONDECEMBER 5: IN MERCY, RAIN - SEANAN MCGUIREDECEMBER 6: CHOKE - SUYI DAVIES OKUNGBOWADECEMBER 7: THIS PLACE IS BEST SHUNNED - DAVID ERIK NELSONDECEMBER 8: RED PYRAMID - VLADIMIR SOROKINDECEMBER 9: HOSPICE/HONEYMOON - JOYCE CAROL OATESDECEMBER 10: MY FIRST CAR - JOY WILLIAMSDECEMBER 11: HOW MANY - BRYAN WASHINGTONDECEMBER 12: KENNY BOND SHOT MY DOG - CHRISSY KOLAYADECEMBER 13: I KNOW YOU'RE THERE - PAUL TREMBLAYDECEMBER 14: THE THERESA JOB - COLSON WHITEHEADDECEMBER 15: CATTLE HAUL -JESMYN WARDDECEMBER 16: I LIKE YOUR SHOES - KEVIN BROCKMEIERDECEMBER 17: SOME OTHER ANIMAL'S MEAT - EMILY CARROLLDECEMBER 18: THE MOM OF BOLD ACTION - GEORGE SAUNDERSDECEMBER 19: THE WEIGHT - ANNE ENRIGHTDECEMBER 20: THE FIFTH STEP - STEPHEN KINGDECEMBER 21: OUR LIFE AS THE VOLCANO CULT - KAWAI STRONG WASHBURNDECEMBER 22: WRONG OBJECT - MONA SIMPSONDECEMBER 23: 68:HAZARD:COLD - JANELLE SHANEDECEMBER 24: A CHILD'S CHRISTMAS IN WALES - DYLAN THOMASDECEMBER 25: CATHAY - STEVEN MILLHAUSERDECEMBER 26: THE KINGDOM THAT FAILED - HARUKI MURAKAMIDECEMBER 27: ANNUNCIATION - LAUREN GROFFFROM THE BEFORETIMES:2016 short story advent calendar2017 short story advent calendar2018 short story advent calendar2019 short story advent calendar2020 short story advent calendar2021 short story advent calendar...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Dec 28, 2022","Dec 28, 2022","Dec 28, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22395267-notes-on-a-war-torn-childhood

It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeers. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared.cats are too smart to get snowballed. unlike the heroine of Snowballin': I Fucked Frosty, a veryfine book i wrote once upon a time. read it for yourself here:http://www.classicshorts.com/stories/...2022:DECEMBER 1: PORGEE'S BOAR - JONATHAN CARROLLDECEMBER 2: SKELETON SONG - SEANAN MCGUIREDECEMBER 3: JUDGE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING MANUSCRIPT - LAVIE TIDHARDECEMBER 4: QUANDARY AMINU VS THE BUTTERFLY MAN - RICH LARSONDECEMBER 5: IN MERCY, RAIN - SEANAN MCGUIREDECEMBER 6: CHOKE - SUYI DAVIES OKUNGBOWADECEMBER 7: THIS PLACE IS BEST SHUNNED - DAVID ERIK NELSONDECEMBER 8: RED PYRAMID - VLADIMIR SOROKINDECEMBER 9: HOSPICE/HONEYMOON - JOYCE CAROL OATESDECEMBER 10: MY FIRST CAR - JOY WILLIAMSDECEMBER 11: HOW MANY - BRYAN WASHINGTONDECEMBER 12: KENNY BOND SHOT MY DOG - CHRISSY KOLAYADECEMBER 13: I KNOW YOU'RE THERE - PAUL TREMBLAYDECEMBER 14: THE THERESA JOB - COLSON WHITEHEADDECEMBER 15: CATTLE HAUL -JESMYN WARDDECEMBER 16: I LIKE YOUR SHOES - KEVIN BROCKMEIERDECEMBER 17: SOME OTHER ANIMAL'S MEAT - EMILY CARROLLDECEMBER 18: THE MOM OF BOLD ACTION - GEORGE SAUNDERSDECEMBER 19: THE WEIGHT - ANNE ENRIGHTDECEMBER 20: THE FIFTH STEP - STEPHEN KINGDECEMBER 21: OUR LIFE AS THE VOLCANO CULT - KAWAI STRONG WASHBURNDECEMBER 22: WRONG OBJECT - MONA SIMPSONDECEMBER 23: 68:HAZARD:COLD - JANELLE SHANEFROM THE BEFORETIMES:2016 short story advent calendar2017 short story advent calendar2018 short story advent calendar2019 short story advent calendar2020 short story advent calendar2021 short story advent calendar...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Dec 24, 2022","Dec 24, 2022","Dec 24, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59606975-a-child-s-christmas-in-wales

Natasha had explained everything to him: go to Yaroslavsky Station and take the train toward Fryazevo or toward Schelkovo. Her station was Zagoryanskaya and not all trains stopped there. The train toward Fryazevo did, but the train toward Fryazino didn’t. Yura ended up on the train toward Fryazino.and i only decided to read this story because my dumb brain saw sorokin, mixed it up with Fyodor Sologub, and got all excited. the two authors' lifespans never overlapped on this earth, but in my brain, they are having drinks now. “Could you tell me when we’ll be at Zagoryanka?” he asked a thin old man with a cane and a pail in a string bag.“Never,” the old man replied laconically. “You got on the wrong train.”“What?”“Well . . . the train to Fryazino has never, ever stopped in Zagoryanka.”still, sometimes there are benefits to taking the wrong train/reading the wrong author, and—like the narrator in this story, i have discovered something new because of a silly error.

Something nestles within that millisecond—a sound like flowing water, though you can’t be sure. Too suddenly, you’re back at the table, everyone still trying to wrap their tongue around your name. Alessia, intermittently contributing to the conversation from the side table where she’s tossing salads, says: “Do you go by a nickname?” She digs at the bowl with wooden spoons and flips with practiced ease. “Like Kay, or something?”“Maybe what you need is an honorary American name,” says Charlotte, enthusiastic. “Name exchanges are great for cultural appreciation—you know the Indians used to do it with missionaries and soldiers? Anyway, my honorary Japanese name is Eiko. Means prosperous or something like that. I gave my friends American names, too: Kayleigh, Brooklyn, Chad. They love it.” She angles her head. “Maybe later you can give us African names?”Another flicker, this time a half second, the crack wide enough to fit several images: white sheets; the sickly gray of a spider’s web; bloodred; fingernails scraping wood. read it for yourself here:https://www.tor.com/2022/09/14/choke-...2022:DECEMBER 1: PORGEE'S BOAR - JONATHAN CARROLLDECEMBER 2: SKELETON SONG - SEANAN MCGUIREDECEMBER 3: JUDGE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING MANUSCRIPT - LAVIE TIDHARDECEMBER 4: QUANDARY AMINU VS THE BUTTERFLY MAN - RICH LARSONDECEMBER 5: IN MERCY, RAIN - SEANAN MCGUIREFROM THE BEFORETIMES:2016 short story advent calendar2017 short story advent calendar2018 short story advent calendar2019 short story advent calendar2020 short story advent calendar2021 short story advent calendar...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Dec 06, 2022","Dec 06, 2022","Dec 06, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/62039437-choke

Secondly, I know that a lot of the substitutions in vegan recipes that are there to replace things like eggs, dairy products and animal fats can put a lot of people off. With this in mind, I've tried to make sure that the recipes in this book are the kind which...just happen to be vegan, rather than being made vegan by using substitutes or processed ingredients. This is a book for meat eaters who are looking to incorporate more vegetarian, plant-based and fish-focused meals into their diets, but one that I hope will appeal to committed vegetarians, vegans and pescatarians, too.WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET'S FIND OUT! FETA, VEGGIE, AND LEMON BAKE (VEGETARIAN)i took some before-and-after-roasting pics and i'm glad i did, because this:[image]looks better than this:[image]and this:[image]looks better than this:[image]i am very on-board with one-pan recipes because the less time i have to spend with the oven on during this devil-season, the better. my feta didn't brown the way hers did, and i skipped the poison bombs (olives), but otherwise, i think this was a tasty success story. not the most filling of all meals, even in the reduced-appetite summer, but that's what bread is for!in conclusion,[image]BAKED GNOCCHI WITH TOMATOES, BASIL, AND MARINATED MOZZARELLA (VEGETARIAN)[image]another easy and delicious meal that follows the same ""throw it on a sheet pan and bake it"" philosophy as the first, and if you think i made my own gnocchi, you must not know that summer flattens me so much i can barely open a bag of gnocchi. [image]this was marred only by the fact that i didn't have any white balsamic vinegar, and my ordinary balsamic vinegar left an unseemly dark coloration on the mozz balls. if you care about this sort of thing, do not come to my house for luncheon. you will be horrified by my discolored balls. among other things. everything's horrifying 'round here.KIMCHEE FRIED RICE (VEGETARIAN)[image]this one may not look like much, because sometimes when it is hot and/or i am weary, i lack the energy to turn my apartment into a photo studio and i just wanna eat the bounty i have made and fall right to sleep. despite the murky photo, it was delicious, with just enough heat to wake those taste buds up without overpowering the flavor-depth and now i know how to make those little scrambled eggies that are in fried rice, which is a terrific thing to know how to do.SPICY, HERBY TWO POUCH MUJADARA (VEGAN)[image]this one isn’t super-quick—there’s a lot of prep-work with the herbs and pomegranate (although thomas has since taught me a game-changing secret to extracting pomegranate seeds), and the onions (red and white) need to caramelize for 40 minutes, but it is so worth it. it’s a lovely mix of flavors and textures: cumin, cinnamon, parsley, cilantro, green lentils, brown rice, and pomegranate seeds, and it tastes fresh and flavorlayered. it’s also absolutely beautiful, even when i’m behind the camera.[image]WARM ROASTED SPROUT SALAD WITH PECORINO AND PEAR (VEGETARIAN)[image]i figured i would use up some more of those hard-won pomegranate seeds and make this dish, and it was EXCEPTIONAL! the only thing that is cooked here are the sprouts; roasted up and tossed on top of the cold ingredients along with a dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, and MAPLE SYRUP! it's deliciously bonkers! and, when i was bringing some to thomas at work, i respected the mcDLT of it all and used a special compartment-tupperware to keep the cool side cool and the cooked side...room temperature awaiting its reheating. [image]although, honestly, i had some right outta the fridge without reheating and it tasted just as good.FRIED COURGETTES ON TOAST WITH RICOTTA AND FRESH HERBS (VEGETARIAN)i have discovered the food i want to be buried with. or in. either way. it is a truly unexpected combination of flavors i never would have thought to put together myself, so this cookbook get five stars for this revelation alone. JOIN ME ON THIS JOURNEY![image]so this pan has the zucchini (and, in an executive decision, some summer squash) that’s been olive oiled and seasoned with fresh thyme and MINT and a sploosh of vinegar, right? [image]and then you toast some pine nuts and generously ricotta a nice chonk of bread[image]and then you assemble it AND DRIZZLE HONEY ALL OVER IT! [image]and then you photograph it from a million different angles because it's just so pretty[image]and when you finally stop admiring it and actually eat it = heaven.[image]MAKE MY GRAVE OF ZUCCHINI! unless i die in england, and then MAKE MY GRAVE OF COURGETTES!...more",Notes are private!,2,80,1,"Jul 07, 2022",not set,"May 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50998930-one-pan-pescatarian

You know, the kind of Norway which is all the way out to Europe and The Icebound Race is in the pure literal frozen ice-hell of the Norwegian Arctic. You know, the kind of Norway which is all the way out to Europe and then all the way up to a town where the ratio of polar bears to people decidedly favors the bears.this is a longish, hallucinatory story about zombie sled races. going into it, i thought it was going to be like the iditarod, but with zombies pulling living humans along the ice, which is an arresting visual, but here it's somewhat different. during ""revenant season,"" the zombies buried underneath the snow are unearthed by the driving winds and begin walking around, where they are gathered by handlers who take care of them until race day. they have more motility than yer average zombie, because they race alone, on kicksleds, drawn by an impulse towards...something located at the north pole. they can also speak“Why do you race?”“It is inevitable.”the zombie racers are given a head start before the human competitors follow on their dogsleds and sometimes there are unfortunate encounters between the two types of racers. the event is new, but gaining momentum, and our heroine, an extreme-sports writer, is there to cover the race and its history, and also participate.her interview style is casual at best:“But how did it become the Icebound? How did people go from ‘Yeah, let’s all get on sleds and chase each other around some hungry undead corpses’ to—uh—‘Let’s get the hungry undead corpses on sleds and send them off at high speeds’?”“Reason other than poke-the-bear, bread-and-circuses kind of thing?” he asks, reaching over me to get the bottle.it starts out funny and jokey like that, but once the race begins, it's nothing but white wilderness as far as the eye can see, hour after relentless hour, and although the possibility of a zombie lagger always a tension-making possibility, the brain naturally slips into a hypnotic resting-state of introspection and self-scrutiny. and then the weird shit starts happening and the story gets slippery and jagged and i probably didn't understand all of it, but the parts i did were great, especially the way it keeps circling back to fate and choices, and i loved the narrator's voice and her ruminative wrestling with her own family legacy. Don’t get me wrong, I do have a survival instinct. I got it from my father, who managed to escape the old country by snaking under a kilometer of razor wire and throwing himself over concrete walls twice his height as he was shot at by fellow officers armed with Kalashnikovs. He made it, though his twin brother didn’t.“I had been right there,” he’d repeat with the same disbelief every time he told the story, “where he was hit. That same spot, a second earlier.” And he’d instruct me, cryptically, “Learn from me.”I was never sure what I was supposed to learn but I grew up obsessed with what it was that made the difference—one zag instead of a zig and I wouldn’t exist. Snap. Just like that.One zig instead of a zag and the bullet that felled my uncle would have chipped a concrete wall instead. And I’d be working in a tech startup or in marketing, because I wouldn’t have had to grow up with the horrible sentence: “I had been right there, a second earlier.”But zigs were zigged and zags were zagged and here I am, seeking out experiences on the edge of survival that I can package into marketable epiphanies for eight cents a word.this race is very much not for me, but the story, despite the murky whasshappening bits, very much was.

The perfect storm for any adolescent.this is a big messy jewish-american family saga in which a couple is broughNOW AVAILABLE!!Privilege and tragedy. The perfect storm for any adolescent.this is a big messy jewish-american family saga in which a couple is brought together by tragedy, their triplets are brought into existence by science, and the five of them spin off into their own separate orbits before being brought back together by another tragedy, and the efforts of another science-birthed sibling. the whole dysfunctional dramedy of the oppenheimer family is rooted in the sour soil of grief and guilt, with johanna first meeting future husband salo at his fiancée's funeral. twenty-year-old salo had been driving a jeep that crashed—killing two of his three passengers—and leaving him numb and ""tumbling."" meeting him again several years later at a wedding, johanna finds herself drawn to him and becomes determined to absorb all of his damage.From this moment forward it was all going to be about our father, and the great purpose of her life would be to love him enough to relieve him of his great burden, and to free him from that one, terrible shard of time in which he was so unfairly trapped, and to salve at last that wound of his, that one that wouldn't heal.for his part, salo shrugs into the relationship with no illusions, but also no great passionBut she knew what he'd done, and she was here anyway. Something inside him slipped into place: not love, not a sudden recognition of his own terrible loneliness, not even desire. Only he thought, looking at her, noting the obvious nervousness as she spoke and understanding that she wanted, for some unfathomable reason, his good opinion: Why not? Here was a pretty, amiable girl who seemed to have decided, apparently on the spot, that the redress of his great personal tragedy—for the record, not his own cosmic view of the matter—ought to be her purpose in life, or at least its priority.Why not? is not the most promising beginning to a love story, but the two of them get along well enough and begin married life in quiet prosperity. salo finds more comfort in art than in other people, and he uses his considerable family wealth and unerring eye for emerging talent to amass a private collection that will continue to appreciate in value over the years. meanwhile johanna longs for a family to cement her distracted, emotionally unavailable husband more firmly into her life. she struggles to get pregnant for years, consulting with fertility doctors and undergoing numerous unsuccessful procedures on her soul-crushing ""infertility journey."" in what is to be their final attempt, three fertilized eggs are implanted into johanna's womb while the final egg is frozen for the likelihood of a surrogate. but against all expectations, all three embryos ""take"" and johanna becomes pregnant with triplets.as arduous a process as it was to bring her children into the world, their conception turns out to be the easiest part of achieving johanna's dream of the big happy oppenheimer family, and the time that harrison, lewyn, and sally spent together in utero is the end of their closeness. the triplets don't have any use for each other, and salo spends more and more time acquiring and admiring his art collection in its temperature-controlled brooklyn warehouse while johanna waits in vain ""for the magical creative synergy of her happy children to fill the house."" she clings to her dreams of familial bliss, but their home life is nothing more than a collection of individuals quietly pursuing their own interests and her children have nothing but antipathy for each other.The three of them might rise but they simply declined to converge, even if they happened to actually share some interest or preference...To call them individually, in their distinct ways, ""quiet"" or ""self-reliant,"" for example, was to ignore the fact that Sally isolated herself to feel annoyed, Lewyn to feel wounded, and Harrison simply to escape the other two. So powerful was the force of their mutual aversion, and so ironic, given they had never actually been apart, that you might even have said it was the single thing they actually did share.wanting domestic harmony is not enough to make it so; every unhappy oppenheimer is unhappy in their own way, and ultimately johanna understands that nothing she has done has saved herself or salo.Finally, finally, the tiniest pinprick of reality came through the force field of her stubborn delusion, presenting Johanna with the first filament of an idea that it had all been a failure. They were two adults plus three children, made concurrently. They were five humans cohabiting. They were not, and never had been, a family.as her children prepare to head off to college, johanna discovers a shocking secret about her husband, and—faced with an empty nest of unfulfilled hopes and purposelessness, she makes arrangements to use a surrogate and her long-frozen embryo to bring phoebe into the world, quadruplets separated by seventeen years.what follows is a slow-burning story of a fragmented family unspooling through the triplets' college-years misadventures; three blood relations forging their own individual paths through the found families of mentors, friends, and love interests; trying on identities, shaping their values and seeking their purpose. although they have been blessed with every financial opportunity, they are nonetheless lonely and drifting; seeking connection, trying to grow into themselves untethered by the bonds of a family divided by petty jealousy, betrayal, and widely diverging sociopolitical worldviews. but then there's phoebe, determined to wrangle them all back together. it's a big satisfying chonk of a book full of all the good family drama stuff like infidelity, secrets, and inheritance, and it's dripping with juicy back- and side-stories where maladjusted and variously-unlikeable characters are forced to consider the world beyond their own privilege and education in matters of religion, sexuality, race, and ideologies. and chickens.everything circles back tidily and somewhat conveniently, and although it's centered around broken, yearning people, it's not a disillusionment bleakfest and it is often very funny. my only complaint is that, once the triplets leave home, johanna doesn't factor much into the story; she's central-but-absent from the narrative and their lives overall, which was disappointing to me, since she's the most proactive and interesting character. her stubbornness, sacrifice, and suffering are the catalyst for so many important plot points, and her choices have such profound consequences that it was a shame to lose access to her inner life so early into the book. it's kind of a perfect summer-book-club-book, so if you have one of those, give it a whirl.[image]come to my blog!!...more",Notes are private!,0,84,1,"May 11, 2022","May 17, 2022","May 11, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693566-the-latecomer

BUT, including a secondary character whose trans status is mentioned for no particular reason and does not serve the narrative in any way feels like the clumsiest checklisty lip service, shoehorning in some trans representation for what, diversity points? kinda cringy, IMO.[image]read it for yourself here:https://www.tor.com/2022/02/22/synthe...[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,not set,"Apr 23, 2022","Apr 30, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60803272-synthetic-perennial

My nightly ritual has burned away the shameful parts of my body and filled the rest with fire.i think i #missedthepoint of this one. here be spoilers, but this '' barely makes any sense—it's just a muddle of questions, so feel free to skip it on either or both of those grounds. i'm having some problems with this one, and since this was apparently the second-place winner of the LeVar Burton Reads competition (after the winning-winner The Last Truth), i know it's a me-problem and not a story-problem. i'm not faulting the writing—she does an excellent job getting across michelle's constant state of wallowing in shame and discomfort over her appearance; consumed with her negative body image and blaming what she sees as her physical imperfections on all of her life's disappointments: career, unrequited love, etc.and what she and wenqian reveal of themselves as they each audition for the same role is a slick way of bringing additional depth to their characters:Preston’s father exchanges lines with me as Billy, the reluctant hero destined to win the tournament and the pretty white girl. Lana only exists on a paper, but I understand her: overlooked, underestimated, taken for granted. I fill her anger and desire with my own, and it carries through my voice, my face, my body. The dialogue finishes, and I’m almost in tears.Parker takes notes in his phone as he speaks to me. “I originally conceived Lana as a quiet character, but you’ve got a style that’s edgier, more aggressive, kinda dragon lady . . . I like that. andThey watch the rest of her performance right through me. Her Lana is not mine, but she is beautiful: sweet and shy and heartbreaking, filled with an honest ambition. She yearns for affection and survival in a world that sees her as an outsider. She is painfully aware her love interest cannot truly understand her or her origin. As I watch, I realize this is not only Lana, this is Wenqian. but, like, what's the message here? because it's not ""accept yourself, warts and all"" because wenqian uses the same product and she's thriving in the precise ways michelle wants to thrive. so, what, self-transformation thru magical means is okay in moderation, but if you try to correct too much without working for it, your story becomes a tragedy and your only recourse is to throw your invisible body into the sea? acting, particularly for women, particularly for asian women, where fewer roles means more competition for those roles, is a job that necessitates a preoccupation with physical appearance, which is why physical trainers and stylists exist, but for those just starting out, a magical serum that does that work before the big break provides the mean$ to afford those professional services seems like a smart career move. and both girls take the risks of using a mysterious product that gives them an edge in that department, but—what—michelle uses too much, too quickly and she's punished for it? even though, according to her own self-assessment, she had more imperfections to correct to make her camera-ready?and i'm not sure what this is suggesting:I look at Wenquian, and I understand her now. She’s someone who carves her own path with sharp words and acrylic fingernails because she’s never had one laid for her. Perhaps she will make better, less desperate and naive, use of this. I leave the bottle on her desk.if their goals are the same, how is wenqian's intent any less desperate and naive? maybe i read this one too early in the day, before my brain woke up, but i'm just gonna move on and call it a day. the story is perfectly enjoyable, i just don't know what i was meant to take away from it.

So instead, we're just not invited.The fact that this wasn't news to Jo made it no less shocking.""The truth of it is, I don't think most of them really question our intelligence or abilities—though they don't mind us believing they do,"" Harriett continued. ""We're just turds in the punchbowl. We spoil their party. They don't want us hanging around."" i did not expect to like this one as much as i did. it sounded very much like The Power, a book i thought was o-kay, but i didn't love it as much as everyone else seemed to. the success of the handmaid's tale adaptation opened the floodgates on paradigm-shifting feminist dystopias (and YEESH—this is either the perfect time or the worst time for me to finally get around to reading Red Clocks, right?), and the #metoo movement sparked a rise in empowering female revenge novels (with or without supernatural power-powers, but—it must be said—far too many witch-novels). i've read and liked several of books coming out of this wave, but with some others, i've found that the concept is strong but the execution is...not. to use christina dalcher as an example, i have read two of her buzzy female-centric speculative novels—the ""women have no power"" Vox and the ""women have all the power"" Femlandia, and they were both pretty meh: too broad in scope, too facile in their treatment of their themes, and not addressing some fundamental questions in their constructed worlds. there was plot but no compelling message to the story. not that i'm expecting social fantasy novels to come up with a solution to gender inequality and the perils of the patriarchy, but it would be nice to walk away from a book with something more illuminating than flashy window dressing. The Change is so much more than window dressing. for one thing, it's not trying to take on too much. it's a small-scale story where, instead of trying to loop in alllll of womankind, it's centered on three women who experience transformations triggered by menopause: nessa can see the ghosts of murder victims, jo can channel her hot flashes into pure metal-melting incandescence, and the stunningly confident harriett emerges from the ashes of her marriage and career as some sort of sensual nature-goddess, feral and giving zero fucks. (or, giving A LOT of fucks, but not taking any guff about...anything)it's essentially a character-driven mystery novel in which these women become literally em-powered by THE CHANGE, using their gifts to obtain justice for a number of ""expendable"" young women lured, used, and brutally murdered within an exclusive long island enclave, their killers insulated by their wealth and power. the three central characters are excellent and more than the sum of their powers. they are bright and lively, with half a lifetime of experiences stacked up in their respective backgrounds to aid in their amateur investigation, and a willingness to get their collective hands a little dirty seeking justice for the forgotten victims. despite the dark situation, there's a lot of humor and light weirdness threaded throughout, especially in their dealings with particular kinds of men. all of them have endured men behaving like shits—been condescended to, groped, dismissed, passed over professionally (and the chapter where jo is applying for a business loan is GOLD), and while menopause may mark the end of their fertility, it is only the beginning of a new stage of womanhood, and things are gonna get ferocious. Jo could feel the fire shooting through her veins and waves of energy traveling down her limbs. She saw heat ripples radiating from her skin and smelled the grass singing beneath her feet. She'd tried her best to control it. Now Jo closed her eyes and let go. Nothing had ever felt so good. She knew then what she was meant to do. She knew why Nessa had found her. Nessa was the light in the darkness. Harriett was the punishment that fit the crime. She was the rage that would burn it all to the ground. it's fun, compelling, fast-paced, and cheeky, but above all, fierce. and, since lady-cancer catapulted me into premature menopause, i'm expecting my powers to manifest ANY DAY NOW. best not piss me off, yeah?

""And most of them are shitbags.""oh, Ymir, it's not you, it's me. this is a fantastic book for a different reader—one with an appetite for cyberpunk/near future stuff. i consistently struggle with SF because i have no imagination, and even the smallest bit of tech-stuff leaves me panicked with incomprehension, so i was floundered in over my head with this one.i loved Annex and several of his short stories*, and i like Beowulf and i LOVE Grendel, so i figured it would be an excellent pairing, but alas, i am not the right reader for this book. it's a very loose interpretation of b-wulf—these aren't your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great granny's grendels: Grendels have distributed processing, a dozen odd nodes that are in constant flux around the reactor—not unlike the nervous systems of the clever cephalopods, the ones the company breeds on some colony worlds for marine work. Humans have an echo of the same in their limbic system, in reflex and instinct.they're all xenocarbon armor and ports and filaments that burrow into your EYES to communicate and in the rest of the book there's nerve suits and geophages and drones and droids and ansibles and gutjacks and holomasks and torpor pools and teledocs and debodying and bubblefabs and all of that to say that larson has Done the Work of worldbuilding, but i am lost within his world. i'm fine with the bodymod stuff—having just seen Crimes of the Future, i have no problem encountering a detachable mandible or a leg containing a musical instrument, but futuristic weaponry and neurochemical manipulation are way beyond my abilities. it was not a complete loss, though—underneath all the futuretech is a timeless human story of estranged brothers and revenge and lost opportunities for reconciliation, and it is powerful stuff, and the cityscapes peppered with orphans and oddballs was very appealing. also—lots of creative violence, people reduced to ""rearranged meat"" and such. loved that for me. additionally, the dystopian-mystery/rebellion elements were great; there's an almost noir aspect to the suspense, in the way that Blade Runner is noir, and i appreciate the gloomy humor:Yorick knows that now is the time to stay put. To stay safe. He can drink himself into a stupor in the furnished oblivion of his hotel room, order the host droid to bring an endless parade of bottles up the endless staircase. He can gorge himself until his shrunken stomach is screaming, then throw it all up in the toilet. These are a few of his many pastimes.but while i'm sure the rest of it would be incredibly entertaining and original to someone whose brain works in a way that mine does not, i can only be the reader that i am and no one is more disappointed in me than myself. * i just looked, and this is an unprecedented short story winning streak: i have five-starred How Quini the Squid Misplaced His Klobučar, Painless, Our King and His Court, Meat and Salt and Sparks, and The King in the Cathedral, which goodreads deleted from the site but you can read here and my deleted from GR  is still over on blog.the only one i gave fewer than five stars was Dark Warm Heart. clearly, my love of rich larson will prevail despite me not loving this one.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jul 04, 2022","Jul 09, 2022","Apr 15, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42779064-ymir

Only truths a lockbreaker has told nobody else can open a lock. As soon as a truth is spoken aloud to the lock, it disappears, unusable—and the memory that sparked it goes too. i'm so glad to be back on the tor-short-train after derailing myself for a couple of months, but also so angry that i missed reading this one when it first dropped on the site. it's a beautiful, haunting, bittersweet story, powered by the same 'memory-loss-as-identity-loss' theme as one of my all-time favorite books, The Book of M. even though this is such a compact little piece, i felt genuinely panicky and unmoored as eri's memories were stripped from her, which means that either AnaMaria Curtis is a fantastic writer or i've finally earned my reader-empathy wings. eri is an indentured thief, with freedom in her sights, but the task she has been set in exchange for her freedom is extremely demanding: She has opened nearly two thousand boxes since Mareck bought her from the prison ship and wrote her a contract: open every box on five ships, and he would let her go, far from where she came from, a free woman.every time eri opens a truth lock, she loses one of her memories, and since some locks require bigger truths than others, her memory-reserves are dwindling, her self-awareness is narrowing, and the promise of freedom is dulled by the uncertainty of what she will even have left of herself to build her new life upon. onboard this final-job's ship, she meets and befriends a violinist named anea, whose life is as restrictive and agency as limited as eri's, and yet, together they might have enough power between them to free each other.oh my god, it's just lovely and moving and it poked at my feels relentlessly. thank you, tor shorts, for taking this strayed reader back into yer fold.

The worst was inevitably what happened when you were in the company of vampires. oof, for the first time since 2014, i have fallen off the pony of reading one tor short a week. i didn't read ANY in february or march, and i haven't even ed two of the ones i read in january. i hate that i fall into a shame-spiral any time i fail to accomplish some stupid self-appointed goal or other, but i do, and now it's time to pull myself out! these judge dee stories keep getting better and better, and the bar was already set pretty high with the first one, Judge Dee and the Limits of the Law. this is the fourth (#2 - Judge Dee and the Three Deaths of Count Werdenfels, #3 - Judge Dee and the Poisoner of Montmartre, because i like to make things easy for y'all), and it's a sort of fang'ed version of And Then There Were None, where a group of vampires (and poor human-companion jonathan) are forced by circumstances to travel together...for safety. however, nothing's ever really safe when cranky vampires with grudges are gathered up under cover of night, and immortality's no obstacle to a vampire with a bone to pick. luckily, judge dee is there, along with jonathan—who's side-eyeing that bone, hoping to gnaw at whatever juicy meat remains—and these vampire-murderrrs will not go unvanquished, and the case is solved in a tidy and unexpected resolution. another clever and delightful story featuring this oddball pair, reaffirming my desire for MORE OF THEM, putting my wish once more into the universe for a physical collection of these stories to exist, and soon.

[image]...a select few people, myself included, have started to address this problem of death through real, hard, scientific research.*soon ken will learn just how HARD scientific research can get.*one evening, our hero’s superior—dr. morris, calls him into his office to examine a number of photographs sent by the FBI: candid shots of people from across the world, and in every one of them, a hooded figure with a skeletal face can be seen in the background, carrying a scythe. shortly after each photograph was taken, someone in the photo died. [image][image][image]dr. morris sends ken to meet with bill lancing, an expert who runs ""a very detailed website about this phenomenon"" and lives in a spooky victorian home filled with fancy antique furnishings.bill gets right to the exposition.""So I understand the FBI is interested in what I know about the reapers,"" questions Bill.*this is not a question, bill.*I nod. ""That’s correct.""""Well, where do I begin?"" asks the man.""Where did you first notice him?"" I start.Bill laughs. ""Him? Don’t tell me you honestly think this is just some guy traveling around the world killing people.""grim reaper ≠ santa.[image]""I think that the grim reaper is a very real thing,"" explains Bill, ""and my research has shown that. Not only is the grim reaper a real thing, but there are reapers all over the world, hundreds of them, an entire species.""""Like an animal?"" I ask.""Kind of,"" nods Bill. ""An invisible society of creatures that thrive off of the energy of the living.""[image]i can has yr energies? ""Here’s the thing that people don’t realize,"" explains the man, ""that the reapers aren’t necessarily feeding on life, just energy. That means if you want to stop them you can give them energy of any kind; emotional, physical, sexual,""hold up—were these options always on offer? why is death still a thing if all we need to do to avoid it is give ‘em a little emotional support?[image]this statement, more than seeing the grim reaper lurking over the photographed shoulder of some birthday boy, gives ken the willies. but let's not get ahead of ourselves—ken's got plenty of willies in his future.The second that bill [sic.] says this the hairs on the back of my neck stand up on end. I had already guessed that he was a creepy guy based on a myriad of [sic.] other factors, but the sexual energy thing completely comes out of nowhere.  ken's ready to GTFO, but first:""I like to take a photograph of every person who comes here asking about the reapers,"" explains Bill. ""It’s for safety. When they know that you’re talking about them, they’ll start coming for you first.""""Why aren’t they coming for you?"" I ask.*lots of coming here, foreshadowing…lots of coming. do you like these interjections, yes or no?*Bill shrugs and then snaps a photograph of me. ""I guess I’m not their type,"" he says. ""They tend to go for guys who are already questioning their sexuality.""[image]is that a banana in your pocket or are you questioning your sexuality? just a banana? fuck off, then. what does bill’s photograph of ken reveal??I gasp. There in the windows behind me is an entire gang of grim reapers, peering inward with there [sic.] strange skeleton grins.”[image]so, just to track this—one grim reaper means you’re going to die [image](although you can negotiate with vaguely defined physical or emotional energy, or with the more straightforward sexual energy), whereas MANY grim reapers [image]means you are talking about them AND you are questioning your sexuality, which apparently applies to ken, although it has not heretofore been mentioned. bill takes another photo, showing the reapers are now inside the house, moving closer to ken and his (apparently) flexible sexuality.[image]""They’re looking for energy,"" says Bill, ""it all depends on what kind you want to give them.""which energy will ken choose to give them?A) emotional energy, expressed through a platonic side-hug?[image]or by listening sympathetically to death's problems?[image]B) physical energy, which is—what—food, maybe? [image]C) sexual energy[image]or D) his life energy[image]If you answered C, someone musta told you this was monsterporn!ken is ready to experience the little death (that's a euphemism for ORGASM, kids) with this merry band of capital-d deaths (thos're reapers, kids) (wait, why are there kids here? go back to sleep, kids. stay in school.)Honestly, I should be terrified right now but, instead, I find myself overwhelmed with a different, more powerful emotion; gay lust.[image]okay, so are we calling lust an EMOTION now? so does it qualify as 'emotional energy?' i still don't understand how any of this works. it gets even more confusing. the reapers are still invisible outside of the camera lens, and the sexual/emotional energies keep blurring together:I might not be able to see these creatures, but I can certainly feel their presence, an aura of aching passion that builds and builds all around me. The reapers are communicating through feelings, an unexplainable presence that consumes my body.so reapers are MADE of feelings? who’s giving what to whom here?now that bill’s pimp-work done, he slinks on outta there. I am now completely alone in the spooky old room. but not ENTIRELY alone, yeah? [image]ken first feels the reapers' ""homosexual aura,"" and then he feels a whole lot more, as their invisible hands undress him and feel up his rock-hard abs and rock-hard genitals. the first GIS match for ""homosexual aura"" is this:[image]but that can’t be what he means, can it? this is the second match:[image]so it MUST be what ken's talking about, although it makes me understand this story even less.one more question—are all reapers homosexual? and are there lady-reapers for us ladies to give our sexual energies to so we can scissor our way out of death? jeezaloo, GIS never fails:[image]anyway, back to the story, i guess. ken isn’t looking for some anonymous encounter, he wants his first orgy with a gang of supernatural murderers to be SPECIAL.""Let me see you,"" I beg. ""I want to see you.""and then he can. it is unclear how many of them there are—bill speculated there were ""hundreds"" working ‘round the world, ken has called them ""a gang;"" you’d think a scientist would offer more in the way of quantitative precision when confronted with the very thing he has devoted his life to studying but okie-dokies. let's just say ""too many"" and leave it at that. the reapers, in unknown quantities, reveal themselves.They are equal parts horrific and hot in their long black robes [image]if you’ve been thinking ahead about the mechanics of this impending boneparty, wondering if ken will be poked at by a bony boner,[image]or frustrated by a neutered dry hump, [image]never freaking fear:Despite the fact that the faces of these reapers are entirely skeletal, their cocks are warm and fleshy, perfectly normal aside from the enormous size. It’s as if these members have been magically affixed.i’m sorry, scientific researcher, but ""magically affixed"" is a shitty explanation. leaving aside how the reapers are able to move about with nothing holding their skeletons together, what, exactly, are these flesh-peens attached to? is it just a bone(r) growing out of bone? does it hover? whose genitals are/were they? were they grave-robbed from corpses? are they zombie-dicks? where does the blood engorging them come from? do the reapers have to take them with them when they leave home like a wallet? and sometimes one shows up to a gangbang and they’ve forgotten it and they're all ""drat, can i borrow yours?"" is this ""boning one’s way out of death option"" ALWAYS a gangbang? why are they all congregating here—is it just because they heard some guy was asking about them and they got all flattered and aroused? is no one dying while they're busy going to town on ken? what is dr. morris a dr. OF?monsterporn is not taking any questions at this time.""Overwhelmed with gay arousal,"" ken does what comes naturally when one finds oneself at the center of a circle of horny grim reapers, and plays a game of ring around the blowie. blow around the ring-y? whatever, he puts those undead genitals in his mouth. although he is providing ""an enthusiastic greeting"" to his visitors, he’s still a novice at this, and gagging ensues. but he's very contrite about it.""I’m sorry, let’s try that again,"" I offer.oh my god, they have testicles.[image]I look up at the creature’s hollow eyes and give a playful wink, allowing him to enjoy the sensation of complete consumption as he holds me here.isn't the one with the penis in their mouth the one who is doing the holding? are these balls holding this dog?[image]ken is holding both the balls and the do(n)g, and then he remembers he has hands, and puts them to good use on the other creatures, who rotate in and out, taking turns visiting handy-town, letting loose with ""otherworldly moans.""ken’s ready to take the next step in this polyamorous relationship, beseeching the gang of ghouls with “wild, lustful eyes” and this declaration:""I want you inside of my ass,"" I beg. ""I need your big, thick, grim reaper cocks.""""We accept your offering,"" I [sic.] loud booming voice says, surrounding me as it hammers down from every angle.speaking of hammering from every angle, ken is quickly getting the hang of this.""Get over here and pound this tight twink asshole!"" I command.and one does, introducing his ""magical undead dick"" into ken's virgin ground. ken's pillow talk is super banal""Oh fuck, oh fuck,"" I begin to cry, unable to contain all of the pleasant sensation as it flows through me.""You’re fucking me so good!""I’m ready to continue my erotic diatribe but, at this point, another one of the reapers kneels down before me and shoves his massive rod between my lips.[image]note to twink: look up the word ""diatribe"" in your dicktionary. I want to be completely used by the reapers, their own personal gay sex toy for the evening. I can only imagine how little these mysterious creatures get a chance to fuck, and they show their pent up sexuality in every hedonistic movement.yeah—let's take pity on these poor lonesome life-taking incels. Eventually, the monsters in both of my holes[image]pull out and let another pair have a turn, trading places within my tightness as they form lines at either end of the coffee table. Each of the new reapers is just as skilled as the first, however, picking up right where the last ones left off and plowing away at my body with a passionate fury.[image]apart from the two-line system, which is excellent organ-ization, how hard is it (heh) to ""pick up right where the last ones left off,"" and does it merit praise as ""skillful?"" it’s just banging after all—you put the thing into the other thing with a passionate fury—this isn’t a choreographed dance routine[image]ken's about to cross over into orgasmville, but then everybody leaves his body before he can. rude.one of the reapers plops down on the antique—and probably quite flimsy—coffee table, (and how is that comfortable, with only his robe to cushion his spine, although i guess—no nerve endings?), ""his massive cock jutting out from the robes like a beautiful tower of aching flesh.""ken is sex-drunk and writing some fine poetry here, but death ain't here for ken's imagery.""Get on,"" a booming spectral voice commands.so he does, scooting his butt over the supine skellington.Every grind of my hips grows harder and harder, my body still trying to adjust to his size until finally the sensation is just too incredible and I begin to fuck him hard, riding his dick like a jackhammer.got that? he fucked him harder and harder until he…fucked him hard. this isn’t an escalation, ken. use words better.1) while you’re looking up ‘diatribe’ in your dicktionary, maybe also consult a thesaurus for another word for ""hard.""2) in order for the jackhammer imagery to work—YOU need to be the one wielding the tool, i.e. being the jackhammer. no one rides a jackhammer (*resists urge to GIS*). this is the ball and the dog all over again.and then, a sneaky grim reaper impatiently slides into ken's backdoor for some supernatural DP action and now there are TWO thick reaper cocks in his butt [image]I look back at the monster in shock, but what started as a moment of anger quickly transforms into a lustful gay snarl.this is what conservatives warned us about—now even our SNARLS are turning gay! The three of us eventually find a rhythm together, pulsing like some strange, sexual hybrid.[image]ken is permitted to come and promptly makes a mess everywhere. ken is a terrible houseguest.""That was fucking amazing,"" I gush.no, sir, you ALREADY gushed, all over bill's vintage furniture. let someone else have a turn. The next thing I know, the reaper who fucks my asshole from behind another interjection to point out that somehow we have moved from the present continuous to the habitual present tense—does this mean that this particular reaper will ALWAYS be fucking ken's asshole from behind? or that this is how ken will introduce him to his social circle? ""i'd like you to meet reaper #5. he fucks me asshole from behind."" and, not to slut-shame, but there are A NUMBER of reapers who have earned this distinction, so it's gonna get confusing. sorry, back to the orgyhas picked up speed, slamming me hard and then pushing deep as he explodes with a payload of hot, milky jizz. His cum fills my ass quickly, gushing forth with a supernatural intensity until its [sic.] squirting out from the edges of my packed anal rim.the undead line up to fill him. A NUMBER of them.[image]UGH, okay, so i have to continue this  over on blog, because gr is stingy with  space. to read the conclusion—and you may as well, you've already come this far, go to here.2022 monsterporn:JANUARY: BAKUFEBRUARY: Taken by the Scorpionmonsterporn archives[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Mar 30, 2022","Mar 31, 2022","Mar 30, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27277028-monsters-made-me-gay

This created a gold rush.Lawyers, politicians, hell, even sociologists would spend the next decade trying to explain what was going on with these juries in East Texas—they were not only unusually sympathetic to plaintiffs in patent cases but were also prone to delivering verdicts with huge dollar amounts. Thousands of legal articles and dissertations were written on the subject, but it all boiled down to this: when people who are overlooked for their entire lives are given a modicum of power, they will wield it with great force.in The Local, the legal niche of patent litigation is overseen by the affable judge gardner. over the years, he has streamlined the process into the most efficient system for handling the heavy caseload by enforcing a five-day limit for any trial, ensuring that big firms representing deep-pocket clients can't use any financial-siege strategies to drag out the case until the plaintiff is forced to retreat or go broke fighting. and since most global-billion-dollar companies, and the clients suing them, are not situated in marshall, texas, both parties must retain local counsel. enter james euchre. okay, so this is going to be a too-long quote for many of you, but hartstone lays out the process so much better than i could summarize. plus, it'll give you a sense of the voicey clarity of his prose, so i'm only slightly apologetic about it:So where did I come in? Lawyers are licensed to practice law in specific jurisdictions, namely in the state or states where they have passed the bar exam and where their law firms are based. When a case takes lawyers out of their jurisdictions, they need to add someone within the new state to the team. That someone is called local counsel.A local can do as much or as little as the rest of the team demands. Often, a local counsel does nothing more than advise the team on any unique quirks of that particular venue and serve as a signatory on any documents that need a regional John Hancock. All of this can be done for a nominal fee. Clients may never even realize that a local is on their team. That's how it used to be in Marshall. After all, intellectual property law is complex, and no one in East Texas had ever tried a patent case. Lawyers here, though, had other skills that aren't taught at top ten law schools. It didn't take long for white-shoe law firms to discover that something was missing, something essential that local counsels could provide. Here's a scenario that happened too many times to count. A twin-engine Cessna Citation with the inevitable moniker ""Law Firm One"" touches down at the quiet Harrison County Airport. Six attorneys step off their firm's jet, all wearing bespoke suits purchased on Madison Avenue. A private car, probably from Dallas, picks them up and drives them five miles, past broken fences and run-down trailers, into town. They march into the courthouse with Italian leather briefcases and polished expert witnesses. A casual observer may understand that this doesn't go over too well with our juries, but rich and powerful people often lack self-awareness. There was a major disconnect between our humble citizens of Marshall and these corporate attorneys from big cities. To make matters worse, some of thee people thought they could fake their way into the good graces of the jurors. I've seen out-of-town lawyers go straight from the airport to the Boot Barn on Pinecrest Drive, buy a pair of shiny new Buckaroos, and then walk their blistered feet into court as if they've just come from the ranch. Mistakes like this have cost clients millions.The top patent law firms around the country began to realize that what was missing from their teams was someone who spoke the language, someone who could connect with the eight citizens on the jury. The more we locals were asked to speak, the more the jurors seemed to listen. Locals, who for so long had been undervalued and underused, were finally being called upon to perform an indispensable service. Like strong pinch hitters and clutch relief pitchers, our roles were small but vital. And we began to be paid accordingly.So it came to pass that the best trial lawyers were not in Houston, Austin, or Dallas but rather in a small corner of the state, practicing an area of law that none of us had ever studied, working on cases worth tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. We were the final component to a billion-dollar industry, a magnificent legal universe created by one visionary judge in Marshall, Texas. phew—you still here? hi! so but even if you don't think patent law is gonna hold your interest, don't worry, because it's really about the murrrrderrrr of that verysame visionary judge, in a trial where euchre is uncomfortably placed in the position of defending the man accused of killing his friend, father figure, and mentor; his “favorite person in the world,” the investigation of which exposes the dirty business of smalltown politics, secrets, and dusty rivalries. euchre must also confront the burdens of the past, both his personal demons of loss, addiction, and daddy issues and the larger-picture issues of racial bias in smalltown texas. also, his client is kind of a dick. but maybe not a murderer. it is a super-quick read—it has more meat to it than a screenplay, but it reads with that same energy, making it a real page-turner through euchre’s sifting through clues and red herrings all the way to its satisfying showdowny conclusion. the romance subplot is perhaps a little threadbare and perfunctory, and layla’s character could have been fleshed out a bit more, but apart from that, it’s a spectacularly fun debut.  and when he dropped the “one-party consent” line, i cheered, since that is a veritable staple of The Good Wife-verse, evoked enough times that you could make a drinking game out of it. [image]you could even make a drinking game out of drinking, as this round up of all the times kalinda♥ and alicia drink together proves.anyway, it’s a brisk summer read filled with fascinating information about patent law, which is a sentence i never thought i would write.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Jun 07, 2022","Jun 08, 2022","Mar 29, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59109030-the-local

Elsewhere definitely has elements of folk horror to it—all goats and sexual bloodletting, the insularity of a self-sufficient town where no one ever leaves, where anything beyond the borders is simply called ""elsewhere,"" where townsfolk treat the few outsiders who do visit with a mix of fascination, reservation, pity, and condescension, living their small pleasant lives quietly resigned to the fact that some of their mothers might just poof out unexpectedly, and life just goes on, children pairing off, girls growing older, getting married, giving birth, maybe disappearing themselves.and it does have a secret kernel to it, which makes it hard to  without spoilerz, but i will say that this book is way more than horror, folk or otherwise—it's an insightful, emotionally resonant and richly themed meditation on the whole experience of motherhood through the eyes of vera, whose mother went when she was a girl, who becomes a mother at the risk of doing the same to her own daughter, and the magical realism elements are just the delivery mechanism for a very literary take on maternal love and loss and sacrifice summed up perfectly by this line: You do not get to keep what is sweetest to you; you only get to remember it from the vantage point of having lost it.because the appreciation of this slim novel lies in the reader discovering it for themselves, i will tread lightly and focus on only two of its five parts (by which i mean ""plop out a lot of passages i loved that don't give anything away"")—the first, when vera is a child, and a stranger named ruth visits them, and the second, after vera has married a man named peter and given birth to a daughter named iris.one of the most notable events of vera's childhood is ruth's arrival to the town. strangers are so uncommon in their community that her presence creates a stir amongst the townsfolk: That night as we ladled stew into bowls, brushed the tiny pearl teeth of children, walked dogs down damp streets, we felt the stranger's presence; it seemed we did these things for her, as if, while our town's population had increased by a single person, we had also doubled, become both ourselves and the sight of ourselves, now that we had a stranger to see us.the residents can always feel when a mother has gone, at which point they will cluster in front of her home, where all photographs of the departed will be removed and ritualistically burned, and the mother's possessions will be divided amongst the remaining women. ruth, witnessing the aftermath of a mother's going, cannot understand their placidity in the face of what she finds shocking.She could only see the horror of it. She couldn't see what we saw: Something happened here that happened no place else. We didn't know why it happened, or how. We didn't demand answers from it because our affliction itself had taught us that you cannot wrest answers from a mystery. We submitted to it. We bore it, carried it, so that there would be a place on this earth where people lived as we did and knew the things we knew. We did this not only for ourselves but also for them, for her, even if she could not appreciate it. We were necessary.people, even mothers, die from natural causes in the town, but the phenomenon of mothers vanishing is different, sacrosanct. the physical body is gone, and there's no pattern to who goes and who is spared, although the women try to determine after the fact if there were any signs—whether a mother loved their child too much or too little, what determining factors they might have missed, always wondering if they will be the next to go, but powerless to predict or avoid it. A girl became a mother who stayed or a mother who went, an outcome that surprised us, or didn't. Impossible to predict, what motherhood would bring out of a woman, what it would show her about herself, the end to which it would carry her.what an outsider cannot understand is that theirs is a glad burden more than a resignation or acceptance, and vera, although captivated by ruth—by the novelty of a stranger—knows she can never truly assimilate into their world. She couldn't comprehend that a mother's going belonged to all of us, or that loss was the smallest part of it, because in losing her, we received everything else. Our affliction opened us to pain, yes, but also to heights of beauty, and of love, that people elsewhere would never know because they did not know what it was to love in the shadow of our affliction, our love deepened and made wild by the threat that hovered over it. Our affliction was terrible, but it was not as terrible as living without it.their only real contact with elsewhere is mr. phillips, a necessary outsider who brings them supplies four times a year, and even he struggles to accept their attitude towards their affliction:...he knew that the mother had not died, but he could not grasp what had happened to her instead, nor find any way to feel about it except this simple sadness and a wishing against it, no different than if the mother had caught a fever or fallen from a great height. He couldn't access what it meant to us, and if he couldn't, it was unreasonable to expect Ruth, who had known us only weeks, to grasp it even half as well.the theme of an outsider unable to access an insular community is later echoed in vera's relationship to her daughter; a specific combination of adoration and resentment inherent between mothers and daughters that she understood before she became a mother herself:A mother was a chance to hate someone as much as you loved them, caring and wounding, a push and pull that only tightened the knot that bound you. While I envied the other girls their mothers, it felt right to me that I didn't have mine. Difficult, but comforting, the way I suppose one's life always feels. and became even more relevant when she had iris; whenever peter tried to intervene in their squabbles:He didn't understand that a mother and daughter cannot be protected from one another, that the harms that pass between them cannot be mitigated because they are also expressions of love.although theirs is a happy family, and peter loves iris unreservedly, the mother-daughter bond is a different, exclusionary beast; a powerful, all-encompassing, desperate, and fierce relationship, all the more fraught for its ephemerality. when iris is stung by a bee: Peter tried to gather her in his arms, but she broke free of him and ran sobbing across the yard and up the porch steps to me. She climbed into my lap and I told her soon, soon, the pain would fade. I looked across the yard at Peter. I could see the hurt in his eyes, and I wanted to wish that Iris had let him soothe her, but I couldn't make myself wish it. I wanted to wish she were not in pain, but I couldn't do that either, because the pleasure of soothing it went so deep.I thought that I should want what Peter and Iris had, a simpler, less turbulent love, parent and child instead of the two-bodied creature Iris and I became together. But I could not make myself want it. I couldn't get enough of our push and pull, the spell we cast upon each other, our love like a secret chamber we shared, and always, no matter where we were or what we were doing, we were also in that chamber together. I loved to love her this way, even as I worried that this love might not be what a child needs, that it might also be a kind of harm.this  is a mess because the book rocked me with its beautifully rendered exploration of the minefield of maternal love and my profound feels are impeding my ability to make words work, but trust me, it's a swooner of a book and the best folk horror not folk horror story i've read. five stars! *happy pride month! for our purposes here (and ONLY here, in discussing the visual narrative of the book cover), let's pretend gender is binary.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,80,1,"Jun 08, 2022","Jun 10, 2022","Mar 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58725012-elsewhere

Constant attention made you need it even more. The band never learned to be alone and neither did we. But if they were starved for attention and we were, too, didn't we make a perfect pair?through faun's eyes, we are immersed in a celebration of the glamor and grit of the 70s music scene, where Life was rainbows and muck—given a doped-up backstage pass to holiday sun's highs and lows; a neverending party where underage girls drift in and out of the bars and bedrooms of the rich and famous and no one is ever sober for long. faun, who has spent her life treading the paths that dazzling josie boldly cut through the world, soon becomes intoxicated by the buzzy lifestyle and...various intoxicants, networking via parties and hookups, chronicling holiday sun's bacchanals, and spinning out beautifully. Life kept getting better. Broader. My world was expanding so quickly that I couldn't stop it, nor did I want to.it's a splashy, ragged-edged, guilty-pleasure story—who doesn't love a juicy tell-all, even when it's about an imaginary band? but it's not all good-time frivolity and fandom—in a shocking act of betrayal, faun makes a selfish decision that spirals into capital-c consequences, and then faun's drinking-unto-oblivion is more about squashing her guilt than having a good time, gleaning some hard-won insights along the way.Everything I'd loved I'd lost, and every time I'd lost it, I said it was my own fault. A lot of the time it was. But not always. Self-pity is so simple. So is self-blame. Easier than having to understand the world doesn't revolve around you, that it doesn't always love you back.the world most certainly doesn't love groupies, and josie and girls like her are scrutinized and judged by jealous holiday sun fans and those people who love to hate any expression of female sexuality.People said she was self-obsessed and conniving, only interested in Cal and his kin for the fame. People said the same of any groupie. We all want things. Desire's not deviant. It's human nature.it's a pretty impressive debut—priscus' writing is like movie-buttered popcorn: slick and addictive, with some nicely-phrased descriptions <--- that last quality is not to be found in movie-buttered popcorn:The tears on my cheeks had dried, leaving my face tense and shiny. I had a look of slept-in insanity, with eyes that felt burst, but I didn't cry again.along with the behind-the-scenes dirt of the music scene, priscus captures a moment in time, where—despite all the casual sex and substance abuse, the world seemed safer, more innocent: Roaming the streets alone didn't scare her—it bored her. It bored all of us. Sure, socially I sometimes felt anxious enough to puke, but when I was out walking, I was never afraid. The world seemed bright and open-armed, not deadly. My mother had been wrong about everything.We were at the very end of the golden era of fearless girls. Soon, women would learn distrust, pumped full of fear by serial-killer newsreels and common sense. But those things weren't in our reality yet. They existed but seemed impossible. Faraway. False. Sure, soon, every girl would look over her shoulder at every turn and lock her car as soon as she hopped into it—but not quite yet. We were still lawless and mindless. Gaggles of bright-eyed girls would prod at each other on the bus, sharing lipstick by kissing, leaving home with only a five-dollar bill and, if they were cautious, a house key. We'd kiss anyone and touch anyone and go anywhere with anyone, as long as the person smiled.i mean, that's for sure some sugarcoating and revisionist history thru drug-smacked eyes—the world has never been safe for women, but it's a lovely dreamworld sentiment nonetheless, although faun will very quickly learn that this perception of safety is really just willful ignorance; turning a blind eye to the reality of abuse going on all around her. it's a solid story about being young and dumb; unapologetically bursting through life, making mistakes and paying the price. it's a 3.5, but i'm rounding up, why not?[image]come to my blog!!...more",Notes are private!,0,101,1,"Jun 30, 2022","Jul 03, 2022","Mar 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57883989-groupies

Once she does, she sees how the lies will build, brick after brick into a fortress designed to protect, but protection means separation, means they will never be as close as he thinks or she wants, and one mistake, one misremembered detail, will be enough to take down the whole thing, burying them both beneath its rubble.the real hook here is the novelty of a woman carrying on two separate lives, because the world is a little less forgiving towards women—towards mothers—trying to have it all: Sometimes it still shocked me, the way Lore didn't seem to see what she'd done as unforgivable in the eyes of those she'd hurt. How did she learn to judge herself so gently in a world that taught women to nail themselves to the cross for any tiny infraction?i know, right? lore eventually agrees to be interviewed by cassie, against the wishes of her family, with the stipulation that she won't talk about the night of andres' murder. lore's story unfolds in a series of flashbacks of her past and what drove her to risk her happy life in texas with fabian and their twin sons gabriel and mateo by marrying andres in mexico. during the course of these interviews, lore and cassie's relationship develops into a familiar quid pro quo dynamic; lore becoming a sort of lady-lechter forcing cassie to excavate and take a hard look at the shame she's been marinating in over the secrets of her own past—her alcoholic father, the death of her mother, and the brother she left behind—and both women are profoundly affected by the emotional clarity that comes from revisiting their life's most painful choices. lore proves to be a somewhat unreliable narrator, giving cassie a version of the truth while holding on to some of her secrets. however, cassie is a highly motivated amateur sleuth, hoping this story will kickstart her journalistic career, and once she susses out the whole truth behind andres' death, she is faced with a difficult choice that makes her reevaluate her own long-held beliefs about her chosen profession. When it's done right, true crime tells us who we are, who we should fear, who we are always in danger of becoming. Under a careful investigative eye, someone opaque briefly becomes transparent. Even if what's revealed is ugly, it's true. And nothing is more beautiful than the truth.like so many books seem to be nowadays, the reader (and cassie) are invited to consider the sticky nature of our fixation with true crime as entertainment, commodifying other people’s secrets and blanketing epicaricacy-nosiness under the noble banner of truth.and there’s the looming ""there-but-for-the"" of:...someone who had killed under a set of specific circumstances. And couldn't that be true for most of us? If true crime had taught me anything, it's that if we never see that version of ourselves, it's only because we're lucky.so it's basically two excellent character-studies smooshed together in a story of sacrifice and secrets, perspective and the justification for tiptoeing that fine line between selfishness and self-preservation. lore is a deliciously complex paradox of a character—she loved her family, but felt that, given a different set of circumstances, she could have become a different kind of woman—she needed two separate lives to become the best version of herself. lore's was an extreme, unconventional form of personal growth—happy with her life, but inquiring what else what else...it wasn't the recession or loneliness that brought her here. It wasn't that she no longer loved Fabian or wanted their marriage to end. It was a different kind of yearning. A nameless suspicion that there was more to herself than she'd ever accessed, and only by falling in love could she discover it, for only then do we become new to ourselves again.instead of getting a room of her own she got a whole 'nother husband, and she felt she became a fuller person enriched by both of her lives. ...perhaps not every affair is about lack in the primary relationship; perhaps some are about a complement. Perhaps multiple relationships can illuminate different parts of the self, like a prism turned first this way, then that, toward the light. Perhaps to love and allow love from only one person at a time is to trap the self into a single, frozen version, and it's this that makes us look elsewhere.however, there's always a price of a woman knowing herself, of wanting more than she has, and in her case, it was ruinous to both of her lives. Lore had never been blameless to me. That was the point. She was so hungry to know her own heart she was willing to destroy those she loved most, including—paradoxically—her children.this is a perfect summertime book—a richly descriptive slow-burning page-turner that delivers more to consider than the average suspense-genre novel. lore is a beautifully flawed character and cassie is a fine counterpoint to her larger-than-life personality. it is a spectacular debut full of deft insights that doesn't skimp on the rough fallout of domino-consequences.i'll let lore play this  out with her musings on the cost of motherhood to a woman's sense of self:Now the idea of more children is unthinkable. Lore lost herself in those early years with Gabriel and Mateo. If you'd asked her then what her favorite meal was, her favorite movie, her favorite hobby, she wouldn't have known. It was as if Lore—the person, the woman—had disappeared, consumed by Lore the mother. The idea of taking maternity leave again, molding her life around a baby's insatiable need while also making sure the cuates were fed and clean, their homework done, chauffeured on time to school and sports—and the house livable, groceries bought, bills paid, her marriage nurtured: quicksand. By the time she clawed her way out, she wouldn't recognize herself.

I'd been chasing them all my life, and acknowledging the limitations of his own comparatively flabby intellect: I had extraordinary dreams and an ordinary mind.geniuses: they're just like us! so once again i leave the facts and figures to crouch's research team—i'm here for the scientific ethics; that old mad-scientist jurassic park-y hubris around what we CAN do and what we SHOULD do. years before this novel opens, logan's genius mom miriam DID do something that had unintended consequences—while she and her team (incl. logan) were trying to eradicate a bacterial leaf blight in china, an unexpected mutation occurred that caused The Great Starvation; a famine that killed 200 billion people. miriam died in a car crash before the full impact of the mutation occurred, and logan was imprisoned for three years for his part in the disaster. afterwards, he gave up on his dreams of becoming a geneticist, instead becoming a committed family man and working for the GPA (the Gene Protection Agency), an organization targeting criminal geneticists operating rogue gene labs creating new species as designer pets (!GIMMIE!), or using their knowledge to weaponize or enhance a human's DNA, which can be smuggled via—wait for it—BOOKS!I was looking for rigidity in the pages, signs they'd been wet at some point, infinitesimal circular stains. Vast amounts of DNA, or plasmids, could be hidden on the pages of a normal book—dropped in microliter increments and left to dry on the pages, only to be rehydrated and used elsewhere. even a short novel like The Stranger could hold a near-infinite amount of genetic information, with each page hiding the genome sequence for a different mammal, a terrifying disease, or a synthetic species, any of which could be activated in a well-equipped dark gene lab.so cool. what is NOT cool is that, while on a job, logan is exposed to something that modifies his genomes. like, all of his genomes. after his nonconsensual genetic upgrade, he's become a brainy-bourne: stronger, faster, smarter, more resilient, with increased bone density, perfect recall, and oh my god—the ability to speed-read two books at once (!GIMMIE!). it's not all great, though—post-exposure, logan is held against his will; a government-caged secret for observation purposes, and his wife and teenage daughter have been told he's dead, so that's a drag.however, logan wasn't the only one exposed to this instant-evolution process, and he gets broken out of science-jail by a fellow-upgrade and, after some complicated family baggage is dragged into the light, he finds himself tasked with a daunting mission: to save humanity from itself.it's a pretty big ask, and, faced with this difficult decision, logan is naturally conflicted about his next steps; a little science-shy over the ethics or consequences of bringing the human race up to his new level, which is already proving to have its downsides: his transformation has made him more efficient and intelligent than everyone around him, but consequently more impatient and less empathetic with normies.additionally, he's still grappling with his mommy-issues: he's finally reached, maybe surpassed, his mother's intellect, but is hesitant to make the same mistakes she made. We had gotten so much right.And too much wrong.The future was here, and it was a fucking mess.Upgrade is a delicious blend of action and ethics, rich with family drama and redemption, where the real hero of the piece is emotional intelligence. We were a monstrous, thoughtful, selfish, sensitive, fearful, ambitious, loving, hateful, hopeful species. We contained within us the potential for great evil, but also for great good. And we were capable of so much more than this.it's just as fun and thought-provoking as his other books, but i gotta say, some of logan's genius-level observations sound pretty close to the insights of college stoners:We walked back to the hotel under a deep navy sky bejeweled with stars.In the center of the plaza, a choir was singing. They held quivering candles, and their voices lilted icily into the sky. I didn't see the moment. Not really. I saw the story behind the moment—a tale passed down over two thousand years that told of a child of a superbeing sent to save the world. Never before had I seen Homo sapiens so clearly—a species, at its most fundamental level, of storytellers.Creatures who overlay story on everything, but especially their own lives, and in so doing, can imbue a cold, random, sometime brutal existence, with fabricated meaning.stoner-geniuses will save us all. but should they??

Is this grief?i picked this book up on the first day of april, thinking it would be a fine way to celebrate the start of national poetrWhat is grief? Is this grief?i picked this book up on the first day of april, thinking it would be a fine way to celebrate the start of national poetry month. turns out, it was a fine way to celebrate april fool's day, because this is not a poetry collection. i don't know why i assumed this was poetry. i have read five other books by stuart ross, and only two of them have been poetry, but his prose always seems filtered through a poetic sensibility, emphasizing cadence and imagery and even the way he lays it out on the page is verse-shaped:[image]or maybe that's all just the rationalization of an april fool. i also don't know why i thought it was such a great idea to read a book about grief so close to my own personal grief-anniversary, but decisions were made, tears were shed, and here we are. this book is short enough that it can be read in one little sitting, but that's not to say it ought to be read that way—quite the contrary. it's sad and beautiful and meditative, and it needs time to work its way into your soft little feeling bits, the way sand niggles at an oysterbody with, ""why are you crying? why are you crying?"" until the oyster suffocates all that emotional shit into an impenetrable pearl and gets on with its life. not a great analogy, but a decent life lesson. anyway, grief. death has taken a lot of stuart ross' people: family, friends, mentors, dogs, and even though writers are meant to take all the universal experiences of life and distill them into art, stu has some emotional roadblocks when it comes to the experience of grief. the premise of this collection of...essays? prose poetry? thoughts? is that stuart ross—the affable canadian vegetarian poet—has an unusual writer-tic: whenever his work skews too close to something uncomfortable or ""heavy,"" a hamburger is sure to find its way into the mix. here, hamburgers are code for grief, and, as he tries—repeatedly—to wrap words around his ""enormous accumulation of loss,"" inevitably he veers off into a hamburgery tangent.It may be that I have grieved and grieved, but I did not recognize it because I don't know what grief is. I have felt pain in my chest and at the same time an unfulfillable longing. Tears have trickled down my cheeks. I am a man of sixty-one and tears often trickle down my cheeks. I sob and curse.I don't know if this is anger or frustration or sadness. I don't know if it is sadness, the degree of sadness that reaches the depths that people identify as ""grief.""Do you like pickles on your hamburger? Mayo? I've got some grainy mustard in the fridge. Pull up a chair.it should be jarring, the incongruous image of a hamburger defusing the emotional tension with comic relief, pulling back to keep grief at arm's length, but once you internalize the subtext, the hamburgers become, somehow, even more emotionally resonant. this collection is a series of digressive memories, ruminations, anecdotes, but they keep coming back to hamburgers, and he keeps finding clever and affecting ways to talk about grief without talking about grief. in one piece, he revisits a poem he wrote nearly two decades ago, whose narrator is a hamburger. he's going through and critiquing it and it isn't until the closing lines that he remembers what the poem is about.It's the only thing I've ever written about 9/11. And it is jam-packed with hamburgers. but it's not all hamburgers and suppressing the painful examinations of loss, it's also full of wisdom:Michael, I worry that I am too tired from grieving to grieve for you too. But at the same time, I don't even know if I have grieved. I still can't figure out exactly what grieving is. Maybe because it's a thing that doesn't seem to ever end. If I grieved right, wouldn't it end? If it's a constant state, isn't it just living?reading this while feeling hyper-vulnerable by my own calendar-reminder of loss was therapeutic and reassuring, and it left me feeling a little scoured afterwards. for someone who isn't sure they've ever truly experienced grief, this book pulsates with it.in these pages, we are confronted by the unexpected pathos in a stapler. i think the first time i cried whilst reading this book was the last sentence of page 18. it's not even a sad line—it wraps up an almost entirely factual piece about c.s. lewis, but it's the buildup to that line, the tonal shock as ross shifts the reader back into the place where his grief lives with five emphatically neutral words that could have been taken from lewis' wikipedia page, but are—when contextually connected to what seemed like a non sequitur on the previous page—absolutely fucking devastating. i mean, but that's grief, innit? you're going about your life, doing something completely ordinary, when suddenly something resonates, twanging a memory or a mood, and you're caught off guard and left absolutely walloped. there are several interstitial bits in-between the longer pieces—poems (his own and others'—take THAT, poetry month! i have honored you after all!), fragments of song lyrics or the last words of famous people with the word ""hamburger"" inserted somewhere, and, in an admirably determined stalling tactic (game recognizes game/staller recognizes staller), searching for the word ""hamburger"" in other people's work. To search for a single word in a physical book is time-consuming. If you recall the particular word, you may remember that it appeared, for example, in the top third of a left-hand page somewhere in the first half of the book. But with electronic books, you can just do a search. The word hamburger does not appear in A Grief Observed.The word burger does not appear in A Grief Observed.C.S. Lewis does not veer from his subject matter; he does not hide or evade. There are no hamburgers, culinary or metaphorical, in his book A Grief Observed.As I write these words, I wonder when I will turn unflinchingly to my own grief in this book. That is the particular corner I am trying to paint myself into. But I worry that I may be too clever for myself. Or too weak.it's the kind of book you can pick up and revisit—and i already have—rereading a passage here and there. it's moving, elegiac, and deeply sad, but it's also a comfort, and i hope that writing it was a comfort to him, too.This book feels like one big hamburger. My intention was to make myself face things I don't think I've succeeding in facing...I want to force myself to come to terms. That's what I'm trying to do here.Won't you please join me?[image][image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,Apr 2022,"Apr 02, 2022","Feb 11, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59034569-the-book-of-grief-and-hamburgers

Not everyone was in a Western 45 Gun Company handgun ad just to pay the hospital bills. Not that I was the one who shot him. Not everyone is the fictionalized star of pedo-erotic-true-crime fan fiction and actual porn, posted on the deep corners of the internet, some version of me wandering around a subdivision in pigtails naked, save for a red-hooded cape.this was a three-star-read for me, but it's a high three stars. not to be confused with three high stars: [image]i love fairy tale retellings, especially when familiar stories are transplanted into contemporary times, forcing the modern reader to re-examine the messages we've been passing down unthinkingly through the generations, many of which are, as they say, problematic, even in their softened, disneyfied forms. lots of happy endings for women kissed sans active consent by powerful men whilst deeply comatose, ladies choosing to relinquish their power of speech to be with a man, women punished for their curiosity, for running late, for talking to strangers—fairy tales are not typically great for females.i'm not sure if angela carter was the first, but she was certainly one of the pioneers in the ""feminist reclamation of fairy tales"" genre, which somehow, despite a finite pool of source material from which to draw, is still thriving as authors find inventive ways to build new stories on the canon's bones.the creative hook to this one is centered around a therapy group for women who had once upon a time lived through a variation of a familiar fairy-tale scenario; girls who grew up to become women deeply scarred by their traumatic experiences, which are reclassed here largely as true crime stories: a woman married to a blue-bearded billionaire serial killer, a girl who saved herself and her brother by murdering the woman who kidnapped them, a girl seduced by a predator on her way to visit her grandmother. because if anyone's gonna need some therapy, it'll be someone who was swallowed up (if only temporarily) by a killer masquerading as a trusted relative. and the formerly little red ruby's...not doing so well. her riding hood(ie) story is reshaped as an encounter with a sexual predator, flattered and manipulated by a wolfish creature in an interaction that reminded me very much of the highly uncomfortable must-read graphic novel Panther. here, we see her grown up to become a wayward substance-abusing cutter; sarcastic, self-destructive and self-effacing—always sweaty, always hungry, wearing a truly grotesque fur coat made of the wolf who consumed her and drawn to debasing casual sex with men drawn to her damage. Emil and I have this on-again, off-again storage-closet romance. ""Romance"" is a strong word for it. He sometimes nonexclusively jams his junk down my throat over lunch breaks until I can't breathe.Emil has the personality of a drunken pirate trying to clean up his act. For three weeks out of each month, he treats me like a siren trying to shipwreck him. When he's exhausted himself from abstaining, he'll reappear with that hungry, wanting look. Later, he'll pawn it off as a moment of weakness that was my fault, saying things like ""Well, when you wear that dress"" or ""You finally washed your hair."" We keep doing it, just like that, in a way that's annoyingly unstoppable, like how you find yourself singing along to a crappy pop song on the radio that you unfortunately know by heart.ruby is just one of the women assembled into this group by the blandly inoffensive will—a therapist with an ulterior motive. well, two ulterior motives, and one icky, sticky secret. his (stated) objective is to provide a safe place for these women to share their experiences with others like them; survivors of unusual and horrific circumstances whose details were salaciously media-twisted, their lives raked over the coals of public opinion and spoiler alert—they are a judgy bunch.""To be honest, I thought Gretel, of all people, would get it,"" says Ruby. ""We both escaped being eaten for lunch, just to have the media eat us for dinner.""the women come to the group for their own personal reasons and hounded by their own personal demons, but will's sales-pitch-goal for them is empowerment—taking back their stories from the spotlight of their abusers and the media’s framing of them as complicit in their own victimhood, or presenting reductive versions of themselves defined solely by their trauma, their rescue, their proximity to real-world horror.so, these are revisionist fairytales of women whose experiences were already revised by scandal-hungry media; their lives exploited for the titillation of viewers, news cycles splaying out their worst days before abandoning them, rapidly moving on to the next bleeding story without pausing to consider what happens to these individuals afterwards; the real people behind the true crime stories, the ""where are they now?"" survivors carrying on living after their experiences have been scrutinized and dissected into unrecognizable form: Sensational or sanitized, there's no middle ground.this book is the middle ground. the best backstories here are ruby's and bernice's, who is surrounded by the chattering voices of her blue-bearded husband's former lovers, now trapped in the objects he made from their bodies, finding herself guilty by association; lumped into the crimes she had no idea he had committed...until she did.In my new neighborhood bodega, the cashier stared, then looked over near the window. I followed his eyes to a display of newspapers and tabloids. I picked up a paper where an op-ed headline read WHEN CURIOSITY KILLS, as if opening the door had been the real deathblow. A tabloid had a photo of me on the cover, on the day of the funeral, wearing a dark navy dress, almost smirking under a rainbow umbrella. TRUE BLUE! The headline shouted in bold lettering. The subheading: BLUEBEARD'S GIRLFRIEND STANDS BY HER MAN. I was always a reference point for someone else. I was born into the last name of a father I hardly knew, in school I was always my sister's little sister, in the mansion Andrea had called me Taylor, and now I was the nameless possessive of some stupidly named serial killer.""Wearing navy to the funeral,"" said one apparent expert in an unnamed field,"" suggests that she's still aligning herself with Bluebeard."" They write about me as if I'd attended the funeral of a mistress I was complicit in murdering. They compared me to the smiling wives of cheating politicians and the adoring fans of death-row inmates.i also enjoyed ashlee's story, an outlier in that she's not attached to a specific fairytale, but is kind of catch-all for every ""happily ever after"" princess story—the winner of a Bachelor-style reality dating show called The One, who got her prince but was emphatically not a fan favorite. hers is a wonderfully caustic behind-the-scenes look at reality show production—the manipulation and grooming and sneaky editing. i have never seen The Bachelor because i am a monster who hates love, but the whole grueling process, the women blindfolded, sequestered, transported to undisclosed locations like prisoners of war was fascinating and also horrifying. and that ""prince"" was certainly no prize.gretel's story was the weakest of the bunch and for whatever reason adelmann decided to be very cagey about disclosing raina's identity until the Big Reveal, so i'll respect that choice, but overall, while i enjoyed the witty observations and commentary, the parts didn't cohere into a satisfying whole.the premise and the individual stories were great, but it needed more connective tissue to make the big-picture story work; to make this operate as a novel instead of a loosely-bound story collection. my issue isn't with the writing, it's with the construction. she's got a strong concept, it's funny and there are some sharp insights, but it mostly just scratches the surface of its themes of gendered power structures, identity, and the squickiness of true crime as entertainment without developing it into anything more than raised questions. YMMV, of course, and my inability to be over-the-moon-wowed by this is probably because i've pretty recently read These Women and Notes on an Execution, where the whole ""taking the narrative away from the serial killer to focus on the lives of his victims/survivors/women surrounding his story"" offered much more thorough explorations of the theme, and More Than You'll Ever Know did an excellent job examining our obsession with true crime in general. as far as this one goes: great cover, great moments, good book. **********************************I WON A GOODREADS GIVEAWAY!!!

She felt almost as if she had seen her somewhere before...or watched her in a film. She had that kind of beauty that hurt your eyes if you looked at her for too long, but made it hard to tear your gaze away. It was, Hannah realized, as if a different kind of light were shining on her than on the rest of the room.but after her death, she became a symbol—a promising life cut short, reduced to tragedy in the media:How dare they—the journalists, the public, the vultures who have picked over this case for years like they care, like they have a right to the truth just as much as Hannah does. They've stripped April of her identity, of her uniqueness, of everything that made her real and compelling and fascinating—they've reduced her to a cardboard cutout of a girl and a series of Instagram pictures. The perfect victim, in fact.the ten-year-gap permits hannah enough emotional distance to revisit her past with different eyes, to consider that the creepy porter was maybe just creepy, and not necessarily a killer, and to perceive the cracks in april's shine; see the way her vanity, her carelessness with other people's feelings and her mischievous pranks may have driven someone to kill her—someone she considered a friend. it does what thrillers do—a mad scramble of suspicion and doubt, red herrings, remembered details given new emphasis, etc etc, and it's a compelling, if conventional, page-turner. i figured it out before the grand reveal, but i enjoyed the ride nonetheless. honestly, the best parts for me were hannah's working-in-the-bookstore bits, which were very relatable, both the comfort in feeling ""safest surrounded by books,"" and the joyful challenge of readers' advisory work:...an elderly lady, who comes in every Tuesday and buys a book, and then comes back the following Tuesday and tells Hannah how many marks out of ten she would award it. She has never, ever given ten. Hamnet got 8.75. This week Razorblade Tears got 9.2. The first Bridgerton novel got 7.7. Lord of the Flies got a surprising 4.1. Hannah finds it impossible to predict what will score high—some of her most confident recommendations bomb, but she lives in hope of finding something that will hit the magic jackpot. i've read far too many campus thrillers in my life, and i will read many more before i die (knock wood), so this was more of a comfort-food read for me than a mind-blowing experience, but it's a fun summertime thriller to escape from the real world, and i'm taking my comforts where i can these days.

I ask you, Stanley, who would read a story on that?”weeeee would—we miners of the free tor shorts, chipping away through the already-reads to excavate this funny little nugget from 2012. it's wodehouse-in-space; a bit of absurdist british humor, with wordplay, good manners, rude gestures, and tea, featuring two chaps performing a necessary, but dull, job in order to keep earth safe from any dratted asteroids. they are intrepid, heroic, and...easily distracted.

The mot juste can have no answer. There’s no topping it, you see. By definition. It’s the last word on the subject. No, that’s one in your column, Stanley, and no mistake.”“I meant answering the, um, urgent message.”it's fun and silly and short and free, and as a bonus, you will learn why isaac asimov is one of science fiction's notable masters of sensuality.

But the price was right.Lou pointed it at his cat and looked in the viewscreen.There was the cat. The picture in the viewscreen was black and white, with a little Date&Time display at the top. It was even grainy, like a real surveillance video.Cool! Lou pressed SHOOT.The cat took a crap in the corner, and then left the room, looking like a criminal. But cats always look like criminals.since tor.com is taking a short break (meaning both ""a brief break"" and ""a (brief) break from publishing the free shorts""), i went way back into the archives to find one i hadn’t read and found this little piece from 2008. a fun, twilight zone-ish premise underdeveloped into an okay story: a lonely loser purchases a CRIMESTOPPERS™ VIDEO CAMERA, only to find that it doesn’t record crimes being committed so much as it causes people (and a cat) to commit crimes, recording them for all yer blackmailing needs. the tone is decisively absurdist—very goofy and slapsticky, but its brand of humor may not appeal to contemporary readers, which seems weird to say about something written ten-and-change years ago, but i stand by it. it’s got strong incel vibes, casual animal death, lady-abduction, some wincingly-broad characterizations, and i suppose the charitable phrase for it would be ""charmingly dated."" it comes across more clumsy than intentionally offensive, but because it’s such a breezy skim of a story, when characters are defined and referred to by their most basic and stereotypical attributes: the pakistani 7-11 clerk, the fat white kid, the black guy buying salems and a lottery ticket threatening to kick the narrator’s ass, the little old lady…it’s not great. my main gripe with it is that it’s a bit hacky. it seems raw and unfinished, like he came up with the idea for the camera and then hastily constructed a story around it that doesn’t go anywhere or say anything. there’s no real motivation given for why the narrator buys the camera in the first place:Lou was almost thirty. He had a job and an apartment, but he was lonely. He didn’t have any friends. He didn’t know why; he just didn’t.So he did what everyone who is lonely does: YouTube and eBay. One day it was eBay.where he discovers the camera:So Lou did what every lonely person with PayPal does. He clicked on BUY. is ebay really qvc-for-men, where lonely dudes hang out, buying shit they don’t need? it’s a pretty flimsy catalyst driving the story. and apart from the three characters mentioned above, whose respective arrivals to the narrative are all clumped into one chonk of the story, he doesn’t bother to disclose the race of any other character (one assumes they default white) or even describe them, beyond ""the girl"" who is ""extremely pretty."" we don’t even know what color the cat is. which, who cares, right? but the fact that he made a point to assign race to three characters makes the omission w/r/t other characters seem like lazy writing. there’s no traditional story arc, no character growth, and why is this thirty-year-old man making such a romantic play for a ""girl"" who’s getting picked up at the mall by her mom every day? i didn’t hate it, but it’s not a great introduction to his work. i’ve always been in love with the cover of this other book he wrote: [image]and maybe that one is better than meh.

[image]for those of us who li am making my triumphant return to ing monsterporn with the story of a sexual encounter between a lady and a baku. [image]for those of us who learned what a baku is from this excellent children’s book: [image]this story is a pretty shocking “where are they now?” exposé. our fair heroine is named lori and she has a problem:She’d been having terrible nightmares for three years now and was willing to try anything to stop them. The nightmares had ruined her sex life.wait, what? i get the first sentence, but let’s pause a moment to unpack that second part: The nightmares had ruined her sex life.no further explanation is given to illuminate that statement, but what the heck, lori? the only way her nightmares could be affecting her sex life is if she’s only attracted to necro-fetishists who want to have sex with her while she’s asleep. (internet gently corrects my terminology with the word somnophiliacs.) i’m not here looking to kink-shame anyone for how they choose to bone, and if sleeping thru sex is your jam, snooze it up, sister, but i don’t think that’s what’s going on here. it would be one thing if she said it was ruining relationships, i can see how sleeping next to someone who is flailing around screaming and sweating the sheets soggy night after night would be off-putting, but even then—invest in a bunk bed, sleep on the couch—love finds a way. but sex? that’s usually a wide-awake kinda thing, no? [image][image]anyway, moving on—lori is determined to end this whole nightmare-woven chastity belt situation so she betakes herself to the Japanese Herbal Medicine shop, whose shopkeeper (who never gets his own name, and is only “the shopkeeper” throughout), tells her to come back at midnight to meet with baku. “Don’t you think meeting back here at midnight seems a little, well, over the top?” she’d asked the shopkeeper.i’m gonna go ahead and find & replace “over the top” with “rapey.”the shopkeeper, who is apparently playing a word-based drinking game all on his ownsome, assures her that certain things must be done in certain ways, and meeting the Baku had certain requirements. [image]so she follows him down the stairs at the back of the shop, because nothing bad ever happens to young women who follow men whose names they don’t even know into strange basements late at night. [image]he points her to a door and, before leaving, instructs her to light some incense. so now she is alone in a fragrant candlelit room lined with “exotic cushions.” but before you start slamming lori for using adjectives that perpetuate asian stereotypes, hark this: She was surprised that the room didn’t have a distinct Japanese feeling to it, the fabrics and patterns seemed to come from all over the world.so she’s sitting there on the unracist exotic cushions[image][image][image]when suddenly A sense of tiredness swept through her body. She’d had a long day and hadn’t been expecting a midnight consultation.if the story hadn’t been so needlessly precise about the fact that lori had gone to the store at noon that day, i might have been able to let this slide without calling bullshit, but she has, in fact, been expecting a midnight consultation for twelve whole hours. anyway, she has slipped into a half-slumber when baku appears. and he is a HOT mess.The figure had an elephant’s head. Lori stared at the large, gray floppy ears. A long prehensile trunk hung from his face, it was pointed at Lori and seemed to be sniffing the air around her. Small, dark eyes watched her every move from across the room. Lori noticed a long, thin tail twitching behind the figure. Tiger paws and furry forearms were visible emerging from the sleeves of the loose fitting silk kimono.lori is gently bewildered:“I’m dreaming,” she muttered to herself.This is not a dream, said a voice in her head. The figure had not moved, however Lori instinctively knew the voice came from the mismatched monster across the room. I’m not a monster, I’m a spirit that can help you. I devour dreams. Or in your case, nightmares. Such horrible images in your mind.okay, hold up. i’m fine with him responding IN HER MIND to something she says out loud. i would also, being magnanimous w/r/t supernatural abilities, accept him responding IN HER MIND to something she thought IN HER MIND. but replying IN HER MIND to a description by the story’s omniscient narrator? that’s a no, johnny. Lori didn’t believe the monster. She decided this was indeed a dream and to just play along with it until she woke up.again, baku—this is the om narr calling you a monster, don’t hold it against lori. and by “it,” i mean that prehensile trunk of yours. but i’m getting ahead of myself—we’re still in the initial consult stage. anyway, lori’s still telling herself this is a dream, and she’s chatting politely, and then baku, sidestepping the whole consent thing, uses just the tip of his long long trunk to tap her on the forehead and enter her…mind. [image]so his trunk is rooting around, scrabbling through her nightmares, causing lori intense flashbacks involving the cretin who had once been her fiancé and had hurt her deeply, and baku goes ahead and gobbles up “his presence.” for clarity—does lori think nightmares are the same as memories? and is there some freudian angle on a soon-to-be-lover (spoiler alert) orally fixated on her former lover, devouring him out of existence?[image]baku is busy exploring all the nooks and crannies of her…mind with his “metaphysical appendage,” eating all her nightmares (memories?), leaving her empty inside. i’m not sure how metaphysics applies here, unless she’s still pretending this is all a dream, although being brainwashed in a basement by a chimera in a kimono is for sure the stuff of nightmares or police reports.Lori felt like she should protest, that there was something deeply disturbing about this level of intimacy from Baku.oh just you wait, sister. once again, baku cheats on lori with the om narr:Baku raised his tiger paws and placed the pads on each side of her face. Lori’s eyes opened wide. His hands felt incredibly real. Her previous dreams, even her nightmares, had never felt so real.This is not a dream, do you not understand that yet? I’m spirit made flesh. Your nightmares provide sustenance for my physical form.so he’s running his big old cat hands over her face and neck, unsheathing his claws and scratching her, giving her little shivery shivers along with, one presumes, all of the dirt and bacteria that gets lodged up underneath an animal’s claws. [image]and then this happensAs Baku devoured her nightmares, Lori started to remember the long suppressed dreams she used to have. The highly erotic dreams of her past now had room to grow in her mind. Dreams that had seemed unnatural then, but with the strange creature Baku standing in front of her they no longer seemed so impossible.so….baku is…clearing her cache? does he work at the genius bar on the side? and what, specifically, was unnatural about lori's erotic dreams? this seems to suggest she had been harboring some beauty and the beast fantasies along with the aforementioned (speculative) sleeping beauty fantasies and is there a lusty-beanstalk confession on the horizon? but truly, why is she being so vague and coy about her desires? this is monsterotica, after all—ain’t no one judging. much.as the great-poet-turned-racist-crank once said:Coyness is nice and coyness can stop youFrom saying all the things in life you'd like toSo, if there's something you'd like to tryIf there's something you'd like to tryAsk me, I won't say ""no""How could I?although, with baku, you don’t really have to ask, do you, since his wiggler’s all up in your innermost, snooping through your cranial dear diary. the reader’s frustration over lori’s half-reveals are turned back on her in baku’s own bestial opacity:He was inside her mind, but she had no idea what he was thinking.typical relationship bullshit. monsterporn cosmo quiz: why won’t my baku talk about his feeeeeeelings?and then that mofo uses his tiger claws to rip her shirt off, tearing the fabric and turning her shirt into a pile of “destroyed material,” before backtracking to do the same to her bra. the correct response to this kind of behavior is to punch him in the face while screaming, “do you know how much bras fucking cost?”lori’s response:[She] panicked at how sharp his claws must be and prayed Baku was in control.i mean, he’s poked around in your mind, you’re topless and your clothes are ruined, but sure, pray that the creature understands restraint. lori’s version of panicking is very subtle—she neither moves nor addresses the fact that her boobies are hanging out nor wonders what she’s gonna wear when she leaves this basement (if she leaves this basement) and now he’s sliding his paws—scratch that—they are now being called ‘paw-like hands,’ all over her breasts, which appendage-evolution explains why he’s able to cup and massage ‘em like no catpaw i i ever saw. The nightmare induced inhibitions of the last couple of years drained from Lori’s body as the Baku devoured the nightmares from her past.wait, is this our explanation? the fact that she had nightmares when asleep made her sexually inhibited when awake so she didn’t put herself out there? but again this conflation of nightmares and memories is troubling and he’s essentially acting like a supernatural roofie taking her inhibitions and wiping clean the “nightmares from her past,” which most people call ""memories"" but whatever i guess, because, lori’s fired up enough by...whatever this is to remove baku’s kimono. “finally,” say the legion of horny monsterporn fans who have read 7 pages of a 14 page story without any sexxybits. “finally,” says i, because dudes in kimonos are cheesy. [image]Baku stood before Lori, unfazed by his sudden nakedness.well, yeah—i suppose animals don’t have to deal with any of that pesky postlapsarian body shame. where’s the baku that eats all of that crap out of the mind, i ask you? because i want the confidence of a baku: unselfconsciously standing naked in front of a prospective new lover with his elephant head, tiger torso and arms, human abs (well defined, of course), human legs and penis (very large, of course) and a freaking tail, with no doubt in his mind that he’s about to get some. ‘course, he did just suck out most of his partner’s brain, but still: #aspirational.anyway, he finishes draining her “nightmares.”Lori searched her memory for the nightmares. There was no sign of them. Baku really had devoured her nightmares and left her only with good dreams.how is she quantifying this nightmare v dream tally while she is awake? does lori know what nightmares are? do i know what nightmares are? am i inceptioning? or, oh shit—does she still think she’s asleep and dreaming here? and so maybe she IS just a somnophiliac, standing before a sexy wuzzle, asking him to intercourse her.[image]“They’re gone, they’re all gone. That’s amazing.” Lori shook her head slightly as if she could dislodge a nightmare still hiding somewhere in the recesses of her mind.and maybe she can, since she seems to be able to check herself for nightmares the way the rest of us check for ticks. (i deeply regret the google image search i just undertook)anyway, baku’s all hopped up on nightmare juice and lori’s brain is empty, so might as well go to town on his weird-ass body!She encased the growing shaft in her fingers and measured the length and weight.if literal, this is some bizarre foreplay and may be the real reason lori’s sex life is in a rut. no one wants to pause the bedroom action so you can run off to fetch your tape measure and weight watchers electronic food scale to catalog their junk, lori. Lori licked the tip of his cock, tasting a male for the first time in years. The nightmares did not come back.i appreciate the precision of the word “male” rather than “man” here, but i still don’t get this sex/nightmare mashup. was there an expectation that the nightmares would return with the taste of male genitals? fuck, is “nightmares” code for her sexual assault-related ptsd being triggered and now i’m gonna be scolded and made to feel shitty for this insensitive  by internet strangers for years and years like on so many of my other s? fuck it, jake it’s chinatown monsterporn.and dear editor, because i know firsthand how rigorous the editorial process is for monsterotica—on the first paragraph of this page, it says “A sound like a purr emanated from the figure standing over her” and then two paragraphs later on the same page it says “An odd, purring like noise emanated from Baku.” that’s my only note—the rest is literary perfection.oh, right, the boning.so baku positions lori onto a mound of “several exotic pillows and cushions” [image][image][image]and brings them claws back out. lori remembers how messy his disrobing game is so she buys the flowers herself: Not wanting to have to walk home naked, Lori quickly reached down and undid the button of her jeans.at least she’s thinking about the future now that all those dingdang nightmares aren’t clogging up her brainspace. somewhere, a cognitive psychologist weeps. and then it’s trunk time!! [image]and baku's running his long snot tube all over her ladybits and she's loving it but THAT WAS JUST IN YOUR BRAIN, LORI! a courtesy wipe, sir, please, if you will. She squeezed her eyes shut. Lori couldn’t quite believe what was happening to her. She had never expected something like this.fair dinkums—baku nose sex is on no one’s bingo card IRL, but anyone reading this thing saw chekhov’s prehensile trunk coming a mile away. fun fact: when baku comes, he also raises his trunk towards the ceiling[image]and then it’s just normal het-sex—doggystyle, so she’s looking at the wall or something instead of her lover’s patchwork quilt zoo of a body. which is just as well. She reveled in the moment. The nightmares were truly gone. And now she was creating all new dreams to take their place.again—this is not what nightmares are. this is not what dreams are. but it may be what this story is.[image]and where did that rude om narr go? and, what, baku, now that you got your rocks off, you don’t talk to lori anymore via that creepy invasive mindspeaking? typical.anyway, lori falls into a blissful sleep—without dreams or nightmares or whatever she means when she uses those words, and she wakes up alone. fortunately, baku has left his cheesy-ass kimono on the ground so she doesn’t have to walk home topless. a sampling of icky sexual euphemisms:wet sex, nether lips, button, sensitive bud, dripping slit, channel, impaling member, supernatural seed, commingled juicestl, dr; to get rid of sex-squashing nightmares, a girl has sex with an actual nightmare.AND THAT WAS MONSTERPORN, 2022-STYLE!!2022 monsterporn:FEBRUARY: Taken by the ScorpionMARCH: Monsters Made Me Gay: Grim Reaper Group Encountermonsterporn archives[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,63,1,not set,"Jan 05, 2022","Jan 06, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24667182-baku

rhea's been doing this spouse-killing gig for centuries; her gift, her responsibility, and recently—her burden. this is stock immortality predicament—their longevity distances them from the concerns of the mortals their actions affect; death is an abstract concept, and to rhea, taking a life has become casual, repetitious—she's rarely there to see the effect death has on the deceased's loved ones. still, it's beginning to take its toll on her, and in the aftermath of her most recent dead husband, who started developing feelings for her against all common sense, rhea's been having some moral qualms. and now it's time to get married again. the novel's other POV character is rhea's twinsie lexos—and vasilis' second in command—a role that gives him a seat at the table but not much political power. both he and rhea, whose duties take her—briefly—to other countries, have seen more of the world than their younger siblings, but their lives are fairly constrained by maintaining the family's political power and protecting thyzakos from the other stratagiozi. all four children live in fear-love of their father, who is demanding and absolute, but his behavior is becoming increasingly erratic and unpredictable, and an unstable person with his kind of power, well, we have seen—it can be concerning.except for the details about how these families control the elements (many of which powers give rise to procedural questions in the readers' mind that have not been answered thus far), this is a pretty conventional piece of epic fantasy. i'm not entirely sure why this title being marketed as adult, since her other books have all been YA and this one certainly reads like YA. the characters are centuries old, but their life-experience is limited, so they have the narrow, sheltered worldview and emotional range of adolescents, and it's ultimately a coming-of-age story about a younger generation pushing back against the power structures set in motion by their elders, paving the way for change, for progress. this  is coming across negative, which is unfortunate, because i did enjoy the book, but if i'm being forced to consider it as 1) a standalone novel, and 2) an adult title, welp, i got some criticisms.this would be a very good first half of a book.this would be a very good YA novel.it's a straightforward narrative that doesn't ask much of the reader—and i am a reader, not some rigid writing 101 teacher, so i'm not gonna scrawl ""show us, don't tell us"" all over this, because in my opinion, telling is a perfectly valid way to write a story. there's a comfort in being carried and sometimes we just want to sit down and be told a story. this one carries—there's just one set of footprints in the sand, and even though it's not particularly challenging or unexpected, storywise, there are some standout scenes and really lovely descriptions. i psyched myself out when i saw the massive list of names at the front: [image]i slogged through the first 1/3 of the book, reading it in a very slow overcautious way to get my bearings, but once i got over that bullshit, this was actually very briskly paced. i'm intrigued to see where it's going, which seems to be ""nowhere good,"" for team argyros, and i do hope chrysanthi gets to be more than just emotional furniture in book two. ******************************************i have had an E-ARC of this since november and a physical ARC of it for a month, but with all of life's perfect storms, i've only been able to get to it now, five days before pub date. i hope to have it ed by then, because GRATITUDE, but there're always more storm clouds, aren't there?[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,99,1,"Mar 27, 2022","Mar 31, 2022","Jan 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58529366-in-a-garden-burning-gold

Each time he gave her a book, the complaining woman said, the man insisted it was a very special book, a book that meant a tremendous amount to him, and regardless of its length or density, he had always read this book many times over. The complaining woman also had many loving things to say about the man who was giving her all this reading material, so I gathered that, if these books had meant a great deal to him, then they both likely hoped that all these books would mean a great deal to her, and yet how could they know if she had not yet read them?Several times during this complaint, the complaining woman reassured the listening woman that she was immensely grateful to receive these books from this man, as she loved reading and did a great deal of it, though she read at a regrettably slow pace, a handicap she often tried to improve, though it seemed that her reading comprehension suffered when she tried to read too quickly, and what would be the point of reading if at the end of a book you couldn’t recall what you’d read? True, she did tend to forget many details of a book regardless of the rate at which she read it, but she felt sure that her memory loss was greatly exacerbated when she tried to force herself to exceed her natural pace.The listening woman interrupted with urgency: Had this man ever accepted any books from her? Oh, yes, the complaining woman said. And he read each of them so quickly and so closely! She was running out of books to recommend, in fact, and though she was glad that the man seemed to genuinely enjoy the books she gave him, she had to admit she was mildly alarmed by how he always came back to her with some criticism about the author’s style or disposition, criticisms he delivered with such elegant judiciousness that, even though the complaining woman usually did not want to accept the intellectual blemish that the man had located in the book, she had to admit that he was correct in his analysis.She had a particular shelf, the complaining woman said, where she was keeping all the books he’d given her. When she could find the time, she intended to read each of them so carefully, but she had her own work to attend to and various arbitrary commitments, as well as other books that he had not given to her that she wanted or needed to read for some reason or another. Often, she would take one of the books he’d given her in her hands and consider it, thoughtfully but not without a little fear, yet most of them were still on the shelf, not yet read.i'm probably breaking one of those mattress-tag laws by printing the entire story here, but it's gonna be a whole new year soon, whose arrival will nullify all the previous year's sins. what, you didn't know about that? it's true. in any case, this seems to be the perfect story to end this particular year, this particular challenge—all the books i didn't get a chance to read, all the pressure to read certain books at certain times, all the books that have gone unread as a result. i know you feel me, booknerds. thank you for being here.read it for free hereor, you know, right up there ⬆️THE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

By moonlight, you inspect the pigeon droppings on the window ledge. Tonight, they are gray and runny, with a couple of little pink balls. The pink balls are as beautiful as pearls, and you would like to lift one out, but already a picture is forming. The ball, you are sure, is the head of someone or something, maybe even the head of someone you know. You leave it where it is, you don’t want to risk it; you are already a killer of horses. ah, to be a child again—worrying about small, silly, childish things, completely unaware of the real danger that's just skimmed right by your innocent little life.

It was a white summer night, a kind of gauze with dusky twilight, no slumber, but a yearning for it. The bear smelled of dust, dust and old age, infirmity, decades, millennia. Opening my eyes in the underwater dimness of this alabaster midnight, I could see the black thread hanging from his miserable little eye socket. I stroked his wooden head; it was covered with scars. I touched his ears.although i am a grown-ass woman, when it comes to stuffed animals, i am myself a big ole softie. and when those stuffies are old and worn and LOVED, it activates all of the feelings in me that are supposed to be attached to babies, small humans, alla that biological imperative kinda stuff.i have experienced misty-eyed heart-swellings over books like Much Loved, Dirty Wow Wow and Other Love Stories: A Tribute to the Threadbare Companions of Childhood, Dirty Bow Wow, and Chewed, and if you know of any others like these, please send titles my way.and this story, about someone reuniting with a beloved old friend, battered now by time and neglect—as short as it is, as achingly unresolved as it is, stirred my feels because i understand this character's swirling nostalgic remorse down to my core. I found the bear or, to be more precise, his remains: a furry wooden frame with a single front paw, a plastic button for one eye and bits of hanging black thread for the other.I grabbed him, holding him tight, clutching his dusty, bristly torso, and closing my eyes to keep the unexpected stream of tears from raining down on him.it's a lovely, forlorn little story, and i will never be too grown-up to feel the scouring, heart-panging joysorrow of a fuzzy friend loved into oblivion.[image]hero bear.read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

Everyone liked him.“He’d bring me along. He knew Mom would be passed out soon, and he figured a bar was safer for a ten year old girl than an apartment with no supervision. It was cool. I was kind of a mascot there.“One time, the bar got raided by the cops for letting the local high school punks in without checking IDs. I was there at the time. Nobody cared about me being there, but they wrote up the bar for all the teen-agers. Technically, the cops should have written them up for me, too. That should have been a clue, but I was too young to pick up on it.”“Pick up on what?” He interrupted.“You’ll see,” she said.He rolled his eyes.andy weir has a BONCH of shorties on his site, some that are part of ongoing or completed story cycles, and some that are standalones. over the years, i've read enough of his one-offs to know what to expect from them: a single page or a handful of breezy paragraphs building to a gotcha twist, which knowledge is kind of a bummer for reasons.

HOORAY!!Your average happy person didn't last in Alaska. It was too much work not to die all the time.i was going to do that exhausting thing where i  all of the stories individually, but there are only eight of them, and since the collection folds over itself, visiting some of the characters at different points in their lives, it's more like a location-specific The Candy House-shaped book, where the stories are linked-but-standalones, so i'll just star-rate the stories separately and  the collection in toto. short stories don't always do it for me, but i thought this was an excellent collection, and my ARC is now full of dog-eared pages signifying a phrasing or description i particularly liked. the stories are set across different points across time, tied together by the romance, the promise, the mythology, and the reality of living in alaska, and the types of people drawn to a life off the grid. I have a radio. Bland, official fuzz from NPR informs me of Obamacare, Social Security, the new Section 8 housing the city is building. I do not know how to do any of this: what forms you fill out, what websites will prove you were alive before you blew off the edge of the world into human vapor. I am fifty-six, and no official trace of me exists.when i read the synopsis of this book, i thought the whole ""survival against the unforgiving wilderness"" thing would be a more prominent theme, but it's more about emotional/psychological than physical survival; the conflicts are ""anywhere"" kind of problems—infidelity, loneliness, regret, scraping by—but the juxtaposition of alaska's stark and beautiful natural landscapes backdropping the tumultuous inner lives of the characters was a nice contrast. nature doesn't give a shit about your failing marriage—nature just quietly, stoically endures whilst you live out your comparatively tiny struggles. newman, whose characters manage to get by with limited financial, social, or actual, life-sustaining resources, also makes the most of her prose, conveying so much with succinct little phrasings: A little dead light explodes in her heart. orHer face scrambled.but she also gets to the center of her characters' hopes and disappointments with chewier prose:""Think about it this way,"" said Benny. ""We live or die together."" I was nineteen by then and he was the age I am now—sixty-seven. I held on to his words as though they were special to our situation, not an agreement you enter into with every person you ever care about. Even just in passing. andShe knew me so well...and still. I knew her so well...and still. Were these twin snowflakes of delusion the only reason we were even married—believing that one amazing day, either she or I would finally do something so unlike ourselves that we would finally make the other happy?i mean, ""twin snowflakes of delusion"" is a bit much, IMO, but the way she unveils the weary resignation of that story's relationship is otherwise extraordinary. Alcan, An Oral History is the longest story and the collection's standout piece—a swerving, heart-scooping emotional road trip that is, indeed, about the convergence of two differently-motivated road trips. it's long, but it still leaves questions tantalizingly unanswered. since so many characters pop up in multiple stories throughout the collection, i was hoping that some of these alcan-travelers would pop up again in a later story to fill in some blanks, but alas(ka), 'twas not to be. i'm glad i won this through the goodreads giveaways, because if i hadn't felt the gratitude-fueled pressure to read it within a reasonable timeframe, it would likely have just sat on my shelf collecting dust, because i'm just never hungry for short stories, and on the rare-ish occasions i DO pick up a short story collection, it'll be one by an author i have already read and enjoyed, not some stranger-danger risky-read. so, thank you to the gr-gods for forcing this debut collection into my hands. if anyone is reading this, the book is NOW AVAILABLE because i am slow at ing these days. argh.Howl Palace★★★☆☆ (but ★★★★★ for that title)High Jinks★★★★☆Nobody Gets Out Alive★★★☆☆Alcan, An Oral History★★★★★Slide and Glide★★★★☆Valley of the Moon★★★★★Our Family Fortune Teller★★★★☆An Extravaganza in Two Acts★★★★☆[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,95,1,"Apr 06, 2022","Apr 09, 2022","Dec 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58438624-nobody-gets-out-alive

Any second now, we might be devoured by a ravening SI with intentions we cannot begin to fathom.I say yet another because, you know: nuclear weapons, nanotech gray goo, biological warfare—all of which could be SI tools if the initial algorithm on which their self-learning depends decides these methods would further their goals. The standard model is that SIs, presently isolated from the Internet, learn like children, through self-directed assimilation. Developers are gambling they’ll grow up much wiser than us. Given their source material, I find that hope misbegotten. They might choose to love us, but why?And could their imagined trajectories be any worse than our increasing totalitarianism? Or any worse than one of the main hallmarks of what it means to be human, which is to kill our fellows, or even send our own kin to torture or death if a certain “belief”—whatever a belief might be, neurochemically speaking—has taken up residence in our unfathomable brains?Bring it on, I say. The change might be for the better.as much as i try to avoid novelettes during these one-a-day reading projects, this one was well worth the extra time and as it raises enough questions around tech and humanity and ethics and privacy and greater good and alla that, it verymuch needs the extra space to float everything out there. 2021 ends in a couple of days and then it will be THE FUTURE! get ready. read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

In fact, so satisfactory was their life, had Pushkin uncovered an old bronze lantern while tilling the fields and unleashed from it an ancient genie with three wishes to grant, he wouldn’t have known what to wish for.And we all know exactly where that sort of happiness leads.who knew amor towles was this good? i mean, besides the SCADS of people who have been pushing his books on my recalcitrant ass for years. scads, i tell you. and yet, no matter how many positive s i read, no matter how many times i read and reread the synopses, trying to find something that drew me in, they always seemed aggressively not for me. but i figured - read a shorty, see how it goes - and here we are. i loved this little pearl of a story about change and progress and patience and ingenuity and kindness and so many other good things i would surely mention here if i didn't have so much baking and wrapping ahead of me this evening. i loved every line of this and the end gave me a panic attack which means it is WORKING! The wisdom of the peasant is founded on one essential axiom: while wars may come and go, statesmen rise and fall, and popular attitudes wax and wane, when all is said and done a furrow remains a furrow. read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

They were real little people to him, with characters and thoughts and feelings of their own, and he was very tender with them all. But some attracted him especially from the first, and when they were brought to him maimed and injured, their state seemed so pitiful to him that the tears came easily. You must remember that he had lived among dolls during a great part of his life, and understood them.""How do you know that they feel nothing?"" he went on to say to Else. ""You must be gentle with them. It costs nothing to be kind to the little beings, and perhaps it makes a difference to them.""And Else understood him, because she was a child, and she knew that she was more to him than all the dolls.good news for else, for when she goes missing whilst returning a newly-repaired doll to its owner one evening, he's concerned enough to go looking for her despite some eerie things going on at the homestead. more frightened for his missing daughter than by the pitter patter of creepy little dollfeet, he is able to bring the mystery to a cheerful resolution, although perhaps not so much for creepy-doll-heroine nina in her mother hubbard frock. uplifting and unsettling and perfect for fireside xmas-reading.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"Dec 21, 2021","Dec 23, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59610625-the-doll-s-ghost

i don't, not really!), which offers people the opportunity to externalize and store their consciousness on a cube, preserving their memories so they can be revisited, re-experienced. these can then be uploaded and shared with an online collective, which anyone who has contributed their own thoughts and memories can then view. that sounds diabolical to me, but i'm barely a whisper online. in egan's near-future world, people are quite comfortable sharing their innermost, and nearly everyone is plopping the contents of their brains out there for the world to see. of course, even if you don't opt in, you're still visible in other people’s memories, in a more invasive form of tagging. naturally, there are resistors to the whole shebang; and a nonprofit called Mondrian shall lead them—the brainchild of chris salazar, bennie salazar’s son (remember him from goon squad? i do—but barely, and really only because of how excellent his name is), enabling ""eluders"" to opt out, hiring writers as ""proxies"" to stand in for an eluder—a whole cottage industry geared towards radical privacy. book clubs will no doubt enjoy the 'would you or wouldn't you' discussions this book will generate, and it's certainly a complicated issue. on the plus side:...tens of thousands of crimes solved; child pornography all but eradicated; Alzheimer's and dementia sharply reduced by reinfusions of saved healthy consciousness; dying languages preserved and revived; a legion of missing persons found; and a global rise in empathy that accompanied a sharp decline in purist orthodoxies—which, people now knew, having roamed the odd twisting corridors of one another's minds, had always been hypocritical.on the downside: loss of privacy, mega-surveillance, shame, knowing what everyone really thinks/thought about you, the disorientation of seeing the most meaningful moments in your life through someone else's critical filter, and just too too MUCH information. about everything. she does more than she ought to be able to do with this conceit, given how relatively short the book is—truly, every segment offers up some sort of rabbit-hole meditation to chew over—and i'm just going to briefly touch on a couple of the juciest-to-me parts of her imagined future.1) the diminished power of language—this is not directly related to the whole mandala v mondrian opposition, and it isn't a huge part of the book, but it interests me as a heightening of the semantic bleaching already dehydrating language in everyday usage, and a pushback against cliché in creative writing.It was Athena who first made them aware, in the workshop where Gregory and Dennis met, of word-casings and phrase-casings: gutted language she likened to proxies...""I want words that are still alive, that have a pulse. Hot words, people! Give me the bullet, not the casing—fire it right in my chest. I'll die gladly for some fresh language.""She meant their prose, not their conversation, but Gregory and his peers strained for fresh ways to say, in workshop, that a piece of writing was powerful (""coiled,"" ""obsidian,"" ""hegemonic"") or flat (""Waxen,"" ""kerneled,"" ""Coffee grounds"").2) fiction's place in a world teeming with Entertainment, where strangers' lives and memories can be viewed like movies, lacking any shape or context. ""But knowing everything is too much like knowing nothing; without a story, it's all just information.""we need our shepherds. 3) the toll of all of this on human behavior. this is a big one, and of particular fascination to me. she takes a multi-angled approach to it, and if anyone's looking for a dissertation topic, you could go nuts on it: particularly through the characters of alfred, lincoln, and chris. the first wink is alfred, who is desperate for authenticity, for [g]enuine human responses rather than the made-up crap we serve each other all day long. the phoniness of television revolted him in early childhood, and it just got worse....by age nine, Alfred's intolerance of fakery had jumped the life/art barrier and entered his everyday world. He'd looked behind the curtain and seen the ways people played themselves, or—more insidiously—versions of themselves they'd cribbed from TV: Harried Mom. Sheepish Dad. Stern Teacher. Encouraging Coach. Alfred would not—could not—tolerate these appropriations.he wonders: ""Why did people have to pretend to be what they already were?""chris' job entails creating ""algebraizations"" of storytelling tropes (Hero Delivers Comeuppance to Perennial Jerk, Blurred Faces Lean Over Protagonist, Gradually Sharpening), and finds this distillation of experiential universalities into data leaching the richness from his own life and flattening the way he interprets his own experiences (Straight Arrow Hijacked by Lawbreaker, Is Unexpectedly Exhilarated). lincoln is a ""counter,"" a profession seemingly custom-made for the neurodivergent, using his numerical-compartmentalizing life-slant to develop analytics/metrics to predict, exploit, and monetize human behavior.the relationship between actual human behavior and the systems designed to analyze these behaviors becomes all kinds of circular and insidious—algorithms and human behavior feeding off each other, reducing humans to traits and character types and expectations, presented as entertainment and regurgitated by performative behavior fulfilling these expectations. infinite jest is one of my all-time favorite books, and thematically, there's a lot of overlap between her and david foster wallace: technology, entertainment, addiction, loneliness, projected self v inner life and self-image, truth/history/memory, spies, individuality, and how we can be connected to absolutely everybody and still feel absolutely alone, scrolling through our own staged social media feeds for evidence of our happiness. it's a staggeringly strong book and a sharp poke in the eye of modern life and relationships. her prose is clean and bright, her characters are flawed and nuanced, and the book overall is resoundingly empathetic. my powers of articulation are not at their peak right now, but i blathered my best and now it's up to you to do better.

He brushes sand and shells from his trousers, double-checks his mooring rope, then spots one of the turkey buzzards perched on the island’s largest rock, peering down at him.‘Hi!’ he shouts in the voice he now hates – cracked and wavering, the voice of a fishwife. ‘Hi, you bugger! Get on about your business.’After a brief rustle of its raggedy wings, the turkey buzzard sits right where it is. Its beady eyes seem to say, But, Judge – today you are my business.Beecher stoops, picks up a larger shell and shies it at the bird. This time it does fly away, the sound of its wings like rippling cloth. It soars across the short stretch of water and lands on his dock. Still, the Judge thinks, a bad omen. He remembers a fellow on the Florida State Patrol telling him once that turkey buzzards didn’t just know where carrion was; they also knew where carrion would be.‘I can’t tell you,’ the patrolman said, ‘how many times I’ve seen those ugly bastards circling a spot on the Tamiami where there’s a fatal wreck a day or two later. Sounds crazy, I know, but just about any Florida road cop will tell you the same.’this is a fantastic story, more magical than horrific, and it rolls merrily along, building zero tension but fleshing out a pretty cool situation that involves death, but is not spooooooky, and then he ends it with a sudden startling I'M STEPHEN KING, BITCHES mic drop that catches you off guard and is very fun unless you are a person who can only have fun whilst being scared. in which case, read a paper. read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

How many messengers and knights and nobles and constables and other such folk has Shakespeare written into his plays? More than he can remember. More than he can count if he could remember. What do they do? Whatever the action requires of them. They come on stage. They say their lines and make their motions. Sometimes they exit.Sometimes they die.In a way, that is as it should be. The play could not advance without them. But never has Shakespeare thought to wonder what the world—the world of the play, the world within the play, the world as a whole—might look like through the eyes of such a personage. A playwright is but a lesser God. How do his smaller, less favored creatures live—do they live?—when his eye is not fully on them?Like this Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, perhaps?They are damned.

It was the big selling point of the building itself: Living there was like living in a fairy-tale castle where every piece of the structure was alive and enchanted to serve the needs of its inhabitants. The showers remembered how warm you liked the water and at what intensity, and balanced your usage with that of the other residents. The fridges told you when a neighbor in the kitchen network had the buttermilk you needed for that special salad dressing. The windows and lights got information about your alpha patterns and darkened to start sleep cycles on schedule. The smart locking systems recognized residents and their visitors, over time, and even introduced them to each other when their profiles matched. Membership in the building came with special pricing from affiliated brands on everything from home goods to auto-rental to nannying and tutoring. The more purchase points you accrued, the more rewards you amassed, which could also be applied to the price of maintenance or utilities. And a massive and very public data leakage from the network supplying this building and many others ensured that the developers had to offer almost unheard-of interest rates, which tempted buyers who might never have managed, otherwise.no and thank you.i found this story after sniffing around the site hosting the emily st. john mandel story i read yesterday (Mr. Thursday) and it sounded right up my tech-reluctant alley—technology as villain; Black Mirror and Maximum Overdrive and all that good stuff where machines crunch tender humanity in its smartdoors. unforchoonately, this was closer to The Turn of the Key, which is a book i very much enjoyed, but one that is decidedly not a SF 'machines will end you' angle. STILL! i liked the moves this story made, and even if it wasn't about sentient tech, it still doesn't make the idea of adopting a smart home in any way appealing. The Mansion made me appreciate how very dumb my home is. it suits me perfectly. anyway, revenge and progress—what could be better?read it for yourself here:https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/...*******************************************THE STORIES[image]come to my blog! ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Dec 14, 2019","Dec 18, 2021",,,view (with text),/book/show/50140394-domestic-violence

Let me explain.An iPhone 4 is among a number of items belonging to a recently reported missing person. It is not associated with any mobile network and at first appeared to be blank, with no call records, music, emails, texts or photographs. Upon closer examination it was found to contain a series of deleted audio files: voice recordings in various encrypted formats, with dates that span eleven weeks in 2019. we recovered these files and deciphered them.There are 200 files in total. We utilised specialist software and processed them in batches to speed up the transcription process. A key to this follows, along with the text. You will notice the transcription is phonetic, so spelling and grammar are quirky to say the least. On a number of occasions the software ""mishears"" or simply approximates words and phrases, especially when speech is in the vernacular. For instance, the phrase ""must have"" is frequently transcribed as ""mustard."" ""Going to"" becomes ""gun a"" and the town of Bournemouth is referred to variously as ""bore mouth,"" ""Bormuth,"" ""bore moth"" and ""boar mouth."" You will soon become accustomed to this and it should not interfere with your understanding of the material. I've sent these files to you, Professor, in the strictest confidence. Quite apart from any personal connection you may have to the subject, your expert opinion on their contents would be very much appreciated. Call me when you've read to the end and we'll speak then.Yours sincerely,Inspector Waliso with The Appeal, i felt reasonably-equipped to participate in the crime-solving; i have a good memory for details and for noting discrepancies between characters' versions of events, but here, i was verysoon outta my depth because codebreaking is not at all a part of my skill set. i'm fine with anagrams, but beyond that, my eyes kept balking anytime there was an explanation about how to go about cracking a code, and i just had to trust that the mystery would be solved by someone more capable at codesmithery and pattern recognition than dum dum me. however, i did try, and in the process, i played around with an online anagram generator and here are some choice selections from a much, MUCH longer list ( > 10,000) i generated using inspector waliso's name:answers il octopianoretic owl pissalts oneiric wopsalpinist cow rosealp crow noisiestalien crow positsair polices townsails inspector owacts spoiler winoactors spoil wineactors loin wipesacorns stop WilieAscot loin wipersASCII porn towelsAlonso rips twiceclitoris weaponseven though i was unable to participate in the investigative part of the experience, i had a ton of fun reading it. The Twyford Code has a better story to it than The Appeal, both because the structure of The Appeal isn't narrative, so it's jagged-by-design, but also The Twyford Code turned out to be more than *just* a mystery; there's a lovely and emotionally-rewarding story at its core THAT I WILL SAY NO MORE ABOUT (...). in conclusion: When you get what you want, you lose what you have.in conclusion #2: YOU DIE NINTH, TOLL WHIFFS.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,"May 18, 2022","May 19, 2022","Dec 18, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58451313-the-twyford-code

Scotch is what fat Americans call whisky.”so, it's about a young scot-tish man who answers an ad seeking a houseboy for a summer in london. it sounds like a pretty sweet gig: The position paid four hundred pounds a week, cash in hand, and offered free bed and board (bathroom en suite). The Englishman said that he would buy me a plane ticket, and I had refused. Then came a berth on the Caledonian Sleeper, and I refused that also. It was stupid to be so proud but I knew it wouldn’t do to be beholden so soon—certainly not to an Englishman. They were not to be trusted, my father would tell us, although as to why, he could never quite say.the bossman is a little bit vague on what his responsibilities will be, though:I asked my new employer what I would be doing. “Oh, this and that—cooking, cleaning, gardening. Let’s make it up as we go along, shall we?”but by day two the pretenses are already dropping and the conversation becomes more pointed: “I’m just quiet. My father always said ye shouldn’t talk just to fill a room—”“Big cock?”“Whut?”The man sighed. “Do. You. Have. A. Big. Cock?”turns out he's just one houseboy of many—next in a long line of a season-by-season rotation of indentured boys filling an old man's photo album. better than a lemonade stand, but it might not be the *right* summer job for him. read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

[image]it's set in 1985, and it has very strong stephen king/stranger things vibes—part coming-of-age story, part RUN FROM THE HORRORS story. Elias didn’t understand how friendship worked.

Intellectually he knew that whatever random collection of boys had been in his class at school he would have found friends. Robbie was just a roll of the dice. But he was Elias’s roll.

The Last Days of Rabbit Hayes was about a big irish family seeing their beloved daughter/sister/aunt/mother rabbit through the final days of her terminal illness. it was a vibrant story of a life well-lived; a larger-than-life character developed layer upon layer through the bittersweet memories of those about to lose her, and what made it such a striking and memorable book was how determined both rabbit and her family were to celebrate her life instead of dwelling on her impending death; telling stories and filling her hospital room with irish black humo(u)r instead of maudlin grief. Below the Big Blue Sky is the grief book, where all of the sadness they'd suppressed for rabbit’s sake is set free to seep into what's left of their lives now that she's gone. and it's pretty bleak. sure, there's some humo(u)r to relieve the relentless mourning, but mostly it's about the myriad ways that grief can be experienced on the path to healing. i am someone who struggles with becoming emotionally invested in fictional stories, and it's pretty stifling, as an empathically-challenged reader, to be immersed in secondhand grief. the way the rabbit's family dealt with the approach of her death was life-affirming, but they way they deal with grief is just...grief. over the course of a year, each character experiences her loss in their own individual ways: losing god, finding a cause, hiding out in the past, leaving the country, making drastic health choices, plowing through the pain using various shields—work, relationships, any distraction at hand to get through it, but regardless of how they choose to manage their loss, it all kind of reads the same—sadness is pretty one-dimensional.my main complaint (other than the obvious fact that it's uplifting to read about a family coming together in a time of crisis and it’s exhausting to read about them falling apart), is the great rabbit hayes herself. i loved rabbit in the first book—she was sweet and funny and kind and resourceful and flawed, living her life and facing her death on her own terms. her character was vividly drawn through her family's memories of her life's ups and downs and the book was a perfect living eulogy to an individual who touched so many lives. BUT—if you haven't read that book (or if you don't remember enough about it, considering there were seven years between the two books' pub dates), it's probably hard to understand the magnitude of the rabbit-shaped hole in everyone's lives, since this doesn't do much beyond sketching out the barest outline of her character. so, it's counting on your having read the first one, where you, too, fell in love with rabbit. if you haven't, it's hard to understand why she was Everyone's Favorite Person, and the hagiography gets a bit overwrought: 'The last time I saw you I was running you over,' Molly said.'That's right, I still have a scar on me elbow.' He showed it to her.'Where?''There,' he said, pointing to a small faded scar.'That's not a scar,' she said, pulling out a photo of a beaming Rabbit showing off a long, stitched cut on her forearm.'That's a scar.'rabbit hayes even got injured better than everyone else. every page is a parade of 'rabbit said this' and 'rabbit believed that,' and these cardboard-prop reminders are too flimsy to do the work The Last Days of Rabbit Hayes did in fleshing out her character, so everyone comes across as pathologically obsessed with this woman, building a whole laura palmer-sized mythology (but w/o the trainwreck personality) around her memory. while it's natural that she is remembered with such fervent love and admiration from her immediate family, the extension of this rabbit-worship into even her casual acquaintances seems forced and it's a little unsettling that the minutia of her life is still being trotted out with such excessive scrutiny a year after her death by people whose lives were only tangentially connected to hers. i get that there's a whole smalltown legend built around her: she died young, the local-boy love of her life died much younger—there's a bittersweet doomed romance angle to their love story that is appealing, but it just doesn't come across in this book the way it did in The Last Days of Rabbit Hayes, and the johnny-stuff in this one was, frankly, a little cheesy and kind of tainted the allure for me. i thought i was taking an emotional risk with this one—it was a bad time of year for me to be reading something so saturated in grief, but honestly—i thought it was a little boring. it just didn't have the sparkle of the first one, and i couldn't connect to any of the characters, although her father—holed up alone reading years' worth of diaries written in happier times while everyone around him spins out of control, and her sister grace—electing to have aggressive preventative surgery to avoid dying of the same cancer that killed rabbit, were very moving portrayals.i'm glad i read it—there are some strong moments, and it's a perfectly fine, sweet book, but i'm more glad that i read The Last Days of Rabbit Hayes, because i need a little more than sweet to fall in love. ***********************i only recently learned that this book, a sequel to the phenomenal The Last Days of Rabbit Hayes, existed, and i wish enough americans had read and praised that book to have made it worth the publisher's effort to publish it here, but MAYBE THERE'S STILL TIME! and maybe my  will convince you to check it out![image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Mar 16, 2022","Mar 20, 2022","Dec 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56096959-below-the-big-blue-sky

The slow discovery that you’re trapped is worse. Having to march your young children through decay and ruin in order to learn that you’re trapped is hell.apparently, there's a companion story, Darker Tide, that also qualifies for this project, so—spoiler alert—that is what i will be reading tomorrow if anyone else cares to join me. read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

I am consumed, utterly.""or when it leaned hard into one of my biggest pet peeves; unrealistic micro-evaluations of a character's fleeting facial expressions/vocal intonations (this example has BOTH!):A thread of sadness snagged on his last few words, and Feyi watched the grief move in a slow wave through his eyes.even with those things cluttering my path, there was more to it than those annoying bits and it is, at least, a very *complicated* love story. feyi is a young widow whose high school sweetheart jonah, whom she married right after college, died in a car wreck five years before the novel begins. since then, she's been defined by her grief, consumed with survivor's guilt, living with her best friend joy and keeping busy making her art, with no interest in romance, sex, or relationships....Feyi had moved down to New York, because if she was a monster, then so was the city, glorious and bright and everlasting, eating up time and hearts and lives as if they were nothing. She wanted to be consumed by the relentless volume of a place so much louder than she was, a place where her past and her pain could drown in the noise. Here, Feyi could keep her name and her unruined face, yet become someone else, someone starting over, someone who wasn't haunted. No one in New York cared about the vintage of sadness tucked behind her eyes and in the small corners of her smiles. She didn't have to drive, and she could cry on the train and no one would look, no one would care, because she didn't matter, and it was, honestly, such a relief to stop mattering.but after ""years of numbness,"" her sexual desires begin stirring again, and she's ready to start easing back into life and its pleasures. ""easing"" may not be le mot juste, as the first chapter finds her barebacking a stranger in a bathroom during a party, which is the kind of reckless behavior we're not supposed to applaud (and joy certainly gives her some grief over it), but it was just what feyi needed to kickstart her back into the deep end of the dating pool. feyi's hot girl summer/sexual reawakening involves three men whom she uses like stepping stones to return to life, beginning with milan, he of rawdog bathroom fame. she's gone through her five stages of grief, and now she's exploring the stages of love in all of its permutations:""...there are so many different types of love, so many ways someone can stay committed to you, stay in your life even if y'all aren't together, you know? And none of these ways are more important than the other.""what follows is a goldilocks romance plot where she test-drives a few different relationship models—with milan: great sex with no emotional intimacy, nasir: emotional connection with no passion, and alim: an older man who has also lost a partner and understands the core of her deepest pain. but, of course, there are some obstacles and turbulence best left unsaid for now. like most romance novels, it's more complex with emotions than with plot—everything moves very quickly except for the introspection, which is slow and sticky—and it embraces all the romance novel tropes: a beautiful protagonist, multiple attractive and appealing suitors who love talking about their feelings and their expectations and say shit like ""I very much want to respect your heart in this, too, which is why I'm asking about which boundaries feel comfortable for you,"" and, through them, she is catapulted into a fairytale dreamworld—getting her work into a prestigious art show alongside all of her favorite artists, introducing her to the artworld elite, staying in a celebrity chef's mansion in a tropical island paradise with frolicking monkeys and oh my god the food.it's a very sensual book—not just the sex, because reading about other people boning is whatever, but the food, the music, the vibrant foliage—feyi's is a full-scale multisensory reawakening, and that is the beauty of this book. not the jane austen parade of suitors or the ""hard and velvet and dew-tipped"" peens, but feyi's growing confidence as she emerges out of her trauma-coma and her willingness to engage with...everything again. if you want a fun drinking game, take a shot every time the word ""alive"" is used. here's a sampling:—It was the start of summer, she was alive and she was so fucking close to becoming what she wanted...—a roiling sweaty mess of alive—She was alive, like her therapist had taught her, and it was okay to live.—She was hers; she was alive; there was so much to do.—And, because Feyi was Feyi and she was alive, there was no way she could say no.—...because Feyi was herself, and alive, she kept going—It was a party, and she was drunk and alive.—To hell with the trouble this would bring, she was alive. —""...I think we're just figuring out how to survive a world on fire...that it's okay to be alive.""u drunk yet?so, i still don't like romance novels, but i'm rounding this one up to a four because honestly—i'm just impressed with emezi's raw talent. this is my fourth of their books, and each one has been so markedly different—Freshwater was challenging and structurally wild, The Death of Vivek Oji was a masterpiece but also straightforward enough for wine-soaked book clubs to appreciate, and Pet—well, i didn't really like Pet, but i was still impressed with what they produced for younger readers, even if i wasn't a fan. and even though i had to wade through a lot of blucky romance prose (every time alim called her ""sweetness"" (which is, for the record, TWENTY-TWO times), eyerolls ensued), when it's not being all romance-wincy, the dialogue is great, especially between feyi and joy, whose friendship is everything everything. i also appreciate that joy's character is a winky spin on the rom-com ""gay best friend"" trope, where the twist is that—unlike most rom coms, where the gbf is a boy—here the bisexual feyi has slept with her lesbian bestie. they hooked up for a while in the empty space before this book begins, but it never became a relationship, which is a shame because they complement each other so well and i'd rather see them together than feyi tits-deep in her messy-messy (but ""messy and alive"") situation. feyi is a compelling and flawed character and i get that we're meant to root for her because of what she's been through (and the fact that she makes a ""that's what she said"" joke automatically endears her to me), but the whole ""the heart wants what the heart wants"" shrug doesn't really mitigate every selfish decision, and she leaves some pretty significant destruction in her wake. love is often messy, but this one—yeesh. i do not envy what comes next for her.

[image](i am team VERB ALL THE NOUNS!)[image]through these comments, which alternate between teasing and confrontational, we get two very different perspectives of the central characters and their motives, and some insight into the dynamics of their relationship—a platonic m/f friendship whose central question is not the cheeky ""will they or won't they?"" but the ominous ""is she or isn't she?,"" and the dark suspicions art has been nursing for years about mercy and her effect on his life (and her furniture) shifts the narrative into spooky, uncanny territory. they met during art's senior year of high school, when mercy responded to art's ad recruiting members for the pallbearer's club; a group created by art as a sort of professional mourner service for people who died without family and friends to see them off into the great beyond. a gangly, scoliosis-stooped loner, art was immediately drawn to the enigmatic and effortlessly cool mercy, who became his virgil into pot, punk music, and the wonders of providence, both its contemporary (for them) club scene and its eerie historical legends, like the one about mercy brown, a notable woman whose story is known to all of little rhody's babygoths.[image]their friendship changed his life, but the precise nature of that change is the crux of this he said/she said account; a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-unreliable-narrator that depends on whether you believe art, who insists on referring to his book as a memoir, or mercy, who is equally insistent on reclassifying it as a novel. although she's—literally—sidelined, mercy is a vibrant, multifaceted character whose personality shines brighter in her brief comments than in art's smirking/sullen version of her. she can be sarcastic and barbed, pushing back against art's veryserious literary endeavor with some much-needed comic relief:The rest of this chapter? Jesus, man. The idea that you were going to sell/publish this as a memoir is batshit insane.but her reactions to what art's written about her are just as often desperately sincere—wounded by his misperceptions of her and her intentions. That hurt then, and it hurts now reading it.if art is meant to be paul tremblay/not paul tremblay, it’s not a very kind self-portrait, either in his physical descriptions, his behavior, or his writing skills, which—as art—are frequently turgid and overwritten. concerning the surgery to correct his scoliosis:I was going to emerge from the surgery physically transformed. Maybe not quite a butterfly poking through a chrysalis, but my kyphotic, cowering body would be radically altered/reconstructed by this time tomorrow. It might not be enough (it would never be enough), but I hoped it might be.that is a good example of art's prose-stylings; dripping with self-deprecation, laden with ominous foreshadowing and unnecessarily grandiose language, and mercy's more lively, conversational voice is a breath of fresh air as she rewrites his-story, often better, and certainly less self-consciously, than his own version of events. I sense you leaving, and I want to say a single word that somehow means sorry, please don't go, help me, it's not your fault, I wish it wasn't my fault, goodbye.I wrap myself around your leg and I sift myself through your very essence. I shark within your cells, and I breathe you all in—and—I am losing you and the loss is aching and delicious and bottomless and as addictive as the gain, as the replacing. You open the door, stand at the precipice, break away, and leave.mercy accuses him, multiple times, of romanticizing, lying, confabulating, she is incensed at his “libelous portrayal of my dialogue,” but as the book progresses, detailing an aimless life derailed by health issues, paranoia, and substance abuse, her commentary becomes longer and increasingly revealing, and buried beneath mercy's humor and her playful jabs are some heartbreaking realities that eventually—maybe—lead to the truth. we are all someone's monster, but we don't always get the chance to see our monstrous selves through someone else's eyes, and we don't always get a chance to apologize for what we've done.i don't know if i succeeded in my goal of summarizing this intelligibly, but i certainly plopped out a lot of words, so imma tie it off here, WITH ONE MERCY-LIKE MARGINAL NOTE:considering that each chapter of this memoir novel is named for a hüsker dü song, with additional titles snuck into the text (i see you there, The rest of the ride to the city was candy apple gray...), it is BANANAS that The Girl Who Lives On Heaven Hill did not find its way into the book.

It is the greatest privilege, the only way to know love, says Mother with the red hair. It is the fundamental reason for life.maeve never made it that far—following an incident on her 8th birthday, an escape attempt that ended in tragedy, the cult was raided, the mothers arrested, the children scattered into foster care. maeve was adopted, trailing clouds of trauma, and she spent many of her adult years unsuccessfully searching for her much-missed companion andrea before giving up hope. until one day, andrea finds her.andrea is happily married and professionally thriving; the ceo of multi-million tech start-up NewLife, whose wealthy donors have enabled her to cultivate a successful lifestyle brand around family planning and parenthood, although she has recently suffered the loss of her own daughter. maeve, on the other hand, is resolutely unmarried and childless, struggling to live in new york on a fiction editor's salary, and ""as unattached as it gets"" apart from a friend-with-benefits entanglement with a local bartender.Andrea's professional life was, admittedly, intriguing. Even in my childish imaginings I had mostly assumed she'd struggled too. It hadn't occurred to me that she'd be wealthy, accomplished, renowned, and loved. My cousin had made a real life for herself. What did I have to offer, after all these years? If my life was a lazy river, Andrea's was the Autobahn. I couldn't help but feel that all those years I was looking for her, she'd been busy leaving me behind. but, far from leaving maeve behind, andrea is eager to resurrect the sororal intimacy of their childhood, and the women fall back into old patterns, their lives intertwining as easily as if they've never been apart. andrea uses her wealth and influence to help maeve, generously offering her a home away from home in her sprawling catskills estate, absorbing her into her life of moneyed ease, introducing her to her baby-obsessed friends and colleagues, offering maeve a safe haven where she can plan her next moves as her life back home begins to skid off the rails. and there are only a few spooky and worrisome red flags marring the idyll. it's like they've never left. no, really—it's like they've never left.Just Like Mother is a very modern brand of gothic horror, but it doesn't stray far from the genre expectations. there are a number of jump-scares and plot twists, and they're all predictable enough that you wanna sit maeve down for an intervention, but even though it's clear where all this is heading, it's a spooky-fun journey filled with creepy dolls and creepier humans, the veneration of motherhood and the inescapable burdens of the past. and best of all, i now have a magnetic notepad that's gonna make me not even want to look at my to-do list, let alone accomplish anything on it, which is going to save me so much time! like maeve, I'd spent my life reaching for something bigger but wanting something easier. ignoring all my self-appointed tasks will certainly be easier.

He had the expression of a man who will speak politely to your face and then lop off your head the instant you don’t answer questions whose answers he has no right to know. He looked me up and down with the measuring eye of a man who loves his pleasures, but his look held no tremor of recognition. How could it, when he had last seen me in the guise of an old hag? He was the sort of man who knew for certain that witches took to witchcraft only because they couldn’t interest a man like him.this story is like a snuggie® wrapped around hans xtian andersen's The Tinder Box; a fairytale i always forget about until i get to that detail about the guard dogs with the various-sized eyes, and it gives me glad-goosebumps. those doggies deserve their own show. if you're wondering why social progress, in our world, is slow, and justice is delayed, it's probably because the immortal beings who are for whatever reason invested in our struggles can afford to take their time fomenting revolution through elaborate, multistage plots; a skull waiting ""for the right heart to pass by"" for years while we mortals live and suffer and die pawnishly. sure hope that right heart passes by soon, yeah? still, it's nice that they want to intervene and help us save ourselves, even when they get all corny about it. Those who fight for justice will die or they will live. Fate is beyond my power. But I will prick their hearts until they either choke on their own blood or are forced to swim in the river of truth.i'm being glib because i woke up in a MOOD, but i enjoyed the story and maybe YOU WILL, TOO!

If I returned home late, I could take it as a given that she would already have fallen asleep. When I turned my key in the front door’s lock and stepped into the flat, alone and with no one to greet me, washed myself and entered the darkened bedroom, the even cadences of her breathing struck me as inexplicably desolate. If I embraced her, hoping to ease this loneliness, her half-open, sleep-clouded eyes gave me no clue as to whether she was rejecting my embrace or warmly returning it. She only swept her silent fingers through my hair until the movements of my body stopped.this is about a relationship doomed for all the ordinary reasons; the couple plodding on lonely and hollow until their division bears itself out into a most extraordinary situation. stunning, sad, sharp—now i really need to read The Vegetarian.that's all i can muster—i have booster-brain and it's hard to be awake.read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

Food and music. The rest of it came later: the magic, the things that fueled it. We were angry before Marion came, even if we didn't know it. At our dads, at our dead moms, at ourselves for being fifteen years old with lives the size of a pinprick, and no idea how to change them. But it was Marion who gave our anger form.It started with the music. That's not where it endedthat is not at all where it ended—while many books would be happy to ride that thematic old pony all the way through, here it's only half of the story, and at the crooked heart at the center of this one is the story of a mother and a daughter and the secrets that separate them. the novel is split between two alternating POV timelines—one taking place in ""the city/back then,"" where best friends dana and fee meet older-girl marion and DO INDEED start messing with magic, with unintended tragic consequences. the second is set in ""the suburbs/right now"" where dana's teenage daughter ivy finds herself in a ""sins of the mother"" scenario, experiencing the spooky fallout from dana's impulsive decision in the wayback. so, yeah, a mother-daughter story that goes way beyond the ushe dynamic of teenage girls struggling to become their own person away from the shadow of the maternal wing. adult-dana is an odd woman and an aloof mother, with her scars and her secrets, her deep-rooted guilt, and she has caused real damage to ivy. and even though ivy's discoveries about her mother's past allow her to finally understand her, understanding doesn't always lead to forgiveness. dana's made some bad judgment calls, and committed some capital-b betrayals, and i appreciated how her choices complicated her relationships with ivy, fee, her husband—it's hard to bounce back from a lot of it, and it's refreshing that it doesn't all end up hunky-dory in the right-now-suburbs. along with the emotional complexity, the writing style is also terrific—the flow, the descriptions; the ""kaz brekker cheekbones,"" a character ""darting toward the fence on Barbie toes,"" a building that ""looked like the sentient dollhouse of a very bad seed,"" and there are also some keen observations, like this astute description of sharon—an adult woman who assisted the witch-trio in the beforetimes:She was one of those people who wielded her own history like a knife. Spend enough time with career alcoholics and you can spot this type from an avenue block away; threading their conversation with terrible, intimate revelations, designed to make you believe they're telling you their secrets. Making you think you had to pay them back in kind. Sharon was magically gifted, but I'd bet her true talent was an eye for damage.i have met some sharons in my day.and as for the girls, especially ivy—they’re more than characters, they feel like people. they are stubborn and headstrong and brave but they are also as flawed and fragile as all of us, despite their magical abilities. i did not expect to love it as much as i did. to repeat myself, this book is a corker. imma close this puppy out with a passage i particularly liked and also a fun fact: one time, this author interviewed me for a job i did not get. i bear her no ill will—the position evaporated, so no one got it, but i am tech avail for bookwork, should she—or anyone else—wish to hire me.anyway, play me out, boss:I never knew my mother. She died when I was two, and my dad wasn't the kind to keep a candle burning. When I asked questions, he'd send me to the kitchen drawer where he kept a stack of old photos and a rubber-banded lock of her red hair. So. A mother can be a photograph. My best friend lost her mother even earlier. Fee came into the world and the woman who'd carried her stepped out. Death transfigured her into a dark-eyed martyr, their apartment the reliquary where Fee's father tended to her traces. A mother can be a saint, then. A ghost. A blessed outline that shows where she's gone missing. Sometimes she's a stranger on a park bench, feeding her child from her fingers, the air between them so tender you could knead it like bread dough. Or a woman on the train, Coke in the sippy cup and yanking the kid's arm until it cries. I've always liked to watch bad mothers.A mother can be a paring knife, a chisel. She can shape and destroy. I never really thought I would become one.There are things a daughter should know about the woman who's raising her. If that woman had the courage. If she could say the words. Let's say you lie in bed at night and rehearse the things you'd tell her, if you could. This daughter of yours, infinitely unreachable and just across the hall. This deep into the disaster, what could you still say?Where would you begin?[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Jun 03, 2022","Jun 06, 2022","Nov 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58724863-our-crooked-hearts

A standard killware assault on the Pre-CR systems would not be able to take into account the alien system, not unless it was variable and could alter its behavior based on the protections and obstructions is encounters. I can't code that with the resources I have available.It was talking about something similar to the self-aware virus that GrayCris and Palisade Security had deployed against the company gunship, where I'd crashed myself and nearly wrecked my memory archive helping the bot pilot fight it off.that all sounds like BEEP BOOP BOOP rattling around in my brain and it takes me awhile to sift through paragraphs like that to make any sense of it. [savvy readers will note that ellipsis—i have omitted six words because i'm choosing to keep mum on something that other ers have shared freely (and it's not a spoiler at all so don't be one of those spoiler-scolders everyone hates), but i'm choosing silence because when murderbot's penny dropped (triggering my own one-cent tumble*), my jaw dropped. it DROPPED.and i want other readers to have that experience. two words: peri 4-eva.]so, yeah, i'm too dumb for a lot of this world's details.but, oh, the rest of it. murderbot's growth as an independent person, their cranky observations about human behavior (and biology), their stunned reaction to any kindness, their discomfort with their feels, their knack for getting out of tricky situations, and the reluctant burden of acquiring allies and even (saying it quickly to lessen m-bot's squeamishness) lovedones. it's funny and touching and FULL of sulking. murderbot-as-mentor is glorious, and the ending opens up so many possibilities for future adventures that i cannot wait to read. as long as mensah and murderbot keep in touch. She smiled a little. ""The good thing is, you do know what you want.""I sort of did know. It was a weird feeling. ""That's new.""She smiled all the way. ""I wasn't going to put it quite that way, but yes.""i'm not sure if the unwritten-but-commissioned murderbot books are going to be novellas or full-length novels like this one, but either way, i am OVER THE MOON excited to go wherever martha wells sends murderbot next.*you know who gives one-cent tumbles?

The Attentionist—Caroline Kepnes★★★☆☆creepy, slow-burning psychological horror. it has a bit of a megan abbott feel to it—her brand of dark coming-of-age exploration into the dangers young girls can stumble into whilst navigating the newly discovered terrain of their sexual opportunities. it's an uncomfortable and tense story, but it lacks the finesse, the fineness and subtlety that abbott brings to these themes. this one is like an urban legend version of a megan abbott scenario, where the female characters are more broadly depicted as cautionary tale victims without any of the dark, delicious adolescent power abbott bestows. i do not know why i'm so hell-bent on doing a compare-and-contrast piece on these two authors, but at least i committed to the exercise. the only other thought i have about this one is that the ending was weak and tacked on and it really deflated the narrative for me. A Life in Nightmares—Ramsey Campbell★★★★☆this one goes on down to cosmic town at the end, but before that, i was really enjoying the slippery dream-within-a-dream shape of the story; the author's skillful manipulation sending me into a succession of tightly controlled spirals and echoes, the very familiar and palpable sensation of waking up in that blurred state of not knowing what's real and what's a dream—he replicated the sharp tang of dreamfear disorientation perfectly. and then he had to go and get all lovecrafty on me and i said ""no thank you, sir!"" Papa Eye—Priya Sharma★★★☆☆i guess this is technically folk horror, but it's truly the gentlest horror story i've ever read. i was really looking forward to this one, because Rag and Bone and Fabulous Beasts were extremely good stories (and judging by my four-star rating, i also liked The Anatomist’s Mnemonic, but since i never ed it, i do not remember what that was even about—whoops). the writing is good, i just wasn't very excited by the story. which is a me-problem. Volcano—Livia Llewellyn★★★☆☆people who dig cosmic horror will probably gush all over this one because even though iiiii don't enjoy it, i can still identify an objectively good version of a thing i don't subjectively like and this one is objectively good. it's got a cryptic antiheroine at its center—a ragey social con-artist with...some kinda magical/supernatural capabilities i didn't fully understand, and the way the story builds is great, until it got the the part i really didn't understand because cosmic horror is a tease that never wants to tell you what it is you're supposed to be afraid of.All the Things He Called Memories—Stephen Graham Jones★★★★☆this is the first covid horror story i have ever read (i mean, besides the news). it's about what happens when you're forced to quarantine with a mad-scientist spouse and what her experiments might unleash. it is legitimately creepy and now i'm afraid of pockets. Trinity River Blues—Chesya Burke★★★☆☆this one is closer to urban fantasy than horror, although the heavy bird content pushes it into my own personal horrorverse. it involves horror nouns, like ghosts and demons and possession, but they aren't used in a horror way if that makes sense. it's more metaphorical than spooky, about loss and ambition and sacrifice, and it's another story that's written well, but just not my personal cuppa.The Familiar's Assistant—Alma Katsu★★★☆☆like the two full-length books of hers i have read (The Deep and The Hunger), her writing is smooth and measured and she knows how to pace a story, but honestly? it's not the most envelope-pushing horror story of all time. but it's also that i feel like i've reached my saturation point w/r/t vampire stories, and i'm not sure what it would take to impress or surprise me in that vein (hardy har), but this isn't it. Swim in the Blood of a Curious Dream—John F.D. Taff★★★☆☆this could probably be a four, my ratings are fluid. it's an interesting premise, and the prose is so cinematic that it feels like a pitch for an episode of some horror anthology-type show i would binge-watch the hell out of.The Sanguintalist—Gemma Files★★★★★this was the most delightful surprise of the bunch. years ago i read this author's A Book of Tongues and i hated it, so i was kinda dreading this one. but i ADORED this story, and it was my favorite in the whole collection. it, too, is more urban fantasy than horror, which is a genre i do not often read, but i would happily read more—many, many more—stories, novels, whatever about this character and this world because i freaking loved it. it's bloody wonderful (hardy har reprise).Mrs. Addison’s Nest—Josh Malerman★★★☆☆this was very similar to the ramsey campbell one in both its cosmic horror leanings and its inception-y* line-blurring between dream and vision and reality and yadda, but this one had more characters to keep track of and, coupled with its aggressive vagueness and the author pushing and pulling the reader into different half-detailed scenarios was a wicked confusing experience and i admit i lost the thread of it pretty early on, and then i realized i didn't care enough to go back and finetooth-comb it for meaning so i just let it carry me to its dissociatively vague ending, shrugged, and moved on. *although the tattoos-as-notes-to-self are a nod to a different christopher nolan movie.[image] Challawa—Usman T. Malik ★★★☆☆more folk horror, but i preferred this one to Papa Eye, because it's more much layered—even though the ending is inevitable given the genre, the stories branching off the trunk of the main plot are both their own things and thematic contributions to the main story, making it a richer reading experience all around. fuck, i'm a pompous douche sometimes. Enough for Hunger and Enough for Hate—John Langan★★★☆☆a very classic feeling horror story, putting a coat of supernatural frosting on the story of a murderer. langan takes his time to tell this one, but that is in no way meant as a criticism. i definitely appreciated the care he took with his storytelling —the slow creep of the horror felt purposeful and inexorable. but, like vampires, (view spoiler)[i might be all wendigo'd out. (hide spoiler)] for some reason i have encountered them a lot lately IN MY READING and the novelty has worn off.*********************************i'm not in love with the cover, but the guest list is OUTSTANDING! i'm gonna chip away at this for a while to get those 'spooktober in springtime' feelings.The Attentionist—Caroline KepnesA Life in Nightmares—Ramsey CampbellPapa Eye—Priya SharmaVolcano—Livia LlewellynAll the Things He Called Memories—Stephen Graham JonesTrinity River Blues—Chesya BurkeThe Familiar's Assistant—Alma KatsuSwim in the Blood of a Curious Dream—John F.D.

It’s not as strong as it was the first time around, but when she feels the curvature of the ball with whatever new sense her brain has flipped on with that switch, that feeling of deep satisfaction comes back, and she knows that it wasn’t a momentary thing. It feels like she’s holding that sphere in the palm of an invisible hand, one that’s much more strong and limber and precise than her own.T.K. laughs with relief. Then she picks up the ball with her mind and flicks it halfway across the court to the basketball rim on the far end. The ball hits the rim and bounces off. Before it can hit the gym floor, she picks it up again without effort, raises it slowly, and dumps it straight through the hoop.“Holy shit,” she says and laughs again.She has superpowers. She’s a damn ace.another day, another wild cards notch on my belt. this one is fine—it's your basic cookie-cutter superhero origin story: character discovers powers, uses powers for self-interest, uses powers for good, becomes overnight celebrity. fifteen-year-old lintilla, who prefers to be called tk for obvious reasons, is a rich girl with a paralyzed arm and the preferred dodgeball-target of her school's mean girls coterie until she discovers she can use her mind to shift the oncoming ball away from smashing into her, which is an excellent superpower to have if people are always throwing balls at your face. experimenting with her powers, she soon learns that she can control any spherical object: basketballs, marbles, ball bearings, bbs, lots of bbs at once, but in doing so, she causes a lot of property damage and realizes that what appeared, at first, to be a fun party trick could also be a dangerous weapon if she loses control. tk is amazed by her own power and a little horrified by its destructive potential, but not too horrified to take advantage of it for some sweet dodgeball payback. after this fun, frivolous introduction, the stakes are raised and the story plays out in the same general shape as the other ya-feeling WC story i read, The Thing about Growing Up in Jokertown: young girl uses her powers to stop a criminal and suddenly she's the center of attention. unlike Jokertown, which was a feelgood story through and through, this one touches on the less-positive repercussions of the powered lifestyle—tk is interrogated by the authorities, subjected to invasive media attention, deemed a distraction and a danger by her school, and all of the suspicion and scrutiny lands her right back to being an outsider freak again, only now it's for her power rather than her disability. She skipped right from disabled to too-abled, without getting to spend any time in between at just abled.but then she meets someone offering her an opportunity to use her powers towards the greater good, opening the door to a future she'd never imagined (which eventuality may or may not be covered in other wild card stories—i'm still new to the WCverse, so i've no idea). in any event, she's still a teen, so while she embraces her destiny by locking down her new superhero name (view spoiler)[slapshot (hide spoiler)], she's entitled to a few more years of goofing off and flinging tennis balls around with her mind before she's gotta become a working hero. a lot of superhero stories use the isolating nature of powers as metaphors exploring the experience of otherness; sexual identity &yadda, but i love how this particular transformation reads more like a judy blume-inspired story about menses:“So you basically suck for not telling me about this earlier,” Ellie says over the phone. Ellie has been T.K.’s best friend since kindergarten—their families have been friends since T.K. and Ellie were toddlers—and Ellie is one of the few callers who makes it through the mom-and-dad screening vanguard today.“I didn’t know until, like, two months ago, I swear,” T.K. says.“You found out at school?”“Yeah. In the middle of gym class.”T.K. gives Ellie the condensed version of the week her card turned, leaving out the part where she accidentally found out that she’s basically a walking weapon of mass destruction now.and we are, ladies. make no mistake.

Who could blame him? It was why so many of us were in this business. People had let us down. People had broken our hearts. We liked books and animals and messy rooms full of things that weren't people. these particular booknerds have loads of sex, but they are refreshingly more than the sum of their private parts. gran's writing is sharp, funny, relatable, and keenly observant, particularly in the prominent themes of loneliness and failure:My father was a man with huge, unrealistic dreams and absolutely no acumen for everyday life. What he had in abundance was alcoholism, grandiosity, and maybe manic depression. My mother had studied English at Boston University before she looked for someone to ruin her life and found my father. My parents were both terrified of trying to improve our lives, long sapped of the strength for any more risk. But they approached failure with cheerful bravery, making every move and step down seem like a new adventure for as long as they could. lily albrecht, daughter of this ambition-averse couple, seemed poised for success and happiness; writing an acclaimed novel at a young age and marrying her absolute soulmate before circumstances reduced her to the struggle of supporting herself by dealing rare books and the lonely burden of being a caretaker to a husk of a man who can give her neither physical, emotional, nor intellectual stimulation. abandoned by the literary fair-weather friends who once made up her social circle, she's become a creatively-drained incel, as trapped in a state of existing-without-living as her lump-of-meat hubby. so, when she's offered the opportunity track down a copy of a mysterious black-magic-book alongside a sophisticated, charismatic gentleman companion; an endeavor promising a huge financial reward, a much-needed change-of-scenery, and the possibility of romantic shenanigans, she jumps at the chance. and if the magic this book contains has indeed been responsible for the wealth and success of countless people over the centuries, perhaps she can use it to turn her own life around. it's a globe-trotting sexual awakening journey involving clandestine meetings with multiple people who have designated sex-rooms in their homes and books stiffly coated with layers of a few centuries' worth of human sexual fluids. NB: if you find yourself in the private home of someone with a designated sex-room, you do not want to luminol their libraries. since others here have already disclosed the Soylent Green reveal of the book's title, i'm gonna risk the torches of the Spoiler Brigade and share this GIF—the first i have ever been inspired to create: [image]although i recoiled at every scene involving smearing sex juices on books (of which there are many), i really enjoyed this one, and for a novel so saturated with magical elements, the monkey's-paw realism of its ending was melancholy perfection.

The answer is that though it was only after this last visit to Dr. Gold’s that I thought to actually write it down, I have been telling myself this story again and again for the last thirty years, taking it apart and unpacking it, examining each detail as I gather brokenhearted lovers do, though I have never had my heart broken and only rarely been a lover.

Gobbets of meat warmed its belly and weighed it down, and it felt pleasant toward the world and its whelp. Because I am hungry.But why not eat—the small monster took a breath—your own leg?Silly. I am your parent. I birthed you. You are mine.But it hurts.It grows back.And neither said a word more.man, this little monster can't catch a break! it's 'rescued' from a limb-munching parent by a beastie who promises to only monch a limb if it can't find a meal less destructive or humiliating to consume, but once the beastie gets a taste of how delicious little monster's little limbs are, it's MONCH CITY until the little monster is whisked away from its clutches by a bird, for a delicious-morsel price. then, little monster's sympathies are roused by a wounded creature it tries to help, which—predictably—ends terribly, (view spoiler)[although the outcome is unpredictably in the monster's favor and involves some excellent eye trauma: Its claws clamped onto its pursuer’s skull. And as the rat-nosed thing swung its head and shrilled, the small monster bit out one silver eye and slit the jelly of the other. Then it leapt down and tore at the taut, thin skin where the rat-nosed thing’s wounds had barely healed. The small monster scratched until the tender flesh parted and showed again the stark white bones. It bit and squirmed into the rat-nosed thing, crawling inside the warm, plush cage of its ribs.The small monster ate what it found there: bitter, bilious, savory, sweet. (hide spoiler)] and then it meets a little crab-critter; an artist/therapist/hippie type who teaches the monster how to protect itself from monchers of the world and channel its pain into something beautiful.None of us can change what has happened to us, the clawed creature said. But if we are lucky, we live. If we are lucky, we do not lose more than we can afford. Much regrows. Claws, tail, teeth, even the vaporous stuff the poets call soul. And bitter experience provides material for art. Ask a shipwreck. Ask an oyster.there're some visits by ghosts of trauma past (the left-behind sibling part is particularly well-done), and some confronting prior injustices and it's definitely a dymanic story. however, it's a little smack-you-in-the-face with its metaphors for my tastes, although i get why others love it.and before you start feeling all awwww for this poor l'il monster, please note:A seagull stooped at the seal carcass. The small monster broke its neck with a blow.Wish I could do that, the clawed creature said.Eat, the small monster said. You’ll be big enough, one day.first of all, yikes. second of all, while i am no apologist for birds, if you kill a seal, take a couple of bites out of it, and just leave the corpse lying on the beach, birds are gonna consider that a buffet, and breaking a bird's neck for trying to snatch a bird-mouth-sized bite seems disproportionately aggressive to me. just saying.[image]read it for yourself here:https://www.tor.com/2021/10/20/small-...[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,not set,"Oct 23, 2021","Nov 03, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59135499-small-monsters

They inserted a funnel between my lips and tipped it through. The sand trickled into the back of my throat, muffling my squeals, clustering over my tongue and toothless gums.“Sand” is a heart-wrenching tale about generational trauma and healing.boy, is it ever. it's a clever, original conceit, and the descriptions of its insertion, and the discomfort of dealing with the ever-present sand in one's mouth—it was a very vivid and squirmy-feeling experience for this reader. in this story, the sand/baggage is an unavoidable part and process of parenthood:There are things about parenthood you can’t really know until you’re a parent yourself – not because they put you on a higher plane of existence, just because they’re too weird or difficult to explain. The paper bag is one of them. All parents get them. One for each child. They’re white airsickness bags, with simple instructions printed on the front in navy blue and a clear, plastic funnel inside. There’s a slightly different process if you adopt – you have to send the sand to the adoption services ahead of time – but you still get sent the paper bag. It’s a whole thing. If you’re a parent too, you’ll know what I’m talking about. The instructions are pretty out there, but you follow them anyway. You spit into the bag – just you if it’s just you, but your partner too if they’re around – then you seal the bag up and leave it under your bed until it’s time for the birth.In that time, the sand grows, mixed from your collective spittle inside it and your sleeping position over it. It absorbs your conversations, the music you play, soaks in the places you go, the friends you meet. You can’t avoid it; it’s just what happens. You can’t unseal the bag. You don’t get to see the colour or weight of the sand you have to put into your child’s mouth until they’re born. It wouldn’t matter even if you could: by that point they exist, and so the sand exists. It’s inevitable.but just because it's inevitable doesn't mean that, with care and self-awareness, it can't be modified into something less destructive, and this story ends on an unexpectedly positive and hopeful note.

[image]13 minutesthe synopsis of this story is both concise and precise:A woman wakes up to find that her girlfriend has ripped her heart out of her chest. It's not the first time this has happened, but it will be the last.it's pretty clear, reading that, that this is going to be one of those metaphorical stories, about the horror of abusive toxic relationships. this story would be good friends with In the Dream House; the two pieces nursing each other's wounds and sharing their experiences suffering at the hands of their unreasonable and violent lady-loves and raising a glass to getting away from them into healthier partnerships. listen to it here: https://play.google.com/books/listen?...THE STORIES:OCTOBER 1: 57 REASONS FOR THE SLATE QUARRY SUICIDES - SAM J.

[image]21 minutesone of the veryfew movies that ever scared me (and i mean SCARED ME, so that even now, just thinking about it, i'm looking over my shoulder a little bit), was one i saw at a very young age, with a little story-within-a-story sequence involving a trucker.YEAH, YOU KNOW WHICH ONE I MEAN, DON'T MAKE ME LOOK AT HER!! (view spoiler)[  [image] (hide spoiler)]NOOOOOOOOOso when it comes to trucker-horror, i'm predisposed to being spooked by it, but, paradoxically, i got childhood scars toughening up my psyche's susceptibility to it, and a high-set bar you're gonna have to work hard to clear. like many of the other shorties i've listened to for this project, this one was very atmospheric and eerie but it didn't make me eek or anything. his writing is descriptive enough to almost have a visual quality to it, and i could see this story being adapted into one of those horror anthology shows on the teevee. there was one thing, though, that was truly creepy, and that was the grown-man-narrator doing the voice of a little girl. ramón de ocampo, you will make my nightmare reel with that one. and that's a good thing.i wanna be skeered, please.listen to it here: https://play.google.com/books/listen?...THE STORIES:OCTOBER 1: 57 REASONS FOR THE SLATE QUARRY SUICIDES - SAM J.

[image]26 minuteseerily ambiguous, this story is about a teacher who hates her job, especially as the 1 1/2 hour commute each way, each day, means she never sees the sun, which leaves her feeling isolated and unmoored from the rest of the world, resenting each long drive alone through the darkness. then, her students start getting sick, not showing up to class, the hallways becoming emptier with each passing day. what is happening? is it a real epidemic-scenario, or the delusions of the narrator's spirally descent into daylight-deprived depression, paranoia, and maaaaaadnesssss? once upon a time, i worked a 10pm-6am shift, and lemme tell you, the vampire-novelty of that schedule soured fast. completely disconnected and out of step with the world around me, i felt helpless and depressed all the time. there was something so grimy-feeling about going to bed as the people in the apartments around me were just heading out to their much-better jobs, and i stopped even feeling like a human for a while—i was just a thing that did a job and ate and slept on an entirely different plane of existence than everyone else. it fucked me up a lot, and listening to this story brought back all of those jittery-itchy, what-even-is-real? feelings, so ymmv, but to me, this story was chilling. listen to it here: https://play.google.com/books/listen?...THE STORIES:OCTOBER 1: 57 REASONS FOR THE SLATE QUARRY SUICIDES - SAM J.

The Snake, being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, “At least my enemy and I shall perish together.”this reconfigures the fable with human participants, employing some effective body horror to tell the tale of a supernaturally-enhanced assassin-for-hire enacting a revenge-plot on behalf of her cuckolded employer, with an outcome that does not go to plan. it dabbles a little too much in the realm of cosmic horror for my personal liking, but the parts the my feeble brain could grasp were chillingly good. listen to it here: https://play.google.com/books/listen?...THE STORIES:OCTOBER 1: 57 REASONS FOR THE SLATE QUARRY SUICIDES - SAM J.

[image]first things first: if you are an animal enthusiast[image]you will already know that there is a difference between a possum and an opossum. [image]i disagree with that cutie v. freaky distinction, since i think opossums are every bit as cute as their australian counterparts[image]#nofilterbut in this book, and to most people stateside, these critters are 'possums,' dammit, and that silent ""o"" gets dropped like it was never even there because silent letters are for suckers and if you want to get noticed, it's better to scream. [image](view spoiler)[  [image] (hide spoiler)]i know a lot of people have knee-jerk negative reactions to possums, with their plague doctor faces and graspy-tentacle tails[image]but they're harmless little critters; their defense mechanism is pretending to be dead, for goodness' sake, and all that hissing and tooth-baring ain't nothing but bluster[image]as sophia, the book's preteen possum advocate, has learned from animal advocates on the youtube: ""...it's near impossible to provoke a possum into biting you. They're sweethearts.""[image]they eat ticks and cockroaches by the thousands, they're essentially immune to rabies, and they're the only marsupial we have in the u.s., so we should cherish them and give them all of our bananas. [image]however, it must be said: possums do not give a fuck. i was leaving my friend's place one night, and as i opened the door to the foyer, i noticed a possum waddling down the stairs approaching the exterior door. [image]i crouched down to say hello through the glass because i am a Friend to the Animals, and that mofo hissed at me. [image]it then waddled back up the stairs and i opened the door, whereupon it looked over its shoulder at me and hissed AGAIN, like i was the intruder preventing him from getting to his apartment. [image]i respect that attitude. another thing possums do not give a fuck about is genre conventions. in this book, the first victim of the monstrous marsupials, whose bites turn people into human-sized possums, is the one who would ordinarily be the final girl: a good and decent young woman who storms out of her boyfriend's place after calling out his friends on their racist jokes. true, she accidentally hit the possum with her car, but she was trying to HELP it when it attacked her. [image]and what about the aforementioned sophia—defending their reputations, rescuing a batch of baby possums from the pouch of their dead mom, feeding them kitten formula and calcium supplements with a teensy eyedropper and trying to save their lives. do the possums spare her?[image]no spoilers here, although i will disclose that possums can really RUIN a wedding reception.[image]this one is great fun, and it ends with what i hope is a foreshadowy tease for another book, featuring another species.fun formatting facts: there are no page numbers, it skips from chapter nine to chapter eleven (but there's no missing content; chapter ten is just silent like the opossum's o), there's a secret code for those of you who speak languages or are tattoo artists:[image]my favorite formatting idiosyncrasy is that the trigger warnings are AT THE END of the book. no, i won't tell you what they are. animal horror is strictly survival of the fittest. (wait for it......)[image]fun fact that isn't about formatting: the very morning i started reading this book, i was hand-feeding a squirrel (see above: Friend of Animals) and it misjudged what was me and what was nut and it BIT my thumb! i have not yet turned into a squirrel, but i'm still holding out hope. and nuts.this book is part of a series of killer-animal books whose faux-distressed covers were designed by kealan patrick burke:[image][image][image]i have already read The Roo and both The Buck Stops Here and The Cassowary are on their way to me as i type this, but i have only been able to find 'dillo mentioned online, with no way to throw money at it and have it here in my home. [image]any information about when it will be published/where i can get a copy would be greatly appreciated, because i am NOT going to type 'dillo into amazon again and have their algorithm shout OH YOU MEAN DILDO?

I asked my director for a two-day leave of absence so that I could go on a short trip and clear my mind. He agreed, but only on the condition that I take a pair of eyes along with me. I accepted, and he took me to pick them up from the Control Center.i have never read anything from this author before*, as he always seemed to be too far on the sci side of sci-fi for my mooshy little brain, but this was the free tor short of the week, so i took the plunge and it turns out that my mooshy little brain was up to the task, after all!! the premise is intriguing, and i'll let him explain it for me:Millions of people worked year-round on the Moon and the Asteroid Belt. The cost of a vacation back on Earth was astronomical – pardon the pun – which is why the space bureau, in all their stinginess, designed this little gadget. Every astronaut living in space had a corresponding pair of glasses planet-side. Those on Earth lucky enough to go on a real-life vacation would wear these glasses, allowing a homesick space-worker to share the joy of their trip.People had originally scoffed at these devices. But as those willing to wear them received significant subsidies for their travels they actually became quite popular. These artificial eyes grew increasingly refined through the constant use of the most cutting-edge technology. The current models even transmitted their wearers’ senses of touch and smell by monitoring their brainwaves. Taking a pair of eyes on vacation became an act of public service among terrestrial workers in the space industry. Not everyone was willing take an extra pair of eyes with them on vacation, citing reasons such as invasion of privacy. As for me, I had no problem with them.so our narrator heads to earth, letting his figurative passenger choose the destination, ending up in china's taklamakan desert, now a vast grassland. the woman whose 'eyes' he is wearing is both grateful and melancholy during their visit—desperate to see and smell and touch everything—the land, water, giving names to all of the flowers, during which the narrator alternates between being charmed and bored by her numerous requests. there's a poignancy to her appreciation of these simple pleasures that so many take for granted, and the narrator is moved by her reactions even as he feels somewhat trapped by her urgency to experience and absorb every last drop of their surroundings. and—oh, when he returns home and realizes who and where she is, her sensory hoarding makes so much sense and it's a suckerpunch straight to the feels, my friends. it's a beautiful story, and while the message could have been facile and trite in a lesser author's hands, it is written with such delicate confidence that it becomes profound and immediate in a way that is very welcome to cynical old me.if he has more stories like this one, count me right the heck in! [image]read it for yourself here:https://www.tor.com/2021/09/22/with-h...* oh, wait—i DID read another tor short by him, The Weight of Memories, all the way back in TWENTY SIXTEEN and it is still on my ' pending' shelf, which sucks for me, since i don't remember anything about it. this is what happens when i fall behind in my ing; a more-or-less ongoing situation that has become even more shameful these past few weeks and i'm just curled into a ball of shame over it.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,not set,"Sep 25, 2021","Oct 01, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18160988-with-her-eyes

WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET’S FIND OUT!All I wanted to do was watch media and not exist.murderbot always hits the spot. i was cranky and depressed, staring at my bookshelves for something to entertain me out of my mood, when it hit me—you know who else is cranky and depressed and uses entertainment as self-care? MURRRRDERRRRBOOOOOT!this one's maybe not my favorite in the series; my flawed brain had to blah-blah a lot of the logistics and tech-stuff, but murderbot + locked-room mystery is the french fry in my frosty, so there's a lot to love here. as always, a tight plot that resolves itself in a satisfying and unexpected way, with plenty of m-bot's signature wry commentary on the proceedings as they endure the suspicion and prejudice that comes with being a rogue secunit amongst humans. Aylen looked me over again in that way humans do when they're trying to intimidate you and they fail to understand you've spent the entire length of your previous existence being treated like a thing and so one more impersonal once-over is not exactly going to impress you.this time, murderbot overcomes their antipathy towards these human skeptics and becomes a reluctant hero...JK that's what murderbot ALWAYS does, but it never gets old, because their (figurative) eye-rolling disgust and sleuthing ingenuity is such a BALM to my SOUL, as is their learning curve when it comes to ""trying not to freak out the humans it's meant to be helping."" Aylen was watching me intently. ""I don't like having private security with its own agenda aboard this station.""Oh wait, she thought it was GrayCris. That maybe I had found out Lutran was a GrayCris agent and killed him, and now I was trying to lead the investigation along a specific path, using my two oblivious human friends as cover. So, the problem was, that wasn't an unlikely idea at all. It was something I might have to do if I did find a GrayCris operative on the station. which meant I had to answer very carefully.There were a lot of humans lying to each other on The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, and I knew outright angry denials tended to sound incredibly guilty, even though they were often an innocent human's first impulse. You wouldn't think lying would be a problem for me, after 35,000 plus hours lying about not being a rogue SecUnit while on company contracts, then the whole lying about not being an augmented human and lying about being a non-rogue SecUnit with a fake human supervisor. But the last two hadn't exactly been failure-free; what worked best was misdirection and not letting myself get caught in the wrong place at the right time, and making sure no humans ever thought about asking the wrong questions. Misdirection, let's try that. ""I would have either disposed of the body so it was never found, or made it look like an accident.""Indah frowned, and Aylen's brow creased, and they exchanged a look. Eyeing me, Indah said, ""How would you dispose of a body so it wouldn't be found?""I'm not the public library feed, Senior Officer, go do your own research. I said, ""If I told you, then you might find all the bodies I've already disposed of.""""It's joking."" Ratthi managed to sound like he completely believed that. ""That's how it looks when it's joking.""He sent me on the feed, Stop joking.Gurathin sighed and rubbed his face and looked off into the distance, like he regretted all his life choices that had led to him standing here right now. On our private feed connection, he sent, Or you could just show them where you were when this person was being killed.(Yeah, on reflection I think I misdirected in the wrong direction. It was the kind of thing a human or augmented human could get away with saying, not a rogue SecUnit. Even if they knew I was just being an asshole, I'd made them wonder, I'd put the idea in their heads.)(And now if I did have to kill some GrayCris agents, I'd have to be really careful about what I did with the bodies.)(It was probably better to make it look like an accident.)murderbot—winning hearts and minds and complaining about it all the way...thank you for your service. i would hug you if you'd let me. ****************************************i was told by the murderbotters among you to read book 6 BEFORE book 5 and, like murderbot, i am learning how to trust humans, so i hope i don’t regret this crazy backwards-seeming choice and end up having to launch a drone into anyone’s face (okay, so i MAY have read the first few pages of Network Effect before giving in to murderbot-fan advice and saw the part about launching drones into annoying human faces) fingers crossed! for the sake of your collective faces.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,120,1,"Sep 10, 2021","Sep 10, 2021","Sep 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53205854-fugitive-telemetry

Reapers are the reason fewer people board doomed flights and good dogs sometimes bark at nothing.i have read a lot of stories about humans—either before or after their deaths—assuming the roles and functions usually attributed to supernatural entities like capital-d death (or in this case, capital-r reaper), but this one is particularly well-executed, which is unsurprising, considering my alix-harrow-shaped readerheart. i am no sentimentalist, and ordinarily this premise—a reaper struggling with the directive to ferry the soul of a two-year-old boy into the afterlife, having conflicted feels about it because of the too-early death of his own son—wouldn't be my thing, being far too intent on its ham-fisted heartstring-tugging agenda for me to respect it.and yet.although it didn't make me weep (or even mist up SORRY I AM ROBOT), from a purely critical standpoint, it hits all of its storytelling beats successfully (BEEP BOOP), and its ending is a perfect combo of closure and surprise. if anyone knows if she has any more stories that qualify for this project, send 'em my way plz. read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 3: THE FRUIT OF MY WOMAN - HAN KANGDECEMBER 4: THE TINDER BOX - KATE ELLIOTTDECEMBER 5: BABYCAKES - NEIL GAIMANDECEMBER 6: HIS MIDDLE NAME WAS NOT JESUS - NOVIOLET BULAWYODECEMBER 7: SING A SONG OF SIXPENCE - LILLI CARRÉDECEMBER 8: DARK TIDE - MARK LAWRENCEDECEMBER 9: DARKER TIDE - MARK LAWRENCEDECEMBER 10: BREAK - MISHELL BAKERDECEMBER 11: A RUMOR OF ANGELS - DALE BAILEYDECEMBER 12: THE ENGLISHMAN - DOUGLAS STUARTDECEMBER 13: IT CAME FROM CRUDEN FARM - MAX BARRYDECEMBER 14: NO MOON AND FLAT CALM - ELIZABETH BEARDECEMBER 15: A STUDY IN SHADOWS - BENJAMIN PERCYDECEMBER 16: ART APPRECIATION - FIONA MCFARLANEDECEMBER 17: THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS - SILVIA MORENO-GARCIADECEMBER 18: WE HAVEN'T GOT THERE YET - HARRY TURTLEDOVEDECEMBER 19: THE DUNE - STEPHEN KINGDECEMBER 20: THE WORTHINGTON - EMILY CARROLLDECEMBER 21: SUNBLEACHED - NATHAN BALLINGRUDDECEMBER 22: BLOOD DAUGHTER - MATTHEW LYONSDECEMBER 23: THE LINE - AMOR TOWLESDECEMBER 24: PIGEONS - NIBEDITA SENDECEMBER 25: WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED, WHAT WE WILL FORGET, WHAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FORGET - EUGENE LIMDECEMBER 26: ONE/ZERO - KATHLEEN ANN GOONANDECEMBER 27: MATINEE - ROBERT COOVERDECEMBER 28: ACCESS - ANDY WEIRDECEMBER 29: UNNECESSARY THINGS - TATYANA TOLSTAYADECEMBER 30: HOOK - DANIELLE MCLAUGHLINDECEMBER 31: HE'S VERY WELL READ - CATHERINE LACEYprevious years' advent calendars (what's left of 'em):20162017201820192020[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,not set,"Dec 02, 2021","Sep 08, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56524117-apex-magazine-issue-121

WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET'S FIND OUT!SEPTEMBER 1[image][image]in the tradition of the cluttered canvases of bosch or where's waldo?, here the artist has depicted a number of ghosts, both human and animal, descending several vines to mingle with the living, to their great distress. a fleeing centaur represents our discomfort with our own mortality while the ghost sneaking up on another ghost and startling it is a clear reference to the bard's famous ""haunters gonna haunt"" soliloquy. other notable figures are the puking ghost whose partner is holding back their ghost-hair as well as several birds and good riddance to them. the ghosts above and several of the terrestrial figures running away are kinda interchangeable and i'm sure there's some artsy reason for that and NOT a reflection on the artist's limited skills.SEPTEMBER 2:[image][image]this piece is called MORNING COMMUTE, NYFC 2021. in it, i am depicted wearing my mask properly (nose and mouth BOTH covered, tyvm) whilst everyone around me ignores the MTA's rules and basic city-living courtesy; puppy-piling in and unleashing covid-spores all over the place. it's maybe not quite this bad, but this is how it feels. don't worry—i just renewed my artistic license so i'm not gonna get fined over stretching the truth for dramatic effect.SEPTEMBER 3:[image][image]so, i didn't want to be some basic bitch horse led to a well to outline someone else's flowers, and when i saw all these little faces popping out at me, [image]instead of coming up with a plan to fine-tune them into a cohesive visual narrative, i yelled ""FACES"" like an unbright child and doodled them in, so here's...this. ta-daaa? i could bullshit and say they are shooting stars or the fairies that bring dreams to children all over the world, but real talk: this is probably how this project's gonna go—pages cluttered with heaps of unrelated nonsense; the artistic equivalent of hoarding, signifying nothing. to celebrate the uneasy relationship between wildly disparate things occupying the same space, please enjoy this oingo boingo song whose title i am borrowing for my masterpiece: REPTILES AND SAMURAI[image]woof.SEPTEMBER 4[image][image]although this brings to mind the words of the great poet rockwell, ""i always feel like somebody's watchin' me...and i got no privacy,"" there's no 'me' in 'reverse coloring book.' we're on this journey together, so instead i offer this more inclusive poem: eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs. eyeballs everywhere! eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs. floating through the air!SEPTEMBER 5[image][image]i had to bake a million things last night and i didn't have time to post, so here's a belated rainbow salad. it would probably taste horrible, ingredient-wise, but rainbow-lovers can't be choosers.

They'd come with torches and muskets and stones and appled faces. Would they hang her? Drown her? Tie her to a chair and lower her into the ocean? Lock her in the stocks or force her into the pillory? She feared her fate would likely be worse: they'd burn her alive in her own cabin.witches get stitches.fortunately she's prepared for this eventuality and long ago hatched an escape plan with owen townsend: childhood friend and son of the captain of the Primrose, now twenty-one and grown into a flirtatious, adventure-seeking sailor who has promised to take her away from this small-minded community, given that he owes her a really big favor. for reasons.but owen's dragging his feet, making her wait one more season, one more run, until his half-french ancestry suddenly puts him in jeopardy as working-from-home king william wages war between french and english settlers. ruth's association with owen drags her deeper into danger, forcing her to choose between self-interest and loyalty, risking the small safety she's managed to claw for herself through strategic necessity.i usually blah blah the romance parts of books, but i'm much more attentive to them when the dramatic complications are legitimate, and while ""gallows"" is a pretty legit relationship hurdle, it's not the only one plonking itself down between this couple and their romantic happiness. it is an emotional roller coaster that even yr stonehearted girl over here became invested in. when i was a tiny munchkin growing up in little rhody, i loved The Witch of Blackbird Pond, in which a sixteen-year-old orphan finds herself accused of witchcraft in 1687 new england because she doesn't assimilate gracefully into the puritanical community; befriending quakers and other outsider-types, including a friend/love interest who is a sailor and captain's son. this is almost like a grown-up version of that story—it's grittier and denser, occasionally a little stolid with historical detail, but still highly engaging. it also reads a bit like a western, with its guns and horsies, its themes of justice and retribution, ruth's relationship with the pequot indians (which, refreshingly, is more transactional than disneyfied), ragtag bands of highwaymen congregating by campfires, and the escalating conflicts arising between the french and native forces against the british-american colonies. unlike a western, there are plenty of high seas adventures and the cold is...intense. ruth's wintry hard times—i felt those descriptions in my bones, friends. all in all, a fantastic debut about perseverance and sacrifice in a tumultuous world, conscientiously researched and vividly realized. more like this, please!!!

Eurydice stares up at him, her eyes swimming with apologies.“It’s fine,” he says, curt and flat. “It’s fine.”this is a chillingly beautiful rework of the orpheus/eurydice myth. in the original, you will recall, orpheus' attempt to rescue his dearly departed bride from the underworld soured when he disobeyed the pretty straightforward instructions to not turn around and look at her until they were well out of hades, and when he did, she was swooshed back down to the land of the dead.this is what happens when you don't look back. it is much, much worse.valente's version unfolds in close third person, following orpheus' POV through his new life with his corpse-bride, her decaying body really putting a strain on their relationship. it's a very modern adaptation—eurydice in a smiths t-shirt drinking lamb's blood microwaved by her rock star spouse, and it features a number of cameo appearances by familiar-but-tweaked characters—sisyphus in a t-shirt that says Rock ’n’ Roll Forever, cerberus as an emotional support dog, prometheus lighting everyone's cigarettes, etc. some of these little easter eggs were great, some a little too on the nose, but i appreciate that she included so many in-jokes for those familiar with the story or those fluent in ancient greek (or fluent in googling ancient greek*) i'm sure i missed a bunch of references—what, pray tell, is the significance of all the vintage star wars glassware? DIGRESSION: when i finished reading this story, i did a little refresher on the original myth, to see if i could catch any more of the references, and i discovered that orpheus' father is, in some versions, king oeagrus of thrace, but in others, it is apollo. which, yes, makes him eurydice's half-brother. i don't know if that matters when the d in the dna stands for 'deity,' and considering how free with the d those olde timey gods were, everyone's sharing some of the same god-genes, but it's an interesting detail new to me. [image]""ewwww, NO, eurydice! you're my sister! sometimes.""END OF DIGRESSIONanyway, if you aren't familiar with the source material, you can read this as a story about a relationship that should have ended a long time ago—after all, marriage is hard enough when both participants are alive and don't need to be scrubbed of persistent mold on a regular basis. true love never dies &yadda, but this is not a love story, and their relationship is more toxic than any of the stuff oozing out of poor eurydice. orpheus is a shitty husband—a golden boy whose music was so powerful that ""the world opened itself up to him like a jewelry box,"" and he's an entitled and selfish man resentful of eurydice's lack of gratitude for bringing her back to the living world.She didn’t even thank him for making her breakfast. He doesn’t want that to annoy him the way it does, but he can’t shake it. She owes him. She owes him so much. his attitude is even more reprehensible when it becomes clear—to everyone but him—that he's holding on, not to who she was before she died, but to the idea of who she was before she died. to him, eurydice is ""adoration in human form,"" and he doesn't care about how she feels, but how she made him feel. the very foundation of their love story is rotten:He was famous. She was beautiful. What else did anyone need? They were young and it was easy. Orpheus saw himself as he knew he could be reflected back at him in that heated, shimmering stare. He wanted it. He wanted that ease forever. He wanted himself as she saw him.Just because he went home with a maenad that night and had to be reminded of her name when they met again a month later doesn’t make it any less love at first sight.Orpheus has repeatedly explained that to their therapist.their new reality takes some getting used to, and although eurydice frequently comes across as passive and pliable, there are sharp moments where her bitterness pokes through.She runs a couple of miles a night, hood drawn up, headphones in. It tenderizes the meat. Orpheus has tried to tell her it isn’t safe for her to be out alone. She laughed in his face.one of the most intriguing things about the story is how little we know about ""this"" eurydice. because this is all told through the might-as-well-be-narcissus perspective of orpheus, we only get tantalizing glimpses of her life in their therapy sessions (bruises on her arm the night they met whose origins are undisclosed-but-hinted-at, her own abandoned musical aspirations he knows nothing about).she doesn't get much of a voice, but she certainly has a presence, and the hair dryer scene'll rip your heart out.she only gets one extended speech, delivered towards the end of this story, but it's a killer. (view spoiler)[“Why didn’t you turn around?” Eurydice whispers.Orpheus tells the truth. “I knew you were there, baby. I never doubted it for a minute.”Children yell and play in the neighbors’ gardens, high-pitched giggles fizzing up into the streetlights. “You didn’t know. You assumed I was there. Behind you. Like I’d always been there. Behind you. You couldn’t even imagine that I might not do as I was told, that I might not be where you wanted me to be, the moment you wanted it. That was my place, and you assumed I would be in it. What in your life has ever gone any way other than as you wished it?” (hide spoiler)]oops, i accidentally wrote a long  for a short story. [image]read it for yourself here:https://www.tor.com/2021/08/25/lespir...* although eurydice's menin aiede qea sweater required an extra step; the phrase—according to some guy on the internet—is a conflation of two different translations of the iliad's opening line: menin aeide thea and MHNIN AIEDE QEA. why all-caps? i don't know; ask that guy on the internet.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,not set,"Aug 28, 2021","Aug 30, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/58772854-l-esprit-de-l-escalier

It starts with the arrival of two mysterious newcomers to the small town of Lockwood, and ends with a tragic death.Someone has already been convicted of this brutal murder and is currently in prison, but we suspect they are innocent. What's more, we believe far darker secrets have yet to be revealed.We believe that the killer has given themselves away. It's there in writing, hidden in the emails, texts, and letters. In the events surrounding the charity appeal for little Poppy Reswick, and the question of whether that money was truly being used to fund her life-saving cancer treatment. Will you accept the challenge? Can you uncover the truth?what a fun shape for a murrrrder mystery: a book where all the clues are given to the reader in the form of ephemera, emails, and texts between its huge cast of characters, along with the notes and exchanges of two law students who have been given the same info-dump and tasked with finding any information that will exonerate the wrongly-accused party—but who have not been given the identity of that individual. the victim, the motive, the accused, the real killer—all of that is for the reader to uncover alongside these intrepid investigators as they wade through SO much correspondence full of gossip, red herrings, secrets, lies, unreliable witnesses, and the everyday bitchery of people who never expected their private communications would be seen by anyone other than the intended recipient. and boy, is it illuminating. spoiler alert: people are hilarious and terrible. it's a juicy and inventive read and it sucks you in immediately. it could perhaps have been shortened a bit to reduce some of the drag of its bloated middle, but that's just a minor quibble for a book that is otherwise so, so much fun. as a final, shallow note, i'm an incorrigible coverlover, and i am SO grateful i was gifted this lovely UK edition, because this: [image]is so much more APPEAL-ing than the cover of the soon-to-be-published US edition:[image]i was drawn to that UK cover before i knew anything about the book, whereas that snoozy US cover looks like so many other books, i would probably have white-noised right over it on the bookstore shelves and never discovered what this little gem has to offer.DON'T SNOOZE!

All kinds of people fill the sidewalks, rushing back and forth to wherever. Young, old, men, women, all ethnicities, in suits and skirts and raggedy jeans and workout clothes. None of them are jokers. It’s actually weird, seeing so many people and not a scale or tentacle in sight.hey, just me again over here ing my weekly tor short a little bit behind schedule. last week was another week sans a new shorty dropping, but now that i can hang with y'all wild cards kids, i have ample oldies from which to choose, like this charmer of a tale.since i had been so mystified years ago reading Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza before i was initiated into the wild cards-verse, i decided to read this one, also penned by carrie vaughn, with my newfound understanding of what this world is all about. and it is a delightful, almost YA-feeling romp of a story, full of the wholesome energy and feel-good vibes that are What We Need Right Now. it's a reasonably self-contained/self-explanatory story, so even if you are completely new to wild cards (or someone like me, with a whopping 4 WC stories under yer figurative belt), you won't be out of your depth here. sure, the specific details might be unfamiliar, but the woes of the adolescent experience are pretty much universal.I’m sixteen, and near as I can figure all my friends and I do is worry. What are we gonna be when we grow up, who’s gonna ask us to prom, how the hell do you fit in when you don’t look like anybody else in the whole world. We’ve got a lot to worry about.the worriers in this case are a group of four joker pals: a gentle fuzzy giant with horns and claws called beastie, splat (née franklin steinberg); who can flatten his body out bonelessly, kris; whose skin is a color-shifting human mood ring, and our narrator miranda; who is built like a whippet with mongoose-like fangs earning her the nickname rikki. and rikki can RUN.they all live in jokertown on the lower east side, whose residents enjoy a lovely sense of community rooted in their shared-but-varied afflictions, and there's a real old timey small-neighborhood vibe to the place, marred only by the occasional gawking tourists.Jokertown gives you some weird ideas of what’s normal, but if you never leave, you never need everybody else’s normal. Normal normal.still, part of growing up is a restless yearning for new experiences beyond the hometown's borders, and rikki's particular joker-trait makes her especially restless—barred from competing in high school track because of her unfair advantage against the nats, she's longing to release some of that pent-up running energy and just ...GO!There’s gotta be something out there for me to do, where I can run and have it be useful and not just some weird joker trick.to that end, the foursome decide to take the subway to central park, and, after braving the stares of commuters, they have a fine day in the sprawling privacy of cultivated nature and rikki does indeed find something useful to do with her gift.i liked this one very much, and i'm glad i was able to right the wrong i'd previously done to carrie vaughn. her relief, is, i am sure, immense.

[image]*************************************how rude am i?[image]i got an ARC of this book back in august 2021, put off reading it until spooktober 2021, and even though i was so excited to be, as this bookmark declares, one of the first readers of this book, and even though the pub date got moved a whole month back, here i sit on delayed-pub-date-eve and i still haven't ed it.i am the worst.the worst thing about being the worst is that i LOVED this book, despite my lack of interest in outer space stuff that doesn't involve murderbot, and now i'm worried i'm not going to write a very good  for it because i waited too long and my brain is tired and i'm terrible at everything these days. this book deserves so much more than me.but you deserve this book—whether or not you're into outer space stuff. it's a mishmash of sci fi, horror, mystery, psychological suspense, and even some romance, which sounds genre-greedy, but manages to work, somehow. it's a whizz-bang adventure story about a beacon-repair crew on the tail-end of their final mission, after which machines will take over the work from humans like some futuristic version of the industrial revolution. team leader claire kovalik, our unreliable narrator with a tragic backstory, is not looking forward to this transition at all, so when the opportunity to prolong the mission presents itself, she digs in despite the protestations of some of the members of her crew. to be fair, it's a pretty exciting opportunity: the discovery of The Aurora; a luxury spacecraft that went missing on its maiden voyage twenty years ago carrying hundreds of passengers—the rich, the famous, and the infamous—whose disappearance became the stuff of legend, speculation, a bermuda-triangle-grade mysteeeeerious phenomenon, and here it is—the chance to make history, solve the mystery, or—for the less noble crew members—fill their pockets with bling.and what harm could there be in boarding a ship that, despite being top of the line in every way, abruptly and inexplicably went dark and has been floating through places unknown full of whatever's left of whatever fate its passengers met, undisturbed and unprovoked for decades? as it turns out, SO MUCH HARM!! SO MANY HARMS!!! A MANYLAYERED HEAP OF HARMS! it's a locked-room mystery set in a haunted house in outer space, and it's intense, wonderful, surprising, disorienting—there are so many different levels of unreliability to this thing and it is an absolute thrill trying to excavate the truth from claire's slippery heap of memories distorted by hallucination, damage, amnesia, lies, self-preservation, and trauma, and even though i waited a long time to sing its praises, i am singing them as loudly as i can to make up for it.'cuz dead silence is the loudest silence of all.[image][image][image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,133,1,"Oct 17, 2021","Oct 20, 2021","Aug 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693184-dead-silence

Except the richer. it must be so boring being rich, i mean being SO rich that the possibilities are literally limitless, where being able to just...have anything you could ever possibly think to want removes all of life's challenges. but if you're rich AND a sociopath, you can make your own challenges, like the challenge of ruining the lives of others. [image]graham herschel and his mother margo are two such sociopaths, taking extreme measures to avoid becoming weighed down by the ennui of their extreme wealth. margo lives with her beloved dog bean in a massive castle-like edifice towering imposingly on the edge of a cliff overlooking the hollywood hills. graham and his wife lyla also live on her sprawling property, in a slightly-more-modest home plopped on top of a subterranean guesthouse that they oh-so-charitably rent out to self-made, new-money tenants. however, these unfortunate tenants will become unwitting participants in the winner-take-all game graham and margo have been perfecting for years. the roots of this game began with margo devising new and exciting ways to crush the spirits of overfamiliar staff for her own amusement, but when graham was old enough, she looped him in and it evolved into a competition between the two, taking turns in an ever-escalating display of power and inventive cruelty. The game is simple, in theory, but in practice it always gets messy. The tenant is the pawn. The landlord is the player. The family is the audience. We observe from a distance, talk it over at private dinners.[image]the game is won by destroying the tenant's reputation, career, relationships, health—whatever they have that can be destroyed, will be destroyed.Everyone is playing a game all the time. It only matters when you're losing.[image]graham's wife lyla has always been a passive spectator to these games, never a participant:I don't want to play. It's different when it's them, when it's something I see at a distance. Something I am aware of, but can easily ignore.however, she inadvertently ruined the last game by getting too close to the tenant; by having the audacity to befriend the prey.[image]The most important rule was no interference—not because anyone was afraid of losing but because rich people can't deal with any conflict they didn't create. In fact, it's almost impossible to ""lose"" the game because the players have all the advantages, and the tenants have no idea they are being played with. It's very much like hunting. You don't walk into the forest and punch a deer in the face. You have a gun, a deer stand and a bloated sense of your own virility.lyla's genuine affection for the last tenant caused her to break this rule, and her interference—warning her friend of the danger she was in—undermined graham’s plans. although the goal was technically achieved and things certainly ended horribly for the tenant, [image]her inevitable destruction occurred outside of the game's parameters, resulting in a hollow, unsatisfying victory. boooo.[image]now, part punishment/part test, graham and margo have decided it's lyla's turn to play, and she's determined to Do a Good Job in order to prove her loyalty and rekindle graham's flagging interest in her through the aphrodisiac of cruelty. but she didn't count on demi golding. after a long slow decline in her life's prospects, demi finds herself homeless and desperate, so when an opportunity to improve her situation presents itself, she has no qualms about grabbing it with both hands—putting the “con” in “economic disparity” by assuming someone else's identity and moving into the curs'ed guesthouse, unaware of what the herschels—what lyla—has planned for her. but if there's one thing she's learned from her hardships, it's how to survive. [image]demi doesn't need to be warned of the danger—her whole life has trained her to expect that someone will try to knock her down. The trouble with living a hard life is that you start to see the world differently. Your mind and your instincts and your outlook are forever altered by negative experiences. You expect bad things to happen. When you're crossing the street, you imagine every car veering to hit you. You plan escape routes in tight alleyways. You think, What would you do if that man—that one, right there—suddenly punched you? Would you hit back? What weapons are at your disposal? What are your emergency exits, safety nets? Oddly, this leaves you less prepared to deal with bad things when they do happen. You have become accustomed to not trusting your instincts. You are so used to telling yourself that it is all in your head that you can't tell when it's not.surrounded by new comforts and the opportunities that are suddenly unfolding before her, demi is braced for discovery; for everything to be taken away from her again, but she’s also prepared to fight to hold onto everything she’s managed to scrabble together. I would rather be in a rich person's hell than a poor person's heaven.And I am so fucking close.[image]the novel alternates between lyla and demi's POVs, where both women are revealed to be complex and flawed and full of secrets. lyla is so profoundly narcissistic that it’s tempting to wanna see her taken down a peg. although she's far more sympathetic than either margo or graham, she's still a nightmare person living in an unpoppable vanity-bubble: I stop to check my reflection in the full-length mirror. Sometimes I am scared by how beautiful I am. Every inch of me is buffed and primed. My face hangs exactly right. My muscles are taut and organized. I am scared because I don't want to lose it: the shaped nails, the tip of my nose, the sapphire glow of my eyes. I am sad because I want everyone to see it, but I don't want to see them. I want them to know how lucky I am but I don't want them to have access to me. It's a real problem. as deliciously vapid as she is, she has a clear-eyed view of what graham is and is not, and there’s more to her than meets the eye.Everything is shallow with Graham: his looks, his thoughts, his actions. And there is something so attractive about that, the lack of depth. No hidden parts. No secret baggage.this is a terrific cat-and-mouse thriller full of venom and deplorable characters,[image]and for the most part it's highly enjoyable froth, but there's a sharp-toothed fineness in how the author handles demi's assimilation into the privileged life and how quickly she begins to take its comforts for granted. ...there is something about having things to lose that makes me afraid in a different way. I used to be numb, accepting everything that came, but now I feel almost more vulnerable.in her life, she has learned that Failure is just like success: It doesn't happen overnight, but here, she has been transformed overnight, and if she hasn't technically achieved success, she has certainly achieved its trappings, discovering the transformative power of wealth; how it consumes, insulates, softens everything; how it makes problems disappear, and how quickly it makes the memories of struggle no matter how intense, fall away. and if her path to stability has been morally questionable, well, she’s not the only one.[image]I want to tell him I am just like him now. Except I earned it. I earned it the same way every rich person does: by stepping over a body.this is a zippy thriller that escalates into an extravagant chaos-party that’ll leave you with plenty of moral ambiguity to chew on by the end. i had a great time with this one, because rooting for terrible people is one of my weaknesses, and i'd apologize, but[image]****************************************i received a free ARC from macmillan in exchange for an honest  &yadda &etc.that  is coming...[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,"Dec 05, 2021","Dec 08, 2021","Aug 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57823811-good-rich-people

[image]compared to the photo in the book, mine seems to have too much stuff in it. i assume their photographer fished a bunch out WITH THEIR HANDS to make it all pretty, which i did not do. however, i DID learn one lesson: let the infuser sit for a bit after removing it from the fridge, or the condensation will INSTANTLY accumulate and make the glass all foggy, hiding yer fruit.[image]i didn't strain it, because then we'd be looking at a glass of slightly pink-tinged water and that's not editorial.i forgot the important detail of reporting on its FLAVOR, so thanks to corrine for reminding me. cutting-and-pasting my lame response from the comments: it was very tasty! the mint made it tingly and the watermelon made it...more watery? anyway, YES—i liked it.i will try to do better from now on. PINK GRAPEFRUIT & ROSEMARY[image]these are supposed to infuse for 2 or more hours and i have been leaving them overnight but maybe that is wrong? this one tastes strongly of grapefruit peel, which i suppose is because it's got the zest of a whole damn grapefruit in it, and i even went to the trouble of unwaxing the grapefruit peel, per the book's instructions. [image]it's pretty bitter, and i'm not getting much in the way of rosemary, but once my mouth got over the initial impact of bitter, there followed a nicer, lighter grapefruit flavor, but the rosemary never really took a bow. book didn't say to bruise the herb, the way you do with mint, but maybe that's something i will try going forward. fun fact: this looks like a seahorse gave birth in it[image][image][image]à votre santé!APPLE & MINThow you like these apples? [image]book says: Crisp apples are best for this infusion. Try Granny Smith for a tart, refreshing drink or Gala if you have more of a sweet tooth.going against my sweet tooth nature (which, frankly, has never been satisfied by an APPLE), i chose the granny smith route. the resulting water was faintly appley, but the mint was the stronger of the two flavors.[image]my apples are probably too thick—they used some kind of alien laser technology or a mandoline to produce wafer-thin apple rounds delicately floating alongside fluffy sprigs of mint[image]and i have some wet apples and beached-seaweed clumps. whatever—i'm super-hydrated so i'm gonna live forever, eating these waterlogged apples keeping all you doctors at bay. BOOM!PINEAPPLE & CUCUMBER[image]so far, this one is both the tastiest AND the prettiest[image]my pineapple was perfectly ripe, my cucumber was perfectly seedless and it's like 2020 never happened.i had the alcoholic version of this infusion at a place this evening, called THE SKINNY DIPPER, which was cucumber infused tequila, fresh pineapple, and fresh cucumber, and now my two august  projects have merged:[image]THREE CITRUS[image]the three citruses were supposed to be pink grapefruit, orange, and lemon, but i swapped out the oranges for some minneola tangelos because they were so plump and perfect (like meeee).[image]this is the only one so far that actually incorporates some of the juice of the fruits along with their drowned bodies, so the flavor was much more intense and deliciously refreshing. however, i only got to drink the glass pictured here because there was a tragedy. shortly after this picture was taken, i would gently CLONK into the infuser with a glass carafe of iced coffee in order to make room for my lemon posset, shattering the infuser and causing a three citrus flood in my fridge and on the floor. this was only a few hours after i had knocked an open container of coffee grounds onto the floor in the process of making that iced coffee. so, a red letter day for karen t. brissette. however—silver lining—i have finally answered the age-old question of which is stronger: a dollar store carafe or a significantly more expensive infuser. silver lining #2: my fridge and floor are now very clean and summery-smelling.long story short—i have ordered a new infuser.FENNEL & CLEMENTINEwelcome to my home, new infuser! watch your back; the carafes here are dicks...[image]like its ill-fated predecessor, this infusion also calls for the juice of one clementine to be blended in with the water.[image]however, it wasn't enough juice to make the water pretty, so i tossed some fennel fronds into the glass to make the photo more dramatic. naturally, i forgot to wash these fronds, so i got to drink a nice glass of orangey licorice water with dirty trees in it. i'm already feeling the health benefits.BASIL, PEAR & BLACK PEPPER[image]it's hard to tell here, but i used THREE different kinds of pears, including a red one, to make this infusion more VISUALLY DYNAMIC or whatever. the infusion, once stripped of its parts, is decidedly less visually dynamic.[image]however, after the first glass has been consumed, you get to the richer part of the infusion; where all the mulchy bits have been soaking up the freshly-smithereened peppercorns, intensifying the flavor of the water, and it's phenomenal.[image][image]it's thick and peppery-peary with only a hint of basil, but it feels restorative and fresh. because i took a little break from project-ing, i'm going to keep this one open for a bit longer and try some other summery flavors and THEN once the temperature drops, i will do some of the hot infusions! hot! infusions!LEMON, BLUEBERRY & LAVENDER[image]so i guess lavender...floats? being neither a sheep nor a grandmother, this was news to me.i poured the liquid through the strainer part of the lid rather than using the wide-pour option, but some lavender bibbits still snuck through. you guys, i had to drink them! they were in my MOUTH! and i am not, if you will recall, a freaking sheep![image]ombudsman-karen has googled this because quality control standards must be maintained and it turns out that sheep don't actually eat lavender. in fact, most animals (mammals, anyway) will avoid lavender. because it's gross. rabbits, deer, even raccoons, who eat everydamnthing, are repelled by lavender because it smells so blucky. also listed amongst the lavender-haters are cats and mice, snakes and FLEAS! even fleas have the good sense to stay away. you know who IS attracted to lavender? freaking BIRDS! hummingbirds, american goldfinches, tufted titmice, parrots aaaand starlings. do you know about starlings? they are one of the most destructive invasive species of all time, and they have plagued america ever since some shakespeare fanboy decided to fling a bunch of them out into central park and from there they basically took over the country, spreading their wing'ed menace from coast to coast. so if you are a murrican full of hatred towards foreigners coming here and ruining everything, please redirect your asshole energy towards these monsters and rid us of these pests. just don't use lavender to do it 'cuz IT WON'T WORK!also a fan of lavender is the spittlebug. [image] spittlebugs, people. i am drinking something a SPITTLEBUG enjoys. so, why, you ask, did i choose to make this one? because once upon a time, i bought a sack of lavender to make PEEPS® Lavender Panna Cotta with Blackberry Sauce, [image]and it's been languishing in my cupboard ever since. does lavender go bad? trick question—it is always bad. just ask nature! anyway, the blueberry/lemon parts of this infusion were tasty, but i am not a fan of eating flowers. TIL that sometimes blueberries float, too! does this mean they are rotten, like eggs? or does lavender also attract pennywise? [image]it's not creepy at all to be stared at by a beverage. [image]WATERMELON & CORIANDER[image]i was supposed to stuff a quarter of a watermelon, rind and all, into this, but that wasn't gonna happen in my tiny pitcher, so i chonked it instead, and it was perfectly fine and fresh-tasting, with a nice bright pop from the cilantro <--- which is what we murricans call it. [image]this one's pretty enough to warrant its own solo head shot[image]the ingredient not name-dropped in the name of the beverage is orange zest, so i once again wound up with a mouthful of fry* and i'm getting used to this strange sensation. *which is what baby seahorses are called, inexplicably.POMEGRANATE & GINGER[image]if anyone's wondering which fruit is the biggest asshole, it's the pomegranate, no question. it's such a hassle extracting the whole point of a pomegranate from the termite-nest of its innards, and it's an expensive roll of the dice to even get a good one. i got two decent ones, but it was way more work than it was worth, and after mashing those little buggers up, i only got a meager amount of pale juice, so visually, this infusion's a total snooze[image]the pomegranate is just a whisper here, and maybe that's down to my not knowing how to pick a good pomegranate from the 'granate bin, but the ginger is nice enough, although even that is milder than i had expected. maybe i have covid and am losing my sense of taste. if, so, i apologize to the fruits and roots who died in vain for this infusion.NUTMEG & GINGER[image]this is my first HOT infusion! and although my infuser is suitable for hot OR cold infusions, i decided to use my cute little teapot instead, forgetting that it wouldn't do the best job of showing off the infusion itself. still, FOXEN![image]considering that this particular infusion strongly resembles metamucil, i think i made the right choice. it's much better as a hot drink than one you remember is sitting on your desk, gritty with nutmeg, some room-temperature-making amount of time later, although it is not bad refrigerator-cold. so, avoid the middle bed, goldilocks, and you'll be just fine.MIXED BERRY & CINNAMON[image]another cold one while the berries are still good and not too expensive (although these blueberries were a small fortune). still, one does as one must, and they were exceptionally tasty berries.[image]in the first glass of this, after infusing overnight, the cinnamon was more of an aroma than a taste, but it intensified the longer it sat so by the second evening, it packed more of a spicy punch. however, by then, the berries themselves looked kind of blucky and bleached of their colors. if there's a sweet spot in there, i missed it, but it was tasty regardless.STAR ANISE & BLACK PEPPERthis is another hot infusion, and it only calls for a cup of boiling water, so the finished product is pretty dull.[image]and, BOY, is it brown.[image]although it's a pretty fall-shade of brown, with lots of nice earthy stuff floating in it.[image]and when you swirl it all up and look at its fromunda, it's got a nice kaleidoscopic effect going on.[image][image][image][image]i'm gonna close this out FOR NOW, because this was an august project that went on and on and i'm sick of looking at it on my 'currently-reading' shelf. however, i'll probably add more to it periodically, so don't worry about my hydration! see you soon!

You moved on. There was nothing else to do.a lovely atmospheric story i'm not sure i fully understood or appreciated. i loved the writing, but the story itself seems a little off-brand for tor—it doesn't have much in the way of a SFF vibe; that ending could be divine/supernatural, or it could be geological anomaly, who's to say? in any case, for the bulk of the novelette, it's strictly realism—a dust bowl migration story that reads like steinbeck when it's optimistic, and mccarthy when it's not. it's in no hurry to get anywhere, which is maybe why it feels like it doesn't go anywhere—it's well-written and the prose is evocative, but when you strip the story of its pretty wrapping paper, it's about (view spoiler)[a boy who abandons his father—who literally needs him to survive—and then becomes a parasite to a struggling family before stealing their child's most treasured possession (hide spoiler)]. he's not written as an antihero, but it's hard to root for him, bullet-pointed out like that. i honestly think it would have been a stronger story if he'd just cut out the angel stuff altogether, because what's there is so brief and ambiguous—it could just be extreme thermal drafts or something (i'm not a meteorologist—those are things, right?)anyway, the descriptions-of-place-are excellent and hardship-narratives are all my kind of thing, but the ending fell flat for me and it doesn't feel complete, so if there's more to this journey somewhere, lemme know and i'll read it and reassess.

I felt safest in my office, alone with my books, charts, runic symbols, and scraps of old text; and when I deciphered a chunk of language—even a word!—a thrill of understanding juddered up my spine. The distance between me and another human being, just for that moment, was erased. It was as if someone were speaking to me, and me alone.those who cannot travel, teach, and val's sent many students off on the scholarly linguistical indiana jones adventures she wishes she could pursue. she is finally coaxed out of her academia-swaddled comfort zone by wyatt speeks. the ornery climate researcher is requesting her expertise on a hush-hush project: a young girl's body was discovered frozen in a glacier off the coast of greenland, hundreds of miles from any known indigenous population. miraculously, she has been thawed out alive, but she is speaking a language no one can decipher. the offer's secondary lure is that wyatt is the last person to have seen val's beloved twin brother andy alive before his inexplicable suicide five months earlier, and val's nonagenarian father—crankily installed in a nursing home with lung cancer, diabetes, and a grudge against andy's mentor wyatt—encourages her to buck up and go off to one of the world's most remote locations to find out what really happened to his favorite twin. it's set in nuunyviak—an uninhabited island off the northwest coast of greenland—where val, wyatt, and the girl named sigrid wedge themselves into tiny buildings made insignificant against the massive nothingness of nature along with the mechanic/cook jeanne, and the married polar marine scientists nora and raj chandra-revard (who offset everyone else's gloomy loneliness with their chirp chirpy-love). val makes some progress in communicating with the girl, but the endeavor goes from ""interesting academic pursuit"" to ""matter of great urgency"" when sigrid starts getting sick and val can't figure out what sigrid is so desperately trying to get across in order to save her. it's atmospherically superb—as claustrophobic inside the research facility as it is outside, although it's too slow-paced to be the thriller it claims to be. there's a pretty significant action sequence chonk at the end—so cold and harrowing, however, the story has a softer, more emotional texture than a typical thriller; containing themes of grief and healing, of forming a connection to the earth and to other people, of love, nature and vulnerability, and a leetle touch of magic. there's also a lot of lovely, lovely language stuffThe word in Inuktitut for climate change translates to ""a friend acting strangely""—what a personal and beautiful way of describing a relationship to the natural world.but also a reminder about how bewilderingly complex language can be, flashing my dusty brain back to my ONE undergrad linguistics class: I'd forgotten the complexity of West Greenlandic, which is a polysynthetic language, meaning the words are composed of multiple elements called morphemes, word parts that often created ""sentence-words""—the longest of which is over 200 letters long. Nouns were inflected for one of eight cases and for possession. Eight moods as well as the number and gender of both the sentence's subject and object inflected every verb. Countless subdialects sprang like weeds. On top of this, most things had two names, the common one and the word used for outsiders—white people, called Qallunaat—to confuse them.i mean, it's a wonder any of us can communicate with anyone anywhere anytime but it does make me feel better about writing such an inarticulate . the takeaway here is that i need to be sent off to the arctic circle in a tiny little hut so everyone will leave me alone and i can just get things done.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,87,1,"Feb 07, 2022","Feb 09, 2022","Aug 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56898156-girl-in-ice

Most victims, however, are trapped between blue, narrowing walls of ice, and as their body warmth melts the ice, they sink slowly deeper and deeper, until they die very consciously of asphyxiation.and now i have two new fears.Echo is about a man named sam whose experienced-mountaineer boyfriend nick sets out with his even-more experienced companion augustin on an alps-scaling jaunt and comes back alone—physically, psychologically, and biologically changed. nick's former golden-boy beauty has been ravaged; the lower half of his face swathed in a mummy's worth of bandages holding what's left of his face in, but his personality, his aura has also been altered—he's brought back unspeakable horrors from the aptly-named Maudit; a stuff-of-legend tardis of a mountain where ancient forces scoff at human stuff like scale and logic and geometry, and are now clinging to him like psyche-rooted parasites, affecting everyone who comes into contact with him and unleashing The Morose on the valley below, along with—as i have mentioned—so many birds. although at first sam is repulsed by nick's spooky new characteristics, love conquers all, and he finds that new-nick is not without a certain dark intoxicating quality—the allure of vertigo that the french call l’appel du vide (the call of the void), the yawning-abyss dizziness kierkegaard described as ""the dizziness of freedom,"" the same that inspired an italian songwriter to declare: la vertigine non é paura di cadere, ma voglia di volare (vertigo isn’t the fear of falling, it’s the desire to fly).none of those references are specifically in the text, although this book is absolutely a polyglot's delight, riddled with often-untranslated bibbits of evocative phrasings that forced me to dust off my slumbering frenchiness. the shape is a multi-POV, time-slippy narrative, mostly linear but pockmarked with holes, where the structure contributes to the reader's discomfort—you kind of always feel like you're walking in mid-conversation, the missing plot-points feel like missing time after a seizure or fainting spell and it's all wonderfully eerie and uncomfortable. it's a surreal and suggestive kind of book, and although i'm not usually a fan of this kind of incomprehensible, unfathomable, joseph-and-the-coat-of-many-cosmic-horror-descriptors style of horror, i was surprised and thrilled to find myself completely creeped out several times, which is a rare occurrence for me. that whole opening bit with the blink-encroaching wraiths:The people in the stairwell are still there.They're closer now.as well as the thing that happens to the boy on the operating table and the smile nick draws on his bandages:He turned to look at me, and, man, chills up and down my spine. On the bandage strips, where his mouth shoulda been, he'd Sharpied a smiley mouth. A black, half-moon curve, crossed at the edges for round Cupid cheeks. Coulda been innocuous, but wasn't. Cuz his head was moving and the smiley wasn't, giving his face the grisliness of a puppet come to life.But the top half was real, and that was Nick. He made a muffled sound, looked happy to see me.He typed on his iPad:Smile!This way you'll always know it's me and never mistake me for someone else. When I smile, you don't have to be scared of me, okay?I couldn't tell if he was joking or not. I smiled to be on the safe side and said, ""I'm not scared of you.""But I was.his fear is entirely justified, as was mine soon afterwards:When I looked up, I saw him slowly swing his right arm and put his hand on his Sharpied smiley mouth.yeesh. and the cold, i mean THE COLD, it's a monster all on its own:I hadn't even gotten halfway to the village before I wish I'd stayed home. The valley was on the verge of a panic attack. The mountains seemed to have been disjointed. The sky rocked. The cold unhinged. There are November mornings when the cold is clear, crackling, and crisp, but this cold was sticky, syrupy, clung to you. Like it was begging you for help. You, the first organism to have crossed its path, and would you please take it with you and protect it from what's about to happen, because that was much, much worse than the cold itself.Jesus. The Morose hadn't even got started yet and my metaphors were already going haywire.the day i finished this book, winter finally dumped a bunch of snow on us, and since i can now participate in the instagram-experience even though i still stubbornly refuse to own a pocket-phone, i foolishly decided to photograph this book out in the blizzard i had to brave on my way to work. i posed it here and there, trying to find the perfect alps-looking background, whilst being buffeted by the wind, waist-deep in a snowdrift, and by the time i had taken way too many very average shots, my fingers were completely numb and i had to stop off at connor's so he could wrap my hands in a hairdryer-warmed scarf until i could feel them again and i have never felt such pain as the thawing of my fingies. needless to say, i was late to work, but once i was finally on the subway, i came across this passage and it made me laugh ever-so-ruefully:I stick my frozen hands under my Gore-Tex coat and in my armpits. The burning pain that takes over my fingers as the blood flows back into them pushes all my thoughts out of my head and I have to scream.all of that, and this is what i got:[image]oh, well. i did my best.anyway, this book is spooky and i liked it very much. that is my . i did my best. ********************************i am very grateful to tor/nightfire for sending me this ARC, and for caring about my safety enough to also send along a handy first-aid kit to protect me from life's quotidian scrapes, even though it would in no way protect me from the dangers of LE MAUDIT.[image][image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,"Jan 16, 2022","Jan 31, 2022","Aug 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53329253-echo

He pruned them one by one, scraping the blade along the clustered stalks. They popped free and dropped into the steel waste bin with a spongy little ping that made his teeth itch.

Vanishing was the province of lonely parks, factory streetsHow was it possible to vanish into thin air on a street where everyone knew your business? Vanishing was the province of lonely parks, factory streets, and rooftops. Vanishing happened to the white sorority girls over at St. John's that partied too damn much. On Amity Lane, good people were always claimed, never discarded like garbage or old clothes.this novel takes the basic details of the ariel castro kidnappings and transplants the crime from cleveland to queens (tyvm, i say, reading this here in my own queens neighborhood—which is name-dropped in the book, although it is not the scene of the crime), in which three young girls: gwin, fern and jesenia, are kidnapped and held captive for a decade by someone they refer to as ""boss man.""it is a fast book, but i would not say it's an easy read. the chapters are very short; many of them less than a page, and it switches POV on a dime, jumps around in time, eschews quotation marks altogether, and ranges stylistically from traditional narrative structure (exposition/dialogue/yadda), to interviews, articles, stream-of-consciousness/out-of-body sequences, dreams, sentence fragments, lists, poems, incantations, photographs, etc etc. i'm a fan of innovative structural choices, but i found this one to be convoluted and unfocused and extremely confusing. i admire ferrell's confidence in bursting onto the literary stage with such an unusual debut, but it was incredibly difficult to follow. i'm not sure of the structure was meant to distance the reader from the horror of the scenario—an emotional cushion to keep the reader somewhat removed from the story of girls being raped and abused, but while the subject matter is brutal, the writing about it is only occasionally graphic, more often recounted in a tone reflecting the dazed vagueness of one of the victims: We asked these things in our minds until Boss Man woke up, did his thing to our innards and outtards, left the house in darkness.or its reverse, buried in figurative and deflecting language:What is a non-born? Let me count the ways.Each time one set in me—like that old junket pudding Bud used to make when we ran out of food—Boss Man’d get mad and kick me down some serious basement stairs. Or else throw me on the rope. Squeeze my neck in such a love-hold that the tissue-issue came trickling out the other end like a stream. i've explained before that i have an inability to emotionally engage with books or movies and i got zero triggers, so it might be down to that, but i've read so much worse in terms of graphic content, and half the time here i didn't even know what was going on, so that probably didn't help with my engagement.more than being shocked or unsettled, this book left me feeling bewildered, and i've been delaying this  for so long, not knowing where to even start, so i did something i never rarely do before writing a , and sought out other s, to see how folks were responding to this book. interestingly enough, the critical response of the pros has been laudatory, while goodreaders have been less enthusiastic.i read several of these positive s to get a sense of what they were getting out of it that i wasn't and came upon one in the san diego union-tribune featuring an interview with the author who was quoted re: her style choices—“The linear narrative did not encompass the fullness of the girls’ story. It was a story of the family, of the community, the people who let the girls down...For me, it was like a mosaic almost—you have these shattered pieces and how are the girls putting it together and how is the outside world putting it together. So fragmentation really became the narrative strategy for me and playing around with time.”so i understand and appreciate what she was aiming for, and i think the ""outside"" perspective was necessary—it's unlikely any of us can truly relate to the experiences of the kidnapped girls, and it's even more chilling to identify with miss metropolitan—passing a house of horrors every day and suspecting nothing, even attempting to befriend boss man, with no idea of what her neighbor truly is. but for me—a regular-reader-person who only occasionally s books for $$—the execution fell a bit short. i didn't hate it; in fact, when it stayed still long enough for me to sink into the prose, there was some really strong writing, even in the gauzy, dreamlike parts. the fairytale elements that crept in, as the girls escaped the horror of their reality in fantasy and imagination, were also effective, although for me, the very underread Gretel and the Dark is a better example of this conceitfrom the same article: Ferrell doesn’t hold back when it comes to the grotesque details of the assaults, but maintains that this isn’t for shock value, but rather to “help define the girls.”“I thought about that a lot,” says Ferrell, when asked about how she found that balance between realism and graphicness. “In fact, there are some sections that I had to take out. I didn’t want the reader to focus on the scariness; I wanted them to think about the story. I think things can be a lot more scary when you withhold things.”again, the 'grotesque details"" didn't really register with me, so i think she withheld too much, and although i'm not at all a fan of the torture-porn variety of horror, i think a somewhat more detailed and straightforward chronicle would have been more effective—between the micro-chapters and the jarring scene-changes, it was hard to stay invested in the story, or even identify the story.still, a very brave debut that plenty of people responded to more meaningfully than i did.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET’S FIND OUT!having enjoyed phoebe robinson's stand-up and sketch comedy, i picked up this book in the middle of a bleak-week, hoping to be wrenched out of my mood with laffs. but it's not that kind of book. it's less a humor-humor book than a book of essays written by a humorous person—the subject matter is often serious and important, but she softens the blow(s) with her comedic sensibilities. written during the quarantimes, many of the essays address the concerns that had us all glued to our newsfeeds throughout that whole experience, nursing our collective anxieties with increasingly horrific stories about the pandemic, BLM marches, escalating violence, and police brutality. we were all put through an emotional wringer by the events of 2020 (and its ongoing repercussions). some people used that time for introspection and clarity, and some used it to marathon The Great British Baking Show and Grey's Anatomy. twice. each.phoebe robinson falls into the first category, and even though everything's still fragile and uncertain, she is Doing Her Part to help us all heal just a little bit.The best I can offer at this moment is that I am a funny person and if I can make you laugh and forget your problems for a moment then I did something. Although I'm not on the front lines, I'm still living in this, too, and it's probable that my way of looking at life could be of use to someone who just needs to laugh. I crave levity because I don't want the time inside to rewire my brain or convince me to lose all sense of optimism. Because in the face of it looking like we're all fucked, giving up would be letting down those in my family and friends who haven't. So I won't give up today. And I'll try not to tomorrow.  to that end, although she doesn't shy away from examining any of 2020's Big Bads, she also shares her reflections and insights about topics as varied as pooping in quarantine,* the importance of wearing matching underwear, and the social media trend of celebrities posting culinary videos during lockdown, proving that US magazine got it wrong—stars are clearly NOT just like us, because they're prepping weeknight-prawns while we're over here scrabbling for toilet paper. the essays are voicey and entertaining as hell, even though i frequently had no frame of reference for their subject matter: tips for running a business, traveling the world, the challenges of 4C hair, being pressured to start a family or get a dog, etc etc. the venn diagrams of our respective experiences rarely overlaps, but it doesn't matter because she's an engaging writer with a strong personality so i could appreciate it without relating to it.as an aside: i'm not an audiobook person, but i think i would have enjoyed listening to this one, because the cadence of her writing is very conversational, and her fondness for hashtags, phonetic spelling, and truncating words (nash anth), might be less distracting in an audio format. #I'mSoOldin any medium, she's an impressive powerhouse of a human being. she started a production company called tiny reparations, which now includes a publishing branch—tiny reparations books—and this book marks the imprint's debut. not even a pandemic can stop this businesswoman handling her business, and it's all kinds of aspirational and intimidating: she's got her shit together and is doing everything with her time, building an empire while i'm sitting over here writing silly book reports that no one's gonna read instead of figuring out a way to make some money. #PhoebeRobinsonPleaseMentorMe. i want to call out two particular, and wildly dissimilar, essays.first, the titular essay: Please Don't Sit on My Bed in Your Outside Clothes.so let's talk outside clothes. while the concept of ""outside clothes"" is not unfamiliar to me, i thought it was one of those antiquated notions from a bygone era, but nope! phoebe robinson, about a decade younger than myself, is a staunch proponent of outside clothes, so much so that she asserts:We need to start redlining heaux and if you don't have outside clothes, around-the-house clothes, and in-bed clothes: YOU. CAN'T. VOTE.i live in the same new york as she does, but even though my brain knows (and has become more paranoid about during this whole pandemic thing) that subways are germy and the outside world is dirty, it has never once occurred to me to put on a whole 'nother outfit just to go to the store. some of the material for this essay is drawn from social-media conversations between the author and folks who are, apparently, as disgusting/careless as me:So wait...say I get up in the morning and decide I want to pop out and get a coffee. I'm supposed to change into full ""outside clothes"" to go across the street for my coffee and then back into my pajamas when I get home? And then later when I need to run to the store or take out the garbage, I'm supposed to change into new outside clothes and then back into my pajamas when I come inside again? WHAT KIND OF MADNESS IS THIS??? I get up in the morning and get dressed for the day, no matter how many times I go outside during the day. My pajamas only go on when it's time to eat.Oh, boy. This. Is. Rough. And no, we're not ""hanging tough."" #MomJoke #NewKidsOnTheBlockForever. For real though, I'm at a loss for words. If you're going outside multiple times a day, just have an ""outside clothes"" outfit by your front door that you change in and out of and then put it in the laundry bin at the end of the night. Why are we acting like that's not an option? Why are we behaving as though changing in and out of PJs is akin to doing high school trig?although this essay made me feel chastised (don't take away my vote please!), the thought of switching between public-facing and private clothing multiple times a day seems exhausting.**even though i am always on my best behavior and mindful of other people's house rules, in my own life i guess i'm just a sloppy person. i have never, for example, in all my years of having boobs, washed a bra. not once. but i do take my shoes off before walking around my apartment—i'm not an animal. shoes touch places where animals (and people) pee, but how is my hoodie getting contaminated on my two-block journey to key food? i thought that outside clothes was a generational thing, she claims it's a cultural thing that white people don't get (an informal poll of my social circle suggests that we're both correct—black grannies are ON BOARD with this), but even though that's never gonna be my life, i adore her passionate stance on this matter. We Don't Need Another White Saviorthis was my favorite essay (and, yes, i DID initially read that title to the tune of We Don't Need Another Hero, which she declares makes me ""[her] kind of person,"" so maybe i can has my vote back now? if she's willing to overlook my unwashed bras, i'm willing to overlook how she uses my name as a pejorative several times in this book).on that note, i'm a white girl named karen, so obviously i'm the last person who should be weighing in about racial matters on the internet, but this chapter, which is about virtue signaling and performative allyship, is worth a thousand empty gestures inspired by White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism, so i'm just gonna hand her the reins:Reading, highlighting, and posting prompts on social media for robust discussions in the comments section can be fun and get the adrenaline pumping, but ultimately wind up being nothing more than empty exercises the majority of the time. I can think of two main reasons why. One, many performative allies operate as though racism is this abstract, philosophical debate that doesn't have stakes in their world. The corporations need to step up. The executives need to do better. These celebrities should be canceled for [insert racially insensitive comment]. This white person is so unbelievably racist in a viral cellphone video. These books are teaching me about past racism and discussing hypotheticals. The racism is always somewhere other than where anyone is. Like what is racism? Fucking Nickelback CD's? The band has sold more than 50 MILLION ALBUMS, but nobody owns a copy? LOL. Okay. Similarly, there is no audacity to perform racism in any and all of its ugly forms without a system, meaning people to support it. So somebody's out here ""racisting,"" but if folks can't even acknowledge the ways in which they intentionally and unintentionally hold up systems of oppressions, how can they change their behavior? Simply put, they can't. So what ends up happening is the cycle of white guilt, which leads to the task of self-improvement then goes back to white guilt because change isn't happening fast enough or at all. And as we all know, guilt is never a good motivator to rectify behavior, but a license to wallow in the pity, which leads to more guilt about their participation in systemic racism, which is now combined with them feeling bad about the fact that they feel bad. Basically, white guilt is a Cathy comic, y'all. Like that bitch always has a sob story. Constantly caught up in the drama without realizing she's a key architect of the spectacle that is her life. Always getting fired and acting like she doesn't know why. It's like, ""Cath, Jamba Juice let you go because you were making smoothies to bring home to your cats."" (her footnote: That is a real plot from the comics. Normally, I choose a side, but I'm Switzerland this time because cats need a balanced diet.) #ThisConcludesMyAntiRacismSeminar #CanIGetPaid40K?The other reason why most of performative allyship is ineffective is that folks move in extremes and go from zero to one hundred as an antiracist. One day, they were unaware how pervasive racism is and the next, they're flooding their social media with information, showing up at marches and protests, screaming about supporting Black businesses. WHERE DID ALL THESE WHITE PEOPLE COME FROM?! I'm serious. You ever throw what you thought was going to be an intimate get-together and it turns into a full-fledged house party and a bitch who was not invited, but showed up with napkins and red Solo cups, now acts like they call the shots and pay your property taxes? That's how this aggressiveness in being antiracist comes across sometimes. And while I'm sure a decent amount of it is well-intentioned, intent doesn't matter when it's causing more harm, and from what I can see, as the number of non-POC participants in antiracism increase so does the ""May I speak to your manager?"" energy. The revolution cannot and should not be Karenized.*** That vibe wants fast results, placation, and constant positive reinforcement, and recontextualizes easy wins as major victories, so that when the wins don't quickly happen or happen at all for the weightier and messier issues, disappointment and frustration settle in, threatening to dissuade future efforts. To me, lacking patience and expecting results immediately for both the micro and macro issues that plague America shows a complete lack of understanding of how pervasive and fundamental racism is to the foundation of our society. Truth be told, systemic racism will most likely not be dismantled in our lifetime. While I would like things to change so that all my Black brothers and sisters and I can live in a better world, I know that's not the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is that those who come after me will not have to experience even a tenth of what I have. Achieving that goal requires a level of acceptance in the face of glacial progress and that is, in part, what prevents burnout and allows one to stay the course. Too often what we're seeing is people blowing off steam at the first sign of adversity and then not rolling up their sleeves and jumping back into the fray. And that combination of impatience and losing interest because massive change has not happened since they decided to get active when there have been people on the front lines for years and decades doing the exhaustive work to dismantle racism is the opposite of staying the course. It's participating in a trend, in a moment. This is not a trend. I repeat: This is not a trend. We have to undo every single institution—both big and small—in our country. And if the expectation is permanent change, then we must understand that the system cannot change unless the people in it, particularly the ones who benefit from it in myriad tangible and intangible ways, change as well.this whole essay is GOLD. long may her empire flourish.so, it's maybe not a book that's going to help you forget the current challenges, but you get wisdom and laughter, so it's well worth the read.**************************** best opening to an essay...ever?I'm not saying you should shit yourself in front of your significant other (IS THIS THE MOMENT WHERE I RUIN ANY CHANCE OF BEING AN OPRAH BOOK CLUB SELECTION? I. FUCKING. THINK. SO.), but I believe that unless you do mortifying things, accidentally or not, that make your partner pull a Walter White and get a burner phone so they can create a Raya dating profile to search for fresh peen or vajeen, then, frankly, you aren't in a relationship.** although, to be fair, much of her type a/git-er-done life sounds exhausting to me*** hhmph.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,1,100,1,"Sep 16, 2021","Sep 19, 2021","Jul 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57169049-please-don-t-sit-on-my-bed-in-your-outside-clothes

I don't think I ever realized until now how uptight we city women are—or were—how we constantly, incessantly protect ourselves by keeping our heads bent down at our phones or by examining an imagined hangnail, our subconsciouses expecting danger lurking around every corner. We make ourselves look older and uglier than we are, as if youth and beauty were attributes to be hidden away from the world. These women don't have any of these tics, because what these women don't have is fear. And being fearless, they must possess a sense of freedom most of us have never known. cut off from the rest of the world, they have been thriving on their own for years, so this little societal collapse is just another day in the life for them. however, femlandia is not so much a feminist utopia as it is a misandrist cult, and miranda starts uncovering some of the grubby little secrets at the heart of her mother's creation (like how these women are still getting pregnant, and having babies and how all of these babies are female), while her daughter emma embraces the community's highly problematic philosophy with full teenage fervor. but, like a teenager's devotion, this book is all surface with very little depth or substance. it’s a little loose at its joints—it feels like dalcher wanted to write about A and B and C, and she focused on writing the loud shocking parts without spending any time developing the quiet connective tissue that would make this whole situation feel...considered.the trans issue is a pretty good example. the femlandia leadership has a very staunch policy when it comes to transfolk—if you have, or have ever had, a penis attached to your body, you are unwelcome:""They can identify as a fucking hedgehog for all I care. I'm talking about what they are. Not what they think they are or what they want to be. It's a slippery slope. You let one in, you have to let in all. There is a reason your mother called this place Femlandia. Get used to it.""part of the femlandia vetting process involves a physical examination, with an explanation:""I need to satisfy myself that you were always a woman."" which, hey—your compound, your rules, but since there is no mention of trans men or nonbinary/genderqueer people anywhere in the book, it feels like dalcher just didn't want to have to bother with the complexities of gender identity, and dispensed with the matter, shutting it down in one short paragraph. and that gruff dismissal of an entire segment of the population is indicative of how this book deals with any kind of nuance—it doesn't. it ignores the complex and favors the reductive—a colorblocked philosophy without any shading.my problems with this book aren't ideological—i don't read books to see my beliefs mirrored, nor do i read books to have my beliefs challenged. i'm willing to roll along wherever the author chooses to have their characters take me, but at the end of it all, i want there to have been a purpose for the journey—not necessarily a lesson or a stance, but give me something to digest at the end of it; even something as writing 101 as setting or character growth or conflict resolution. my issues with this book are storytelling issues.as far as the community is concerned, we get very few details about the logistics or political structure or How It All Works. we see some of the punishments for disobedience—in fact, miranda's month-long solitary confinement means we don't get a lot of first-impression insights or any perspective about how this colony functions—she immediately (on day five, after being in a medically-induced coma for three days) becomes peripheral to the action; locked in a room reading books while emma is being turned against her and radicalized—with no clarity about how her daughter came to be so quickly indoctrinated into this ""all men are terrible"" weltanschauung. miranda is a wildly inconsistent character and very slow on the uptake. come on, miranda, you work in a zoo and you don't know what coyotes sound like? (and the reveal of that particular plot point was obvious from the first mention, but it was dragged out so long, like dalcher thought we were brand-new and wouldn't immediately clock what was going on there.)it's such a contrast to Matrix, which squeezes the theme of a female-centric cooperative of every last narrative drop. and obviously that's a different situation, a different mission statement, a different writer, but it's a very good example of a story written by someone who is willing to Do the Work—to think beyond the barebones ""i have an idea!"" stage and actually flesh it out with meat for a reader to chew on. Matrix took the idea of a gated community of women and showed all the angles—the good, the bad, all of the unconsidered subtleties. by comparison, this is so shallow and brief. i'm not sure what point she was trying to make. ladies can be shitty, too? what's the story? why is this book? i liked the beginning of this very much—the tipping-point momentum of society breaking down, the shortages, the danger, the situational morality, miranda's friends, having resented her cushy life, turning their backs on her, along with every religious or social institution she approaches for help.You want to know how people end up homeless, how anyone could turn away or shut a door or hang up a phone? Just start asking for help.but it doesn't give anything to the reader, other than a hollow misanthropic clang. men are shitty. women are shitty. people are shitty. we know. we've been here.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,110,1,"Sep 11, 2021","Sep 13, 2021","Jul 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56584677-femlandia

""When everything was sold, and all we had left was a cottage so far away that nobody wanted it...I stopped feeling miserable. It was like I'd come out the other side. I remember this kind of crazy exhilaration as we left the city.""""Because we were finally leaving?"" asked Holly, the teacup forgotten halfway to her mouth.""A little. But more..."" Bryony spread her arms. ""If that could happen to us, if we could be rich and then suddenly have nothing—if life could change that much, overnight—then anything could happen. Birds could turn into fish. The sun could rise at midnight. I could learn to fly. The world was obviously wilder and stranger than anyone knew. And there was nothing left to lose. Nobody could take anything from us, because we didn't have anything left to take. I felt invincible.""bryony was never interested in marriage and was relieved to be out of the courtship game—she shared her equally unpretty sister holly's exhaustion of entertaining suitors halfheartedly pretending they were desirable for their merits instead of their money. their youngest sister ivy was pretty and girly and loved all that fairytale stuff, but all bryony wanted was to be in her comfy gardening clothes with dirt under her nails. a passionate gardener who hated roses even before one sealed her fate, the only things she brings to her new home are plants and seeds, turning a small portion of the beast's sprawling grounds into her own botanical paradise. once ensconced in the house, in the most emphatically pink room of all time, bryony soon discerns that she is not the beast's prisoner; that they are both prisoners to...something else, possibly the house itself, as it clearly has a personality and a sense of humor to go along with its magical abilities. the beast can't tell her much about whatever sinister force is keeping them imprisoned together, but—unlike the tight-lipped fellow in For the Wolf, it's not that he won't, but that he can't—each time he comes too close to divulging too much, the house makes its displeasure pretty clear until the beast walks it back placatingly. bryony clocks the rules pretty fast and becomes a proactive and resourceful investigator, soon finding a way around these restrictions in order to figure out how to lift this curse and get back to her life. but overall, although she misses her sisters, it's not a terrible place to be. she has her garden, the house can summon anything she could possibly want, and the beast has a kickass library. a booknerd whose own library was greatly diminished by her family's financial ruin, she's delighted by the beast's shelves, although a little embarrassed at the sheer greed that the Beast's library awoke in her. in short, she acclimates, becoming part of her surroundings without losing herself to them. she has no interest in the frilly pink dresses and jewels the house keeps laying out on her bed, but she's gracious enough to make some concessions and endure what she can, meeting the house's sartorial preferences halfway. she also gets used to the beast; their compatibility surfacing in unexpected ways, familiarity breeding respect and understanding, and bryony's kind enough to try to make the beast feel less self-conscious about his physical appearance. although he attends the formal dinner every evening, he will not eat in front of her, out of consideration for her likely disgust having to watch a beast eat. eventually, she makes him get over his damn self:""You might as well pour yourself one,"" she said wearily. ""Ask the house for a bowl or something.""He stiffened. ""It is—""""Unsightly, I know. Beast, does it matter? You are what you are. I promise that I will not be horrified if you lap your wine instead of sipping it."" She rubbed a hand over her eyes. ""Perhaps I should beg your pardon for sipping it. Who is to say which one of us is doing it correctly?""their blossoming relationship is perfect, made up of playful banter that develops into a genuine appreciation for each other's company, even as she turns down his nightly, curse-ordered marriage proposals. the ending is very different from the original, traveling some very dark ground before resolving in a satisfying and fitting conclusion even better than the original happily ever after. and one MUCH better than For the Wolf. if only all romances were as genuine and un-gooshy as this, i might like 'em more... * after this outstanding meet-cutewet too long to quote in the body of the , that showcases everything that makes these two characters so appealing, and reason #138 of Why I Love T. Kingfisher/Ursula Vernon:""I never faint,"" she said aloud. ""I consider it revolting. I have no patience for women who faint."" She pinched the bridge of her nose between her fingers.""On the contrary,"" rumbled the voice of the Beast, ""I felt that your skull bounced most charmingly on the carpet...And the way in which you soiled yourself with terror was graceful in the extreme,"" added the Beast.Bryony's eyes flew open and she sat bolt upright, ignoring the ringing in her ears and the immediate stabbing pain behind her eyes. ""I did not!"" she cried, and then the smell hit her, and she realized that she had.""It is not right that I am going to be both dead and mortified,"" she told the Beast. ""Either kill me now or give me a change of underwear.""He was kneeling down, which put his head on a level with Bryony's. His golden eyes were cool and sardonic and amused.""I am not going to kill you. And I fear that I do not carry women's underwear about my person.""""You are not a gentleman!"" cried Bryony. It was not that she was too furious to be afraid, it was that fury was sitting on top of the terror and riding it like a horse.""No,"" he said.

Everythiwhat's fun is that i read this story and mere DAYS later, my bestie greg was in the ICU with babesiosis, a disease he contracted from A TICK! Everything stopped. It was pitch black inside, or at least I thought so at first. In retrospect, though, that moment was like the first glance up past streetlights into night sky. It takes a while. What we like to call stars coming out is really just our eyes adjusting. Finally seeing what’s there.i was excited to see that this week's free tor short was a horror story, but this one was a disappointing fizzle for me. i'm not a fan of the kind of horror that writes around the supernatural events, putting the burden on the reader to fill in the details the author isn't providing. our unnamed, unreliable narrator is a documentary filmmaker specializing in ghost hunting stories who is following up on some very vague anecdotes a fellow prospective juror has shared with him in the waiting room before being dismissed from the case. tracking him down to a mall where he works as a night watchman, our intrepid narrator wrangles his curiosity and his go pro and circles the building, seeking the man and finding...other things. and it's not like those things aren't described, some of them very well and creepily:I glanced back in her direction. Just as I did, the store lights went out. In the instant after I saw her face, which was right at the window, pressed hard against the glass so her nose slid sideways.That stopped me. Held me pinned to that placeless place. but the story is told after the fact, and is full of jaggedy impressions, self-queries, and admissions that certain details were not witnessed, but inserted into the memory. it's a good representation of how someone's mind would process the experience; the doubt and half-glimpses, the screwy timeline—mentioning things out-of-order, employing both hindsight and foreshadowing, but that sort of padding doesn't enhance the narrative for me, it pulls me back too far away from the immediate action. The second time I knocked, I got an answer. From behind me.I don’t even remember the sound, couldn’t begin to tell you what it was, am not even sure there was sound; it could have been vibration underground. A temblor, they happen all the time out there, never really stop, as though the whole planet has Parkinson’s, is slowly shuddering itself and us to pieces.So maybe I just felt, didn’t hear. Maybe it wasn’t in response to my knock at all.Whatever. I was too busy whirling, fumbling my GoPro up to my face and turning it on—from protective instinct, not directorial—and so I saw what I saw through the lens.I’ve played the footage back a thousand times since then. I still can’t say. Neither can anyone I’ve shown it to. Is that a dragonfly passing? Wrong-color hummingbird? What you see is what I saw: a streak of black in the air, right at eye level, like a smear on the lens itself.Or a contrail.i suppose all of this is meant to intensify the reader's sense of dislocation—which is usually an effective tactic with horror, but in a piece this short, is more frustrating than anything else, and the scenes actually describing what he encountered that evening were more curious than terrifying. it's a very frontloaded piece—he spends more time describing the jury duty room and a vending machine apple than any of the apparitions, and while he develops his atmosphere well, for me it was too vague and uncertain.but i'm sure you will like it more. i'm just an old fraud who hates reading in general.

I feel like I want to unzip my skin and wriggle out of my body and into another. By what metric is he measuring my luck? I suppose he means that I'm luckier than a woman whose attack has resulted in her murder. I want to tell him: lucky is what you are when you win the lottery.a home invasion gone weird disrupts a recovering addict's life even further by its aftermath, dragging the reader along on an oftentimes very confusing ride. i'm a rounder-upper by nature (and probably also by nurture), so while there are some frustrating things about this one, mostly centered in the author's dislocating structural choices and my own personal inability to get with the lovecraftian tradition of half-unseen horror slithering on the periphery, the parts that i did like were strong enough to boost this into four-star territory. its horror is mainly psychological in nature, but there's plenty of graphic body horror to bloody the pot, with a cherry of hubristic science fiction on top. plotstuff: the titular sydney burgess is a former addict nine years sober who has struggled to turn her life around and finally seems to have achieved the suburban american dream: a steady career, a stable boyfriend who dotes on her and her eleven-year-old son, and a beautiful house where the three of them live in unremarkable placid safety.this all changes when sydney is attacked by a masked intruder in her home while matt and danny are away camping. she manages to escape with serious but survivable injuries, but the incident leaves her with profound psychological scarring, especially when she learns that the intruder has been found emphatically dead in her home, stabbed twenty-eight times, presumably by her own self-defensive overkill.blackouts and memory gaps are not unfamiliar territory for the ghost of sydney past, but violent mutilation is a pretty significant thing to forget, and the encounter shatters her sense of calm, creating psychological fissures that allow her past behavior and memories to crawl closer to the surface of her hard-won new life. more specifically, it unleashes 'the swimmer;' an inchoate dark force that manifests, causing dreamlike hallucinatory experiences—visions and voices and impulses; weakening the seam between time and reality and some other ineffable realm, altering her with a slippery indefinable ""offness"" in her physical appearance; perceptible to others in a startling can't-put-my-finger-on-it way, and causing some erratic behavioral changes. everything gets a bit murky from this point on, but while there were some ""wait, HUH?"" moments, there were also some high points shining through the confusion. he really shines at writing about addiction. and yeah, trigger, trigger, chicken dinners all around. i don't have any personal experience with addiction, but he writes sydney's predicament so viscerally—the lure of addiction crooking its finger, inviting her to backslide; her acute psychological distress and head trauma weakening her resolve—even as she refuses the painkillers her doctors prescribe. the temporal and reality shifts of the narrative pull the reader along into sydney's turmoil, enhancing the sense of being caught in a spiral with her, where her willpower clashes up against the hunger, the wanting, the ritual, and the promise of release that drugs once provided. it can be read, up to a point, as an extended metaphor of addiction as demonic possession; addiction externalized into an entity, always lurking, set giddily free by a violent experience. it frequently reminded me of the psychic unraveling in sara gran's excellently taut demonic possession novel Come Closer; the narrative becoming increasingly fragmented as something else supersedes sydney's will and she begins losing control of her life. the idea of compartmentalizing one's dark urges into a whole 'nother entity is not new—dexter's dark passenger, dr. jeckyll's mr. hyde, etc, but this one eventually takes the conceit one step further into unexpected—debatably implausible—territory, and that ending is a pretty solid gutpunch.i appreciated the author’s extra credit wrinkle to the possession angle; a deft little pivot exploring sydney's growing sense that she is herself an invasive species; a performative parasite in this shiny happy suburban life she was maybe only adopting as protective camouflage.My heart quickens. Just for a moment—a passing flash—a sharp wave of disgust washes over me. Not at the sheriff and his fealty to the unrest in this room, but at the sheer blandness of the things I've surrounded myself with. The proof that I have embraced with all my heart and soul the proper aspects of being a mother, a partner, a fucking commuter. All the time and energy spent scratching and clawing just to put myself in the position to scratch and claw some more, at upward mobility, like a normal person. I recall the reckless misdirected rages and euphoric highs of the wreck I used to be and once again the craving hits—to slip into that younger skin for a moment, to sidestep the notion that the straight world has anything to offer me. To stay the fucked-up course. I haven't felt the pull of these impulses in a long time.when it's on, it's ON, but it's a not-for-everyone kind of book, for a number of reasons. my personal reason is that i have always balked at the blurry phrasings of cosmic horror—the ""impossible geometries,"" and ""thicket[s] of vagueness,"" and ""the angular alphabet of some incomprehensible language."" stuff like that makes my brain itch, and there's a lot of it here. it's a genre convention of a genre i don't dig, so that's on me, but it especially rankles here, when he's so damn good at the detail work when it's grounded in the real. the whole opening, describing the attack, is so finely-wrought that i'm powerless to resist typing most of it out here and you can read it or not.It happened so fast, say people who have lived through sudden bursts of violence—but for me, time's a slow drip and I can see everything at once. Black sneakers on our reclaimed tiles, old appliance manuals in the junk drawer, the RSVP to the wedding of my boyfriend's cousin, a small lace-trimmed envelope waiting to be mailed. The man's eyes are framed by the slit in his balaclava, a word I know from the tattered paperbacks I tore through in the rehab center's shabby library.I take one step back, jam my hand into my shoulder bag, and rummage wildly for the pepper spray. But I've never used it before, and it's buried under travel Kleenex packs and lip balm and generic ibuprofen and noise-canceling headphones and laptop and charger and moleskin notebook and tampons.His hand closes around the Jesus candle my boyfriend bought from the bodega by the train station. Señor de los Milagros de Buga, $3.99 plus tax. It's the size of a relay runner's baton, glass as thick as a casserole dish and filled to the brim with solid wax. My fingers brush the pepper spray canister. There's a little rim of plastic that acts as a safety—I just have to flick it to the side. Too slow, Sydney. The candle comes at me in a fluid sideways arc.Half ducking, half flinching, I twist away. His side-arm swing smashes the candle into my left ear. There's an unbelievable volcanic thud inside my head, a searing, blinding flash, and time's not a slow drip anymore, it's a film reel with missing frames. I am holding myself up, clinging to the door.I will stay on my feet.There's an electric current buzzing through my teeth. The front hall is full of bad angles, a nonsense corridor in a dream. The coats are swaying on their hooks. I raise the pepper spray, but my arm can only aim it in the direction of the baseboard, the off-white trim that doesn't quite touch the tile, a haven for crumbs and lost earrings. In the gilt-framed mirror next to the closet door, I see a gloved hand holding the candle up in the air. The man is very tall, and the tip of the candle hits the ceiling before it comes down.The walls are tinted red and the whole house roars like the ocean. There's a hot-penny tang I can taste in the back of my throat, a cocaine drip that fills my mouth and overflows. Tissue packs and hair clips are scattered across the tiles, coming up fast.I shouldn't be here. These words can't really form because the darkness is thick enough to stifle thought. It's more like a sharp sense of injustice wrapped in the fear that throbs somewhere in the void. An impression that I have been cheated by circumstance.I shouldn't be here.now that's how you open a book, yeah? it's so immersive and real—the splintery convoluted thought-chains of panic, desperately grasping at the familiar, clinging to the smallest, most inconsequential details, caught in the slow realization of the moment, danger making everything stand out in sharp relief because this could be where you end. anyone who's had a near-death experience is bound to relate to this and it is powerfully effective. which is why i was so frowny when it slid into that 'unutterable horror' track that does nothing for me. still, there's a lot to applaud here, so i'm rounding up and no one can stop me. not even some eldritch swimmer. tl;dr: DO YOU LOVE ME?tl;dr2:[image][image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,101,1,Aug 2021,"Aug 05, 2021","Jul 14, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56620854-the-seven-visitations-of-sydney-burgess

""For when this fighting is over, and we're happy again. We'll go to French restaurants like we used to. We'll fall back in love. So deeply in love that it burns us to be apart. Then, one day—maybe we'll be having breakfast, maybe we'll be watching a movie. Something normal. But you'll look over to me to make a joke, ask a question, and I'll be gone. Then you'll look for Callie, and she'll be gone too. I'm going to leave you when you least expect it, and I'm taking her with me,"" He looms over me and plants a kiss on my forehead, light as a dry leaf. ""I'm smarter than you,"" he said. ""I've got endurance. I can wait long enough to make it really hurt."" He picked up his glass of water from beside the night table and hurled it at the wall. The sound was like the world opening. Glass flew like diamonds. Irving smiled at me. Then he got into bed and a moment later he was asleep.********************************when a glitchy thing happens six times in an ARC by a notoriously tricksy author, you have to wonder whether it's a recurring typo or if you're Miss.ing something.i will wait and seeconclusion: typo. and a lot more than 6 times.[image]dammit—i really wanted it to MEAN something. still—a badass-wonderful book.

'cuz if there are powerful higher powers to whom humanity is no more significant than an anthill or a beehive is to us, the consequences would be catastrophic if the first person they met was some self-aggrandizing misanthropic douchebag. let's be on our best behavior when the planet-crushing entities come over, mmkay?

But she finds the girl pale and shivering. “Whatever is the matter?” the mother asks, and the daughter says, in a whisper, “I think there’s something under my bed.”The mother says, “I’m sure that’s not the case,” but nonetheless indulges the girl by getting down on her knees and lifting the dust ruffle and peering beneath the box spring.And it is here, in the shadows beneath the bed, that she spies a face. A pale and shivering face that seems to belong to her daughter, who says, in a whisper, “I think there’s something in my bed.”so good and shivery!on the other hand, the pick-and-mix of it all feels slightly discombobulated, like a series of notes and half-developed ideas for novels he'd like to write someday all gathered up and sandwiched between a framing device and passed off as a story.some of it is a little outlandish—the second chonk especially so because, come on—consequences? still, i love urban legends, and even though i appreciated the parts of this one more than the whole, it's well worth your time, and i'll be here crossing my fingers for him to develop this into something even better. read it for free hereTHE STORIES:DECEMBER 1: NIGHT STAND - DANIEL WOODRELLDECEMBER 2: MR.

Toreth will be left alone?""Turnbull waited until du Pre nodded. ""Good, I'm glad we can see eye to eye on this, Cam. Obviously, if his threat level rises in the future..."" She shrugged, offering the concession. ""But I think it's more than likely the Administration will want his services again. One might even go so far as to say need.""She lifted her glass and, reluctantly, du Pre clinked her cup against it. ""What are we drinking to?"" du Pre asked.""The future.""

Blacktop Wasteland is the only gearhead novel i will ever love, featuring a reformed getaway driver drawn out of his small business-owning, family man retirement by that proverbial ""one last job."" it's blisteringly good, and earned him much-deserved critical praise and recognition as an exciting new voice in crime fiction. this one is even better; deploying his taut-but-lyrical prose and exceptional character-work into a much broader story with gritty action sequences for the crime fiction fans, and resonating social themes for people who like to Talk About Books—a perfect balance of genre and literary fiction. quickplot: ike and buddy lee (the ex-cons from the glib tagline) meet at a funeral, grieving over the freshly-dug graves of their sons. the young men were murdered only a few months after their wedding; a ceremony which neither father attended. both men have done time, but have left their criminal ways behind them, living the good-citizen life for years. however, as the months pass without any arrests in their sons' case, they decide to take matters into their own hands, falling back pretty hard into their old ways, reaching out to former associates, following leads, and finding their skills of forcible persuasion undiminished. they may be rusty but they are formidable. it's a grizzled (and grisly) buddy pic of a novel—two flawed but not unsympathetic antiheroes who share the guilty remorse about being locked away and missing so much of their sons' lives, expressing (and attempting to exorcise) their guilt through some of that old testament salting-the-earth kind of violence.their shared purpose bonds them in a gruff sort of friendship, calling each other out on their more unsavory behaviors and beliefs—buddy lee's alcoholism and unexamined racism, ike's disgust with his son's homosexuality; his refusal to accept his son when he was alive, punching out his rage that his only child died without a reconciliation. but in between dropping bodies and putting the hurt on others, there’s time for some personal growth. this isn’t some feel-good story where men stuck in outmoded and problematic ways of seeing the world are suddenly cured of their bigotry by grief-riddled self-examination—where a black man teaches a redneck that thinking you're not racist because you’re not wearing a pointy white hat doesn't mean you're not still harboring some racist beliefs, or where a man grapples with the fact that being part of a discriminated group doesn’t make you more tolerant and understanding towards other discriminated groups. but it’s also not not that.""Feels like we waited pretty late in the day to start learning shit,"" Buddy Lee said. The bartender brought them two more shots.""Day ain't over yet,"" Ike said.i, for one, learned, in great detail, what a body does to a woodchipper.gun to my head and i have to say something negative?the only complaint i can see being made about cosby’s writing is about his tendency to get a little simile-prone:The wound on his cheek was weeping like a broken-hearted bride.but while some of them are a scootch too flourishy, others are sheer perfection:When he hit the ground, his large and small intestines began to unspool like a ribbon of saltwater taffy soaked in merlot.he is a tremendous writer, and i hope he doesn't get dismissed as ""genre"" and overlooked come awards time because, like the criminally overlooked* tana french, he's literary AF.i will leave you with one more simileTime makes loyalty thin. People shed it like snakeskin.i've read over 130 books this year, and this one is easily #1. * by award committees outside of the mystery realm**********************************ALL THE STARS!! s.a. cosby is three-for-three with me. it's gonna be a second before i get a chance to  this one, so just go out and read it for yourselves and then you won't even need me!************************************i finished all of my july obligations so i am rewarding myself with this before my august obligations begin...[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,179,1,"Jul 25, 2021","Jul 28, 2021","Jun 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57660923-razorblade-tears

It will lead to something, eventually, even if that is a revised definition of nothing. He tells himself that telling himself these things does not help. Except for the many times that it does.when i bought this book—about twenty minutes after learning of its existence—the entire synopsis was: Your book. Right now.there's a bit more posted now, but those four words were four more than necessary to guarantee my purchase, 'cuz i'm already an evan dara superfan and it's been too long since his last novel. i'm glad i didn't know more going into it—i'm actually sorta itching to delete that user-posted synopsis, because it's near-impossible to distill an evan dara plot into a tidy summary, and part of the joy of his books is the dislocation you feel as you try to find your way through the convoluted glory of his prose—his books are puzzles, journeys, challenges. the pleasure is not in ""understanding all the things,"" but in knowing that each time you revisit it, you might understand a little more, or you might interpret something differently.i went in knowing nothing, i ended knowing some things, but certain that i wanted to reread it, in the hopes of knowing more somethings.in a way, it's the most straightforward of his books, but it isn't straightforward by any other metric; you're not going to just be handed the name or age of the protagonist, the setting, or the specific set of circumstances that have led to his situation. the appeal of a journey to daraland is the way he builds atmosphere and that—even if you don't know what the heck's going on, you are hooked into finding out more. it's a fully immersive experience—you become surrounded by his story, and even now—a week after reading it—a part of me is still back there, trembling alongside our hero. it's also about his unique voice, his word-choices; these perfect descriptors that are unexpected and striking without being strained. it's such a rare quality—so many writers try to force what comes naturally to him—cramming their prose with unusual words to give their writing a poetical flair, but if it's not done well, it clunks everything up. dara's aren't...expensive words, but they're perfect for evoking the situation. whatever that is. Four is the manse with three gables, one on every side I've seen. The building has three stories, standing unswaying under a punk cut of angled rooflets and steep pediments. Walls made of heavy limestone, mullioned windows dark and depthless. Halfway up a girding of half-timbering, uncrumbled. They're working the manse's east side. The buttress-stones already reach to just below the windows of the third floor and extend in a French curve twelve, fourteen feet from the exterior wall. One stone bears, worndown, blurred, the oval insignia that once hung next to our post office's entrance door.The buttresser, hauling my stone, works his way up the slope. Sometimes he places my stone down on the terraced stack and uses it as a prop for his next step. Not once does he grunt. In less than a minute the buttresser stops, lifts my stone above his head and compresses like a spring beneath it. He shudders back to vertical, raises his arms, his sleeves slip below his elbows and he slides the stone onto the slope's top. Then, with both hands, he pushes the stone snug. No mortar or cement. The existing structuring of stones and rocks makes my stone stay put. The buttresser monkeys back down to earth. He runs off and jumps over a shirtless man squirted on the ground and approaches a distributor at the next manse's north facade. My distributor continues to look up at my stone. I tell myself he is perhaps now surveying for aesthetic purposes. He nods and turns towards me. Hmphs and blinks his eyes to say: Done. He flips open his strongbox and stirs in two fingers. Fishes out and hands me fourteen florins, muddy dark coins. Then he turns to receive the next drop, from a man who must be seventy. Beneath a white mist of hair the man moves agilely, in short scurries. His back, under loose, sodden clothes, is rippling bone and lumped muscle. He tilts and I see he's carrying two stones. Two large stones. I disappear for the distributor. He stands with his hand curved above his stability rail and watches another buttresser scale the heap. The buttresser's shoes, soleless beige cloths, grab edges of stones as he clambers up. The hard hill rises. Pebbles sprinkle down.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN? LET'S FIND OUT!JUNE 1: draw anything that comes to mind on this pink background. think of something that isn't pink in real lifeso, my real problem when it comes to drawing is that i'm not particularly creative and can never think of *what* to draw. i am someone who requires direction. so i decided to use wikipedia's ""random article"" feature to ""tell"" me what to draw on this here pink background. wikipedia told me to draw MOOSE MOUNTAIN. and so i did.[image]WELCOME TO MOOSE MOUNTAIN! IT IS A MOUNTAIN FOR MOOSE!JUNE 2: close your eyes and reach into your pencil collection. pull out a random selection of five colors and use only this limited palette to create your piece. this is great because it leaves EVERYTHING up to fate—the colors AND the content! here is fate's rainbow:[image]olive green, lilac, tuscan red, crimson red and one without a name that i shall prosaically call ""gray."" wikipedia challenged me to draw ""Macrobathra porphyrea,"" but refused to provide a picture of whateverthehell that is. i asked google to intervene, and was rewarded with this:[image]so i drawed this:[image]a fuzzy slenderman-alien with a case of the wing-pox!JUNE 3: draw a person riding a bike, using your left hand if you are a righty, or your right hand if you're a lefty. [image]honestly, this came out better than i thought it would, and it's probably pretty close to how i would draw a bike using my awesome left hand. i realized, while drawing this, that i have no idea what a bicycle looks like.JUNE 4: draw one big dog and four small cats[image]don't mind if i do! this is a bad photo but it's the best i can do right now. long wearying day and it's a miracle i was able to even get the drawing thing done. sorry sorry meowJUNE 5: draw an underwater animal tea party[image]don't ask me how this works w/r/t gravity/buoyancy and soggy sandwiches. i'm a CHILD, remember? goo goo gah gah&etc.JUNE 6: fill in six squares depicting your day[image]THIS IS WHAT I DID!

It was first performed in March 2009 at the Jerwood Theatre Downstairs at the Royal Court Theatre by the author himself, directed by Stephen Daldry. Its topic is the Israeli Security Barriers in the West Bank and Gaza and it is intended by Hare as a companion piece to his monologue Berlin and its passages on the Berlin Wall. Both monologues were later performed together as Berlin/Wall at The Public Theater, Broadway in May 2009.challenge accepted! from my fisted tool to your eyes, here is the fruit of mine and wikipedia's loins:[image]i didn't color this one in because it would have turned into even more of a mess than it is in plain old pencil.

[image]an argument can (and HAS) been made that brrémaud is more interested in drawing a bunch of different animals than with telling a specific story, but when you draw as well as he does, i think you should be able to do what you like without reproach.* i mean, look at this platypus shaking itself off like a puppy!

[image]look at this wombat getting its butt bitten by a dingo![image]there is a story here, but like all the other books, it strays from its titular creature and takes a widescreen approach, showing off the sometimes brutal way nature goes about its business. [image]like any nature documentary, they are always equal parts lovely and upsetting, and i, for one, never feel betrayed when brrémaud drifts from the ostensible center of the story to see what's happening elsewhere—detours are opportunities.opportunities for quokkas!

PART ONE can be found HERE.SHRIMP & LINGUINE FRA DIAVOLOi got to make my beloved arrabbiata sauce for a third time![image]but then i had to make a whole other recipe on top of that. somewhat labor intensive, but well worth it. [image]but who's this?[image]oh no, shrimpy! laying down his (delicious) body to save his friends! but it's too late, little shrimpy, you are the sole survivor of the arrabbiata assault. this project just got pretty dark and i'm sorry. looks like MAY is actually the cruelest month after all. [image]but back to the food-: the crispety cruncheties are the real stars here. they are just butter-fried panko with some seasonings, but they bring a lot of YUM.only ONE DAY LEFT, but i still want to make so many more things. BAKED RACLETTE[image]okay, this one won the final slot because 1) CHEESE, and 2) ""raclette"" rhymes with my last name.[image]this was very tasty, and CHEESY and i got to make little cornichon fans (which i just realized you can't see in the pictures so hang on) HERE:[image]anyway, thanks for following along. i have enjoyed this project very much and i will update in this secondary  space as i make more dishes in the futuuure, although some of them are more suited to cold-weathertimes, so it might be a while. HOLD TIGHT! [image][image][image]these are the ones i had planned to make during this project, but there just weren't enough days in the month:KIELBASA WITH MUSTARD DIPCHICKEN POT PIE SOUP WITH PUFF PASTRY CROUTONSBAKED FISH CHOWDERMAINE LOBSTER STEWSEARED TUNA AND AVOCADO ROLLSSKILLET-ROASTED CHICKEN & POTATOESFRESH CRAB & PEA RISOTTOadditional pictures (including pics of each of her finished dishes) are over on blogTHE PROJECT CONTINUES with SALTED PISTACHIO MERINGUES!HERS:[image]at the critical meringue-ing stage, where you were meant to ""whisk on high for 10 minutes,"" my mixer died. i tried to be a mixer, i really did, but my flabby little arms could not replicate the whisking power of a machine. i googled ""how do the amish make meringue"" and the answer is: using air compressors to power their hand mixers. anyway, these didn't come out the way they were supposed to, but they were still very tasty and i will make them again once i replace my mixer and some time has passed to salve my emotional wounds. [image][image]fed up with everything, instead of making individual cookies for the second batch, i just glopped the remainder onto a baking sheet and there you have it[image][image]weird, slightly overcooked meringue. i have since replaced my mixer, so all is well. CHUNKY APPLE BUTTER[image]i don't think i have ever had apple butter before. i thought it was some kind of paste or something, and maybe it is and that's why she specifies that this is CHUNKY apple butter, like how chunky peanut butter is its own anomalous thing. anyway, this is basically applesauce that takes longer to make and requires a vanilla bean and now i am out of vanilla beans. when i make applesauce i don't use any sugar at all, so this one was maybe too sweet for me (says the girl who eats marshmallow fluff with a spoon). but it's got good fall spices like cloves and allspice and is maybe best made in the fall, because midsummer is not really a buyer's market for the cider called for in the recipe, so, betrayed by the farmer's market, i had to settle for the ONE overpriced option at the store and it was not thick and cloudy the way cider ought to be. CRISPY CHICKEN AND LEMON ORZO WITH FETA[image]apparently, in my neighborhood, one can buy boneless chicken breasts without skin, or bony chicken breasts with skin, but NOT boneless chicken breasts WITH skin. considering that the draw of this recipe is the crispy skin, i chose the bony breasts, so i was unable to slice them all nice like she commanded, [image]but they were still great: moist and juicy and crispy, with a lovely glisteny brown butter sauce which makes it look somewhat smeary and greasy-looking here, but that's because i'm bad at food photography.i didn't use any dill in my orzo because i'm not a fan (and i used extra feta because i AM a fan), so it's not the prettiest orzo in photographic history, but it was a fine companion to the chicken and it was VERY lemony. [image]i made the CRISPY CHICKEN AND LEMON ORZO WITH FETA again, and they came out even better.[image][image]although it did sortof give me some flashbacks[image][image][image]TONIGHT I AM MAKING A POSSET! WTF IS THAT EVEN?ENGLISH LEMON POSSETSO! although it sounds like something a courtesan wears, a posset is actually some kind of a semi-jiggly pudding, in this case, a lemon-flavored one covered in macerated straw- and raspberries. it is deliciously sharp and sour, but the berries offset the pucker perfectly. [image]NB: it becomes significantly less jiggly the longer it takes you to get a decent picture of it in this unbearable summer heat[image]until it melts into something resembling the way i feel inside and out.[image]this recipe calls for limoncello liqueur, which is apparently only sold in one-liter bottles. so now i have a whole bottle (less 4 tablespoons) of limoncello and no idea what to do with the rest of it. suggestions welcome.[image]and where was i when we all learned that snoop had a freaking rosé line? [image]i haven't cracked it open yet, but that time is drawing nigh.ROASTED SAUSAGES, PEPPERS & ONIONS served with FRESH CORN POLENTAa tray of delicious sausages![image]a close-up of delicious sausages![image]and a puddle of polenta (her words, my reality): [image]this polenta looks like the early-morning sidewalk in front of the bars in my neighborhood, but it was absolutely delicious, even spooned cold into my mouth the next day. she does indeed use the word ""puddle"" in the recipe to describe the polenta, but hers looks nothing like the puddle my direction-following-self produced. [image]but that's fine—i'm not trying to be pretty over here, and it tasted gorgeous. it's also fun to knife-skim corn from its cob, which i've never done before but is oddly therapeutic.here is their blessed union:[image]with a hearty plop of basil and cheese[image]this concludes my sausage party. more recipes coming, probably...[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,149,1,not set,"May 31, 2021","May 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51154724-modern-comfort-food

You’re a thing, and there is no safety.murderbot? murderNOT!this l'il shorty follows the events of book 4, and spins the POV away from murderbot's narrative voice into a close third POV of dr. mensah, recently rescued by murderbot and dealing (or not dealing) with the resulting PTSD of that situation. what's great about this is seeing murderbot through a human's eyes and realizing that a lot of its self-assessments in terms of its awkwardness are inaccurate, and the way these two traumatized characters care for each other is such a balm in a world where terrible things keep happening. i know murderbot is ace AF, but their requisition forms for ""increasingly improbable armaments"" seem flirty to me in a way that is very sweet, despite all the spikes and guns involved. i'm not sure what the platonic version of flirtation is called, but whatever their relationship is, it's mutual, and they certainly understand and respect each other in a very specific and lovely way. SecUnit is looking down at her. “You can hug me if you need to.”“No. No, that’s all right. I know you don’t care for it.” She wipes her face. There are tears in her eyes, because she’s an idiot.“It’s not terrible.” She can hear the irony under its even tone.“Nevertheless.” She can’t do this. She can’t lean on a being that doesn’t want to be leaned on. Of all the things SecUnit needs, the only ones she can give it are room and time in a relatively safe space to make decisions for itself. Becoming a prop for her failing emotional stability won’t do either one of them any good.i'm going to try to ration my remaining murderbot books because i'm blowing through them so quickly that i haven't even ed the last two yet. i hadn't meant to read book four so closely on the heels of book three, but i really wanted to read this story as my free tor shorty of the week, so i had to catch up to it, you know? if there's a murderbot version of the marshmallow test, i'm failing it, but of all my numerous failures, it's been the most enjoyable.

(in other words, nothing like the fizzy and frothy Luckiest Girl Alive, which i (lovingly) described as ""kind of like if the lifetime channel exploded, causing lifetime confetti to go everywhere."")it's also in no way similar to the increasingly manic presentation of Black Swan. sure, they are both about ballet, but you can't just consider nouns when you're bookmatching. Crime and Punishment, American Psycho, and The Silence of the Lambs are all about murderers, but they don't have much else in common.Black Swan is frenetic in its exploration of the themes of obsession, competition, and the mad quest for perfection, but The Ballerinas is no fever-dream; it's grounded in the real world—leisurely-paced and thoughtful. the megan abbott-match is solid—both this one and Dare Me are intimate looks into insular worlds (cheerleading, ballet), whose facade of female prettiness belies the athleticism and drive required to succeed; challenging the stereotypes of cheerleaders as perky and ditzy, and ballerinas as delicate and dreamy, revealing the fierce badassery at their cores. in both, the pursuit takes place in a bubble of exclusivity that nonetheless acts as a microcosm of the female experience in the larger world (...you start out as perfect and you become something else/You start out as whole and then you break.); invoking themes of control, selfishness, drive, ambition, sacrifice, legacy, power, sex, manipulation, deceptive appearances, taking charge of one's destiny, and living with one's choices. The Ballerinas lacks the ominous tone for which abbott is known—that omnipresent sense of menace simmering, about to explode—and it's ultimately more kind, but the way both authors fixate on female bodies is extremely similar—especially comparing The Ballerinas to abbott's ballet-focused book The Turnout—both authors spend time detailing how ballet breaks the body to achieve the perfection and beauty that dance demands—the strength and suffering required to deliver the illusion of a pretty delicate thing flitting on the stage, compliant and pliable and tossed about like a little pink blossom. and no one knows more about that process than a dancer-turned-choreographer:I'd never actually say it, but the part I love most about being a choreographer is pushing the dancers to their limits. Being the one with power for once. Only dancers really know what it's like to lift, to float, to grind through the infinite combinations of the same positions, day after day, underneath the ticking, appraising eyes of a choreographer or ballet mistress or artistic director. Every time i work, I watch their pink satin feet and I know. Underneath those shoes, the flesh is exposed, has been rubbed down into multilayered wounds.Beneath the glossy pink tights, they ache to the marrow of their bones.Below the crowns and the tutus and the perfection, they're all just quivering messes.And it's all for me.Until, of course, they step onto the stage—becoming my agents, my brushstrokes, my tools. Then it's all for the audience. It's all for you.""Don't they realize,"" I'd hissed to Margaux during a curtain call after a particularly grisly performance of Swan Lake fifteen years ago, ""that we're all covered in the most disgusting sores under our shoes?""She'd plastered her pink grin wide, grabbing my hand as the curtain went up, exposing us once more.""Of course they know,"" she said between her teeth. ""That's why they like to watch.""And that was what I liked. To hide the suffering with my own brand of perfection.abbott, in any of her books, goes deeper and darker than The Ballerinas, but this one takes a longer view to consider how aging affects women in these fields of brief viability; the frustration of their overextended bodies failing, the judgment and dismissal they experience in favor of younger dancers, the rage and regret of almost making it, the devotion to a brutal discipline that goes against the most basic biological imperatives:A ballerina is a perfect woman. Thin. Beautiful. Invisibly strong.There are no evolutionary reasons we should look the way we do. If what you want is a good procreator, look anywhere but a ballet company, where you're unlikely to find a period that comes more regularly than one month out of three. What you want is someone round, with wide hips and pendulous breasts; someone ready to take a few months of war or famine in stride and still guarantee the future of the human race. Arms ready to plow a field, knead some bread, comfort a child. Good peasant stock.Yet somehow, delicate and breakable, we have become the height of feminine perfection.all of that to say, if you're not expecting a thriller, you'll be in a better position to appreciate this slightly dark book about the inner lives of women navigating a very specific world that is built upon presentation, performance, where Being presentable when you go outside is a public service. it's ALSO a reminder that you gotta be careful about advertising a reading experience that a book isn't going to deliver, which is why people with RA training (like ME: a lady with extremely strong readers' advisory skills who is DESPERATE FOR WORK IN THAT FIELD PLEASE AND THANK YOU) should be in such high demand that they don't need to beg for work on the internet. but here i am, driven to gaucheness, ready to serve. as an aside (this whole  is basically an aside), ballet has been a hot topic in books this year: Center Center: A Funny, Sexy, Sad Almost-Memoir of a Boy in Ballet, Being a Ballerina: The Power and Perfection of a Dancing Life, Turning Pointe: How a New Generation of Dancers Is Saving Ballet from Itself, My Daddy Can Fly!,Balanchine's Apprentice: From Hollywood to New York and Back, Swan Dive: The Making of a Rogue Ballerina, Dance Theatre of Harlem: A History, a Movement, a Celebration, The Ballerina Mindset: How to Protect Your Mental Health While Striving for Excellence, Black Ballerinas: My Journey to Our Legacy, Dance or Die: From Stateless Refugee to International Ballet Star, and of course, megan abbott's The Turnout (which is, oddly enough, not a better match to The Ballerinas than Dare Me, despite the more targeted subject matter because its florid, claustrophobic, erotic, and neo-gothic tone is a whole different vibe.)despite the sudden wealth of ballet-books, they're mostly nonfiction, and naturally, i had a woman come in who was looking for a novel about ballet that was more realistic than sensationalized/romanticized; that wasn't focused on dancers who were emotionally damaged or hyper-sexualized (i.e., she did NOT want The Turnout). although it features flawed characters (like any book worth reading), i mentioned this one to her, even though it was months away from pubbing, and i hope she didn't lose that little scrap of paper because i think she'd really dig this book. *******************************oh no i sat on this  for too long and now it's pub day and i have FAILED my ONE JOB!i'll write it tomorrow. i am terrible.*******************************i received a free ARC from macmillan in exchange for an honest  and i will be reading this SOON.[image]come to my blog!...more",Notes are private!,0,94,1,"Jul 09, 2021","Jul 14, 2021","May 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56268810-the-ballerinas

[image]...it was a foolish thing, a childish thing, to think that monsters only showed their teeth at night.even though my brain knows that The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is set in new york, it FEELS like such a new englandy story, and growing up, whenever the wretched summer finally ended, making way for the cozier fall; the leaves flaring before crisping, the scent of autumnal spices on the air, there you would find young karen, sipping warm cider on a horse-drawn haunted hayride, listening to someone read aloud the tale of ichabod crane and the headless horseman.because of this, i've always had a nostalgic fondness for the story, so i was over the moon excited to read this book—the cover gave me full-body shivers, and i loved henry's Lost Boy: The True Story of Captain Hook and was excited to see where she'd take this material.[image]i didn't...love this one.there's not much retelling going on here. it's more of a ""what came after"" story that checks in on sleepy hollow twenty years later, when brom and katrina's fourteen-year-old grandchild ben starts questioning what she's been told about her parents' deaths and the legend of the horseman.it started off so well, giving me vibes like The Village[image]Very little about Sleepy Hollow had changed since its founding. It was like the Hollow was caught inside a soap bubble, or maybe a spell—always the same, never growing or changing. There weren't even that many visitors, generally—people sometimes passed through, but they rarely stayed. Any newcomer was like grit in the Hollow's eye, and the people of the village would rub at it until the grit was removed.but there's no big payoff-reveal here, no revisionist slant taking what we thought we knew about sleepy hollow and refracting its light in another direction, the way she subverted our good/evil assumptions of Peter Pan in Lost Boy: The True Story of Captain Hook (and, presumably, in her other retellings, all of which i have bought and are still sitting here unread.) this village-as-isolated-snowglobe scenario is simply establishing the scene—an outsider-wary village whose people accept magic and the supernatural as a fact of life. Sleepy Hollow believed in spirits and demons, because they lived side by side with those beings. The people of the town believed in magic. And why wouldn't they? Magic was woven into the fabric of the Hollow. It drifted in the air. It rode through the night on a fast horse.the headless horseman does indeed ride through these pages, but the more immediate, kid-chomping threat is...something else, so the story is less a reimagining of the source material than henry taking the original and tacking a narrative branch onto it. there are actually two horsemen here—the one that ichabod crane encountered, whose story has become part of the village's mythos (and it confirms what washington irving insinuated about the horseman's identity in the original tale), but there’s also an enigmatic quasi-spectral horseback'ed figure who seems fixated on young ben, his intentions a combination of sinister and protective. more than anything else, this is ben's story. ben is an orphan being raised by her grandparents. she idolizes brom, and is impatient with katrina, specifically with katrina's insistence on her dressing like a girl, keeping out of the mud and being ladylike, when ben has never felt like a girl, preferring boy's clothing and pursuits to the suffocating expectations of smalltown womanhood.but ben's destiny lies elsewhere.and as far as that goes, this is a very good book about yearning, and becoming, but the indifferent scaffolding of the horseman tale makes this pretty flimsy, storywise.people who accept magic’s existence don't necessarily embrace it with open arms, especially when their children start dying, and ben's otherness soon becomes a liability. In little villages like ours, those who don't fit in were cast out.this didn't have to be a sleepy hollow-rework. it could have been set in any small town where ""different"" means ""dangerous,"" it could just as easily have been a retelling of The Crucible. in fact, one of the best parts is ben's slow-dawning realization about what, specifically, all of katrina's dismay over ben's gender nonconformity and her attempts at behavioral adjustments have been trying to prevent. I recognized that grief had driven him mad. I also knew, with a deep uneasiness, that any accusations of witchcraft might be taken seriously by the people of the village.as a headless horseman adaptation, this missed the mark for me, but the guts of the story are sound, and i really enjoyed the character relationships and ben's whole achin' to be struggle. i'm flickering between 3 and 4 on this, but if we're judging a book by its cover, it's an easy five.

Eventually, she recovers.There is no question, then: The man must release her. He has no use for a crane, no matter how beautiful. He takes her out of the woods. The sky stretches out.

But that is not where this tale ends.most people will read this story about a woman delivered from domestic abuse as beautiful and triumphant, but i'm the lady on the fringes going ""wellllll....""this part got my goat:(view spoiler)[“Marry me,” you say, fumbling the ring. You have only one free hand. The other holds a bag of frozen peas to her swollen rib cage. “We’ll go away from here. We’ll start over.”There is a moment when her eyes slide away to the magazines and bundled script pages, the view from the new apartment, the billboards and city beyond. It is just a moment. Her gaze returns to you, red and puffy as a poppy gone to rot.“Marry me,” you ask again. When you try to smooth away her tears, you only manage to rub the salt into her skin. It is then that she shows you the unsigned contract that came with the diamond and platinum monstrosity that has taken your place on her ring finger. Through your tears, she is someone you cannot recognize, bare-faced and broken.an actress who enters into a publicity-orchestrated relationship with an abusive man she doesn't love while the woman whom she's been in a long-term secret relationship loyally covers up the bruises he leaves is offered multiple chances to get away and doesn't because she likes the fame too much? that's a hard ask, reader-sympathy-wise. i understand how difficult it is to get out of an abusive relationship when there's an emotional attachment blinding the way out of it, but staying in a sham relationship as a calculated business decision, while shitting all over someone* who's demonstrably invested themselves to your well-being seems like the inevitable result of someone who's made their own shitty bed. am i saying she deserves to be abused? obviously not, but it's a price she's choosing to pay to keep her face on billboards, and since she's accepting the consequences of this 'relationship' for her own ambition, my sympathies are 100% wth the woman who's picking up her pieces back at their home, applying make-up to her lover with such abject devotion. this isn't presented as a harvey weinstein situation, where she was railroaded into something and her career would be jeopardized if she didn't comply; it's depicted as a publicist thinking it'd be cute and lucrative if two co-stars had an offscreen romance. there aren't any professional repercussions for backing out, so it comes across more selfish than sympathetic.

HOWEVER, i did finish it and i will say that neve is more appealing to me than her twinsie red, who was content to just drift along thru book one without doing anything or asking anything, dragging the reader along through hundreds of pages of easily-remedied ignorance. neve is far more proactive, and there was at least one time where i said ""oh my god badass"" out loud. because she was. super badass. it's still a romance-fantasy, which is still not my thing, but i'm glad i gave it another shot, because despite all the stuff i find a little silly, the story makes more sense, there are more answers, and it's certainly darker and creepier than For the Wolf when it's not busy being distracted by someone's cheekbones. *...speaking of pining, ...he tasted like cold, like the space between winter pine trees. this is where i dropped the book onto the floor and said ""no he fucking didn't."" and i apologize to the person i've promised this ARC to because now it's hella damaged.
