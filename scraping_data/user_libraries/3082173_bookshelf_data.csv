This was one of those community reads through the local library. Set during the time Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species” came out in 1859, the author included many historical figures (Darwin, Dickens, other prominent figures in London) to tell the story of assassination attempts on the life of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert – in particular Prince Albert. I loved all the historical events going on during that time and the historical figures – I even verified them through that process known as “googling”. There was some medical stuff in there too (we definitely have come a long way since then), some grave robbers (surgical medicine was in its infancy and did need some help), and there were those folks conspiring against Mr. Darwin and his ideas and anyone else who might give them credence. I loved our police detective, Robert Field – quite intuitive with just a tad bit of bungling – he finally does get his man and saves a few others including himself.

It sounded intriguing and I was able to get it from one of my online libraries.That being said, I really liked her writing style. It clicked with me on the first page. I also liked the way she chronicled the story. In the beginning I'm thinking the county sheriff's really bungled this one. Then it looked like it went higher up to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations. But then, Jax Miller investigated everything she possibly could to find out what really happened, went down every rabbit hole, thoroughly investigated the meth aspect - that sounded pretty plausible to me, interviewed every person she could find (even the really unsavory ones), she formed a bond with the families, and did everything she could to bring some closure to this case.I know there was a television documentary and it helped me to put a face to all the individuals involved.

This series is the “Children’s House” series and I am assuming that all of the crimes in this series are going to involve children of some age. That being said, I gloss over the gruesomeness of the crimes and focus on the clues and the procedures used by the police in solving the cases. This book involves teenagers, bullying – especially cyber-bullying, and the parents of those kids who bully and are being bullied. Detective Huldar seems to be the only policeman who can see beyond what’s put in front of him, but he’s still not well thought of within the department. His boss is reluctant to assign him to anything after what’s happened in the past (that’s why you’ve got to start at the beginning of this series), but she does relent a little bit. That's the only way this crime is solved. And, much as Huldar would love to have more of a personal relationship with Freyja, she’s not ready to let that happen.

It’s not so good on a marriage if the fathers don’t feel the same way.

It begins in 2004 when eight year old Vaka goes missing while waiting for her dad to pick her up after school. It turns out she has gone to the nearby home of a classmate. Sigrun, to call him – not knowing the classmate’s father is home, drunk, and not anyone you really want to meet. Fast forward to 2016 – a series of bizarre, gruesome killings has begun – but only after Sigrun’s father Jon Jonsson has been released from prison. Police detective Huldar and child psychologist Freyja are once again thrown together. Huldar no longer heads up any investigations having been demoted after the last case he worked on. He’s now been relegated to investigating a letter in a time capsule written by school children in 2006 saying six people will be killed in ten years – listed by initials only. Freyja is no longer held in high esteem either. Her last work with the police department didn’t turn out well. Once we’re brought up to speed as to why Huldar and Freyja are in their current positions doing what they’re doing, the author sucks you into the stories of the time capsule, two families destroyed by Jon Jonsson’s actions – his own and Vaka’s, bizarre killings, children falling through the cracks – no actually they’re intentionally pushed into them, bribing people in high places to look the other way, and then tying everything together so neatly in the end. Once again, Huldar and Freyja make a great team. Huldar has some amazing powers of perception in putting all the clues together. I didn’t give this author enough credit with her first book. She covers a lot of ground, comes up with a complicated plot, complicated people, and forces the reader to think.

Almost all the men are at sea when a freak storm comes up and sinks all the boats killing the men and leaving the women to fend for themselves. This is a time of superstition, a belief in witches, and gender specific roles for women. The women splinter off into different groups - and eventually one group is pitted against the other - those overly zealous religious ones and those who aren't. Then the accusations start.This book is based on actual events. The author does a fantastic job of describing life during this time period.

Francoise Malby-Anthony took over the running of Thula Thula when her husband Lawrence Anthony unexpectedly died in 2012. This book is her story of meeting Lawrence, moving to Africa (she’s French), and sharing his vision for protecting elephants and rhinos at their private game preserve. I’m not sure she realized what she was getting into when she decided to carry on Lawrence’s work after his death. It is such an incredible amount of work and she has worked hard to maintain the preserve. She doesn’t just run a lodge for visitors – she also maintains a wildlife rehab center which cares for orphaned animals. Her descriptions of the poaching – killing the elephants and rhinos for their horns – is heartbreaking.

It does start off with the author's love of books and libraries but quickly goes into the fire that destroyed the library in 1986. I love the way the book smoothly moves from the fire to the history of the library system in LA, its librarians, the impact the fire had on the community and what the library as a whole meant to the community. And who knew one library could hold so MUCH information about so MANY different things! The author does take us back throughout the book to finding out who started the fire, the trial, the people involved. But, even though this is a history of the LA library, it drives home the importance of libraries to our communities and how the role of libraries as a whole has changed since their inception.

John Snow was a doctor who didn't buy the bad air theory and through research of his own - along with help from Henry Whitehead - an Anglican priest - was able to debunk the bad air theory.What I liked most about this book were the descriptions of living conditions, social order, growth of cities, the rise of scientific method in determining cause and effect for cholera, changes in medical treatment, the building of the sewer system in London (thank goodness they figured that one out), the use of statistics, what the future holds as far as cities go - there was a lot of food for thought in this book.

She doesn't remember him - didn't even know he existed until now - because 16 years ago he was convicted of murdering one of his students, Winnie Maas, and ended up in a psychiatric hospital. Michaela goes missing, her father goes missing, a dead body turns up, the police chief seems to be hiding something - and Ewa Moreno cannot keep her nose out of the investigations.Nesser's plots are intriguing and I can tolerate a few discrepancies in translation so I'm off to find #9 in this series! ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 16, 2019","Aug 18, 2019","Sep 08, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19876040-the-weeping-girl
