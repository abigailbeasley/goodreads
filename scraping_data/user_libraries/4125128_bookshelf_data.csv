It's taut while not quite a thriller (we know what's going to happen).

He shows a Germany run by an insane man who attracted other insane men who wanted...what? What did they want? People knew Hitler was nuts but they were unwilling to take the measures that might have stopped him. They thought they might be able to finesse their way out of a confrontation and avoid plunging Europe again into war when the awful carnage of WWI was still fresh in their minds, an understandable collective case of PTSD. We can hardly blame them.

This is for westerners interested in a secular system of thought that provides a way to relate to the uncertainties of life without worrying about a vengeful God. While none of these ideas are unique to Buddhism, they were at the time of Siddhartha, the Budda, and they don't form the central core of belief of the Abrahamic religions. I'm thinking of Christianity and Islam, not Judaism. Christians and Muslims have God or Allah to answer to. The Jews are a lot more circumspect about defining the Deity. My impression is that they regard even talking about a Deity as presumptuous. That makes more sense to me. Now that science has disclosed just how immense and bizarre the universe actually is it seems the Jews got that one right, that is, presuming you believe in a deity at all.

To me this is a book about how our dominant culture, one created by Christian white men, is dangerous to our health. The founder of the Jesuits, St Ignatius of Loyola, was supposed to have said: “Give me a child until he is six and I will have him for the rest of his life.” It seems to me that HY does not like our male-dominated, Christian culture or the secular counterpart to it, psychiatry, with its debt to Freud, and illustrates her dislike by immersing her main character, Jude, in a male world of physical and sexual abuse that lasts from childhood all the way up until the age of not just six but sixteen! The novel asks if it is possible for this main character, or anyone else raised in similar circumstances, to overcome such a disastrous beginning to his life. And it suggests more troubling questions: Is Jude’s world all that different from what a lot of people endure? Is this, for one obvious example, the situation a lot of women have to live with, just a fact of their lives? Is our society abusive? Is mistreatment built in, sanctioned and promoted by a punitive, male-dominated religious culture, with its secular counterpart in psychiatry and psychology? Is there an enabling relationship between our religious culture and our exploitive economic system? Does this oppressive culture condemn so many of us to ""A Little Life""?The story is about Jude and three other friends: J.B., the artist; Malcolm, the architect; Willem, the actor. All are very smart, very talented, all graduates of a prestigious college like Harvard. All follow the careers they were leaning toward in school and succeed, with effort and setbacks, but nothing out of the ordinary reverses all people suffer. Jude becomes an outstanding litigator among New York City trial lawyers. Not bad. There is a backstory for all four friends but HY concentrates on one, Jude, who, as a foundling, is rescued and raised in a monastery by monks. There is a tantalizing moment where he almost gets adopted by a couple who seem normal, but they back out. That turns out to be fateful, a way out denied, a turning point for Jude. He is stuck with the monks, many of whom are sadists who beat him and abuse him sexually. One of the abusers, Brother Luke, induces Jude to trust him and then escape the monastery with him, promising relief from his ordeal, but Luke turns out to be an even more evil abuser than the others were. Luke uses him to make money by pimping him out to other men on an interminable road trip with a promised end that never materializes until they are discovered. Luke hangs himself rather than be caught by the police, and Jude is sent to a youth detention center from which he escapes only to be picked up by another monster, the psychiatrist, Dr. Traylor, who subjects him to more harrowing experiences that end with Traylor almost killing him. All by the time Jude is sixteen. Then he gets a break and gains admittance to a prestigious university where he meets the three friends, the law professor and the doctor, all of whom try, heroically, to help him heal, mentally and physically, a process that goes on throughout the novel, but their efforts fail.Jude deals with his general psychic pain by substituting a specific physical one--cutting himself, a remedy he learns from Brother Luke. 'Irony' is not the right word to describe Luke's suggestion of cutting as a palliative while he continues to be the instigator of Jude's abuse, a major source of his psychic pain. Maybe a phrase like 'moral idiocy,' or 'evil,' if that's not too general, is more apt as Luke knows what he is doing and does it anyway. Or maybe he’s just an unscrupulous businessman. He’s in it for the money and leaves it to Jude to deal with his torment in a concentrated way, at the point of a razor’s edge, repeatedly and gruesomely. Empathy is not this religious order’s member’s strong point. It’s not our acquisitive society’s either. Christian teaching stresses man’s inherent predisposition to sin, the result of Adam’s fall. Freudian theory has a secular counterpart in the Id, that festering source of socially unacceptable urges, the great contrarian inside all of us. We are fallen creatures, driven by our flawed natures. So, they tell us, we’re set up to do bad things. It’s hard-wired and can’t be remedied. That’s why, we are told, we need guidance, instruction, and, when appropriate and it often is, punishment. But the wrongs imposed on Jude don’t result from anything he’s done. They are imposed from outside, from this same religious culture. They don’t spring from anything inside him. He thinks he’s bad because the men in charge have told him he is. He escapes his insane world at sixteen, badly damaged but expected by society to be a functional adult. And he succeeds at this. However (Isn’t this always the case?) none of the material comforts offered by success in our culture can make up for the mental harm this same culture imposed on him during his formative years. Nothing else helps, either. Not inborn ability. Jude’s intellect turns out to be irrelevant, perhaps even a handicap. He can’t stop remembering. Not education. His Ivy League experience is very important in training his superior brain but no help in dealing with emotional harm. Sex doesn’t help. In fact, sex doesn’t figure all that much in this story, aside from its aberrant expression. Jude has an understandable aversion to it. Neither does Jude’s choice of career matter. Success as a litigator is not the pathway to mental well-being for him. It makes him rich but that’s all, though it’s nice to live in a fine place and Jude enjoys his magnificent New York apartment, redone by Malcolm, the architect, and his spectacular retreat home in the country, also done by Malcolm. Wealth makes a lot of things that money can buy readily available but none of those make a difference. Not even the extraordinary friendship of Willem, of Jude's adoptive parents, Harold and Julia, the good doctor, Andy, or his numerous other friends is strong enough to overcome the malevolence he absorbed during his first sixteen years. No material rewards, no remedy or theory of healing or course of therapy can make up for the nightmare that was imposed on him. This culture, for the most part, doesn't understand the results of its own malevolence and ignores or misunderstands the causes. Material success; that's how we measure merit. Get rich. That's the ticket to happiness. Most people know that isn't true, but try to change it and you're asking for trouble. In an interview HY said she thought everything in the book was “turned up a little too high.” She does exaggerate to make her points, and one I took her to be making is that it's easier and suspiciously convenient to explain the power of evil if you think its presence is an inherent fact of our being, something that needs to be controlled. That's an idea thought up by men interested in exercising power over others, no matter how they try to disguise their intentions by cloaking them in religious cant.Looked at coldly, this whole “fallen nature” story of man ought to be regarded as ludicrous, ridiculous. How could we ever have ceded so much power to the “religious” people who sold us this nonsense? Maybe we did because of ignorance but that’s no longer the case, thanks to the rise of science.HY doesn’t advance any solution except to identify the problem. It ought to be enough. She does indicate a much better way to understand our world and that’s science, the study of reality, raised to the level organized religion occupies now. It’s already happening. Seeing things as they are without veils of superstition, fear or illusion—isn’t that what thinkers in uncorrupted religious and secular systems of thought talk about? That will invite the fierce opposition of entrenched power. It’s going to be a difficult struggle but now the planet is at risk. The world we encounter in this novel has been created by men—males-- and it isn’t working, not even for the men in charge. There is an unmentioned parallel course in human development that has also occurred and pre-dates the one we are used to: that’s evolution, of course, our origin in the world of other living things. In that world there is no ""fall,"" and females matter as much as males. I understand HY to be saying it’s time we ditched the male version we’ve lived under for millennia, the one in which females are discounted. Look where that’s gotten us. There’s another, saner way to understand ourselves and it’s a lot better, by half.Many s comment on how intense this novel is and yet there is almost no graphic description of sexual abuse and the occurrences of cutting, while very unpleasant, would be a lot more graphic in the hands of a less gifted writer. She uses both sides of her brain and the effect is chilling without descending into the pornography of violence. How does she do that? Her writing is so accomplished that many passages have something that approaches musical logic in the way they conclude, the last words having the same inevitability of the final chords of a musical composition. And she does that over and over again. And she has interesting, left-side thoughts about a lot of things, law, for example, or parenthood, and many more. She’s a very good thinker and a superior writer. There’s a line in a Bob Dylan song that goes: “Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine.” HY is right there in this impressive novel. She’s right there, right on that edge.P.S. I didn't comment on what I thought HY's view on sexuality might be as it is such a complicated subject. However, I suspect HY thinks all of us are on a bell curve of sexuality with same-sex on one extreme and hetero-sex on the other. I suspect she would say most of us are grouped somewhere in the middle with very few at the extremes. Maybe someday labels like ""gay"" or ""straight"" will seem irrelevant, anachronistic. We will reject the labels made up by this same group of mostly men in the organized religious doctrines that still dominate mainstream culture. No one will give a damn anymore what a person's orientation is, and sex will take its place without the boldface and italics of sin and shame we have now, and all the damage that's done to so many people, to be regarded, finally, as another in the important list of human traits that make up everyone's identity. We'll work out a balance ourselves. I'm thinking of the final lines of Blake's The Garden of Love: ""And Priests in black gowns were walking their rounds/ And binding with briars my joys and desires."" We won't need those guys anymore....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 17, 2017","Apr 27, 2017","Mar 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22822858-a-little-life

IThis is a novel about self-absorption, delusion, and about how emotions have a lot more to do with who we are and how we act than our intellects do. I thought it was at the center of Donna Tartt’s The Secret History, which also features a lot of real smart people who have no idea of who they are or why they do what they do.Teddy Wayne does a very good job of creating his self absorbed character, David, and shows how his actions are motivated by his feelings and have almost nothing to do with his intellect, of which David is intensely proud. David is unaware of what impels him, and unawareness is one large marker for stupidity as a functional matter, having little to do with IQ. David's unawareness, a consequence of his self-absorption, is his ruin. It causes this very bright young man to do spectacularly dumb things. The novel takes place at Harvard, which most people think of as a beacon of education, of reasoned inquiry. The word education has its root in Latin and means “a breeding, a rearing,” and is related to the homonym “educo,” from “e” or “out of” and “duco, “I lead, I conduct.” (Wikipedia) So it has a larger meaning. But to lead out of what? Isn’t the answer, ourselves? Isn't education a means of getting out of ourselves and into the world, the world of other things and other people? It’s a notion as foreign to self-absorption as it can get, and David, like most of the rest of us, is going to have to learn this lesson the hard way. He still hasn’t gotten a start on this journey at novel’s end. If fact, he doesn’t yet know there is a journey for him to take but he will have to realize that if he ever wants to get better. It’s the only way to lead a real life, and, more importantly, to stop hurting other people. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 31, 2016",Nov 2016,"Oct 31, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27276325-loner

I suppose I was expecting less from the earlier work, this one, since we are supposed to get better as we go along, but maybe that’s not true about novel writing. It has an unusual point of view, something I didn’t catch on to until late in the novel. I’m not sure what to call it. It’s 2nd person, sort of, but different in that he is describing the actions of everyone, including himself, as if being observed by himself. Earlier he describes himself when younger as observing himself as he was doing whatever he was doing and wondering if others did that too. So it’s “You did this and did that, and she did this and then you said…” etc, but you never think he means anyone else but himself. 2nd person narration is supposed to bring the reader into the story but you never think of yourself, at least I didn’t, when he talks about “you” in this novel. I’m not sure I’ve ever run into that before and am not even sure if that is a variation on 1st person tricked up as 2nd person narrative style but I liked it. The novel is funny, clever, affecting. The pace is nicely taut and stays that way throughout. It’s not sentimental. He’s invented some very good characters, all of them, some likable, like his mother, Vickie and Megan, and others that are interesting though less likeable. He makes them all believable.

I wondered throughout the book how it appeared Russo thought we should be regarding his very difficult character, Sully. His name lives up to his actions since he sullies everything he comes in contact with: people, animals, places, things. He is hard on everything but Russo supplies us with a reason. His father was an arrogant, bullying, drunken moron, an actively aggressive, violent SOB. In death he still dominates his son's actions, but not completely. Instead of being actively aggressive Sully is passively aggressive. He's good at needling, jabbing, evading, provoking. So, isn't there any pushback from the other characters? Oddly, not very much. I think Russo thinks this guy is sympathetic. I might think so too if he was trying to confront his problems, or at least be more aware of them than he appears to be, and grapple with them in some way, even if his efforts didn't work. That would have made a different story, of course, but at least it would not be asking us to have sympathy for someone too self-absorbed to be sympathetic. Russo's other cast of characters take on an artificial role, functioning as supporting actors and enablers who mysteriously put up with this extended nonsense from Sully that would get anyone like him decked regularly in the real world. This novel is an elaborate fantasy, Russo's very cliched and sentimental version of the all-American anti-hero, funny, irreverent, iconoclastic, he'd like us to think. (I liked Paul Newman and I guess he played Sully in the movie. I'm glad I didn't see it because I might have had more sympathy with a character who appears to lack any of Newman's sense of irony about himself.) Sully doesn't appear to understand or care about the unpleasantness he spreads to just about everyone who has anything to do with him. So is Sully the rebel who bravely rejects the values of a culture he doesn't like and to hell with the consequences for himself, or a man who's still infuriated by the actions of his long-dead father and acts out his rage against others, often with deliberate cruelty? I don't think you can have it both ways, but Russo seems to want to. He's the ultimate enabler. The novel seems to me to be way too calculated. We're being manipulated. I suppose all novels do this, but there's a falseness about this one. Unless he's a cynic who likes to exploit his readers I don't think Russo understood the idea behind this novel clearly. He seems to want to reconcile a duality that can't be reconciled and that makes the manipulation apparent. Sully is a fake hero. He's not as bad as the worst male jerk I've read about lately, the main character (forgot his name) in Christina Stead's remarkable novel, THE MAN WHO LOVED CHILDREN, but he's in the ballpark. Sully is a different kind of jerk but they do have one thing in common: neither of them is funny....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 05, 2016","Aug 15, 2016","Aug 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/659388.Nobody_s_Fool

It isn't the Taliban or ISIS or Al Queda or any other branch of lethal religionists that is the most serious and immediate threat to us. That threat is posed by the radical right in this country, lavishly funded by billionaires who don't understand that greed is not good. (One interesting thing I learned: the income tax originally was aimed at the rich, the class that had been most rewarded by the system and could afford it with the least pain.) Preeminent among these people are the Koch brothers. Reading about them you will be reminded that they possess the traits the psychological community identifies as psychopathic. These guys are intelligent crackpots. They want to take over the country and Mayer documents how close they are to achieving their goal. If they do get their way it's goodbye to social security, medicare, efforts to address environmental concerns, and other forms of progressive legislation that seek to take some of the existential dread out of the lives of everyone who isn't rich. They're waging a zero-sum fight. If progressive forces continue to lose ground, the radical right will consolidate their already strong position and the deck will get even more stacked in favor of the rich. Ordinary citizens will have to do what they say, and take what they give them, which won't be much.

Best to be clear-eyed about it. Pfeffer likes virtue but recognizes it does not prevail a good part of the time. I'm not sure what the percentage is but close to 50% of the time it doesn't. Be clear-eyed and realistic, he says. And even though you will be disappointed at the venality of lots of practices in the business world a better strategy is to see them clearly, and that means giving up illusions, always a good strategy.

He comments on everything, has opinions about everything, wants to argue about everything. It gets tiresome after a while.

Chomsky seems to me to be saying: forget ideologies, institutional religions with their fantastic theologies (my notion, not Chomsky's), political theories, etc, as drivers. What matters is power: who has it and how is it used. That's it. There is an old sort-of joke that says that Christianity and Communism are two good ideas that have never been tried. Other stuff-- theories, models for political organization, etc.--all boils down to who gets how much of what. Tough guys win a good deal of the time because they are willing to do what more reasonable people aren't, that is, kill their enemies or at least make their lives miserable. Chomsky is saying we need to recognize the monster and then maybe we can do something about it. But we have to recognize the real enemy.

It's a very good assemblage of evidence that shows that climate change is a real and very present danger. Klein's argument should persuade anyone not stuck in idealogical delusion that we had better address this problem and we had better hurry up about it. I wonder if it will take the catastrophe that looms ever nearer with insufficient preventive action. We need change, real change, in our habits. Or else. Are we an addicted nation? We are told that consumer buying accounts for about 60% of GNP. Can we stop our runaway capitalism that has us on a buy or die track? We either knock this off or get knocked off and there is a comparatively easy alternative that promises a stabilized climate and a much better life for more people. Capitalism of the sort we have now has run its course. We could plead ignorance of the consequences of runaway consumerism before. Not any longer. I'm not happy to see our violent weather but I'm glad that change is happening much faster than people generally predicted. We have now more violent winter weather followed by more violent spring weather. Now we are having more violent summer weather. All from a two or three degree change in average temperature. A degree or two more and predictive computer models are no help. We don't know what might happen. But we know it will be bad. Very bad. I'm glad she sees signs of hope. She makes a compelling case that there is time, but only if we act now. The earth is not ours to use as we please. It never was.

Madrick doesn't like Friedman, either. The whole agenda of this group, ascendant since Reagan's election, was just what the Republicans had been waiting for, supplying the scholarly foundation for the very nasty policies the R's are so fond of promoting. I hope one day Reagan will be regarded as a disastrous president, one who set our country on a path that threatens everything from our economy to our civil discourse. No wonder so many of us are so frightened and angry and yet we keep electing the politicians who want to make it worse. Idealogy rules.

This made them rebels and outcasts to the mainstream of the culture they wanted to leave and a curiousity to the black culture they were so eager to join. All these women, and there were a lot of them, were collectively and individually referred to as ""Miss Anne"" by the black men and women in Harlem they so admired.

It's wonderful satire on bureaucratic minds working in a relentlessly bureaucratic agency.

It's a form of insanity.

Just one example: the event that sets the story in action lacks the seriousness you would think would have to be there to merit the reaction of the main characters, especially the Harvard-educated (why do so many characters in fiction go to Harvard?) Jim. Nevertheless the family puts this kid through a legal wringer which could have threatened to, at the very least, badly handicap his making his way in the world. It seemed to me to be a grossly exaggerated response to what amounted to an adolescent prank.

I found the book hard to put down, thought all the characters were interesting and had my sympathy, even the apparently cold Gauri, and wanted things to turn out right although the central event in this moving story makes that impossible. It's a terrific novel about splits: cultural contrasts between the US and India, personality differences between the two brothers, one being more reserved, the other impulsive; the intellectual and emotional, especially in the wife, Gauri, an intellectual who discovers a passion for philosophy; the economic split between the haves and have-nots that pruduces the turmoil that still afflicts present-day India and brings about the central tragic event that unifies and separates the main characters; the power of love and the blessing extending it provides and the tragedy that ensues when it is withheld.

I admit my bias. Democrats genThis is a good study of how conservatives have taken over the Republican party and the methods they have used to do it. I admit my bias. Democrats generally want to do things, to take measures that in the tug-of-war between liberty and justice means intervening to restrain laissez-faire capitalism . That means government taking a more active role in the economy and that's accomplished with regulation, oversight and taxation. Republicans and Libertarians, generally speaking, don't like that. Their approach is essentially negative and passive. They say leave us alone and let the market sort it out. It has built-in mechanisms that in the long run will more or less correct any imbalances that might affect the stability of society generally. Liberals don't believe that works, and I think they think the Republicans know it, too. Democrats think their job is to restrain runaway capitalism for the greater good. Disaster happens in a grand version of the ""tragedy of the commons"" if the Republicans have their way. It seems to me the evidence for this is overwhelming but that message has not gotten through to, in this case, the citizens of Kansas who continue to vote for a political party whose policies won't help them, and for others around the country who do the same thing. Since Republicans don't like change and don't want government to do anything, they resort to distracting voters with issues like family values and other abstractions that have nothing to do with anything that makes a difference. It helps them appear, to too many people, as defenders of virtues Americans hold dear. In his book, This Town, Mark Leibovich says that a lot of Washington politicians think the voters are stupid. Thomas Frank, in this very good book, is trying to wake us up, to exhort us to pay attention to where our real interests lie and to support politicians who want to create a more just society.

First, Tartt is a very good, very assured writer with a good voice and rhythm in her sentences. The dialogue is good, too. It's a coming of mental age book for the narrator, Richard, who begins as an impressionable kid from a poor family in rural California, a trap his academic ability is able to get him away from by way of a scholarship to a small college in New England, modeled on Bennington I understand. There he meets a small group of very intellectual people studying the classics in the original Homeric Greek. Very impressive to Richard who is happy to learn that he can keep up with them in the language, since he has studied it before, though he is not nearly as accomplished in the classics as they are. Tartt does a wonderful job of skewering intellectual snobbery and pretension by showing how emotions rule each person's world, not that person's intellect. Since we can't put words to emotions, or do it accurately or comprehensively, we tend to attach way too much importance to the thinking we do with words. Emotions are much trickier to get a handle on but I think Tartt is saying they are our real drivers. These very smart young people from wealthy families drink and smoke ALL THE TIME. That can't be an accident. Both serve to keep under unspoken control warring but unrecognized emotions. Those can't be suppressed forever, of course, and end up emerging, exposing the carefully guarded and all too human frailties these privileged and brainy young people thought their cleverness protected them from. The exception is Richard who at first is overly impressed with them, his very clever fellow students in this especially demanding and obscure field of study. At first, Richard doesn't realize how smart he really is. He slowly comes to himself and ends up as the only real survivor in the group when their fragile, it turns out, world collapses. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 03, 2014","Feb 03, 2014","Feb 03, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29044.The_Secret_History

To me it is a novel about contingency and how we all might have lived utterly different lives if we had not stopped to tie our shoes so we missed being run over by the drunk driver, etc. Our lives are a series of forks in a road that keeps on forking (sorry) but multiplied by the multitudes of others confronting the same accidents and ""choices"" as we move blindly this way and not that, go here, not there, meet this person, not that one; in the wonderful English phrase, ""muddling through, somehow."" The main character, Ursula, has a preternatural awareness of this possibility that she experiences as premonitions but not developed as a conscious theme for her. Except to say, as she does, that she suspects life is a like a palimpsest more than anything else: not repetition and not a linear path. It's as far from the idea of predestination as you can get. We stumble ahead, doing what seems reasonable at the time, but with wildly different outcomes, and with accident and chance that can and do change our lives profoundly always looming and completely beyond our control. Atkinson guides us through a selection of possible lives for her Ursula, a wonderfully attractive character and does it beautifully. Her novel is an argument for being here, for experiencing life in the here and now as carefully, thoughtfully and watchfully as we can, not just because Buddhists (and others) tell us to do this but because this is the best way to increase our odds of living a good and long life. Unfortunately there is only so much we can do. Accident intervenes, outside events, and the world is inhabited by too many people who live in their own worlds and mistake those worlds for reality and through whatever accidents of history are able to impose that view on others. It's hard to to think of anyone who was able to do that with as much destructive effect than Hitler. Maybe Stalin, Mao, Napoleon and a few others. I liked the way she enlarged the scope of this book to include, in one alternate scenario, a tour of the continent for Ursula which winds her up in Germany where she meets Eva Braun. This is in the early 1930's. So she gets to observe Hitler, a nice touch. I so much liked her take on him, as being an essentially silly man, as were his closest aides. Psychotics, yes, but that is just a label. What distinguishes them? Atkinson suggests a basic, emotional childishness about them which, in an adult, is a form of stupidity. Maybe that is all evil is, a form of stupidity in action, but with Hitler and aided by history, elevated to the profoundly stupid--an absence of mindfulness. Maybe we need a new definition of evil to combat it effectively. No devils, no predilection to sin. Just ignorance, emotional starvation and atrophy that results in the unfinished person. If my memory serves she alludes, in a sideways way, to the observation, I guess by Burke, that the only requirement for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing. Good people, good Germans, recognized Hitler’s menace and its nature, One or two tried to kill him, but, contingency again, were unsuccessful. Too many others did nothing until it was too late to prevent catastrophe. Ursula speculates what a different world we might have had if Hitler had been stopped. In our own time we might ask what would have happened if President Kennedy had ducked his head, or sneezed, or leaned over to try to hear what Jackie was saying. Would there have been a Vietnam War? If this had happened, if that had not happened, all the very possible alternatives that are always there and all our lives could have been completely different, or we could have been killed, or died, or very happy or terribly unhappy. All possible outcomes and all happen to Ursula in this engrossing novel of “could just as easily have been.”Atkinson is wonderful in her description of her very English family. They are different from us in that they seem much more psychologically hands-off with their children than a lot of Americans. No one sits Maurice down and tells him to be nicer to people. They don’t seem to like him all that much but they treat him well, they hope for the best, but his temperament is his and no one tries to change it. Maybe that is why eccentrics seem to thrive there. They are tolerated. So we get Maurice, but we also get Izzy, the dotty, wonderful aunt. Also wonderful are her portraits of an English family with all the danger to it from war, illness, chance, the absence of modern medicine. It wears Sylvie, the mother, down until she can't bear it any longer. And Atkinson does riveting descriptions of London under the Blitz, Ursula’s experience(s) in Germany, and others.We all have to die. But that’s it. There is nothing inevitable about anything else, ever, until it happens, and mindfulness can increase our chances for a better outcome if that prevails and a worse one, sometimes much worse, if it doesn’t.The novel ends, I suppose, happily, but on a balance scale, maybe 51/49, just barely. We inch forward, each generation, precariously, but there is no guarantee. And we could do so much better!P.S. I like the way Atkinson handles ""death."" It seems to me there is no such thing. We are all in the world of light. Death, as I imagine it (illogically), is oblivion. There is dying, yes, but not death itself. All the deaths in this wonderful novel occur as a descending of darkness. So, really, though we all regret and fear ""the dying of the light,"" there is no such thing as ""experiencing death."" It's a contradiction in terms. Yeats has a poem about it called DEATH. Just because Yeats says it doesn't mean it's true but he says, in this poem, in the last line: ""Man has created Death."" We certainly have done that, in spades, haven't we.All hail to Kate Atkinson, on her profound, beautiful and moving novel!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 18, 2013","Aug 27, 2013","Aug 18, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790842-life-after-life

That hasn't happened yet but Kate Atkinson comes close. She contrives intricate plots that require the reader's sustained attention and I tend to be a sporadic reader, reading maybe 50 or fewer pages at a time. That is not so good with a complicated writer like Atkinson and my comprehension of this novel is not what it might have been had I been more attentive. I'm going to try to remedy that with her next book that I just started, LIFE AFTER LIFE. I'll read her other work but If I had known how much I was going to like her I would have started at the beginning and read them in order. I should have trusted Hilary Mantel's recommendation. Atkinson is wonderfully clever and funny. She tells an interesting story but her moral presence is always there. STARTED EARLY...is a detective story with all the usual twists and turns but it's also about the banality of evil, the awful things people are willing to do to cover up their own, guilty sins or just get what they want. It's also about accident, the contingencies of life, how the unexpected and unpredictable govern our lives so much more than we imagine. We are not in control. Life is too complicated for that, something it takes humility to understand. If we did we would save ourselves and each other a lot of trouble. Atkinson sees that and makes us see it too, clearly and with power. I like that in a writer.

McCann appears to see Petit's feat as a theme. It was a remarkable display of nerve, skill and Petit’s courage and ability to focus--an impressive array of traits. If there is a significance in this that is supposed to extend to his characters we would have to see it in them, somehow, wouldn’t we, but they seem oddly one dimensional and ordinary to me, some brought up briefly, then dropped, as the guy who hit the priest’s car, talks himself out of any responsibility for the accident, and then-–poof--he’s gone from the story. There are other examples of characters that appear briefly but don't seem to have any function in this story. They are there one page and gone the next.Much of the action takes place in the south Bronx, a virtual war zone in the 1970's. So many of the people living there were reduced to being outlaws--prostitutes here-–if they wanted to stay alive. Moving among them, a main character, is a good-hearted member of a Catholic religious order who is there for them, supplying a safe house and haven for a few of them in their dangerous lives. That is all to the good though there is something too bland about him that prevents him from being more interesting. He means well, I guess. Though it would be easy to do, I don't think McCann intends to satirize his role of the religious man trying to make a difference in a brutal environment although it's easy to get political about this character. His institution, the Catholic church, is part of the problem. It accepts our ""fallen"" nature as normal. That's part of their basic doctrine. William Blake tells us, in a paraphrase, ""and Misery's increase/ Is Mercy, Pity, Peace."" We don't need the virtues without the context of misery. Sadly, instead of trying to get rid of misery we think it's sufficient to comfort people, or be nice or to try to help. The priest is an agent for good in an evil world but it's an ineffectual agency. Also, McCann spends too much time over the priest's agonizing about whether or not to have sex with his woman friend. We would expect him to display at least one or two of Petit's virtues, but no, he doesn't. And McCann really shouldn't try to talk like black people. He has an average ear at best. That kind of zesty, irreverent, clever, jive talk is hard to replicate. I don’t think he does it well enough. But it’s McCann's own voice that really gets me. I have a few examples of his vague and aphoristic style from a book that is crammed with them. He makes statements like, “If you think you know all the secrets, you think you know all the cures.” Please, what does that mean? If you are a generous reader you will find yourself saying, well what he means is.... and then you will supply your own interpretation. But it seems to me it’s the author who is supposed to do that. He wants us to supply his meaning for him. He keeps tossing the ball back to the reader. Here, you make sense of this.Another: “So much of it was about the old cure of forgetting. To become anonymous to himself, have his own body absorb him. And yet, there were overlapping realities: he also wanted his mind to be in that place where his body was at ease.” What does the “it” refer to? Is forgetting a cure? For what? To become anonymous to himself... is that possible? He knows who he is. Have his own body absorb him? What does that mean? And he follows that up with “and yet...” but he hasn’t said anything specific enough for a phrase like “and yet” to get us ready for the conclusory thought he is about to thrust at us. What is that thought? That there are “overlapping realities(plural)–the desire to be where his body was at ease (singular). What realities? Where? Overlapping? What the heck is this supposed to mean? It takes nerve to be this vague and it happens over and over.How about “It was so much like having sex with the wind.” Not just “like” but “so much like.” So there is a shade of meaning here he wants to call our attention to. And “having sex with the wind?” Really? What is that like? What about wind chill?Another one: “A grave does not equal what we have had in our lifetime.” What does that mean? Does it make sense as an observation? Not to me. To me, it's ridiculousness uttered with a straight face. Why does he expect people to read this and then puzzle out what it probably “means?”“Goodness was more difficult than evil. Evil men knew that more than good men. That’s why they became evil.” Come one. This is a silly, empty statement, pretentiousness stretched to the absurd. About New York he says, “Things happened because it was a city uninterested in history...Strange things (!) occurred precisely because there was no necessary regard for the past.” This is nonsense. A city is not an entity that is “interested” in anything. Strange things (what things?) occurred “precisely"" because there is no “necessary” regard for the past. “Precisely” and “necessary” being words intended to alert us to what McCann appears to regard as a trenchant view, though the view itself is obscure. What is he talking about?It seems to me that readers have the right to assume that the author has something specific in mind. His sentences have the obligation to convey at least one meaning on the surface, and maybe a figurative one as well if that is the writer’s intent. But too many of McCann's sentences fail this basic test. Too many of them convey nothing unless and until the generous reader steps in and supplies the meaning it was the author’s task to provide. It’s not all bad. But there is too much baloney to make up for some of the things he did passably well. I mean, this guy got the National Book Award for this. I’m still scratching my head on that one. This book, to me, is an example of the novelist as con man, and this from an academic. I think McCann is worse than Richard Ford who pulls this kind of stuff, too.Even the title is pretentious, as if he is saying we must take our world as it is with all its tragedy. It appears to accept life as we know it now with no anger at our lost and wasted potential. It's passive, in line with what I suspect is McCann's Catholic, stoic view. We sinned. This is the result. So back to Petit for a moment. Do any of the characters in this book display any of the qualities that Petit displayed? I didn't think so. Is that the point? That our modern culture is so corrupted that we need feats like Petit's to remind us of them? I don't think that either. Well then maybe McCann is a fatalist and embraces our fallen world. A lot of us don't and want to see it improved. In this respect it is a very conservative book, aside from being a very muddled one. We can't really tell what McCann thinks. But a novelist is supposed to have a point of view that he uses his art to express. McCann doesn't. He won't tell us what he thinks. One er was upset because it did not make the list for consideration by the Booker Prize committee but I can see why. I would be upset if it had. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jul 09, 2013","Jul 09, 2013","Jul 09, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

It's about young Japanese women coming over to America to marry other Japanese men they have never met. It's about their bravery, imaginations and expectations and how those were blasted by the brutal reality of their lives once they reached our shores. It is hard for me to imagine how most of us, no matter how challenged our circumstances might be, would be able to cope with the nastiness of the lives these women were subjected to after their arrival. I remember SLAMMERKIN, Emma Donoghue's novel about a talented but lower class girl in mid-18th century Britain, and thinking how very very difficult life was in those days but especially for young girls unfortunate enough to be born in the lower classes. It makes one wonder if much has changed since then for the underclasses of the world, especially for women. The book ends with the relocation of west coast Japanese to internment camps after the beginning of World War II.

This is a story about a girl growing up on an island off the Maine coast. The inhabitants are lobster fishermen. There is a second island close by so naturally there is conflict between the two, and resulting sabotage of each other's traps and encroachment on each other's fishing territory. We learn how tough it is to make a living fishing for lobsters but part of the toughness results from the unnecessary conflict and competition that arises between the two groups of islanders. The main character, Ruth, is a very smart girl who decides to stay on her island though it is hard to see why. The work is hard, the weather is bleak, and the people seem to love hating each other. The book is also about how the latest wave of the women's movement is probably the best thing that has ever happened to men. It promises to save us from ourselves and, by extension, the world, by preventing a descent into a global tragedy of the commons. Can we stop ourselves in time? If we can I think it will because of the civilizing influence of women with brains and sense and a clearer vision of what's important than we men seem to have.

I was disappointed because I thought the end of the story was contrived and brought up more questions than it answered. It has a European fatalism, a conviction that nothing is going to turn out right. Sometimes I wonder if this is the ""sophisticated"" European's idea of romanticism expressed as a belief that everything, basically, stinks, and we're not going to get what we want, not a goddamn thing, and that's just the way it is. I guess it's a nice idea to compare prime numbers to our isolation from each other. We're stuck inside our skulls and we can't get out. That's the bad news. The good news is that it allows each of us to become ourselves and achieve some kind of singularity. Finding a kindred soul is the best we can hope for but that does happen. At least I'm persuaded that it does. Alice and Mattia seem like kindred souls and they get separated by circumstance. Bad stuff happens in each of their lives: her accident, and resulting lameness and difficulties with her parents; and his abandoning his ""identical"" sister, though they are not identical, separated by gender and mental ability, and his guilt over that. And then he moves to pursue his academic career. But Alice takes a risk and sends him a card. He responds immediately. (I'll leave out reasons for the note for readers who haven't read the book and maybe they should stop reading here.) The upshot is that they have an opportunity to get back together if they want to. And at first it seems they do. But then each begins an interior rumination in which each is persuaded that what they had is long gone. Just a memory. They are different people now, each says, and end up talking themselves out of a shot at happiness and going back to their bleak lives with partners they either don't know or don't like. And this after passages talking about a thread that has always been there, connecting them even while they were separated. But they decide, no, it's hopeless. Paolo, why not a more satisfying and optimistic ending which was within your grasp though it would have taken a longer novel to settle the unresolved questions I mentioned earlier. That would have made you a target for people accusing you of sentimentality. Instead, we get sentimentality the other way. We get gloom.

He seems to me to be a social and political historian with a novelist's imagination and a first-rate ability to show how the climate of an era, as expressed in particular times and places, shapes the lives of the characters in his complicated and wonderfully rendered stories. THE BOOK OF DANIEL is his accouunt of the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg episode in post World War II America, and how the paranoia of our culture forced the government to go ahead with what Doctorow says was a trumped-up charge against the Rosenbergs for stealing atomic secrets and giving them to the Soviets. It shows how the machinery of government, once focused on someone, can make their lives a living hell, or end them, as it did the Rosenbergs' who were both electrocuted after what amounted to a show trial. But this wide scope is reduced to an intense tale of the Rosenberg family--named Isaacson in the book--and how the trial utterly destroyed them and how they would have been destroyed even if the nonsense case against them had been dropped or if they had been found not guilty. There is another book about the history of secrecy and surveillance in 20th century America, Jay Feldman's MANUFACTURING HYSTERIA, a very good book about how fear and ignorance, displayed on a government level and with government resources, can bring ruin to whole classes of people. There are a lot of books like Doctorow's and Feldman's. Read them and you will come away with a much more sober and ominous view of our recent history. We are lucky, perhaps extremely lucky, to have survived as a nation that likes to think of itself as a free country.

It shows how various conservative interest groups got organized in the late 1970's and how very successful they were in pushing the Republican party far to the right of where it used to be, so much so that more moderate Republicans of the past, people like Eisenhower and others, would hardly recognize it as the party they once belonged to. It's also a good explanation of why these conservative groups think the way they do. They believe the first function of government is to protect the interests of property owners. It also shows how gerrymandering has created safe seats for most incumbents, so much so that any wavering from the conservative line, any sign of bi-partison cooperation with the Obama administration, is likely to bring a challenge from angry conservatives to the office holder in the next primary. They need to oppose anything--anything--the Democrats propose, again to avoid the appearance of being insufficiently unwavering in their opposition. We learn how the filibuster has become a very effective way to block any legislation the Republicans oppose. And a lot of other things. I came away from this book with a new appreciation of just how difficult it is to get anything passed in this toxic atmosphere and how easy it is for the opposition to obstruct or block any measure it opposes. It's a sobering look at our disfunctional government. These conservatives mean business. Unrestrained, free-market capitalism is what they want and if they win this battle we can say goodbye to any kind of state in which the government plays any moderating role in our national life.

THE ZERO is one of the laziest novels I have read. The protagonist shot himself while drunk. While not debilitating it was serious enough to disrupt his memory. So he is not responsible for telling us about himself, but he is such a hot shot that some CIA-type agency wants him to help in hunting down Al_Queda-type terrorists, 9/11 people, though he doesn't know what they want him to do and when he asks, others jump in, conveniently, to complete the questions for him they didn't let him finish. They make fantastic allowances for him. I guess Mr. Walter thinks this is a comic touch. He has sex whenever he feels like it, but he is always drunk so he doesn't remember it. It isn't described, either, of course. Walter thus avoids the ""bad sex writing award"" now, I think, held by Jonathan Franzen. THE FINANCIAL LIVES OF POETS is about a guy, who, in Sarah Vowell's good book blurb, makes several ""seriously stupid"" mistakes. She softens that in the rest of the blurb but it's a spot-on observation. Matt's self-indulgence makes him do stupid things. He's an irresponsible extended adolescent, but there is no irony here. Walter isn't making fun of Matt. I think he LIKES him. Why?This book is not about contemporary America at all. It isn't about our culture, despite Matt's incoherent rants. His ""epiphanies"" often don't make sense, even at the level of ordinary language.None of the characters is drawn so we can see or hear them clearly.
