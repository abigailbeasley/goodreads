Having enjoyed The Idiot (with a few caveats), I had hopes that Either/Or would build on my appreciation for Batuman’s writing and the world she was building around Selin. That didn’t happen. The first 2/3 of the novel was aimless wallowing over the events of the previous book. The self-reflections droned on and the pace became infuriating. In the last third of the book, Selin makes choices that – to me – don’t match her character. Nor do they open the door to some unexplored territory of her mind. They just happen, with the same meaninglessness as her other anecdotes. I suppose there’s value in a character that doesn’t fit the reader’s mold, but it all felt out of place. Batuman’s a fantastic, clever writer, no doubt, but this story felt hardly worth telling. Any given part could’ve been left out and change little of the end result.

George’s writing is unique in that it’s very stream-of-consciousness from each narrator’s perspective. You get every thought, no matter how weird or incoherent. This makes the first few pages of each story hard to get into because you don’t have context for their world yet, but by the end the plot holes get patched up and those thoughts add up to characters you feel surprisingly familiar with after a few short pages.
