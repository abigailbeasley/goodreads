A year or so ago I read a Pride & Prejudice sequel about one of the other sisters so bad that I won't even tell you what it was. It was just . . . so bad. My real problem is that too often I go in thinking, Surely if they wrote about about Pride & Prejudice/Little Women/Alice in Wonderland, it's because they love the story so much they want to add to it and make it even better! But alas, it seems like all too often these people really want to correct what they see as flaws, picking holes until they've ruined the fabric. That is most definitely not the case here!I picked this up because it casts Lydia (poor, foolish girl!) as a witch, which I thought was interesting and I'm reading a lot of witch books right now. But I was wary. Very wary. Then I happened to look at the author bio before I started, and realized that I know Taub's work and she is HILARIOUS. I started reading eagerly, and I was justly rewarded! This is someone who knows and loves not just P&P, but all of Austen's work. She brings Sanditon into it! SANDITON! I know, right? The way she plays with the characters of Lydia and Kitty, Georgiana Darcy, Wickham, and others beyond just Lizzy and Jane is marvelous! I really felt like this was something Lydia would write. And the plot wasn't just, while Lizzy was over here at the Meryton ball, I was over here doing this thing. It had a lot going on that was new and very creative. In short: if you are looking for a straight up companion book for Pride & Prejudice, this is not for you. But if you like clever fantasy that has been lovingly braided into Austen's world, this is FABULOUS. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Feb 27, 2024","Mar 07, 2024","Feb 23, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/83823784-the-scandalous-confessions-of-lydia-bennet-witch

Who talked of running for president and said he would be a dictator if elected. An uneducated, obese man who nevertheless attracts followers, especially women. Who talks of family values despite being well known for his many divorces, ignoring his children, and having many affairs. A man accused of violence, of lying, of raping and brutalizing women, whose first wife needed medical treatment after he abused her. I know what you're thinking: ""Wait, this is about Trump?""NOPE. It's about a Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920's, D. C. Stephenson! I'm really wondering if Trump hasn't read about Stephenson, since he seems to have borrowed from his playbook. There were quotes from Stephenson (from his letters, newspapers, court reports) that were VERBATIM things that Trump has said. I read this with my jaw on the floor. And the thing that horrified me the most was that what finally stopped Stephenson was that one of his victims DIED. Horribly. Someone shouldn't have to die, in great pain, literally with teeth marks on their body from the brutality of the attack, for an evil man to be stopped. And yet this book gave me hope, because it finally was stopped. The madness was . . . well, tamped down, at least. Crooked mayors and judges were removed from office. People slunk back into their holes, and good people prevailed. It can happen!

I'd heard about this book for years, notably because it's one of the rare children's books that doesn't have any children in it and yet is still widely used in classrooms and is still relevant today. And, yeah, actually. It's set in 2036, or after 2036, really, and written like a nonfiction book about the Pushcart War, an event every schoolchild should know about. This story about corrupt politicians, greedy business owners, and the ""little guys"" who struggled to right the wrongs that are being done to themselves and their friends is truly timeless, and it's written in a way that is engaging for younger readers, even though they're reading about older characters. Is this a classic that I think every child MUST read? Not necessarily. But is it a book that could really spark some great classroom discussion?
