So much so that I actually stopped reading for MONTHS, then picked it up again this week to see if I could get through it. The rage tripled. This is a transcript of a “debate”, but I use that term very loosely because this wouldn’t pass the standard of most university debating societies. The balatant and continued tones of racism and whiteness, and a focus on the West being “good”/affluent, and that poor countries should be pitied — infuriated me, because it had fuck all context. No mention of wars — they actually claimed that this was the biggest time of peace at one point?! — or conflicts, or genocide. These are meant to be some of the worlds best thinkers — LOL. It’s three white guys and one mixed race man talking around themselves in circles. No one won.

However, it’s much more of a storytelling narrative, with her story and her patients’ stories intertwined.It was a solid read, easy to get through, and was written with a self-awareness rarely shared, which I would hope would encourage readers to self-reflect as well. It was also occasionally peppered with solid psychology, and generic but genuine therapeutic advice.
