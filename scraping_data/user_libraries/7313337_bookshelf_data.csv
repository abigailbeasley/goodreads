Consider this my recommendation to you: read this memoir.First, the form is innovative-- snack sized sections, with different audiences (the ""you"" addressed throughout shifts), set off with images and text from legal documents.Second, there is such raw power in the prose here. The descriptions of pregnancy, love, parenting and being parented are so apt that I had to slow down while reading. Third, there is no easy black and white here, although all of the pictures are that way. Bodies are messy, marriages and families are messy, and the way that people perceive gestational mothers who don't present as female: definitely messy. I had never really thought about all of the inherent language that could isolate nonbinary pregnant and nursing people before, but I will now.

Over the course of a year in Towne, dogs will get lost and found, and relationships will change foreverA completely original braided-narrative novel. Over the course of a year in Towne, dogs will get lost and found, and relationships will change forever. Kaltman's book brings us into six different threads and households to see these transformations take place: a loner girl, a teen questioning their sexuality, an interior designer searching for something bigger, a widower, a washed-up actor aching to be a better man, and a new father novelist who can't write. As is normal with this kind of multiple POV book, I did favor some perspectives and find myself leaning away from others, but they all moved the book forward in necessary ways. The most compelling perspectives for me were the new father and loner teen, and I'm sure that other voices will speak most to other people.

The village, taken over in every practical sense by an oil company, struggles to regain its ancestral land and keep its children from dying from the poisonous water. Over the course of the novel, Mbue takes the reader on a journey not just through one generation, but many, as the aftereffects of this environmental and capitalist overreach wreak havoc. The story mainly centers on a girl named Thula, who holds the hopes and fears of all of the village with her. I was immediately grabbed by this novel, its first grounding perspective told in a first person plural, ""we, the children"" as they watch a horrific event. From there, I couldn't put this novel down and resented each time I had to. Passionate, lush prose. While there were many tertiary characters that could sometimes be harder to track, in its fullness, this novel is devastating and, indeed, beautiful.
