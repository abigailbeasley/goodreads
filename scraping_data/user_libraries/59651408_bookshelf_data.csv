Rather than crafting a clever narrative surrounding an intellectual, astute main character as she traverses through school at Harvard and travels abroad, Batuman’s novel comes off as a mere catalog of books, movies, and songs that the main character briefly interacts with and applies her life to before moving onto the next work. This sounds like intellectual fodder my pretentious ass would eat up, but unfortunately the main character is too naive, frankly a little stupid, apathetic, and cold to successfully communicate how life imitates art, which seems like the novel’s intended thematic keystone. I will say that there are some banger lines and that the intertextuality is top notch and well-researched, albeit a little exhausting for the reader.

Not as good as Normal People in my opinion, but much better than Conversations With Friends.I much preferred Eileen and Simon’s storyline to Alice and Felix’s. Both the relationship between Marianne and Connell and the relationship between Eileen and Simon were so touching and sincere to me because in both parties in each relationship, there was the recognition that the other person was THE ONE. Like the other person’s existence and involvement with their life was imperative to their happiness. Each partner was so perfectly molded to the other to an extreme extent, so much so that it was volatile and often imploded (and then they would come back together again, etc.). I felt all of this amazing tension between E and S, though nothing similar between A and F. I felt like Felix treated Alice like shit and didn’t understand why nothing ever came of his wrongs. To me, it seemed like there was absolutely no reason for Alice to be in such an emotionally-taxing relationship, and it didn’t even seem that her and Felix matched each other intellectually, which is often integral to the relationships that Rooney writes. I thought that BWWAY showcased Rooney’s improved abilities of advancing social, philosophical, and existential commentary. I also thought it was really interesting how she dealt with ideas of fame and celebrity through Alice, as it mirrored her situation and provided unique insight. Additionally, the sex scenes in this novel were written better than in the previous two lol.

Someone had to be the author to bring me back down to earth after finishing Donna Tartt’s Goldfinch, and the unfortunate task was given to Ms. Henry. This book was just..bad. The characters were boring and exclusively defined by clichés. The prose was saccharinely melodramatic. The plot maundered on and on and I found myself completely uninvested. Another criticism—this is marketed as enemies-to-lovers, yet Gus and January literally stay enemies for like 50 pages?? And then it segues immediately to them grinding on each other while looking at high school yearbooks. There was none of the internal shame, the internal battle of “this person disgusts me/I am repulsed to be in the same room as you [cut to] there is no way that I find this person mildly attractive, I hate this person why are they looking at me like that” that I associate with, and look forward to in, a true enemies-to-lovers plot. (Okay, maybe it was there a little, but it became genial far too fast, and January expressed being attracted to him in their first interaction.) Also, Gus mentioned something about being physically abused as a child and?? hello? that was completely skated over and very poor character development on Emily Henry’s part to not give that any attention.

Maybe that's unfair; maybe it was meh bordering on good. The main character, Casey, is a struggling, 31-year-old waitress living in Boston; she recently lost her mother, her father is an asshole and completely out of the picture, she's swamped in debt and student loans, she's losing all of her friends, she's reeling from her breakup with her ex (Luke), and she's finding it challenging to complete the first draft of her novel--which she's been working on for six years. To add to all of this, her waitressing job, which barely pays enough for her to live in a (literally) moldy storage shed, exposes her to a threatening, abusive head chef, and she doesn't know that she is able to get health insurance until at least halfway through the novel, which is when she finally gets an underarm lump examined that could be cancerous. She also has romantic problems, but I don't even want to touch on those. This book had a lot of promise, but I found the main character and her life so unrelatable and...deeply sad. Maybe it's because I've never experienced intense grief before, but she seemed so stuck and numb, which was really unpleasant and unsatisfying for the reader. I'm likely too much of an optimist to be able to appreciate or withstand (?) the kind of acute depression that Casey/the reader experiences, but I just found it so discouraging to read; there was nothing redeeming about her life. Of course, in the last 30-40 pages, things turned up, but the ~280 pages before this were...rough.

This book just didn't touch me like it seemed to for others. I thought Orange was trying to do too much with too few pages; it felt like half of the time reading was spent flipping back to the beginning to the character glossary to figure out who was who. I also felt like the entire shooting/heist subplot, which we later find is integral to the entire novel, is not..written or explained well? I didn't understand why they needed guns, nor did I understand how they roped in all of the accomplices into it. It was tragic, and seemingly unrealistic, to me that Indian men--who Orange had spent 50-100 (?) pages carefully explaining the nuances to their characters, exposing their past traumas, and generally making the reader feel sympathetic towards their personages--decided to rob an Indian Powow of all things, a purely disrespectful, immoral, and unempathetic gesture in my opinion. It was frustrating and I felt robbed and manipulated as a reader. All of this being said, I enjoyed the prose and was impressed with Orange's tact in exploring historic and contemporary Indian issues, which are not talked about nearly enough. I also think that reading/annotating this book for school spoiled my reading experience; looking for quotes and paying attention to character arcs took away from the story and the artistry of the language. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 19, 2021","Aug 31, 2021","Jun 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36692478-there-there

The banter was cute, the slow burn was too slow, the flashbacks were irritable and I tried to read them as fast as I could so I could get to the current-time stuff, and the characters were mostly well-rounded and relatable. Reading this book after a James Baldwin novel (and giving said Baldwin novel five deserved stars), I don't think that I could possibly give this novel five stars, given that the prose simply does not compare to the beautiful literature I read earlier this week. A few other things I didn't like about this novel: For some reason, I felt like I didn't quite know what Alex looked like? maybe I had not properly comprehended a description at the beginning, but all I gathered from his appearance was that he was muscular/fit and that he had messy hair. Another complaint--I didn't think that the name 'Poppy' worked for the main character; the name seems too cheery and happy for her, as her character was much more complex and nuanced. I think this was more well-done than Beach Read, but honestly overall am not very impressed with Emily Henry’s work. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 27, 2021","Jun 29, 2021","Jun 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54985743-people-we-meet-on-vacation

The fact that Billy was able to become sober after a 2 month stint in rehab and STAY sober on tour, while being surrounded by drugs and alcohol, is just extremely unbelievable to me. Having read other books involving substance abuse and currently being in the midst of intense research about the War On Drugs, this facet of Billy’s storyline seems so poorly done. (Same goes for Daisy and her sobriety journey lol.) I also felt Camila and Billy’s dynamic was not realistic—I just find it hard to believe that spouses can put up with so much shit from their partners. Both Daisy and Billy were assholes.

I am in awe. Shocked by the twist at the end. Sad to leave the characters with which I spent 550 pages. Sad, but a little relieved, to leave Hampden and Vermont. The blurb on the back of the novel vaguely describes a story of a friend group attending an elite college in New England, which, yes, is what this story is about. However, Donna Tartt's novel is so special because rather than being plot-driven, it is character-driven, which leads to a more emotional, more nuanced, reader experience. There's Richard, the narrator, who hails from California, from an abusive, poor, suburban family. The reader experiences the opulence and elitism of Richard's new world through Richard, whose shock at his new surroundings leads him to be submissive and easily manipulated by other characters, yet also leads to an out-of-body experience for our narrator; the novelty of his new world is so chilling that he has lost the ability to process empathy or remorse for the gruesome actions he has committed (or simply been a part of...or coerced into)--it's almost as though Richard is experiencing or observing his actions rather than doing them. (Some might point to this as evidence of his awful personage--that he's a little too okay with murder--but I can't help but feel sympathy for him.)There's Charles and Camilla, twins from Virginia. Camilla poses as sweet and delicate, though she is manipulative and leads others on. (Although she seems to be a reader favorite, I don't like Camilla.) Charles develops more during the second half of the novel, and although he morphs into an ugly, unhinged addict and abuser, I think it is a testament to Donna Tartt's writing and character-building that I felt compassion and sympathy for him; Charles received the shorter end of the stick and those who enjoyed the longer end were so greedy and conniving that they continued to shorten his piece of wood. Henry is the leader of the group. He's a trust fund baby who receives a heady allowance every month and will never work a day in his life. Mysterious, brooding, brilliant, and manipulative--I did not like Henry. Francis is likely the best out of everyone--though still morally gray, just as everyone else--and I love him and want the best for him. Francis is honest, reliable, and a good friend to Richard, though also hopelessly and tragically repressed. Bunny is an awful person; racist, homophobic, lazy, and an abuser of everyone else's (mostly Henry's) generosity with their money. Bunny is insufferable.Other side characters, such Cloke Rayburn and Julian Morrow, are also likable, unlikeable, terrible human beings, or a mixture of all three. This is the magic of Donna Tartt. No one could really be described as good, everyone could be proven as bad, and yet Ms. Tartt was still able to cultivate the reader's acute attachment and empathy for each of the characters. I also think that many readers or critics of this novel don't understand how it's a critique of elitism, rather than an endorsement or romanticization. Donna Tartt fulfills the reader's most perverse, pretentious, ridiculous fantasies of luxury and dark academia, then demonstrates to the reader how terrible, loveless, and flawed that world truly is. In summary, I can't recommend this book enough. Be forewarned, however, that it is long, with small type, big pages, blocky and can have dialogue droughts, and dense, but beautiful, prose. It took a while for me to get through, but SO worth it....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 30, 2021","Jul 25, 2021","May 23, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29044.The_Secret_History

That being said, the narrative that Adichie crafts (which belongs to the “plotless” genre akin to the style of Sally Rooney) often gets lost, and sometimes Adichie recognizes this wrong turn, and frantically advances the romantic plot line to keep her reader invested. On multiple occasions, the author chronicles pages-long dialogue that seems to serve no other purpose than to prove to the reader that she is still cultivating a narrative, that this is not a series of essays. However, when Adichie is good, she is really good. Her musings on race and racism are fascinating and enlightening, and her characters elucidate poignant introspections.

I wasn’t wholly impressed by the prose, the time jumping and back stories lent to a non-linear plot that got sloggish and un-engaging, and honestly, contradictory to a lot of the other s, I thought the characters were a little flat. I also felt that the author did not go deep enough in regards to the issues which she dealt with; ex. a story line involving a trans man in the 80s and 90s and there is no mention of harassment, and the dialogue of trans struggles only goes as far as not being able to afford surgery or T? I think there was room for a lot more depth. I definitely experienced this novel with a white, privileged perspective, so to others in the trans/queer and/or the black community, it might have been a very different read....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 02, 2021","Jun 13, 2021","May 23, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half

I found all of the characters basically insufferable, both for a plethora of specific reasons for each character, but also because I felt that there was a deep lack of character development in the entire novel. Frances was annoying, cold, prideful, tortured, and depressed; Bobbi called herself a Communist and criticized Frances for not being an activist, but still lived off of her parents’ money and flexed her moral superiority over everyone; Nick was bland, tortured, depressed (Frances and Nick shared those two qualities), submissive, and pathetic; and Melissa was..one-dimensional (I can’t even think of words to describe her personality? I feel like she literally doesn’t have one). Obviously, not all characters are meant to be liked, but I just found it so hard to empathize or find anything redeeming in anyone. I didn’t know who to root for because no one/no couple was compelling (maybe Frances and Bobbi? but everything in their previous relationship was in brief flashbacks, so I didn’t know it well enough to root for it, and the weird girlfriend thing at the end seemed like it was an afterthought), and I felt lost and confused because I was not invested in anything. I have to give this at least three stars for Sally Rooney’s immense craft (and will continue to devour any of her work which is available to me), but this novel was just not my cup of tea☹️...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 13, 2021","Jun 18, 2021","May 23, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32187419-conversations-with-friends

Wow (I say this at the beginning of every  it seems, oops)--this is one of the best books I have ever read.Tartt's third novel follows Theo Decker, who we meet as a 13-year-old living with his mother in Manhattan (Upper West Side, from what I could gather?). Within the first 50 pages, readers join Theo and his mother, who loves art, at the Met to see a Dutch exhibit. Unfortunately, a bomb goes off in the museum, planted by a terrorist, and Theo's mother dies in the explosion while Theo survives. On his way out of the museum, Theo takes the Goldfinch, an invaluable, world-famous painting by the Dutchman Fabritius, which, coincidentally, was also saved after an explosion at Delft (0ne of the many, many parallels in this book). Due to his orphanage, Theo first moves into the home of a wealthy Upper East Side family, then finds himself in Vegas for a couple of years, and back to Manhattan (now in Greenwich Village), and then finally in Amsterdam (though at this point he is grown up and no longer an orphan in need of supervision).Throughout his travels, the painting stays with Theo (though not always physically), just as much as other things stay with, and haunt, him--the grief and guilt from his mother's death, the trauma from the explosion, and drug addiction and alcoholism as passed down from his father. Along the way, Theo makes life-long friends, sworn enemies, and falls in love. So, as much as this book is about a stolen painting, it is also about life, about love, and about loss. Donna Tartt is masterful: in her words and prose, which are both poetic, beautiful, yet also accessible; in her characters--Boris is probably one of my favorite literary characters ever, and the way that Tartt is able to write his dialogue and make his character so nuanced and lovable is pure excellence; in her setting, when she takes us through the rainy, loud streets of New York, the gilded home of the Barbours, the wooded comfort of Hobie's shop, the shiny depression of and in Vegas, and the haunting, dank streets of Amsterdam. BE WARNED: this book is not a light read. In a physical sense, it is extremely heavy and long, but in a content sense, topics like physical abuse, drug abuse and alcoholism, suicide, and depression are all discussed at length. With that warning in mind, please, please read this book--maybe only to meet Boris, but I promise that will not be a waste of time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 02, 2021","Aug 08, 2021","May 23, 2021",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27886778-the-goldfinch

I understand that it was an NYT bestseller, etc., etc. . . . There truly is a lot of hype around the book, especially now that the movie is coming out soon. I just didn't find this novel to be incredibly satisfying. The premise was promising and cliche--an ordinary girl gets swept off her feet by a mysterious, handsome suitor who turns out in fact to be rich and famous. It sounded so very cliche, yet also delectable in that it would be able to satisfy our deepest desires to see the peasant girl live happily ever after with the rich prince. Although the ending was fulfilling, in my opinion, I found the novel to be a frankly 'meh' read, if that makes sense. Every character had the same, easy-breezy, blah dialogue. It seemed as though the dialogue only existed to move the plot along and push the reader in the right direction, rather than entertain the reader and make the reader feel as though he or she was listening to normal human beings. Basically, the dialogue was hugely lacking throughout the entire book which was a huge miss, due to the fact that the dialogue took up the majority of the novel. The second problem I had with the novel was simply the writing. I just found it to be plain and boring. The descriptions were animated and sounded like a 5th grader wrote them; as it seemed the author decided to add basic adjectives to any noun he could find. The vocabulary, once again, was at the level of a 5th grader, and this was something that I wasn't entertained by. In addition, Kevin Kwan's writing in general was boring. It wasn't poetic or interesting and he didn't wow me with his use of language. Like the dialogue, it seemed like the writing was there for necessity and necessity only, and not to leave the reader flabbergasted due to the way that he described Ah Ma's face (etc.).Lastly, Kwan used the tactic where he left each chapter as a cliff hanger, yet switched perspectives every chapter so that the reader had to wait a while for various characters' problems to get resolved. Usually, I don't mind this because it keeps readers on the edge of their seats, seeing as readers enjoy all perspectives equally and don't mind being thrown from perspective to perspective. The problem I had with Kwan's way of doing this is that I frankly was not interested in the other characters' lives. I decided to read Crazy Rich Asians because I wanted to read a romance novel about two characters, RACHEL and NICK. I couldn't really give a crap about ASTRID'S marriage or ANABELLE'S satisfaction in finally being accepted into society. This really frustrated me because I felt that I wanted to skip all of the scenes without Rachel and Nick because they were boring, but I couldn't because that would be an injustice to the novel (does anyone else ever feel this way??). Although there were clearly things I did not enjoy, there were a few that I did. One of my favorite qualities of the novel was the little footnotes that were at the bottom of the pages that elaborated upon slang and native foods, among other things. I found the descriptions to be charming and hilarious. Also, I really enjoyed the family tree at the beginning. I had to get into the book and understand the characters better before I could understand the tree itself and the genealogical relationships between characters. To conclude, this would not be a novel that I would read again . . . . but the story itself was good enough--and cliche enough--that I would happily go watch the movie.😊😊😊...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 15, 2018","Jul 15, 2018","Jul 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16085481-crazy-rich-asians
