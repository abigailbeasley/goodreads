This book does a fine job of transporting you both to modern day Siena and to 14th-century Siena through two simultaneous stories. The main story, set in modern day, involves a rather unappealing young woman named Julie who travels to Siena to uncover secrets about her family and The True Story about the two feuding families who provided the basis for Romeo and Juliet. The second storyline, set among the danger and drama of Renaissance Siena, is where the novel really shines. Somehow it’s so vivid and immediate that I was desperate to find out if maybe – maybe! – things would work out for these prototypes of the star-crossed lovers we first met in 8th grade English class. All the best plot elements from Shakespeare’s play are here – perfidious adults, power politics, and the anguish of doomed love. And such doom! In this author’s rendition, the action is fleshed out to be grander, darker, more violent, and more exciting than a masked ball and a couple of duels. (Will I be struck by lightning for saying that?) The bad news is that the novel derails in the modern day sections. Our main character Julie is irritating, she has an evil twin sister who’s sometime evil and sometimes just childish, and the dialogue has so many bizarre idioms that I wondered if it had been written by a foreigner (turns out, yes). And unfortunately, the modern story is narrated in first person so we’re treated to Julie’s uneven voice and questionable powers of reason the whole time. Plus her obsession with Romeo and Juliet means she quotes it incessantly and feels mystically doomed because, after all, Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, so she’s obviously fated for a tragic end herself! Because we are doomed to repeat history!! (That was not a spoiler: Julie does not end up stabbing herself in a crypt.) Anyway, the end result is that the 14th century storyline is a gripping homage to Shakespeare, but the modern storyline comes like come across like a Shakespeare-themed Nancy Drew adventure. Even this isn’t entirely bad, though, because instead of Ned Nickerson we get a swarthy Italian policeman with rich relatives.Another plus is that I learned a lot about Siena, which I’ve never been to and now am dying to visit.

While the descriptions of life for Jews in Vienna at the end of the 30's was interesting and understandably moving, once the action moved to England the story lost its fizz. Part of the problem is that I didn’t much like the main character, so the story suffered by being in first person. Plus I don’t like feeling conflicted about being sympathetic to a plight more than to the person suffering the plight. Shouldn't a person's suffering make her more sympathetic?? Not necessarily to me, and I don’t want to bother wondering if this is a character flaw.

Even Pygmalion, which strikes me as a superior play, makes me slightly irritable, and Major Barbara doesn’t have any musical tunes to hum while you’re trudging through Shaw’s dreary I Am So Keenly Critical and Nuanced dialogue. The other problem is that, in my opinion, he’s neither keen nor nuanced. He’s bigoted and cranky, and his weak humor begs an unfavorable comparison to Oscar Wilde, who probably didn’t like this play either. I know – Shaw brings up interesting questions about individual and corporate responsibility toward those who purchase goods, and he explores the question (impossibility) of a utopia. These are good issues, and not easily resolved in or out of the play. But Shaw’s antagonism toward religion and his disgust for human beings in general are so off-putting that I want to toss the book at his feet. Too bad someone didn’t tell him that misanthropy gets tiresome. In retrospect, possibly what pushed me over the edge wasn’t actually Shaw’s play, but having to listen to self-righteous classmates discuss it. “It’s awful that the Salvation Army hands out bread and soup instead of providing job training!” “Yes, in fact it’s EVIL when you think about it!” No, it’s not.

Here's the premise: a young Chicago woman gets an invitation from her college friend, Will, to spend the summer in his family’s ancestral home in Tennessee. She can relax on the porch, eat chicken salad with his great aunts, and maybe start writing the novel she’s been thinking about. Will’s family turns out to be the kind that has framed letters from Thomas Jefferson on the wall and Secrets Nobody Ever Talks About. For the bohemian-raised Ava, who doesn’t know her mother’s real name let alone her genealogy back to Adam, this is as much of a culture shock as dressing for dinner and hearing people’s life story at the gas station.Fortunately, the book isn’t full of the overly wacky “characters” that often plague Southern fiction. Well, there is a cousin who dresses up like Edgar Allan Poe, but he’s kind of funny. The great aunts are charming, the story moves along nicely, and the occasional flashbacks to 1927 or 1931 make for an intriguing element.

The beginning is that scary. Portentous weather, foreboding landscape, cryptic warnings from the natives, freaky castle, freakier inhabitants....it all looks very grim for our hero, a hapless solicitor sent to Transylvania to help a client transition some of his affairs to England. The atmosphere of danger and doom make even the most implausible elements (wolves with glowing eyes! men crawling down castle walls!) completely chilling. For the first few chapters I was too creeped out to walk outside alone at night, hence the forced chivalry.Then, in what feels like a bait and switch but of course isn't, the narrative shifts and we’re back in England with the hero’s fiancée, Lucy, and her best friend. This should be where things get interesting, as Dracula – the ancient, foreign menace – is now coming to safe & familiar England to search for new victims, and we get to see his powers of seductive corruption in action. However, the story loses some of its zing, and all the doom and dread and “What could this mean?!” I was sucked into in Transylvania seemed faintly ridiculous in the London sections. Alas. On the plus side, I enjoyed Stoker’s commentary on understanding evil. The company of Englishmen in Dracula is too modern, too complacent with scientific understanding to figure out Lucy’s decline. Only Dr. Van Helsing knows to hearken back to legends, traditions and folklore in order to apprehend the threat. It’s an interesting approach, for Van Helsing does not pit science against faith, or pagan myths against Christianity; rather, he pits modern, rational science against the mythical and supernatural. Van Helsing is not a priest, and although he uses symbols of salvation (a crucifix and communion wafers), the battle he wages is more spiritual than religious, the conflict between good and evil more in the mystical rather than in the orthodox realm.Dracula is well suited to an age of rapid scientific and technological development, for it speaks to the limitations of man’s purely rational achievements. Plus, it packs a double whammy of gothic horror: Dracula does not merely exert physical control by kidnapping women or locking them in a tower – he also produces spiritual enslavement and damnation, which must be combated by similarly spiritual means. However, the corrupting influence of Dracula is neither immediate nor absolute; Dracula can outmaneuver our band of Englishmen but not defeat them; he’s tricky, not invincible. And, most importantly, he’s subject to the strength of goodness and to the ultimate power of death. *SPOILER ALERT* Significantly, Lucy’s soul is returned to a state of purity when she dies, and even Dracula himself seems released from the evil possessing him when he is defeated. For some reason, this facet has been jettisoned in contemporary vampire stories, in which the vampire main characters are attractive victims of circumstance who try to control their blood lust, against whom neither man nor death has any power, only fellow vampires. In this vision, vampirism is contained – though never defeated – not by religious symbols, but by individual will. Does this mean that there is no possibility of redemption from evil, only management of it? And vampires, with their strength of body or strength of will, are the ultimate power in the world? I find this more disturbing and ridiculous than the original vampire legends. There are about a million critical essays on the cultural/psychological/religious/sexual issues Dracula brings up, which are interesting, but for me those issues are secondary to the actual novel, which isn’t spectacularly written.

It came into being because Gretchen Rubin, a woman with a bizarrely charmed life, decided to spend a year devoting each month to a “theme” designed to make herself happier and then write a book about it. The whole thing smacks not only of a calculated stunt, but also of the sort of “list” approach she used for her breathtakingly trite book on Churchill. Regardless, any reasonable person would wonder why this woman was worrying about how to be “happier” than she already was with her “soul mate” husband, two healthy children, a family she likes, in-laws* she likes, plenty of free time, and money coming out the wazoo. The obvious question is: “If she wants to be happier, why doesn’t she do more service?” The question you’ll also probably ask, repeatedly, is “What could a smug perfectionist with an easy life possibly teach me?” Honestly, I have no idea, unless it hasn’t already occurred to you to.....are you sitting down?.....stash your crap in file boxes instead of leaving it strewn all over, and stop nagging your husband. Other previously unmined gems of insight: “You can’t change others,” “Exercise makes you feel better,” “Be friendly,” “Do things you like to do,” “Be grateful,” and, my personal favorite, “Money can buy happiness.” Even better, every ten sentences or so she inserts – not to be confused with “works in” – a quotation that sounds like the first entry in its category from The Big Book of Quotations. Based on the self-congratulatory tone she doesn’t quite have the skill to avoid, I’d guess she’s deeply invested in showing she is Educated, and has Done Research. I think you’re also supposed to surmise she’s really smart, based on the number of references to editing the Yale Law Review or clerking for a Supreme Court Justice. What she never mentions, yet you can also surmise, is the fact that money is no object. Neither is time. While being rich and leisured doesn’t disqualify her from having wisdom, it does place her situation in context. She’s not struggling to find happiness amidst real trials – illness, poverty, loneliness, relatives who drive you bonkers – she just wants to be “happier.” What’s amazing is that with all her research, she doesn’t come up with anything profound. At best, her paper-thin “insights” are merely summaries of other people’s research. And yet, inexplicably, a couple of women in my book group actually liked it! These women don’t sit around wondering if they’re happy enough – they probably wonder if they’re faithful enough and doing enough good in the world. So what did they find valuable?? A couple of them said that the organization chapter prompted them to clean out closets, which is always good, but there are at least a hundred books on de-cluttering that were written by people who were already aware of file boxes. (I know this because my sister has bought all those books and occasionally gives them away as presents, unless you’re really lucky and she just throws your stuff out without being asked.) So the organization chapter struck me as a bit silly. But not as silly as turning to Nietzsche for tips on happiness. And I think that indicates the biggest flaw – her approach is entirely secular. Joy and fulfillment (a bit deeper and more lasting than “happiness”) come through doing good and, eventually, becoming good. Every now and then she stumbles as if by accident upon versions of the Golden Rule Lite, but, naturally, in her eyes the point of being nice to others is to make herself happier. *Father-in-law is Robert Rubin, Clinton’s Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.

The book opens in the spring of 1943, as Norway is suffering under Nazi occupation. Four ex-pat Norwegian commandos are heading to the coast with the intent of recruiting and training saboteurs – their ultimate goal is a German airbase, as the Allies desperately need a sea route to Russia. The mission is compromised, and young Jan Baalsrud is left on a tiny, snowy island in the Arctic Circle, drenched, shot, bleeding, unarmed, with only one shoe and a team of Nazis a couple hundred yards behind. How could anyone survive? The cold alone is enough to kill most of us off, not to mention the fright. What follows – frostbite, snow blindness, avalanches, treachery, heroism, starvation, and, always, miles and miles of Arctic snow – kept my mouth hanging open most of time. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Almost as astonishing as Jan’s story is the will of the people who help him, the danger they faced knowing what would happen to their families if they were found out. I have to admit I never think of Norway unless I’m watching the winter Olympics, and certainly I never think of it in the context of World War II, yet the Norwegians’ love of their country in all its frozen, inhospitable glory, and their will to fight the occupation are truly inspiring.

Drawing on her extensive interviews with victims/survivors, Lynn Nottage presents a tale of such suffering that it seems like a warped horror story from another time period or, we could wish, another planet. Yet it’s a frighteningly immediate story – variations of the drama are being enacted in real life every day. Also, the mineral at the center of the war, coltan, is fought over partly because it’s an essential component of cell phones. In an oddly disconcerting way, every one of us has a piece of the Democratic Republic of the Congo sitting on our desk or in our purse. I’m not prone to displaced guilt, but you have to admit it gives one pause.The play takes place in a bar/brothel at the edge of a war zone and presents widely disparate characters – insurgents, government soldiers, prostitutes, international traders, and villagers. But at the center is Mama Nadi, the commanding owner and madam. One day she might be serving the insurgents, the next she might be entertaining the government soldiers, but her establishment is a neutral zone and everyone checks his bullets at the door. Mama’s forceful personality and equivocal ethics encapsulate the muddy, moral mess of war as well as the resilience of human nature. You know a world in which a brothel is a retreat, and working in a brothel a girl’s best hope, is not going to be a pretty one. But however horrific and alien the circumstances, the characters in the play grab you with their humanity, and they force you to relate to that shared humanity by witnessing assaults against it and, at times, triumphs of it. I saw Ruined performed in the round, which means you could see through the actors and on-stage drama to rows of other theatre goers. This had the benefit of almost superimposing the action onto the audience; I simultaneously watched the actions of people halfway around the world and the reactions of people like me. The odd unity of actors and audience was suitable for a play full of alien and shared experience. Casual references to witch doctors and spats over nail polish occur in the same scene; the foreign and familiar are not mutually exclusive, and neither are unspeakable abuse and the possibility of healing. At the end of the play half the audience was smiling and breathing an audible “Ahhh” while the other half didn’t even applaud because they were still wiping their eyes…the combination of brutality and humanity is quite unsettling. However, I’d definitely wait to see it performed rather than read it – while it’s powerful, it’s no Streetcar. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Oct 2010,"Jun 10, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6411892-ruined

Actually, it never actually was a relationship, as the woman in question preemptively rejected him through her indifference. That doesn't affect his heartbreak, though, and he requires sufficient time and a suitable location to indulge in self-pity. So off he heads to his aunt’s house, where he anticipates that the stark landscape of the Irish coast will provide a fitting backdrop to indulge in misery. His aunt, who is only a couple of years older so she’s more like a cousin, is happy to have him.....though he suspects that the hideous floral wallpaper covering the kitchen walls was hastily put up in order to drive him out of doors, because she, too, is a writer and needs peace and quiet. Unlike her nephew, though, the aunt has made a mint with her books, which are thinly disguised re-writes of classics. Her approach is to “correct” the offending texts, giving the characters the endings they would have gotten if she were in charge of the universe. Anyway, the story sort of follows the mourning writer’s blunderings around the coast, but it’s mainly about the almost surreal imbroglios of his aunt, her pig-tending former BFF, and her ancient-feud-sworn-enemy. The actual mystery – Who killed the man whose bones were uncovered by a stray pig in the aunt’s garden? – is almost incidental to the more amusing development of intense, zany Irish characters and their interactions with our self-absorbed writer. He, naturally, is less interested in the murder mystery than he is miffed that events keep conspiring to interrupt his mourning. My guess is that the author is making fun of rambly, overly-lyrical Irish fiction, which is why this occasionally reads like an exercise in magical realism.

Her characterizations are far more disjointed than the plot, which has its flaws but at worst they’re jarring, not heinous. However, the characterizations don’t work not merely because there are only two or three bearable people in the entire novel (and this isn't a farcical satire), but mainly because they’re a convoluted mess of contexts. Major Pettigrew’s manners and standards hearken from a more gentlemanly era, yet it’s as though he’s a one-man time warp surrounded by modern incarnations of rudeness and overt materialism – his son is breathtakingly selfish and shallow, his relatives are vulgar and grasping, and the local squire has class snobbery but no sense of heritage. (And are we supposed to feel sorry for the Major because of his frightful son, or wonder at his bad parenting??) Worse, and still more disjointed, many of the other characters seem to come from outposts of civilization in the 1930’s where people think that Mecca is a restaurant and Hindu and Muslim are the same things. Yet the story is obviously contemporary, so why would the author create a collection of characters in 2010 who overtly shun children raised by single mothers and won’t talk to the village shop owner because she’s “in trade” and has dark skin??? The whole thing is preposterous, and I suspect it comes from some people's obnoxious desire to paint the rest of the world as narrow-minded and petty in order to position themselves as morally superior. It’s a shame, because in defter hands the story could have been uniformly sweet and delightful. The idea of family heritage and honor being embodied in an heirloom is especially interesting and poignant...as is the fraught road to late-in-life love. Too bad the themes are ruined by the addled execution. (A highlight is when a curry dish is considered far too spicy and exotic to serve at some golf club dinner – the author is so hell-bent on portraying everyone as provincial that she somehow forgot the English have been eating curry for over a century??

I have several of John Keegan’s books, most of them featuring lots of photographs, but this is the one that made him famous – and for good reason. His elegant prose has the right amount of wit and clarity, scholarship and humility, gripping description and hard facts. After an introduction to military historiography that left me – I'm not even kidding – thinking “What a fascinating topic!!” he describes three seminal European battles that took place in the same region: Agincourt, Waterloo, and the Somme. I can’t say that you don’t need to be a teeny bit interested in military history to be interested in this, as I do happen to be interested in military history, but I can objectively testify to his eloquence. He describes what it would be like to be a man-on-the-ground combat soldier in each of these battles with the arrows whizzing by, the cannon smoke obscuring the field, and the rain of bullets falling indiscriminately and unceasingly. (I know “rain of bullets” is cliché, but I’m not John Keegan.) And with a considerable understanding born of his years researching and teaching at Sandhurst, he explains what on earth compells the average soldier to endure the misery and danger of combat. To hear him describe the experience of these battles, buy the book – you, too, can know as closely as it’s possible to know what it would be like to fight in another time period. It’s worth far more than $11 and five or six hours just be wowed by his prose and grateful for your life.

In this fasJonathan Shay is a psychotherapist – and impressive amateur classicist – who has spent decades treating Vietnam veterans with severe PTSD. In this fascinating book, he analyzes what he sees as the moral breakdown of Achilles in terms of factors common to the Vietnam War. The first section of the book outlines these factors: a betrayal of “what’s right”; the shrinkage of the social and moral horizon; grief at the death of a special comrade; guilt and wrongful substitution; and going berserk (a clinical condition, not slang). In each of the chapters he describes these conditions as revealed through years of treating veterans, often quoting transcripts of therapy sessions, and analyzes their presence in The Iliad. In the second section he goes through soldiers’ common reactions to these conditions, again drawing from Vietnam veterans’ accounts, and demonstrates the same reactions in Achilles. It’s convincing and utterly compelling.I’m no classical scholar, but I have read The Iliad many times and can appreciate his deep understanding and meticulous examination. His book is worth multiple readings. In fact, Achilles in Vietnam has filled a role in my understanding similar to movies of favorite novels, like “Gone With the Wind” – now I can’t read The Iliad without this as context and subtext! I also was stunned by the descriptions of combat in Vietnam — both the conditions of guerilla warfare against the Viet Cong and common U.S. military practices seemed designed to inflict maximum psychological damage on our soldiers. Be forewarned: this is not for the faint of heart. If you’ve studied the Vietnam War then much of this will be familiar. If not, brace yourself; the accounts are from men whose combat trauma was debilitating enough that they sought professional help. Also, Dr. Shay quotes veterans’ words verbatim, and the profanity is almost as stunning as the substance. I have no tolerance for profanity and felt like I needed to wash out my head with a power hose, yet at the same time I couldn’t help feel sorry for both the lack of education that often produces such a low level of language and the obvious crutch that profanity was for these men; if the eloquent can’t find words to describe such horrors, what hope had they? (Not all the interviewees swear four or five times in a sentence; there are distinct levels of language corresponding to levels of education, a fact that the Vietnam veterans I know are quick to assert.)

Wishing to give Charis a season in London in order to secure her a good husband, she applies to Alverstoke for sponsorship. Alverstoke is floored. How many dreadful females must he endure in one day? But then it dawns on him that by giving a joint ball for Charis and one of his unpromising nieces, he can do a favor for his late cousin AND score off his sister, whose daughter will be woefully eclipsed by the angelic Charis. Ha!Pretty soon Alverstoke becomes sucked into the rather slapstick imbroglios of Frederica’s younger brothers, who for some reason like his acerbity and believe he’s their new best friend. As he bails them out of various scrapes, all of which are surprisingly funny, his crustiness begins to flake – though fortunately just a bit. Romances in general are dicey, and “historical romance” is a genre that fills me with horror; my few forays into it have not been rewarding. However, Georgette Heyer’s between-the-wars mysteries are so funny that I keep hoping the same humor will surface in her Regency novels – and voilà! Success!! This offering is laugh-out-loud funny and surprisingly engaging. Most amazingly, much of the humor comes from the children — usually the kiss of death. Again, I think the narrator is largely to thank.

In brief, Hobbes argues for a strong central government headed by an absolute sovereign. Frankly, I can’t imagine anyone liking Hobbes, as his take on social contract theory supports the theoretical groundwork for constitutional monarchy instead of republicanism. But some of his other theories are a bit more intriguingly off. I’d love to have a dinner party with Hobbes and a couple of Romantic poets – maybe Wordsworth and Coleridge – and ask them what they thought of Hobbes’s assertion that imagination is “nothing but decaying sense” and is the same as memory.

Her ever-increasing economies simply cannot keep pace with her dwindling dividends. Should she try keeping chickens? No, they’re rather alarming. In desperation she decides to write a book, and, knowing little else besides the goings-on of her village, she writes a thinly veiled description of her friends and neighbors. Surprisingly, Miss Buncle’s book not only gets published, it becomes a best-seller. Critics are in violent disagreement over whether the book is harmless drivel, the product of a brilliant satirist, or.....the lurid imaginings of a dangerous subversive! Miss Buncle is warmed by the praise, shocked by the criticism, but mostly just grateful to be able to pay the butcher and buy a new hat. The reaction of the villagers, however, is worth the price of admission. It doesn’t take long for everyone to realize the novel, presciently titled Disturber of the Peace, is about them. As you’d suspect, the innocent are enchanted and the guilty are outraged. Can they really have been nursing a viper to their bosom all this time?! Worse, the book doesn’t merely hold a mirror up to the villagers — it imagines some of them engaging in daring, destiny-fulfilling enterprises. Clearly, the heretical author must be ferreted out and punished! Hilarity and satire ensue. I read this, laughing out loud, at dinner every night during a solitary week on the Oregon coast, which provided a nice setting for a book about a woman isolated by a secret and often reveling in it.

A woman who is obsessed with the BBC version of “Pride and Prejudice” longs to get over her Mr. Darcy fixation because she thinks it might be impeding her life. Then a great aunt dies and wills her a vacation at some Regency-themed manor house in England where she can become immersed in Austen’s world for three weeks. She somehow views this experience as her big chance to – stay with me – exorcise her Darcy obsession. I don’t get it either. Also confusing is that she calls herself “obsessed” with Pride and Prejudice yet she doesn’t know the first thing about Regency language, manners, customs, clothes, or anything else. Is she really dim, or is her idea of being “obsessed” merely watching Darcy get out of the lake over and over with the TV muted? Anyway, off she goes to this pretend world she doesn’t know anything about and which, inexplicably, she then resents. We all have our kookiness and contradictions, so the absurdities probably wouldn’t have been so glaring if the narrator (I got it on cd from the library) had been better. Unfortunately, the deranged woman infused each sentence with such drama that the effect was both disconcerting and wearying. Every WORRRRD was positively DRIPping with irony – because we’d never pick up on it otherwise, so subtle was the prose?? The overwrought narration served, regrettably, to highlight the writing’s triteness. How does this stuff get published?

Then partway through I feel as though I’ve inhaled half a box of Hostess cupcakes. I need to vow never to succumb to another Austen knock-off, because it’s just encouraging these people.The only positive thing I can say was that the ending had several twists. I was returning it to the library without bothering to finish, but then I popped in the last disc and ended up sitting in the library parking lot for 30 minutes in order to see how it ended, so I guess that’s something. However, come to think of it, perhaps that’s not a recommendation — Austen’s own novels are of stories of self-discovery, so the reader knows well before the end what the happy ending should be for each heroine. It’s up to the individual characters to adjust their vision or realize and correct the flaws that are already obvious to the reader. So the fact that I didn’t know which guy, if any, would be a happy ending for this heroine shows a weakness in characterization and development, not skillful plot twists....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Apr 2010,"Aug 13, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2004362.Austenland

As always, WhEdith Wharton’s pet subjects — failed marriages, social minefields, and stymied dreams — play out against the backdrop of the Great War. As always, Wharton’s prose beautifully combines criticism with compassion, lyricism with clarity, and subtlety with wrenching drama. I found myself re-reading passages and just sighing. The set up for this novel hooked me before I even read it: In the summer of 1914, a divorced expatriate father living in Paris is anticipating a month’s travel with his son, George. Adding a rosy glow to the prospect is the father’s recent success as an artist after years of struggle, which means he’ll finally be able to support his son financially. After all, he wants George to be “independent” and not have to work in some soul-destroying business such as the son's stepfather owns — such a nice touch to combine class snobbery and whiff-of-Bohemian artistic snobbery! Anyway, war breaks out and prevents the father/son vacation, but the big crisis is that George can be drafted into the French army because he was born while his parents were visiting France. Oh, the twists of fate. This danger forces the ex-husband, ex-wife, and her second husband (who essentially reared George) into an uneasy collaboration to protect the son, without his knowing it, from active duty. The three parents scramble and scheme to pull every string they have to get George behind a desk, but, to everyone’s amazement and horror, George enlists. The mother is devastated; the fathers are secretly proud. (And the reader isn't surprised as that's the title of the novel.) The bulk of the story concerns the agonies of parents waiting on the home front, a situation more complex because of the divorce and the weirdness of being foreigners in a country at war. Wharton explores the human psyche with such unrelenting perception that it’s almost painful. So many times I wanted to reach into the book and shake the characters even as I ached for them. You yearn for these people to rise above their petty concerns, but, as in real life, people usually fall short. However, Wharton is a genius at portraying the moments of connection that offer transcendence. For instance, both men know the wife isn’t the sharpest knife in the drawer and needs to be handled carefully (though they can’t say it aloud), both have a father’s love for George, and both have a conflicted admiration for George’s willingness to fight. I wanted the characters to burst into soulful, lushly orchestrated duets about their differing roles, but Wharton doesn’t provide musical theatre, just realistic insight, and so the result is more exploratory than cathartic.Edith Wharton lived in Paris during the Great War and drove an ambulance to and from the front, so she writes with nuance and authority on the issues of being American in Paris during the years before the U.S. entered the war. Mostly, though, I enjoyed a personal and family saga that gives insight into both a vanished social context and universal experiences....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,Sep 2009,"Jul 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5254.A_Son_at_the_Front

However, something about a characterAlexander McCall Smith has a penchant for “cute” titles, some quite funny(At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances). However, something about a character named La, short for Lavender, struck me as too twee even for my low standards. I should have followed my instinct and skipped this, but I hoped for shades of Guernsey Literary and Potato Pie Peel Society, or maybe “Paradise Road,” or at the very least some insight into the Women’s Land Army.In brief, the story is about a woman who moves to a farm to wait out World War II and starts an orchestra that meets once a month or so. The book’s failing can be summarized as briefly: None of the plotlines, let alone the themes, is developed. There’s a Polish refugee who might not actually be Polish (spies? moral dilemmas? star-crossed lovers?!?) but nothing thrilling happens. There’s La’s farm work that breezes past chickens and planting potatoes for about five paragraphs total. Then there’s some thief-in-the-neighborhood intrigue that I can’t remember the resolution to because it was dull and underdeveloped, and finally there is the orchestra, the one that “saves the world,” which practices only a few times and has two performances at which nothing happens. Books that can’t help but be dull are one thing; who would expect drama from Bird Watching for Beginners or How to Be Your Own Accountant? But dull books that should be intriguing are the worst kind of bait-and-switch. This could have been about conflicts of personal and national loyalties, the transcending power of music, and ordinary people coping with extraordinary circumstances. The big mystery is how you could take these elements and turn out a tedious story. It also — worse still — is philosophically unmoored. For example, La wails about the destruction of war, but then thinks, “Hmm, those Nazis are so terrible that they’re actually evil! We must stop evil.” Later she laments, “Why would we develop more weapons? Who would ever go to war again?

This one has a couple of bittersweet storylines that pulled at my sympathies — the trusty assistant Mma Makutsi starts her own business and becomes involved in a bit of an intrigue, and Mma Ramatswe has a client who needs help rectifying a past sin.

K. Sandars, has filled in the story substantially — to see how substantially, read the Kovacs editionI prefer this edition because the translator, N. K. Sandars, has filled in the story substantially — to see how substantially, read the Kovacs edition. Normally translators with a flair for invention drive me mad, but in this case the original text (twelve stone tablets) is so fragmented, literally, that it’s nice having someone else fill in the blanks. The epic concerns the journey to maturity of our hero Gilgamesh, one-third human and two-thirds divine, who became the fifth king of Uruk (ancient Babylonia) at some time between 2700 and 2500 BC. Because Gilgamesh is tyrannizing his people, the gods create a challenger and companion for him, Enkidu. These two become friends, they embark on adventures mostly involving defying the gods (who rival the Greek pantheon for their childishness), and eventually Gilgamesh goes on a quest for immortality. I imagine the comparative lit. crowd enjoys this more than most people because of its parallels to other early works — for instance, there’s a flood with a Noah-like survivor, a ferryman who transports Gilgamesh across the river to the next life, the seduction of a man in a garden, etc. However, as nice as it is to say, “Oh, that’s like (whatever)!” it’s not enough to compensate for the charmless characters or their rather tiresome journeys. To be fair, I might feel that way as a result of the problems inherent in translating cuneiform — the original text might have been as gripping as The Iliad, which features some charmless characters who nonetheless leave me in tears. So really, I guess Gilgamesh shows the power of language over concept: an epic story needs great writing, or else it’s just a story about tedious people with big adventures. In spite of that, however, it’s worth reading for its position as the first epic. Plus it’s interesting to see what the greatest work of Mesopotamian literature is like, not that we’re likely to be browsing through others. For ardent fans, the good news is that back in 2003, some German archaeologists reported they found Gilgamesh’s actual tomb! However, as this is not a propitious time for digging around Southern Iraq, we’ll probably have to wait awhile for Gilgamesh-themed tours to spring up....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Mar 24, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19351.The_Epic_of_Gilgamesh

A dreadful old writer invites his offspring, all of whom loathe him, to his estate to celebrate his engagement to a glamorous socialite. It doesn’t take his kids long to dig up that she is suspected of murdering her first husband decades ago. The offspring would refuse their father's invitation (also maliciously extended to their mother, the ex-wife), except they'd run the risk of being cut out of his will — a prospect he’s tormented them with for years. So the troops assemble, in varying degrees of sobriety and sanity, to see if they can scuttle the engagement. At the very least, they can see what this woman is like; after all, it’s impossible that she actually loves their father, so is she hoping to cut in on their inheritance, or just secure an easy old age. . . or maybe murder him for the loot??  The characters are all so flamboyantly appalling that you don’t care who gets murdered, or why. Just watching them try to scheme and cope is entertaining enough (though I did develop a soft spot for the frumpy daughter who has made a name for herself publishing Bible-themed cookbooks).

And fold laundry at the same time??” Two possible answers: First, you’re not going to get patricide, matricide, human sacrifice and unintentional cannibalism on daytime TV because we still draw the line somewhere, and you have to admit those are pretty dramatic. More importantly, though, along with the dysfunction in the House of Atreus comes a searing examination of guilt, retribution, and justice. It’s a lot of philosophical bang for your buck.The first play in the trilogy, Agamemnon, sets up the conflict for the remaining two. Agamemnon returns home from the Trojan War to his wife, Clytemnestra, who has spent the last ten years plotting revenge because he sacrificed their daughter to appease a god at the outset of the journey. The verbal interplay at their reunion is the stuff of English majors’ dreams. Clytaemnestra’s subsequent murder of Agamemnon, with the help of a lover who has his own history with Agamemnon, is the stuff of Mafia dreams – though actually I’m only guessing on that one. However, Clytaemnestra’s revenge creates the conflict that drives the other two plays and generates the ethical conundrum Aeschylus ultimately wants to solve. For now Clytaemnestra’s son, Orestes, needs to avenge his father’s death . . . but what happens if you kill your own mother? And how is the cycle of revenge ever supposed to end??The Libation Bearers has Orestes debating what he should do, sort of like Hamlet, until the advice of his sister and the chorus women wins the day. . . and that’s when the excitement kicks up a notch. Clytaemnestra’s death at the hand of her son calls forth the avenging Furies — ancient goddesses of chthonic tradition who appear here as gorgon-like horrors, swathed in black, heads writhing with snakes. It’s so dramatic!! Also it’s fitting, for Clytaemnestra is like a Fury herself: in avenging her daughter’s death she acts within the old paradigm of blood ties that the Furies champion, wherein maternal claims are stronger than marital. So even though Orestes does his duty to avenge his father (in accordance with the current ethos), he’s pursed by snaky-haired horrors for killing his mother. Like his father, Orestes appears to be both an agent and a victim of fate, for in following the gods’ direction to avenge his father’s death, he both aligns himself with the Furies’ spirit of vengeance and becomes subject to it. Perhaps Orestes’ contradictory relationship with the Furies is Aeschylus’s commentary on a theology rife with snares and contradictions. In The Eumenides, Aeschylus resolves the problem, but his “solution” to the blood feud tradition is hardly unproblematic itself — read it and lose sleep! But you’ll know for sure why this is a masterpiece. ...more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,not set,Oct 2008,"Jan 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1516.Aeschylus_I
