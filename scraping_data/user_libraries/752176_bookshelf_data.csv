At one point, they took audience questions and someone wanted to know what books the panel read. I got excited for a minute, then I realized they meant like business or personal development books.But one of the women recommended this book and I decided to reserve it at the library because the lady who suggested it was awesome. Granted, she meant the original book probably and what I picked out and reserved on my library's tiny and not particularly mobile-friendly website was this. This is by the same author and is a cash grab supplement to the original book full of exercises and brief readings to help you stay on course. Look, I am not here to knock you down or dissuade you.

It's kind of hard to find gifs of and, more germane, my s these days get less action than the Tastee Freez in my hometown (and that place has been closed for 30 years, babump-tsssss) so, it's not really worth spelunking the Internet for. Anyway, that movie is based off of the first book and (a small) part of the second book in this series. A lot of stuff was changed but what I find most curious is the character, FBI agent Pendergast, who is the mc that runs through this long series was written out completely. Several of the other characters such as young biologist Margo Green, Chicago (NYC in the book) cop Vincent D'Agosta, elderly faculty advisor Professor Frock, and conniving competing biologist Greg Kawakita remain, in slighty altered forms. (Honestly, the Pendergast character is mad entertaining but strains credulity frequently. My favorite oddball fact: he owns an apartment in the Dakota. THE Dakota. And he works for the FBI. Okurr.) This book picks up around a year and a half after the first book. Our main characters (minus Greg, who seems to have disappeared) are trying to move on with their careers and their bad dreams when a police diver discovers two skeletons. One of them turns out to be the remains of a missing socialite and one turns out to be not exactly human so Lieutenant D'Agosta finds himself needing the expertise of the Museum of Natural History and the fabulous Dr. Margo Green again. Why does this thing look so similar to the museum monster they killed 18 months ago? Is it related to murders of homeless living in the tunnels beneath the city? WTF is track rabbit? (Y'all don't want to know and you probably really want to skip over the brief section where it's eaten.) This is high quality popcorn reading. Monsters, monster nom noms, science facts, crazy information about the multi-storied tunnels beneath Manhattan that is at least partly true, valiant cops and their incompetent leaders, conniving journalists, mean rich ladies. Lots of savory and sweet ingredients here, mixed well. I read the first book 20 years ago, so I don't remember it well. I definitely want to continue with this series though for at least a few more books.

The Original Stories series is, at least for now and hopefully going forward, available for free for Kindle Unlimited readers and this particular collection includes the audio versions for free as well. I don't seem to be able to focus well on audio for an entire book, but I'd love to hear this short story performed. Brenda and Amanda are precocious Michigan teenagers. Brenda makes movies, Amanda stars in them. Their lives are pretty promising and groovy until Amanda disappears in the woods one night. But while participating in the search party, Brenda hears the other searchers whisper to one another about a local campfire legend. About a magical bridge and a face-stealing imp named Opso. Brenda can't get this Opso guy out of her head and is convinced--in an army of one sort of way--he's responsible for Amanda's disappearance. And this is a horror story after all. Moreover, it's a horror story with fairy tale DNA. Maybe he is? [image]In unrelated news, I miss Adventure TimeI was into the story for 3/4 of the way. I can't quite decide on the ending but I'm not mad, I guess. I think maybe I'm rating it too high but I also think Malerman's writing on this is absolutely baller: the story has a chilly, goosefleshy vibe right from the jump.

This is a very short, article length memoir (memoirticle?) about Cheryl's mother-in-law passing away but, by nature of the author, becomes a reflection on how all of us deal with family (genetic and found), the difficult relationships found within, and how we face death.

When time came for everyone to Drop Everything AnRamona decided that she preferred Sustained Silent Reading to DEAR because it sounded more grown-up. When time came for everyone to Drop Everything And Read, she sat quietly doing her Sustained Silent Reading.Oh, Ramona. Such a bright, anxious, adorably pretentious*, boisterous and, as she would surely tell us, grievously misunderstood child. Part of her appeal is that she reminds some of us adults of younger versions of ourselves. *I say ""pretentious"" with nothing but love, Ramona. I'm positive I would have preferred Sustained Silent Reading too. It's book #6 in the series. Ramona is in third grade and has--oh no!--another teacher she doesn't vibe with. She and her older sister Beezus are even sort of friends and allies these days some of the time, but Beezus is now far away in the junior high school. Most importantly though, her father is going back to college and the financial strain this puts on the family--who are mostly living on their mother's income as a doctor's receptionist--and the time lost with the parent who gets Ramona best will be recurring themes throughout the story. As usual, the lightness and humor are mixed with plenty of real world issues delivered in Cleary's empathetic way. Ramona overhears her new teacher saying some not too complimentary things about her which puts her in a bit of a tailspin and her parents, who have problems of their own, brush off it off as Ramona being Ramona. Additionally, Ramona and Beezus must now go to Mrs. Kemp's house after school since their parents aren't home in the afternoons. And I'm 100% Team Ramona on this one: Mrs. Kemp kind of sucks. As always, there are some hysterical scenes included, like Ramona's oral book report and Beezus and Ramona struggling to cook dinner as punishment for complaining. About dinner the night before, naturally. This book is probably the most serious in the series thus far but it's still pitch perfect in that Beverly Cleary sweet but realistic way. ""That man paying for our dinner was sort of like a happy ending,"" remarked Beezus as the family, snug in their car, drove through the rain and the dark toward Klickitat Street. ""A happy ending for today,"" corrected Ramona. Tomorrow they would begin all over again....more",Notes are private!,2,14,1,"Dec 26, 2023","Dec 29, 2023","Dec 26, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/91243.Ramona_Quimby_Age_8

Everything Doug says will have two sides because he doesn't know what she did, and everything she says will have to hide what she knows. She has to be smarter than she was. She has to be careful, and it can't show.In a future so close to our own it might as well be now, the Stella/Handy company manufactures lifelike robot companions. Do you want a nanny, or a manny? A 50's housewife who cleans and bakes? Or perhaps you'd like a Cuddle Bunny? You can probably guess what that is for. Annie Bot, or just Annie, is #3 and she's owned by a manchild named Doug, who you will almost certainly want to punch almost on sight. Annie is in autodidact mode, so she's smart, very smart, and getting smarter. Doug naturally thinks Annie's advanced perceptiveness is a reflection on him but when a duplicitous friend of his pays a surprise visit, that will set events in motion that will have profound impacts on Annie (And Doug too, but seriously, fuck that guy.) This was good, I would say not great because the ending was a bit unsatisfying. More specifically, (view spoiler)[look Doug did kind of redeem himself at the end but I was still of course 100% team Annie and I get she had nowhere else to go but she barely knows that Cody guy. They interacted in total for maybe an hour a year ago and for half of that hour, he wasn't that nice to her. It felt very abrupt and not at all certain to me he'd help her or give her a place to stay. (hide spoiler)]There was a lot to think about here about the lives of women and AI (and the last bit is something we'll have to worry about all too soon and humanity will almost definitely do a shit job of managing it I'm sure. )This was a short book and I felt like maybe because of that some threads didn't get a chance to breathe and be explored (view spoiler)[Delta Bot deserved better, sniff, and the Kenny Bot thing seems like a missed opportunity (hide spoiler)] and the ending felt rushed.I do think Sierra Greer did a good job of writing Annie's POV and subtly shifting it as Annie grew into her own. I did like this, I just didn't fall in love with it. (I might be in love with Delta Bot though...) But if you are interested, I definitely do recommend reading it....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 05, 2024","Mar 06, 2024","Dec 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/156023123-annie-bot

We had to rebuilt our lives all Even though we were boat people who came to America in 1983, Ma's awful death made us refugees a second time in 1996. We had to rebuilt our lives all over again, but instead of doing it together as we had always done with Ma at the helm, each of us did it alone in silence. I have tried to process her death with therapists over the years, but retelling the narrative over and over again wears down even the steadiest of treadmills.Full disclosure: I won a copy of this from Celadon Books in a giveaway, so thanks to them and the author.Second disclosure, I had mixed feelings about winning this book because while I was interested in it, it also sounded like a huge bummer. Maybe you have read the description and think so too so let me say up front---Susan Lieu can WRITE, y'all. She writes like someone born to write and to be able to find your purpose like that is a blessing. When Susan Lieu was 11, her mother died from a botched tummy tuck and the surgeon, who preyed on immigrant women, never faced any real consequences. Her memoir spirals back and forth in time from this event, which was a smoking before/after crater in her life: remembering how her parents escaped to the US from Vietnam and her mother's creation of a small nail salon business from nothing that was able to provide emigration opportunities and jobs to various family members. In the aftermath, Lieu attempts to move on but can't heal from this event, particularly when her family stops talking about her mother. I find it really difficult to  memoirs since it's just someone talking about their life but this reminds me a bit of Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail. Not so much Strayed's style, for those who didn't like that book (although I loved it), but the way Lieu, like Strayed, can make any story edge-of-your-seat fascinating. The sensory overload of her stories about the food were my favorite, whether it is at the family dinner table or Sizzler. Despite the heavy subject matter, this is mesmerizing (the story of how her parents escaped from Vietnam, I mean, Jesus!)

She'd been smoking her feelings since she was fifteen, and now, at age thirty-three her real self was beginning to emerge. Unfortunately, her real self was horny, easily enraged, and no longer interested in making money.When I first read about this book, it was an easy ""Naw, I'm good"" for me and it really shouldn't work: Greta gets a job transcribing sessions for a sex therapist in the small hipster hamlet of Hudson, NY, (not coincidentally where the author is from) and becomes obsessed with a married female client she refers to as ""Big Swiss."" One day, Greta randomly meets her at the dog park, immediately recognizes her voice, and a torrid yet highly idiosyncratic affair ensues. Big Swiss has no idea meanwhile that Greta has heard her therapy sessions. Actually, she has no idea what Greta's real name is. This book should not work but somehow it does beautifully. It's absurd and smart and melancholy and hysterically funny and delightful and I absolutely loved it. But before we get too far, serious tw's for SA and suicidal ideation. But if these topics are not “no way/no how” for you, read on. Also, my eternal, primary concern: does the dog get hurt? (view spoiler)[There are various animals in this story, but principally dogs. One does get injured and it looks like something awful might happen, but it's ok. The doggo will be ok. (hide spoiler)]Greta....felt incapable of making plans for the weekend, let alone a wedding, let alone the rest of her life, and so their engagement had lasted ten years. In the meantime, she kept catching the bouquet at other people's weddings. The bouquet was never tossed into the air, it seemed to Greta, but rather hurled directly at her head, and she had no choice but to catch it and then quickly pass it like a football to the woman standing next to her, who always dropped it. ""Fumble!"" Greta yelled each time. The woman would then pick up the bouquet and pass it back to Greta, and Greta would feel like dying.Greta is a very specific type of person: a hyper-articulate, overly smart, underly employed woman whose wry, casual to somewhat affectless exterior masks a boiling caldera of long bound and gagged emotions. As you read the book, more and more of how she is begins to make sense and although I wanted to shake her many times, I loved her dearly.And I haven't even told you yet the sex therapist--not a licensed psychologist, more of a well-meaning, good vibes sort--is named Om and fond of giving his patients a gong bath (which Greta originally transcribes as ""dong bath"", one of many moments that made me snortchoke.) The combination of colors--the bright orange with the turquoise blue of the lake, his white shirt and teeth--opened a door in Greta's mind, a door she usually preferred to keep shut and locked, but now she let herself cross the threshold and roam around. It’s not so bad in here, she thought. Maybe she'd spend more time in this room from now on. ""What room?"" Om said. ""The future,"" Greta said.Beneath it all is a story about people who are hurting because the world has at some point socked them hard in the face and how they careen around and damage others, but mostly, and repeatedly, themselves. And the book is so brilliantly, meticulously put together, so meticulous that I didn't really notice until I was almost done when an anecdote that Greta casually mentions in the beginning turns out to be a moment in a much bigger, pivotal story. I had to immediately go back and read a bunch of scenes over.

""The people who said that,"" she whispers, ""were from another world. Now there is only this one.""The final book in the Fennbirn quadrilogy and while it's not perfect, I have five stars worth of feels, easily. Everything is ended with perfect messy neatness though. I will miss this wacky island and this even wackier generation of triplet queens so, so much. It's giving faint Dune vibes, especially with the themes of corruption, plotting, faith, and power, and how they tie into the inevitable end of all human-made institutions. This is still YA though, so you won't be subjected to Dune-esque multi-page soliloquys. If you've made it past the second novel in the Dune series (and I have), you can't be too sorry about that. One other thing I want to praise this series for is being a YA fantasy with a minimum of romance and what a rare and beautiful unicorn that makes it. What romantic entanglements do occur here drive the plot forward in a multitude of interesting ways and are not really the focal point. No love triangle. No meet cute but with halberds. No insta-love (maybe with Emilia. Fucking Emilia, I'll get to her...) No ACOTAR bone-a-thon vibes. This is high octane, high stakes, twists and turns, tears, laughs, pins and needles, burn the midnight oil finishing the last half. This series is fucking everything, fight me.I need to talk about some things, so fetch me an elemental to summon a spoiler tag:(view spoiler)[Ahh, that's better. It crushed me when Mirabella died, although I suspected that would happen. And it crushed me (to be sure, less) when Katharine died, although she died an absolutely baller hero and definitely got the shaft in life and undeath. And Arsinoe, thought giftless for so long and weak, saves the day with low magic of all things. I still intensely dislike Emilia, but hey--I used to hate her. Still, she's pushy and very possessive/fangirly regarding Jules and I just can't get behind those qualities as a romantic partner. I don't know wtf Kendare Blake was thinking with this character. Oh well, at least Mathilde survived.I kind of loved the redemption arc, such as it was, for Pietyr Renard too.  (hide spoiler)]I dragged out the reading of this series because I didn't want it to end and now it has. I'm sad, but I can't wait to see what is next for this author....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 18, 2023","Nov 25, 2023","Nov 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35391237-five-dark-fates

Although the chapters felt like laundry lists at times (""This person died in a plane crash, half of this band died in a plane crash, also this person died in a plane"" got to be the vibe after a while), there's a lot of information here. But, while it looks like Wilson did a LOT of research (check out her bibliography), I did catch little bits and pieces that made me wonder how many other errata exist. For example:Page 112, ""the Purple One and his guitarist Dr. Fink (aka, Dez Dickerson)"": Heavens to Paisley Park! Dez Dickerson was a guitarist in The Revolution until he quit after the 1999 tour. Dr. Fink, on the other hand, was a keyboard player in The Revolution. They are not the same dude! They even both appear in the movie Purple Rain, although only Fink has a speaking role and is part of The Kid's band (Dickerson appears briefly in a performance with his own band.) It's still a good and for the biggest part correct reference, barring some fine details, as far as I could discern when I looked up various stories for more information. And there were many stories I had never heard before; I had no idea that it recently came to light that Michael Hutchence of INXS suffered a head injury and brain damage in the early 90's which might shed some light of the troubles he had in the last few years of his life. And I did, at times, enjoy Wilson's snarky humor....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Sep 13, 2023","Sep 13, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61138554-rock-roll-nightmares

I made it about 1/3 of the way through this before I finally faced down the fact I wasn't interested in picking it up anymore. It's not that it's bad really. I am a huge fan of King's first collection, Night Shift, and none of his other anthologies seem to reach those dizzying heights. This also falls into the era where I stopped reading King because his writing style grew stale and overly fussy: ""I don't know how many people on the airliner just missed getting turned into strawberry jam, but I bet you do and I know the cockpit crew does. The only reason these guys are still alive is because the captain of that boat was bright enough to allemande right, and I was bright enough to d0-si-do....""I don't think this snippet can convey the weariness I have for how he could go on back then. I kind of speculate that he got too big to ""need "" editing and too many of his characters all had that same bloviating ""I think I'm clever"" affectation. People just don't talk like this. I did really like the first story, ""Dolan's Cadillac"", and as I said it's not bad. I'm a huge King fan, but this one might not be for me. I might also pick it up at a later date (In which case, future me: the last story I read was ""Popsy"".) BTW, King's having an amazing renaissance in the 2000's.

This will be the easiest  I ever write and you will ever read. Have you ever watched Drag Race ever or have you been curious about it or have you ever looked at this book and wondered if it's worth reading?If any of the above applies then, yes, hunty. This is the book for you.The first thing I want to get out of the way is this book was published in April of this year. Around the same time, the US version aired the finale of their 15th season and then their 8th season of All Stars. So, we're already behind, especially since All Stars is just touched on in the appendix. I assume more will be forthcoming, the first 10 seasons alone took up 400 pages, after all. The basic setup is a season a chapter, with a prefix, a very brief (as mentioned) All Stars chapter, no international seasons (the cheek, the nerve, the gall, the audacity and the gumption!), and some concluding words. It's an oral history so you hear from the dolls themselves plus production. It was lovely to hear the queens at least somewhat untethered from production control discuss what happened as they experienced it and it was also interesting to hear production talk about their side of things. Is it almost definitely tilted to make the show's creators look good? Duh. But it's still interesting to get their take on so many iconic moments.Great collection of voices, too, with multiple queens from each season and there is goopery and or gaggery on almost every page. Fun fact: just about every Season 9 queen claims that they were the first to recognize the last queen to enter the workroom was in fact THE Stefani Germanotta.Some queens I wish we could have heard from: Nina Bonina Brown, Alexis Michelle, Pearl (the stupid production feud with her needs to end), Willam (this stupid feud will never end and I both hate it and kind of live for it), Jade JolieQueens who were immediately identifiable even without context: Alyssa Edwards, Vanessa Vanjie Mateo, Laganja Estranja, Bob the Drag Queen, Bianca Del RioSpeaking of Laganja, I live for her getting a second chance with the fandom and hearing her side of things. And I agree with her, her roast set was unironically hysterical:[image]If she had said this to me, I would have fallen out of my chair, taken a Boniva, crawled back up and tipped her with everything in my purse. Hope the BluBlockers fit, Ganj!Look, I could keep babbling and gif the house down Versace boots take that thing off your face Gaga snatch my wig okurrr. But I'm not going to. Absolute must read. Here is producer Fenton Bailey reflecting on the show's legacy:One of the most moving things.....is seeing queens on the show who remember watching the show before they knew what they wanted to do with their creativity and it inspired them to do drag. That is so moving because gay people struggle to find their place in the world and it isn't easy to be your authentic self. I think that the very idea that people could watch this show....and then identify for themselves a career and a vocation and succeed at it.....is better than any Emmy....more",Notes are private!,2,14,1,"Aug 26, 2023","Sep 13, 2023","Aug 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62874233-and-don-t-f-k-it-up

We sat in the most isolated table we could find in our small town library and took turns reading it and far from the anticipated titillation, my thoughts amounted to ""This is nothing like Forever..."" and ""Judy should stick to kids and teens."" I decided then I was done with Judy's adult fiction. But then decades later I was in the Las Vegas airport and could not sit there reading my Kindle for one more goddamn minute. And I'm not going to make the most obvious Vegas joke but....I kind of did take a gamble and bought this from the sundries store. There's been so much press about how good it is lately. And....it's ok. The chief problem is it's way too freaking long. This story just doesn't have 400+ pages of steam. It's largely set on Martha's Vineyard, so it has vaguely Elin Hilderbrand vibes although it was published 2 years before Hilderbrand's first book and Elin Hilderbrand would never, ever write about 12 year old girls masturbating together.[image]ANYWAY, I did find this story about a complicated friendship between two young women that continues over decades, one rich and self-absorbed and one working class and good as gold--you know the drill--fitfully moving.

If you haven't read the press blurbs, you'll almost immediately guess anyway because the first half includes a barely fictionalized retelling of the violent end of his crime spree in Florida and half of the story is narrated by an eyewitness at a certain sorority house. Because the author wants the story to be focused on the victims and survivors and not on the small, vain, dead sociopath responsible, she strips him of his name and so, then, will I. When Judge Edward Cowart sentenced THE DEFENDENT in his first capital murder trial, he referred to him as a ""bright young man."" This book will challenge that notion, repeatedlyPhewww. It was tough, tough, TOUGH reading this book and I contemplated putting it aside more than once in the first half but I persevered through and I'm....I don't know if glad is the right word exactly, maybe happy that I persevered. I felt physically ill, sad, and so angry through much of it. But more objectively, I desperately wished that Knoll had included some kind of afterword to help separate fact from fiction.  I think it would have bolstered some of her claims because as it turns out she did so much research, reading through hundreds of pages of trial transcripts (during the pandemic, no less) and speaking to one survivor of the Chi Omega murders. Here, for example, is Knoll on her Instagram reading an excerpt of THE DEFENDENT's nearly inarticulate closing statement that rambled on for some 45 minutes. (But despite much reluctant Googling about this case and learning waaaay more than I everrr needed to know, I still don't know if there is any truth to some other allegations in the book. For example, is the stuff about the DA in Colorado factual?) Still, in spite of the somewhat slow first half and the somewhat uneasy feeling at first that Knoll was resting on the subject matter to do most of the heavy lifting, I was eventually won over and marveled many times at how well she captured the souls of these lost women and how this violence is like a tear in space/time. These women and girls were here, they had lives, they had purpose, they should still be here but they are gone. Excerpts that show Knoll at her finest:I was thinking about Denise and all the people she encountered in her daily life. The woman who sold Denise the multivitamin that made her hair healthy and strong and the family with the dog Denise sometimes walked for a little extra cash and the saleswoman at Denise's favorite clothing store in Tallahassee who always set things aside she thought Denise would like. I was wondering who would tell all these people that Denise was dead and if it should be me.*******I wondered where we were and what we were doing when he decided on us. I understood in a new way why premeditation carried a stiffer sentence than crimes that occurred in the heat of the moment. It was a unique kind of violation to think that when you were curled up on the couch, watching As the World Turns with your best friend, someone was plotting your demise. I found I was having difficulty swallowing.*******The hope is that when we come back in the fall, one of the ferns will flag Ruth's final resting place. But I can do better than hope. I have faith because nature is the very best example of integration. Things grow differently when they're damaged, showing us how to occupy strange new ground to bloom red instead of green. We can be found, brighter than before....more",Notes are private!,3,9,1,"Dec 11, 2023","Dec 17, 2023","Aug 05, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/101124639-bright-young-women

Probably not a lot of cash for an editor:Her whole body hummed and buzzed with the vibration of the forest. Max had never felt more ecstatic, more real, in her entire life......Max's whole body hummed.If I could figure out a way to count how many times something hummed, which I'm too lazy to do, it would be, I don't know, like a bunch. That would also make me kind of a dick. I guess I'm already being kind of a dick tho. Not really scary and too earnest to be dark humor which makes the denouement all the more “The fuck?”, this is a tale of some teenage girls who decide to fuck up their local representatives of the patriarchy. I want to say a little more about this because I’m tired and clearly I’m at the babbling stage. I can remember teenage boys being assholes. But you know who else are assholes? Teenage girls. I remember in 11th grade my friend Lisa got someone to cut her hair so she had a tail—it was all the rage at the time. Except hers was just a big chunk of hair in the back that was longer than the rest. Then she died it blonde, so now she had a big chunk of hair in the back that was longer than the rest that looked like it got lost on the way back to someone else’s head.So when we were in chemistry class and JP Morgan was making fun of her hair and he looked at me and said, “Vanessa, tell her it looks stupid.” and then Lisa turned around to look at me, did I defend her hairdo’s honor? No, I started giggling (see? I was the asshole in that story.)(view spoiler)[Case in point, the most fucked up thing that is done to the protagonist in this story is by a teenage girl at her school, who put a dead bird in her hair (which the protagonist didn't notice for a while, how the HELL do you miss having a rotting carcass on your head?) But it's a boy from her school who got human sacrificed at the end. (hide spoiler)]My point is, girl, this is overkill.ETA: So I wrote this about two hours before the food poisoning gurgling away in my stomach made a legendary appearance, so I think that's likely why this  has such a delirious, rambling quality.

Like a normal twenty-three-year-old? Like a normal person? The answer was no. I knew it would always be, and I was foolish to hope for anything different. Hope is like candy, I thought. It's sweet in the moment, until it rots your teeth out. My past would always be my past. My family would always be my family. So I'd never be fucking normal.Y'all, I bought this on a whim and was not--NOT--prepared for how much I would love this. Sure, the subject matter was right up my alley, can't go into details of course. And sure, I've seen a lot of horror movies with this trope and as other ers have mentioned, you'll likely guess what is going on before various reveals occur. Or maybe you won't, I don't know your life. Regardless, my opinion is it doesn't matter because this was a pure blast to read. A lord over all that flies blast.The one thing I was thought might be a reveal and blessedly wasn't was (view spoiler)[I thought maybe Vesper's new boss George would turn out to be Lucifer in disguise and when they hooked up I was like that is so metal of you, Rachel Harrison, but also fuck, shit, shittt! They are actually having sex and that means she is banging the Devil aka Dad, what in the Rosemary's Elektra Complex Baby, NOOOOO!. (hide spoiler)]But back to the beginning. Vesper was raised in a weird, secretive cult in rural New Jersey until she ran away at 18. But life in the outside world, while free of cult life and her mother, who is a B movie scream queen and, also, a bitch, is anti-climactic. When Vesper receives a mysterious wedding invite for the marriage of her cousin and childhood sweetheart and an offer to return home, she can't resist the adamantine bonds of the past. It's not like they will miss her at the soul-sucking chain restaurant where she works, especially since she just got fired.It's kind of weird they are just welcoming her home though, since people who leave are typically shunned for life. Oh well, nothing to worry about, I'm sure. It's not like there's an adversary there waiting for her.I thought this was smart, I thought it was clever how Harrison worked in a lot of real world thoughts about how your family doesn't have to define you, and while I took a bit of time to warm up, I loved Vesper and was rooting for her in the fucking insane climax which made me want to cry and cheer at the same time.

Her mother is a human beShe squeezes her hand, and for the first time ever in her life, Jessie understands that her mother is real.It's a revelation. Her mother is a human being who feels pain--sadness, loneliness, confusion. Jessie thought all grown-ups lived in a different atmosphere, one that was like a cool, clear gel. Adults had problems, Jessie knew--money and their children--but one of the benefits of reaching adulthood, she thought, was that you outgrew the raw, hot, chaotic emotions of adolescence.Ok, after years of seeing her on the best seller charts (and eventually realizing this was not Tiger Woods' wife), I have read my first Elin Hilderbrand and I loved it. Like really loved it. I laughed, I cried, I tried to blame it on menopause but, no. This is a genuinely greatly written book full of achingly relatable life moments even if your family doesn't summer on Nantucket--I assure you mine does not. I'm also not a fan of romance novels (which this isn't) or beach reads (which this is) but I loved this anyway. Elin Hilderbrand can write, y'all! This prose is gorgeous, the way the story is put together is sneakily brilliant and I spent 10 minutes on FaceTime the other night telling my unenthused mom the Foley-Levin family has got to pay more attention to little Jessie for shit's sakes!! I was so invested in these people. When the summer of 1969 starts, Kate Levin must send her only son to Vietnam leading to a tumultuous but ultimately life-changing summer for everyone (I'm going to pause here and say that Hildebrand's ""brand"" is comfort reads of a sort so don't start noping out, even if she doesn't mince words about the horrors of that war.) Kate struggles with perpetual agonizing worry about her son, Tiger, and finds drinking is the only way to manage it. Oldest daughter Blair is pregnant and learning almost immediately post-wedding that marriage wasn't what she thought. Middle daughter Kirby underneath her blustering exterior is aching to find herself and plans to rebel by spending the summer on....Martha's Vineyard. And the youngest, Jessie, is going through a lot too and for shit's sakes, would you people pay more attention TO JESSIE??Ok, Jessie clearly was my favorite, maybe because her sections of the book gave me luminous Judy Blume vibes: bright, sensitive, and Jewish because of her father (the rest of the kids are from Kate's first marriage) and missing her brother horribly while dealing with a first love that feels so real it made my face sting and a creepy tennis instructor and spending her first summer at her grandmother's house without her siblings. Kid, I am rooting for you.When she was a child, she told her parents everything: I'm hungry, I'm tired, I need to use the bathroom, I skinned my knee, I like, I hate, I want, I need. What if growing up means keeping some things to herself? The experiences of this summer will become as much a part of her as her bones and muscle, her brain and heart. Ten or twenty years from now, when she looks back on the summer of 1969, she will think: That was the summer I became real. My own real person......And then another radical thought strikes her: to her father, she is already a real person.[image]Oh! I didn't realize you were there. Pardon me, someone must be burning trash, my eyes are watering. From some reading I've done (Elin Hilderbrand, like me, was born in 1969, she attended the Iowa Writer's Workshop but dropped out, she lives on Nantucket year round), this book seems to be listed as a lot of reader's favorite. I've read a few of the other book descriptions and wasn't sure I was interested, but Hilderbrand is mad prolific and I'm definitely ready to read more. Also, if you are interested in these characters, Hilderbrand wrote a follow-up story ""Summer of '79"" that is available as an e-book or audiobook....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 10, 2023","Jul 21, 2023","Jul 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42283286-summer-of-69

That includes this small collection of short stories, many published originally in them fancy literary journals, about scallawags and small tragedies. All are set in the Ozarks, where he's from and still resides. Like other ers, I felt like the beginning was the strongest, but there wasn't a story I didn't like (maybe ""The Horse in Our History"" came close.) Here are some of the best, with quotes to set the Woodrell mood.Uncle--a young woman takes justice into her own hands to save herself and her mother from a rotted relative, leading her to ponder the nature of evil. This was my favorite.He was helpless, and I took to wondering if Uncle was still evil now that he'd become a helpless baby. Do babies learn evil in the run of their days, or bring it with them from the other side of all that you can see?Black Step--a Gulf War veteran ponders life back home and finds it wanting. Not the life he has so much as being alive in general.They tell me Dad committed suicide for reasons he dreamed up. His mind was too active. He had a round mind and it roamed. He could imagine the many miseries of this world flying over from everywhere to roost between his ears, but he couldn't imagine how to get away.Florianne--while most of his stories have their funny moments (black humored though they may often be), this is a wrenching tale about a father living with the long time unsolved disappearance of his daughter.At some point every old friend sensed my suspicion aim their way and several couldn't get over that moment of recognition, even after my suspicion rotated to the next ol' buddy, or slightly creepy cousin, that mailman with the pencil mustache.....I've often thought about that: If she'd stayed chunky would she be here now?

But when she learns through a chance encounter at a bar that her old college professor is in a coma, she is catapulted back 10 years to when she was a university student in Cork and the complicated relationship between her, her professor, and her best friend James. ""Whenever anyone has, like, an exciting romantic life, I'm all over it."" Exciting romantic life! When I couldn't even make Carey shag me in a bread shop.I was fully not prepared for how gorgeously written this book is and how it felt to experience so potently that time of your life again when you are an adult but not really and having the first adult friendships that will change who you are and you are constantly fucking up because you haven't figured out how to not fuck up and how exciting and terrifying and heartbreaking and amazing and precious it all is and I loved this book so much for taking me back there. ""Sometimes I feel like I was in a coma or something, before we met.""God...I, ok I said the stuff about fucking up already, did I? I remember this, I remember how this felt. But I'm also decades older than these characters so I also want to hug them and shelter them and tell them it will all be ok and how I know it's hard but please run after that person and chose your words better because this might be the only moment you have to make it right. ""Like""--he fiddled with the string edges of the blanket--""you know, people like me, I'm funny. I can write jokes. I can always get laid. I can always make a living. I can always get a job. That's a lot, you know?""He braided the pieces of string together. ""That's a lot for one person to have. I think it's ok if I never get to have, like, romantic love.""Ok, I am slightly watery eyed at that quote but I'm not going to cry, goddamnit, (I blame menopause--can I blame menopause??) because this isn't a sad book. It has sad moments, certainly, and moments so intentionally cringe that your pancreas will flip inside out but it's really, really lovely and warm and funny and Caroline O'Donoghue can string prose together and make beauty page after page after page. I will hereon read anything with her name on it....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 21, 2023","Oct 09, 2023","May 15, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63094957-the-rachel-incident

Not Toni Natalie.I'm the one who got away.So if anyone remembers that crazy news story about some self-help cult in New York state that was branding women a few years ago, this is a story about them. The one that had the actress from Smallville (Allison Mack) in it and Catherine Oxenberg's daughter, India? If you saw the HBO documentary, ""The Vow"", Toni Natalie was featured in season 1 and (briefly, I think) in season 2. This is her memoir of her time spent with Raniere in the years leading up to the creation of NXIVM and his adoption of the moniker ""Vanguard"" (named after an arcade game he used to play) and the literal decades of torment she endured from his minions for having the audacity to reject him:""And, Toni?""""Yes?""""You need to start calling him Vanguard.""Vanguard. Like he was a hunky member of the Justice League and not a megalomaniacal con man who looked like Rick Moranis. I laughed in her face.""Fuck that,"" I said.In what became the NXIVM playbook (borrowed heavily from Scientology), Toni was subjected to endless harassment after she left: her home was broken into multiple times, her mail was stolen, her dog was poisoned, she and her family were bankrupted by an avalanche of nuisance lawsuits, and most bizarrely, with assistance from higher-ups in NXIVM Mexico, a plan was hatched to lure her and other ""enemies"", including cult de-programmer Rick Ross, to Mexico where they would be thrown into jail and tortured/murdered. Fortunately, the ""smartest man in the world"" and his inner circle were largely dumbasses. And Toni Natalie?Toni Natalie is a fucking badass. And because she was there in the early years (she was the one who introduced Keith Raniere to Nancy Saltzman, the heads of NXIVM who are currently both in prison), she knows these people well and has a lot of insight to share. Or gossip, some would say. Regardless of what you call it, girl, I was living:Keith already had disciples, but his ""girls"" all had flaws. Pam was a space cadet, too flighty and dim to stand with him. Kristin was too headstrong, and didn't bring enough expertise to the table. Karen had the brains and the capacity for evil but lacked the charisma....While he had wooed me as a lover and partner however, he had failed to convert me to the Church of Keith.Gossip/insight with a heavy splash of vinegar, I should add. If anyone has earned this, it's Toni. This book covers the period right up to Keith's guilty verdict and the indictment of his co-conspirators and since Toni followed the trial closely and often in person, you'll learn lots of interesting, sometimes schadenfreude-laden and hilarious, tidbits from that time as well:Her [Clare Bronfman's] attorney at the time, Susan Necheles, was a hot mess: frustrated, interrupting the judge......After the hearing, Necheles was unable to find her car, leaving Clare to wander the streets while photographers snapped her picture.So, to summarize--Is this worth reading?As you might have guessed, I have gone down a deep rabbit hole with this story and I still found this book interesting. Toni was an insider from the start, often reluctantly. This is perspective no one else has. I also think you can easily follow this without knowing the extensive backstory. I want to read ONE book/watch one documentary about NXIVM. Is this it?No, you should definitely read Don't Call It a Cult: The Shocking Story of Keith Raniere and the Women of NXIVM by Sarah Berman.In conclusion:  Natalie and her ghost writer, reporter Chet Hardin, write well and succinctly and the snark really is the icing. I'm not sure if this is a four star read for everyone, but I got four stars of entertainment out of it....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 05, 2023","May 12, 2023","May 05, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44287145-the-program

She's afraid I'll tell her that the world won't let herNiagra, so full of scrumptious hope, is looking at me, there, afraid I won't share her vision. She's afraid I'll tell her that the world won't let her have her dreams realized quite so easily, and probably not at all. That her dream is just a thread of fantasy to hang by for a while, but it'll go limp one horrid night somewhere down life's road and start coiling around her pretty neck. But I don't want to tell her...Because those young dream-years are by far the best years, when you have hardy faith and gallops of energy and go for it all, perhaps in a dumb fashion but with gusto, right up 'til the night the dreams goes limp and starts that coil.Where were you when the dream went limp? Daniel Woodrell is probably best known for writing Winter's Bone, source of the movie with Jennifer Lawrence. I read that book over 10 years ago and loved it. The movie captured the plot but not the plain spoken, sometimes gloriously vulgar, often transcendent tone of Woodrell's writing. Reading his prose is like swooning, repeatedly, and wanting to grab a highlighter but you'd highlight damn near the whole book. This is a story about Doyle Redmond, an Ozark boy from West Table, Missouri, (a stand in for the author's hometown, West Plains, a recurring location in Woodrell's work) A charming shitkicker with a poet's soul, Doyle has tried to make it as a glossy yet earthy literary type and even made it to the Iowa Writer's Workshop but has remained obscure and never quite ditched his shitkicker roots (Doyle, also, shares at least some of his life story with Woodrell.) So when his marriage hits the skids, he borrows (more or less, probably less) his wife's prize Volvo and heads back east and finds himself on an errand back to West Table to get his older brother Smoke out of trouble. But it turns out neither brother are much invested in that errand and much more invested in a huge marijuana crop Smoke and his girlfriend Big Annie are clandestinely growing in the woods. Doyle is also instantly invested in Big Annie's daughter, Niagra, an otherworldly beauty with an oddball intellect.Smooching at the Dog'NSuds, my class ring worn on a string around a girl's neck, parents who just didn't understand--I'd never been there. Now here I was, having a sort of teenage love affair, only I was thirty-five years old having it, and hear this clear--it was everything common legend had glossed it up to be, and more. But full of hidden shoals.(Hear this clear: the way Woodrell writes is like sunlit honey in your mouth.)Alas, there is trouble on the wind in this hawthorn and cannabis-scented Ozark paradise: the local bad element know the Redmond brothers are up to something in the woods and have been skulking around looking for any opportunity to make mendacity. And as the money garden continues to ripen, the dread does as well as you wait for bad shit to manifest. Recurring Woodrell themes of land and family resonate here, not just of those things in the present but the eternal endurance of those things and the celestial destiny that binds you to both. He's also a genius at making you love small time cons. Maybe Doyle and Smoke are lovable because they're the protagonists, but their steadfast commitment to each other and their own brand of mud-and-blood-spattered chivalry make them a pair you can't help but love, as long as they aren't your neighbors. Do you like grit lit? Are you interested in hillbilly noir? Do you like writing that can turn an anecdote about the dates on pennies into a tragedy of Aristotelian proportions?

Any similarities to January 6th or Pizzagate are purely intentional. It's very near the end of World War II in a German village in the Reindhardswald region of Germany, home of the Sleeping Beauty Castle, the origins of some famous Brothers Grimm stories, and fantastical forests. Uwe Fuchs is a decent man with a young family. He quietly dislikes the Nazis and mistrusts what the government says about the war's success. But he also worries about the rumors about Allied troops murdering all Germans they find. He also struggles with feelings of being an inadequate protector and conflicting loyalties toward the Fatherland. This allows him to be drawn into bad company with even worse ideas. And you can guess where that leads-[image]How you gonna keep em down on Der Bauernhof when they can't keep their eyeballs in their heads?Alma Katsu is well-known amongst horror fans for writing stories that are grounded in a historical setting that's purposefully chosen (she also writes the Red Widow series.) I loved the thick atmosphere of the time and place and enjoyed the odd bits of history. In Nazi Germany, the Grimm fairy tales were a propaganda weapon so valuable that every home was required to have a copy. ""Little Red Riding Hood"" became an allegory for how the Jews kept the German people down and ""Cinderella"" was transformed into an homage to Aryan beauty. It's a novella so the ending is somewhat abrupt, but this was a good story with a great message that might have become repetitive over a novel's length but worked fine here....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 21, 2023","Feb 22, 2023","Feb 21, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62157138-the-wehrwolf

Lula on one side of me, Connie on the other...Connie and Lula now wore two guns apiece. They each had a gun at the small of their back and they each had one in their purse. My fear of getting shot by the Carnation Killer was considerably less than my fear that I'd get shot by Connie or Lula.Stephanie Plum returns in her ninth outing, her world preserved in golden amber with top notes of Love's Baby Soft and Cheez-It's. There's a soothing consistency to this series, even as it strains credulity: Stephanie is still not great at her job, Morelli and Ranger are in a frosty detente over their carnal but loving impulses toward her, and Ranger and Lula are constantly helping Stephanie perform her bounty huntering without complaint or (apparently) compensation (which is really the most unbelievable part to me.)This time, Vinnie is on the hook for some new type of immigration bond when the bondee, Samuel Singh, vanishes. All of Vinnie's employees are told to give this top priority so Stephanie sets out to comb Trenton looking for Singh and his landlord's missing dog. Along the way, she attracts the attention of a possible serial killer and before you can say ""I'm president of the Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam Fan Club, yes there still is one excuse your mouth,"" she's getting weird messages, even worse photos, and potential witnesses keep dropping dead. There are plenty of funny bits to this story of course--Lula tries an Atkins Diet type thing with farcical results, Lula, Connie, and Stephanie take a paid trip to Vegas, and Stephanie is always Stephanie. I didn't find this one as funny as some of the last few books. Evanovich more often than not lands her slapstick humor but too often here she drives right past ridiculous but funny and lands in plain ridiculous.And while I can forgive a lot of improbable things in this series, it was too much when (view spoiler)[Stephanie, who KNOWS she's being stalked by a wackadoo serial killer, loans her sister Valerie and poor Albert Kloughn her apartment. Oh, they also have a newborn. (hide spoiler)]For that matter, the main mystery plot is pretty out there too ((view spoiler)[a bunch of losers are playing a game trying to assassinate each other IRL and win prizes but the guy running the game decides they should kill Stephanie as well because he's into her, so he sends someone to kill her but then decides he actually wants to kill her himself? IDK, I'm glad Stephanie shot the shit out of him. His motive was fucking stupid. (hide spoiler)]) But, these books are all about the mood you are in when you read them. They are light and slapsticky; maybe I wasn't in the mood for slapstick. They are strangely addictive though and as of this writing there are 29 books in the series so I can rest assured Stephanie will rally and be around when I need her....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 03, 2023","Feb 06, 2023","Feb 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40331.To_the_Nines

I like some of the original approaches the author took to This was a Kindle Unlimited find and it's a good and thorough refresher of Greek mythology. I like some of the original approaches the author took to the material, like explaining the significance of various plants in myth. For instance, Persephone created mint when she shredded a nymph who was trying to seduce Hades; it's kind of weird Persephone would get jealous when she was only married to Hades because he had kidnapped her and dragged her to the underworld but those gods and demi-gods were a wacky emo bunch.I also enjoyed the author giving more context (and therefore, ironically, humanity) to the Gods' actions, as in this passage about Hera:It is easy to dismiss her reactions against Zeus, his mortal lovers, and illegitimate children...but we must keep in mind that Hera above all, as a deity symbolizing marriage and family, is a representation of stability.I did find the material dry at times (although, have you tried reading Hamilton's Mythology recently? Talk about dry) and the writing was occasionally clunky. But I learned a lot and highlighted the crap out of this book to the point where I figured I might as well buy it. I'm sure the people I buttonhole in the future while I explain the origin of the mint plant will be so grateful. The author, Lucas Russo, has a whole series about ancient mythology, including volumes on Egyptian and Norse, if you are interested in the subject....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jan 29, 2023","Jan 29, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56273652-uncovering-greek-mythology

I really loved her first book, Miracle Creek, so to start out, that is a more satisfying read in my opinion.Like many second novels, this book repeats themes of the first book (one such example, the Korean immigrant experience in America), digs deeper into those topics, and adopts a more challenging, zigzag course. I'm very conflicted. The narrator of this story, 20 year old Mia, has such a unique, compelling voice. I simply don't think I've ever encountered anyone quite like her in fiction before. And Angie Kim writes so beautifully. This story is a mystery but it's wrapped in literary fiction about a family in crisis and also wants to examine the interactions between disabilities (and, in a broader sense, ""otherness"") and the justice system. I love novels that do more than one thing. The problem for me was the way Kim brought that last topic into play caused the story to slalom down a path of increasingly unbelievable (and, frankly, weird) plot points, especially when it comes to (view spoiler)[Eugene's alibi (hide spoiler)], until it started to fly off the rails around 50 pages from the end. I hate to say this, but despite the many things I loved, I'm left with an ending that was unsatisfying. However, reading is an individual experience and that's especially true here. I am neither Korean nor have a family member with Angelman Syndrome, for example. I will definitely still read the next Angie Kim....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jan 15, 2024","Jan 23, 2024","Jan 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56868434-happiness-falls

Weinman considers this book--whose title is inspired by James Baldwin's book Evidence of Things Not Seen, about the Atlanta child murders--a companion to the first one and it's going to hit hard and repeatedly at the beliefs of a lot of readers, my own included. The overarching theme most of these tales have in common is ""Who gets to tell our stories?"" Some articles are better than others and at least one I thought was too long, but there isn't a bad, or even mediocre, one in the bunch. In fact, there are SO MANY brilliant articles here that it's hard to single out a few favorites but I'll try:""A Brutal Lynching. An Indifferent Police Force. A 34-Year Wait for Justice"" by Wesley Lowery""How the Atlanta Spa Shootings-the Victims, the Survivors-Tell a Story of America"" by May Jeong""Picturesque California Conceals a Crisis of Missing Indigenous Women"" by Brandi Morin""The Prisoner-Run Radio Station That's Reaching Men on Death Row"" by Keri Blakinger""Has Reality Caught Up to the Murder Police?"" by Lara Bazelon (If you watched Homicide or The Wire, prepare to be really depressed)The appendix of further books, articles, and podcasts is huge. I'm still tempted to take some pictures of it.

The universe had protected Alex....There was no reason to feel anxious--the fear had been transmuted, the way it often was, into excitement, the memory always dissolving until it was only the idea of fear, and when had the idea of fear ever been a convincing deterrent?Rating this book bedevils me, as ratings sometimes do. I really like Emma Cline's writing and this book is very Emma Cline, dealing with ""agency, cost, the performance of gender, the undercurrent of violence roiling just beneath the surface of ordinary life."" (In honor of the sticky fingered protagonist of this novel, I just stole that line from ""the Paris Review's interview with Cline.) If you've even glanced at the other s, this is a divisive book. And as much as I like Emma Cline's writing, this felt like a slog although it absolutely got much better in the second half and I had to see how this ended AND it will linger in my brain for a long time.Why it's so hard to read has largely to do with a somewhat opaque and extremely unlikable (but brilliantly conjured) protagonist and a languid plot that could almost seem like not much is happening, although that's not really the case. ""Why are you like this?"" asks one exasperated kind-hearted soul who has the misfortune of getting entangled briefly with Alex. And we would like to know that too, although perhaps the point is sometimes there just is no reason. Some people are just toxic jellyfish, drifting through life without a purpose beyond survival, not intending malice exactly but always leaving shrug-laden disaster in their wake. When Alex is booted from latest trophy girlfriend status from her latest wealthy boyfriend, she convinces herself that he is only angry with her and resolves to spend a week on Long Island scraping by until his Labor Day Party where they will magically reunite and she will return to a life with endless days of leisure and high thread count sheets. Yeah, this idea is laughable, but she can't examine that too closely because she has a looong trail of burnt bridges behind her (including an unsavory ex she's ripped off) and nowhere to go. And so this book recounts her week spent in various Hamptons careening from one port in the storm to another, just waiting for Labor Day where her future will magically re-manifest. What makes this story worth it is Emma Cline's writing and her thoughts of what separates the likes of Alex from the idle rich:""I'm sure they do,"" Alex said, ""I'm sure they care."" Though, as she said it, she didn't believe it was true. Even for people like Jack, with parents like his. Or the kids at the party the night before. Hundreds of years ago, their parents might have abandoned their babies in the woods. Instead, the neglect was stretched out over many years, a slow motion withering. The kids were still abandoned, still neglected in the woods, but the forest was lovely.Not my favorite Emma Cline (that would be The Girls) but still absolutely brimming with her jittery energy and bravely unafraid to walk in the shoes of unlikable but complex and fascinating characters....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 12, 2023","Nov 17, 2023","Jan 13, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61986136-the-guest

But it gets worse when it appears there is a murdery monster on the ship.

But every summer for the past several years he comes out with a new thriller As of this fleeting moment in time, I have read every Riley Sager novel. But every summer for the past several years he comes out with a new thriller that is usually a fun mish-mash of a popular trope thrown in multiple blenders. Pages will be turned and midnight oil will be burned. In this entry, Kit McDeere is a home health aide who is currently unemployed because people think she either killed or assisted in the suicide of her last patient. Forced to accept the only job she is offered, she winds up working high above the Maine coastline at a crumbling estate that is the site of an infamous triple homicide in the 1920's (the story takes place in the early 80's.) Her patient is the even more infamous supposed killer: Lenora Hope, who has a Lizzy Borden-esque rhyme the local children repeat to tell the story of how she bumped off her family one night in 1929. It turns out there are other mysteries at the house and, even worse, the structure is architecturally unsound and is rapidly sliding off the edge of the cliff. But Kit can't get hired anywhere else and has nowhere else to go anyway. Then shit starts happening. So, credit where credit is due, this IS a page turner. You'll definitely want to finish it fast. But will you find it all believable when you are done?Schmaayybe. So many revelations rain down near the end I had to stop more than once to flip back and go, ""Wait...how....?"" Sager eventually explains them all but I still wasn't totally satisfied. And I want to talk briefly about our protagonist, Kit. Despite driving the point home that she has no money and no other job prospects, repeatedly, she goes out of her way to tell her patient that she's scared of her and offends the other staff on the first day and then just keeps on saying more dumb stuff. And she's in her 30's. She's worked as a home caregiver for several years. She should be smarter than this. I feel there's a way to make this story still work and hum at a rapid clip without having such a perpetually and, more importantly, unrealistically foot-in-mouth protagonist. I did enjoy the surprisingly heartwarming way this wrapped up but this is not peak Riley Sager. Wait, what is?

It was Hera, the queen of the immortals, who gave this task to me. I won't defy her.""But Hera wouldn't save him, I thought. Artemis has show me that the gods could be as ruthless to their favorites as they were to their enemies. Jason thought that Hera's blessing was the same as her protection. He didn't see that she had merely given him the chance to succeed. If he failed her, it would be better he die than survive long enough to face her disappointment. But he knew nothing of the gods. Jason thought the world was built for heroes. I knew we had to build it ourselves.Ok, so, I liked this but I didn’t love this, although I do love Atalanta and the tiny cadre of ass-kicking mythological women she reps for. And that’s down to liking the message here (being a girl who makes her own rules and wants to do the things boys do can be hard and lonely) more than the delivery.Stories of Atalanta differ, because that's how mythology goes, but this version does stick to the best beats of the Atalanta myths: she was abandoned in the woods as an infant by her father who wanted a boy, she was spared a grim fate by Artemis, she was a legendarily fast runner, a deadly archer, and stronger than most men. She was a bonafide Argonaut and she killed the famous Calydonian boar. She was also a favorite companion of Artemis until she fell out of favor (which really wasn't hard to do with Artemis. Even a relatively feminist goddess like her has pretty regressive rules about women and consent.)[image]This is how our fleet of foot legend Atalanta is often depicted. Try not to focus too much on how well or swift she was gonna run without a foundation garment.The story sounds exciting but it really dragged in places as some of the quests end up being anti-climactic and, to be fair, that is how mythological stories are told some times. Like all set up (""We landed the boat and this army of six-armed giants with chainsaws for arms and laser beam eyes attacked us"") and little to no payoff ("".....so, uh, we like threw rocks at their leaders' head and he exploded so they all ran away."") As much as I love Atalanta, my eyes were crossing with boredom at points.(The best part was when Medea enters the tale with her chaotic neutral witch vibes. I NEED a Medea retelling.)I also thought it was an odd choice to (view spoiler)[spend SO much time with Meleager, whom Atalanta clearly had a connection with, only to kill him off and have her meet back up with Hippomenes who gets less than half the story that Meleager gets. I get we’re supposed to think Hippomenes is more compatible with how she lived, but that just didn’t come across.

Boy, it sure would suck to be trapped there overnight when the tide comes back in and there's a killer on the loose or something. (Look, I'm not telling you anything the book jacket doesn't already.) Among those at the party is our narrator, Daisy Darker, a girl with a suitcase full of unhappy family memories and a BIG secret. Don't worry if you forget that last part, Daisy will remind you. Frequently. So, this obvious homage to And Then There Were None is fine. The writing is a bit clunky in places (those hodge podge metered verses that were left as clues made my skin itch.) It's not deep or exceptional and you'll almost definitely guess the biggest mystery early on.

And I sincerelyJohn Scalzi was having a hard time during the pandemic but he still managed to crank out a novel, if not the one he had been planning. And I sincerely fangirl at my fellow Ohioan John Scalzi (who was born the same year as me.) I don't think anyone would say this is his best novel. It's interesting and cute and has a genuinely suspenseful ending but it's definitely a minor effort and, as other ers have said, it may not age well. Another thing is it just took me forever to read despite being a slender 258 pages. This book is small but also feels padded. Things take too long to start happening and the dialog and exposition have this plodding redundancy at times like we wouldn't pick things up the first or second time. This isn't Gravity's Rainbow here, I think readers can follow the story just fine.(In the interest of full disclosure, I also had a 2 week sinus infection while reading this so factor that into my lackadaisical experience.)Ok, enough bellyaching. Jamie Gray is working at a Grubhub-like startup in New York City in March of 2020. God, what a shitty time to be alive. Then he gets fired, finds himself now a delivery driver, and by chance gets a dream job offer when he delivers Thai to an old acquaintance. He later finds out it involves kaijus and an alternate earth. And honestly, the details about the alternate earth and its biology are the best part of the story. And because you should go in fresh, that's all you need to know. Can't leave without a shoutout to my favorite kaiju:[image]Mothra living her best hot kaiju summerI have struggled to not make it seem like I'm dumping on John Scalzi.

I'm sorry to be blunt but this book is just not good. Like it's sort of ok, but I really want to ask anyone who rated it three or more stars if they are pulling my leg. Written in the style of unartful YA, this book fails to deliver scares, characters to care about, or much of anything else, sadly. Jules is a typical teenager someplace in Ohio (someplace that regularly shows classic films at the theatre which, where that?) whose life is turned upside down when her mom brings home a patient named Mae who seems to be the victim of ""Satanic"" abuse. Just listen to the rubes at the hospital fret about the pentagram on her back and SATANIZMS like they've never seen a Motley Crue album cover before. Jules' mom, meanwhile, is a questionably adequate psychiatrist and shitty parent because she's waaaay more into this patient than anyone in her family. Jules is at first annoyed that Mae has moved into her room, then she thinks Mae is cool, then she starts to suspect Mae is pulling a Single White Female and icing her out of her own life. Oh, and there's some town in Ohio where a devil worshipping cult lives and Mae may be from there. If you came for teen angst, congratulations! You are in the right place and then some. If you want Luciferian frights, there aren't any, really. I mean, there are the cult people but those bozos are mostly in the background because, you guys! Mae is trying to steal Jules' crush and is like totally copying her Halloween costume and--[image]My advice is to pass this one by, but I can't speak for the Netflix series they made of this.

She aWhen Lexi was 18, she chanced into a bit part in an iconic slasher film where she met her future husband, the son of the film's famous director. She also saw a castmate die in a horrible accident that would make the film live in infamy as ""cursed.""In the present, Lexi is a recently widowed parent with a teenage daughter (we'll get to her--trust) who has just run off to the Florida Keys to work with her grandfather on the long-awaited sequel to the first film. But then life starts imitating art too closely when a hurricane sweeps in and they all find themselves stuck on the island in its aftermath and then the body count starts rising. Say, wasn't that the plot of the first film? Ok, lovers of mysteries and final girls, I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is the author is a psychologist and he is really able to get into the heads of his protagonists. The family interactions between Lexi, her daughter Quinn, and her estranged father-in-law Rick all felt authentically complicated. I think, with a better editor, he has genuine promise. As for the bad--Jesus, Mary, and Jason Voorhees did the ""climactic"" ending and coda drag on. There are pages of dialog and exposition that need to be trimmed here. Final showdowns should not be this loquacious and leisurely and I really didn't need all the details of the main character's self-help reading list. And trust I won't get into spoiler territory but the reveal kind of felt like a foul ball. Finally, I'm sorry but I have to add I HATED Lexi's obnoxious, dumbass daughter. Having just read a book where a teenager sulked and made irrational decisions but managed to be believable, relatable and endearing anyway (The Burning Girls), I started wishing for Quinn to get eaten by sea slugs almost immediately.I truly think the author has potential, but this book is weighted too heavily in family drama and not enough murder and mayhem for me and has an overall plodding tone. Sorry to be a downer.

Of course, he also thought he would never take a drink, not after seeing what it had done to his father.Sometimes we just get it wrong.So, I had seen a few so-so s of this book but someone I know told me it was great, particularly the scenes talking about alcoholism and she was right. Feeling like a man having an out-of-body experience, he returned to the roadhouse and parked in the back of the dirt lot. He felt good about this. He also felt like a man who has just picked up a loaded gun and put it to his temple....There would be ladies in there who would want to dance. Ladies with curls, ladies with pearls, ladies in skirts, ladies in cowboy shirts. There always were. He wondered what kind of whiskey they had in the well, and God, God, great God, he was so thirsty.King's writing is as great as it ever has been and maybe that's why I was able to overlook one of the chief criticisms of the book: the villains are.....a choice. But I still really liked this and I still say read it. King was inspired to write this sequel to The Shining because people kept asking him what he thought ever happened to Danny Torrence and he was likely interested in that himself because that book seems like it might have been particularly personal to him. He was an alcoholic with a family writing about an alcoholic with a family and was now able to look back on it from 20 or so years of sobriety. So, yes, young Danny Torrence is Dan Torrence now. His mother, Wendy, is dead and he's been nose-deep in the bottle and drifting since he was a teenager. But something compels him to settle down in Vermont and get sober. And that something will have something to do with forces of good turning incomprehensible wheels against forces of evil. In this case, that evil is some middle-aged flea-bitten RV enthusiasts who are really monsters who murder children with The Shining. For food.[image]Meth lab optionalBut maybe these monsters are picking on the wrong kid this time.There's something comforting about King's prose at the same time it's giving you unbearable anxiety. His fiction leans hard into the idea that good is stronger than evil and I find that soothing these days.Also, Stephen King is in top form these days!

So, I just read Black Sheep by Rachel Harrison and despite a plot outline I could trace in my sleep and somewhat thin characters, I still really enjoyed it. So much that I had to dart to the library and scoop up an armload of Rachel Harrison. Turns out that the same critiques about characters etcetera apply here, but the enjoyment has considerably waned. Maybe it is the most terrifying part of the werewolf curse: it's rare to find a good werewolf story. [image]Present company excepted, David. Chill.So, you'll know what's going on from the cover of the book and the story wastes no time introducing us to Rory, who is home helping her pregnant and now single twin sister get through things. But Rory has barely gotten back to her old stomping grounds and flirting with her high school crush when she gets attacked and bitten by what she tells people was a bear. But we all know it ain't no bear. Every story beat was predictable, but worse--I was just bored. Intensely bored. None of these characters interested me. They are pleasant enough but paper thin. Rory's love interest? Don't care. Rory's struggles with the lycanthropy thing? Meh. Rory's unresolved anger with her mom? Yeah, if I don't care about the werewolf part, I definitely don't give a shit about that.[image]Geez, you werewolves are so sensitive!Ok, ok. Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. Harrison seems like she's on a writing journey. Maybe this particular book just didn't work for me.

I can see it on your face. And because of that, you're easy to manipulate. If I can mess with your head, if I can get you mad at yourself for not being the Carrie Soto you think you should be--I will beat you every time,"" he says. ""And that means Nicki will slaughter you.""Last year, I had a mediocre reading experience for no reason in particular--although there were certainly bright, bright spots: The Rachel Incident, Big Swiss, Summer of '69, and Bright Young Women. This year, though, I resolved to read more stunners and the first one has arrived. I fucking loved this book. And guys, I don't even like sports--playing or watching. But who forgot to watch Svengoolie last night because they were watching old tennis matches on YouTube? What is even happening to me right now? Carrie Soto was a record setting tennis player in her youth. Coached by her father, a tennis player turned much sought after coach, she has spent nearly her whole life on the court training to be the greatest player there ever was. And she has the scars to show for it: almost no friends, almost no hobbies other than tennis, and coupled with her pure love of the game is a blazing ambition that balms and scorches in equal measure. And the scorching, as many know, lasts much longer. To borrow a metaphor from the book, if you've ever publicly kicked yourself for only getting 99 on an exam while everyone else glares at you for breaking the curve, you've had a taste of the Carrie Soto bug. So when Carrie sees a young player named Nicki Chan is marching relentlessly toward breaking her record, she decides at 37 to get back in the game. And along the way there will be a lot of talk about things other than tennis, but what I loved most was Reid's take down of pervasive sexism in the sports world: Carrie is castigated by commentators for being ruthless or, even worse, not ladylike, she is told by a male tennis player that her record doesn't matter since women play fewer sets (it doesn't go well for that dude), and is called The Battle Axe, with begrudging affection at best. (And I see you, Taylor Jenkins Reid, throwing in other moments like excerpts from an ESPN type commentary show where the female tennis player on the panel is frequently talked over by her male counterparts.) This book is why I read literary fiction. I felt drawn into Carrie's world, into her heart and soul. It didn't matter that I barely know professional tennis, I was riveted. But I also loved her and felt my heart break for her and thought a lot about what lessons I could take with me from this book, all of which is what the greatest writers give you. Also, points to some of the best, quietest moments in the book between Carrie and her agent, Gwen:Gwen smiles, ""Do you know what part of 'If--' is actually relevant right now? To this moment? 'If you can make one heap of all your winnings/And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,/And lose, and start again at your beginnings/And never breathe a word about your loss.'""She must be messing with me. Surely she knows she's just described my greatest fear. But no, I can tell from the look on her face that she sincerely thinks that I'm that brave, that I am doing this because I am okay with losing big. Not because I am terrified of losing it all. And it stuns me silent, for a moment: just how vast the gap is between who I am and how people see me. I am so much smaller than the Carrie Soto in Gwen's head.Carrie and Gwen are discussing the quote from the poem ""If"" by Rudyard Kipling, which apparently is over the doors to Centre Court at Wimbledon. Seriously, I don't didn't watch tennis. ""No,"" I say. ""Not about what you're talking about. Not about love. I've never felt brave about that.""""Oh, for fuck's sake, Carrie,"" Gwen says shaking her head. ""You just [spoilers clipped]-when no one thought you could do it. And now you're going to sell yourself short on the easy stuff?""""It doesn't seem easy to me at all,"" I say. Gwen stands up and puts her hand on my shoulder. ""Falling in love is really quite simple,"" she says. ""You want to know the secret? It's the same thing we are all doing about life every single day."" I look to her.""Forget there's an ending.""So, wow. WOW. Although I own a few of her books from BOTM, this is my first Taylor Jenkins Reid book I've read.

I love how the books and the TV shows fill in the richness of this universe and this collection does a great job of that.Be prepared to humbly visit Wookieepedia young Padawans, as some of the character's names may not ring a bell (and some weren't even in the movie.) No stories are from the perspective of Luke, Han, Leia, or Chewie (although they appear in the narratives of others frequently) but a few other big names share their POV.Some stories are better than others, some have too fleeting a connection to the source material or were too uneven, but there are no stories I outright disliked. This is 550 pages without a real goose egg in the bunch.The stories:* ""Eyes of the Empire"" by Kiersten White: An Imperial tech who is tasked with monitoring probe droid footage is forced to re-evaluate when she sees the fruits of her labor. 4 stars*""Hunger"" by Mark Oshiro: One of many stories that deals with the war's ecological effects, this melancholy tale is narrated by a famous wampa. Actually, the only famous wampa. 4 stars*""Ion Control"" by Emily Skrutskie: The Battle of Hoth told from the perspective of Toryn Farr, the young woman who operates the ion cannon. 4 stars*""A Good Kiss"" by C. B. Lee: This one is narrated by one of the nameless rebels who dart by Han and Leia while they are arguing about him leaving Hoth. Interesting premise, but too romancey for me (also ""You cold, Yavin baby?"" is a creepy pickup line in any universe.) 2 stars*""She Will Keep Them Warm"" by Delilah S. Dawson, who is a goddess: The tale of one pivotal tauntaun's life on Hoth just wrecked me. 5 stars*""Heroes of the Rebellion"" by Amy Ratcliffe: Corwi, a PR agent for the Rebellion, attempts to make the most of the Hoth evacuation. 4 stars*""Rogue Two"" by Gary Whitta: Zev Senesca will die in the Battle of Hoth but we won't talk about that. Instead, here is the story of a rescue mission and life in Rogue Squadron. 5 stars*""Kendal"" by Charles Yu: This unique take is entirely from the perspective of Admiral Ozzel, who dropped out of light speed too soon on the way to Hoth, as he's being force choked by Vader. 4 stars*""Against All Odds"" by R.F. Kuang: The story of the life and last few minutes of Dak Ralter, Luke's pilot in the Battle of Hoth. This one also hit me in the feels, but it's also sweet and hopeful. 5 stars*""Beyond Hope"" by Michael Moreci: The Battle of Hoth as seen from the Rebel trenches. 3 stars*""The Truest Duty"" by Christie Golden: And here's an AT-AT's view of the Battle of Hoth, courtesy of the ill-fated General Veers. 4 stars*""A Naturalist on Hoth"" by Hank Green: I loved this unique take on some non-military members of the Rebellion and their contributions, chiefly a young naturalist who advance scouts Hoth. 5 stars*""The Dragonsnake Saves R2"" by Katie Cook: This goofy one page comic is adorable 4 stars*""For the Last Time"" by Beth Revis: Newly promoted Imperial Admiral Piett comes to have a different, unwanted perspective on Vader. Don't worry, Admiral. Not a lot of tenure in a job like yours. 3 stars*""Rendezvous Point"" by Jason Fry: Lots of interesting detail about flying an X-wing and life as a fighter pilot, courtesy of a post-Hoth Wedge Antilles. 5 stars*""The Final Order"" by Seth Dickinson: Captain Canonhaus ponders life in Imperial service on the soon to be doomed bridge of his star destroyer. 4 stars*""Amara Kel's Rules for Tie Fighter Pilot Survival (Probably)"" by Django Wexler: Mixed feelings about this one. I loved the details about flying a TIE Fighter and how they mostly suck compared to an X-Wing, save in a few crucial details. Could have done without the shower grab ass between the two female pilots--they're TIE pilots who take joy in shooting the heads off of astromechs, I'm not shipping these two! 3 stars, with 5 for the TIE stuff, 1 star for the grab ass.*""The First Lesson"" by Jim Zub: Yoda awaits a visitor on Dagobah.3 stars*""Disturbance"" by Mike Chen: Palpatine meditates and finds new ways to ruin Vader's life 4 stars*""This is no Cave"" by Catherynne M. Valente: Leave it to Valente to tell a weird but lovely tale from the perspective of an Exogorth who is definitely not a cave. 5 stars*""Lord Vader Will See You Now"" by John Jackson Miller: Miller wrote one of my favorite Star Wars novels, A New Dawn. Rae Sloane, an ambitious officer in the Imperial fleet, accidentally makes an important discovery in the Hoth asteroid field. 3 stars*""Vergence"" by Tracy Deonn: The dark presence on Dagobah tells a story about its shifting relationship with the Jedi. 4 stars*""Tooth and Claw"" by Michael Kogge: Bossk (the reptilian--ok, Tradoshan technically--bounty hunter in the group Vader summons to find the Falcon) encounters a surprise while looking for a wookie pirate. This was a decent concept but the character decisions don't make any sense and ultimately has no consequences for Bossk or anyone else down the line. 2 stars*""STET!"" by Daniel Jose Older: Another tale about bounty hunters that doesn't really pan out, despite the cute premise. 2 stars*""Wait for It"" by Zoraida Cordova: Ok, here's a bounty hunter tale that works and no surprise, it's about Boba Fett's trip to the star destroyer. 4 stars*""Standard Imperial Procedure"" by Sarwat Chadda: Life is not great for Ashon, an Imperial engineer who has been demoted to garbage duty. But there's something afoot on his star destroyer involving these bounty hunters and maybe his luck is about to change. 5 stars*""There is Always Another"" by Mackenzi Lee: I really don't know how to rate this one. This tale told by Obi-Wan's force ghost sounds like him in one paragraph, and then sounds nothing like him in the next. (Would Obi-Wan say that Yoda made ""a meal of his martyrdom""?) 2 stars*""Fake It Till You Make It"" by Cavan Scott: I had never heard of Lando's ex-smuggling acquaintance, Jaxxon Tumperakki, but I loved this fun, goofy redemption tale of his role in the evacuation of Cloud City 5 stars*""But What Does He Eat?"" by S. A. Chakraborty: Another tale seldom told about how the Empire makes life miserable for the average working person, in this a star chef in Cloud City who doesn't want to cater a dinner for Vader 4 stars*""Beyond the Clouds"" by Lilliam Rivera: This tale of a would-be bounty hunter and a fight for worker's rights in Cloud City never really took off for me 2 stars*""No Time for Poetry"" by Austin Walker: The adventures of two more bounty hunters, Dengar and IG-88, after they leave the star destroyer to find Solo. 3 stars*""Bespin Escape"" by Martha Wells: The evacuation of Cloud City from the perspective of an Ugnaught clan (if you watched The Mandalorian, Kuill was an Ugnaught) 4 stars*""Faith in an Old Friend"" by Brittany N. Williams: The three droid memory cells who make up the Millenium Falcon's computer narrate this funny and sad story of their time on Bespin. Will someone ask Brittany N. Williams to write more, faster? 5 stars*""Due on Batuu"" by Rob Hart: A gloriously goofy fan service tale of Willrow Hood's attempt to become a smuggler in the final days before the Empire's invasion of Cloud City. Willrow, who was originally a nameless extra during the Cloud City evacuation scene, has become a superfan legend over time. 4 stars*""Into the Clouds"" by Karen Strong: This story about an aristocratic resident of Cloud City and the pilot she has a crush on is fine, but I didn't really see the point of it. 2 stars*""The Witness"" by Adam Christopher: This was a nailbiter about a storm trooper who hits Cloud City on Vader's detail and decides she's finally had enough. I found it kind of improbable she was able to witness the pivotal moment she describes and I don't really buy some of the final parts of the story but this was still good. 3 stars*""The Man Who Built Cloud City"" by Alexander Freed: A story that tells another side of Lando Calrissian and the nameless security guards of Cloud City. 3 stars*""The Backup Backup Plan"" by Anne Toole: A plot against the Imperial takeover of Cloud City goes sideways. Or does it? Good story but too thin characters left me not caring that much. 2 stars*""Right-Hand Man"" by Lydia Kang: YA author Kang is a physician in her spare time so she's the perfect choice to tell this tale about the philosophical medical droid who attaches Luke's new hand. 5 stars*""The Whills Strike Back"" by Tom Angleberger: So for those who don't know, the Whills make the force somehow with the Midi-Chlorians. Don't worry about it though. I love the absolute cheek of this fan service closing story, narrated by some bickering Whills. The Life Day reference alone is worth it. 5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Dec 26, 2021","Dec 29, 2021","Dec 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53965796-from-a-certain-point-of-view

She was so sick of people talking over her, of men interrupting her and speaking on her behalf. As if they knew even a fraction of what went on in her head, as if they knew what it was like to be her, for a day, for an hour.Yes! Simone St. James is back with a new book--ok, this one is a year old and there's already a new one on its way. As always, this is mystery that explores the long reverberations that violence brings, particularly violence against women. St. James' books have this very relatable female perspective without being preachy or clunky. She also always manages to walk an immaculate tightrope in her novels, balancing parallel contemporary mystery and ghost stories. And I'm happy to report that her books never end with ""Oh yeah, so the ghost did it and nothing you read in the last 300 pages matters.” (I don't know what you'd call this genre. Neo-gothic mystery? Is that a thing? Very Bronte sisters if they had crap jobs and one bedroom apartments....but on the bright side, no tuberculosis.) When Shea Collins was nine, she barely escaped a would-be abductor and now, twenty years later, that event still impacts her life daily. She can't ride in a car, she loathes going out at night, she doesn't talk to strangers. After work she goes home to her apartment, where she bolts all doors and windows and spends hours working on her true crime website, The Book of Cold Cases. One cold case Shea obsesses over is a serial murder from the 1970's. A young and wealthy local woman, Beth Greer, was tried and acquitted and improbably continues to live in town as an enigmatic recluse.Then one day Beth Greer walks into Shea's day job and Shea completely breaks character and asks Beth if she can interview her about the ""Lady Killer"" case. Amazingly, Beth agrees. But looking into a decades old murder can be dangerous and almost immediately weird things start happening to Shea. But for the first time in 20 years, Shea has passion and purpose and some weird shit and a budding camaraderie with a woman who might be a manipulative psychopath aren't going to spook her. Also, someone gives Shea their pet cat, Winston Purrchill, which might be the most adorable thing ever (Guys, it's ok. Nothing happens to the cat.) I'd say if you want to start with Simone St. James (and yes! You should!), my favorite is The Broken Girls. But I also think her books hit each reader in a very individual way. Maybe this book will be your favorite. Or maybe The Sun Down Motel will. All fine options!And now, I kvetch about something spoilery so I'm not trifling with this tag:(view spoiler)[I don't get why Shea had to turn Beth in for Lily's murders at the end. Lily was bad, Beth clearly felt like no one would believe her--with reason--and had legitimate fears that Lily would kill Detective Black or Ransom in retribution. Lily was always going to be a serial killer and she would definitely involved or implicated Beth in it.

""Only then do we find freedom does not depend on being able to do what we want; it depends on not being able to do what we want yet still experiencing self. Love is only measured through pain. Our ability to feel human pain determines the depth and strength of our love.""--Keith Raniere's word salad for one victim who wanted to leave the secret branding/sex cult inside NXIVM(His surname is pronounced Ray-NEAR-ee, btw.) I don't normally put tw's on my s but I'm going to talk about sexual abuse and false imprisonment and other crazy shit so, you've been notified.The sound that you hear is the sound of me obsessed with the NXIVM story, a truly bizarre tale of a Scientology-esque self-help group whose leader is serving 100+ years in prison for child pornography, racketeering, wire fraud, and a bunch of other charges. Forgive me then if I yammer on about it because, frankly, everyone I know is sick of hearing about it (other things people are sick of me talking about: the Friday the 13th series, Dungeons and Dragons, drag queens, Spiderman, fondant.)You probably remember the headlines about this from a few years ago, the ones about Smallville actress Allison Mack branding women as part of a ""slave"" cult. I have watched both The Vow on HBO and Seduced on Starz more than once so this book was a no-brainer for me. The author, Sarah Berman, covered this story for years when she worked for Vice and while the book does recount parts of both documentaries, there's lots of information that was new to me. Catherine Oxenberg's valiant struggle to get her daughter India out, something both documentaries spend a lot of time on, barely gets a mention here. There are so many stories. Too many stories. Raniere began his career as the creator of an MLM called Consumer's Buyline, that was shut down for being an illegal pyramid scheme. He eventually hooked up with Nancy Salzman, a nurse, practicing hypnotist, and NLP student, and created the organization that ultimately became NXIVM, peddling mealy-mouthed self-help courses to those who could cough up a few thousand dollars per class. Over time, they became popular and attracted a number of mid-level celebrities, although most wouldn't stick around. Most importantly, they attracted the Bronfman sisters, Clare and Sara, two gullible heiresses to the Seagrams' fortune with deep pockets who would fund the group's illegal and/or seriously fucked up activities for over a decade. This includes bribing someone in the Dalai Lama's organization to have him come speak at a NXIVM event.(I should note here to be fair the Dalai Lama wasn't implicated in this and seemed somewhat skeptical of Raniere. The person who was bribed was fired.) Much like Scientology, NXIVM students were never ""integrated"" (their version of Scientology's concept of clear), thus the need to take ever more and more expensive courses. But, if you signed up so many people underneath you, then you could become a coach and take classes for free and theoretically be on a salary track IF your team signed up enough people under them , although very few actually made any profit at this. And thus the MLM aspect, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Here are a few of the other things Raniere either did or had NXIVM do at his behest:* Bullied their ""enemies"" with private detectives and harassing phone calls* Installed spyware on Edgar Bronfman's personal computer (Bronfman, the father of the Clare and Sara, was considered an enemy)* Buried defectors under a slew of frivolous lawsuits, causing at least one to file bankruptcy* Conspired to lure at least two former girlfriends who left the group to Mexico under false pretenses in order to have them arrested and imprisoned on false charges* Kept a young Mexican woman they had lured into the country illegally imprisoned in an empty room for two years with no contact other than her NXIVM handler because she had the audacity to want a boyfriend who wasn't Keith Raniere* Had intercourse with her underaged sister and took sexually explicit photos of her, thus leading (eventually) to those child pornography charges* Created a secret women's ""empowerment"" society within NXIVM. Just hearing about the details of it required the exchange of collateral in the form of sexually explicit pictures, secrets about their family (those who couldn't think of anything were encouraged to make something up, like molestation), the deed to their house, etc. Many, many of these women were coerced into having intercourse with Raniere. And yeah, they were branded with his and Allison Mack's initials (the participants were told various lies about what the symbol meant.)I don't claim to understand a lot of what his adherents did, but I do understand that once they handed over that collateral (which turned out to be a monthly instead of a one-time thing), they had little to no agency. For instance, when this happened:After dinner, Mack made another announcement. ""As much as I would like this to be just a bonding trip, it's not,"" she said, according to Nicole. ""I have another assignment for you guys....I am going to take a close-up photo of all of your pussies.""[image](This man is the late singer/comedian, Bishop Bullwinkle. Please stream his music.) Fast forward, it all comes crashing down. Raniere and several of his top followers are serving time (including that piece of shit, Clare Bronfman.) Others turned state's evidence. Others that should have faced charges didn't (including that other piece of shit, Sara Bronfman.) Jeez, how do you wrap up a story about this? It's fascinating. Don't join any group that requires nude pictures to be a member.

It's a soothing tradition, even though nothing quite matches the glorious chaotic insanity of his firAnother summer and another Riley Sager thriller. It's a soothing tradition, even though nothing quite matches the glorious chaotic insanity of his first book, Final Girls. This one is good although it has a slowish beginning. Not Sager's best but also not his worst. It was fun and entertaining and occasionally preposterous and that is all I'm looking for here. Despite the familiar settings--a newly reopened summer camp with a tragic backstory, horror in a creepy Rosemary's Babyish high-rise (which gets a blink and you'll miss it shoutout here), this boozy, vaguely Rear Windowish tale--I still continue to find his books suspenseful and surprising (Except last year's book, Survive the Night, you can probably skip that one and instead read The Final Girl Support Group by Grady Hendrix, because it's super excellent.)The rest of Sager’s not-so-secret recipe: a young woman with a traumatic past, a handsome friendly dude who may or may not be up to no good, a twisty plot, and murder. [image]Fade in: Casey Fletcher is moderately successful actress who is in hiding at her family's Vermont lake house after a personal tragedy (see? Check!) and very public meltdown has sent her into a downward spiral of sadness and bourbon.And I like drinking. A lot. I like the way I feel after three or four or five drinks. Limp and floating. A jellyfish drifting in a calm sea. Even though I know it won't last--that at some point in the future I might be dry-mouthed and headachy and heaving it all back up--that temporary weightlessness was worth it. But when Casey saves her supermodel neighbor from drowning, it starts a whole thing. Casey catches a vibe something is amiss and thinks the husband is up to no good, especially when the neighbor goes missing shortly after. Good thing Casey's been keeping a friendly eye on them with her binoculars and is on the case. Everyone will totally believe her when she explains that she thinks someone has been murdered because she's been spying on her famous neighbors for days now while consuming snootfuls on her back deck.And obviously no spoilers, but Sager does do something new in this one (I don’t know that i necessarily loved the new thing, but we’ll see if it becomes a new ingredient, I guess.)Sager is pretty much an old faithful and at this point it's just a given I'll select him as my Book of the Month pick next summer too....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 07, 2022","Aug 16, 2022","Nov 28, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58909880-the-house-across-the-lake

I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I break them right away.""--J.D. Salinger via Holden Caulfield, The Catcher in the RyePOV: You're me reading a list of upcoming 2022 novels:""An erotic thriller...""Oh, nah, I'm good, dog, thanks."".....by Sara Gran""Oh freaking hell. Nevermind, I wanna read the shit out of that.Oh, Sara Gran, you minx! I would read the proverbial phonebook if she wrote it cause that would be one wacky yet exquisitely melancholy phonebook. Her writing is so full of her simultaneously otherworldly and earthy reflections on one of her fixations: how trauma reinvents us. It feels like she takes her pain and pours it into you and a flower grows there. And you are never the same because of this goddamn beautiful flower and somehow you are both a little better for it even though you're like 500 degrees of separation from Sara Gran. Ok, I know what you're thinking:[image]Her vibe is just contagious and I'm not a professional word writing person. Lily Albrecht, however, was once a celebrated author with the perfect husband before life punched her hard in the face and left her once brilliant husband virtually catatonic with unexplained early onset dementia. Then one day another bookseller approaches her at a book fair about a rare magic text called ""The Book of the Most Precious Substance."" This sets wheels in motion and as Gran reminds us--maybe too many times--Lily and her hunky yet intellectual bookselling partner-in-crime Lucas aren't the ones in the driver's seat. And while they're having fun for now chasing the book across countries and oceans and doing sex stuff and eating fancy cheeses (as the story progresses, the sensuality of all things increases: food, sheets, smells, physical and....personal geography, etc.), they may not like where this is going. Now I had to admit: All my excuses were lies. Shit and liesIt turns out this rare text is a book of sex magic, so hence the ""erotic"" part. There is a good amount of explicit sex but this isn't a book about 50 Shades of mindless banging. Grief, the kind that fills your marrow, is never far from the author's mind:""The answer is different for everyone. But you need to somehow begin again. The old you, the old life--it's over. Gone forever. And it's very sad, because you lose the person who your wife--your husband--loved. It's another loss. After I met Madame, I found out how I was now. Who is this new person, this person who has lost so much, been so scarred?""The other women at the table nodded knowingly.....I could see each had some understanding of what Kat and I knew: a loss so dark it changed who you were, changed the planet you lived on, changed what words meant.It's about the journey. The kinky, sad, fucked up journey. Like always.I liked this, although I liked Gran's Claire DeWitt detective series better (start with Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead, the first in what is for now a trilogy.) Gran also wrote a delightfully spiteful horror novella, Come Closer, which feels like a spiritual cousin to this. Actually Claire DeWitt feels like a spiritual cousin to this book's Lily, but she's way too savvy to ever fall for Aleister Crowley's The Joy of Sex.I can already feel the shivers the last chapter gave me sticking to my ribs....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Aug 21, 2022","Sep 06, 2022","Nov 10, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58945991-the-book-of-the-most-precious-substance

Enjoying life as it unfolded was always hard. Since ConsI thought about how much I wanted to enjoy the sunshine and the hummingbirds and the flowers. Enjoying life as it unfolded was always hard. Since Constance died it seemed physically impossible. It was all just a long, infinite blacktop of things you'd regret not enjoying later.This is the third and I hope not the last Claire DeWitt novel from the beautiful, esoteric mind of Sara Gran and it's been a joy to watch her writing evolve over the course of this trilogy. And while on the surface, these books are mysteries, they are really about heartbreak and connection. Redemption and resilience. Metaphysics and breaking the nose of some louse who takes credit for your work. This book picks up right at the end of the second one. Claire DeWitt, the world's both greatest and most idiosyncratic detective, awakes banged up as hell from a hit and run that she's sure is a murder attempt. Who and why are the questions along with what will Claire do instead of going to the hospital, which is walk off with a concussion, possible broken bones, and a cop's taser. A stolen car and a handful of illegal stimulants later, Claire is out to solve the mystery of who is trying to kill her, which she is sure is connected to the greatest mystery of her life: what happened to her childhood friend Tracy, the girl who could have been the world's greatest detective. Poor Claire has had so much pain in her life. Tracy, her mentor Constance murdered in a random mugging, investigating the homicide of the man who was probably her true love in the last book. ""I'm fucking up everything. Everything I've done has been a mistake."" ""Yes...Probably. That's what it means to be a person. It means you make horrible decisions, and you fuck everything up. It means you love people, and they leave. It means sometimes no one loves you at all. That's the state of like 90 percent of humanity at any given moment. You don't need to make a religion out of it. You don't need to memorialize everything that hurts. Everything changes, and half of finding peace in life is to stop resisting it. Someone who loved you yesterday doesn't love you today. Someone you loved is gone now.""So, not to get too personal but as I read this I was flying across the country to attend what would soon be a family member's funeral and help another family member with a breakthrough Covid infection they caught while staying with them in the hospital (I'm fine, everybody is fine. Thank you science for the booster shot and monoclonal antibodies.) I sincerely love Sara Gran and the universe (and the Columbus Public Library) for sending me these words right when I needed them.But, sometimes, a crab did get out. Change was possible. At least for crabs. Maybe for me. I saw one escape from the barrel, sidle all the way across the pier, clicking his claws on the wood all the way, and jump back into the giant, dark, mysterious ocean, where life was harder, but the rewards, on some dim foggy mornings, at least for a few minutes, at least sometimes, were worth it.I hope all is well in your world, friends....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Nov 10, 2021","Nov 18, 2021","Nov 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38532150-the-infinite-blacktop

(Only the menfolk will make that decision of course. She's just a wee woman, fer God's sake.)She thought perhaps they'd stand up and say their good nights now. But no, the group plunged into a Hail Mary, and then another, and another. This was ridiculous; was Lib to be stuck here all evening?I instantly loved starchy, no-nonsense Lib. Sure, she's harsh the first few days of the watch, basically frisking Anna and tossing her room to see if she has a hidden food cache. As a Nightingale, she takes her job as a nurse with great gravity. I loved her spunkiness and distaste for religious superstition. And as she gets to know the extraordinary Anna, she's not afraid to go ham on anyone who doesn't have her best interests at heart: her parents, the buffoonish local doctor, the village priest, the journalist from Dublin. We'd all be so blessed to have her in our corner. ""And where did he get this nonsense about her being in grave danger? I caught Kitty bawling into her apron this morning because she heard you say something to the doctor about a deathbed.""Lib decided to go on the attack. ""What would you call it, Mrs. O'Donnell?""""The cheek of you!""""Have you looked at your daughter lately?""I'm struggling with what to rate this, so I settled on 3.5. I'll go ahead and round this up. The first half moved slowly, but I loved Emma Donoghue's writing. I think it might be maudlin, but I love how she wrapped the story up. It seems improbable, but the author also explains in her note at the end it has a historical basis. Ifs and buts, fruits and nuts, as they say. And good grief, what a superstitious morass 19th century Ireland was.

There's nothing wrong with a 3 star . It was amusing and was an easy read, I just don't think I cared that much despite the author’s attempt to make it mean something more.

Syd lives in a dumpy dead-end small town with her mom and little brother and is secretly in love with her best friend, Dina, who is dating a super jerky jock boy. She also discovers she has superpowers. Or a super curse, maybe. Did she get them from her dad? Is this why her dad killed himself recently? Then I Googled season 2, only to find it had been renewed and then cancelled because of pandemic logistics.[image](Okay, it was actually cancelled last year I just didn't know. I'm not a scientist, you guys!)Since S1 ended on a cliffhanger, I got the graphic novel from the library thinking I could maybe see where the story was going to go. First, I wasn't crazy about the animation style. Tell me Syd doesn't look like exactly like emo Olive Oyl:[image]My bigger complaint is holy cats! The graphic novel is pretty different from the show. And turns out, I liked the show much more.Some of this is because the show obviously had more time to flesh out characters like Syd's mom and brother, Stanley, Dina. But the characters are different too and can we talk about (view spoiler)[Syd's dad didn't commit suicide, she MERCY KILLED him per his request, whaaaaa? (hide spoiler)] The story starts out similar but quickly diverges to arrive at a completely different ending. And again, the show's ending was much better. So now I'll never know what was going to happen in S2. The burning question, as always, is what's the deal with Paris Hilton? I realize there's not a one-to-one relationship programming-wise. But still, while this show was cancelled, Netflix greenlit a trashy dating show about rent boys, a trashy dating show about furries, a reality show about some dumbass TikTok people, and a cooking show with Paris Hilton. I bet Paris Hilton doesn't even know what a mirepoix is. The moral turpitude of it all. tl;dr: The show was better than the book, it ended on a cliffhanger, and it's all goddamn Paris Hilton's fault.Edited to add: This is sitting in my memory like yesterday's PBR in my stomach.

I loved the nearly perfect The Institute and really liked The Outsider. This book is the firsI've been on a Stephen King rediscovery mission of late. I loved the nearly perfect The Institute and really liked The Outsider. This book is the first in a trilogy that has a thin tie to the latter in the form of a character, the fabulous Holly Gibney. King calls this his first straight-forward mystery and he won the Edgar Award for it in 2015. It was also adapted for TV by the Audience network so, uh, congratulations to all 12 people who subscribe to that. The book opens with a killer driving a stolen Mercedes into an early morning crowd of job seekers. He is never caught, and this amongst other things haunts retired and divorced police detective Bill Hodges. When he gets a taunting letter from the killer, it unexpectedly breathes new life and purpose into him when a day before he had been idly considering eating his revolver. Hodges is sure Mr. Mercedes is going to mass kill again, and he's right, of course. As the investigation grows more personal, Hodges is joined by his teenage neighbor, Jerome, and Holly Gibney. Holly is on the autism spectrum and King makes her into a living, breathing person, not just a fluttery, convenient, delicate genius stereotype. This whole team is unexpectedly fun together and the best part of the story. There's also one startling ""NOOOOOO!"" scene, something King loves to do. (I'm going to throw out a very minor spoiler for anyone who gets wound up about these things like I do: nothing happens to Odell the dog.) This is a perfectly fine mystery and it has a slam-bang final act, but it also has a saggy, too long middle. King is a great writer, but sometimes he can ramble on. If you've read him, you'll know exactly what I mean. There's also a lot of POV of the killer, too much for me, and (view spoiler)[I don't know why Steve has to throw weird sex shit in so many of his books but I had to peace out on some sections because the detailed ramblings of an incestuous sociopath just aren't popping for me. (hide spoiler)]If I finish this series, it'll be mostly for my love of Holly Gibney. I liked The Outsider better; you don't need to have read this trilogy first....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Aug 15, 2021","Aug 29, 2021","Aug 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18775247-mr-mercedes
