That’s what Scott Warms and his friend, narrator Marty Hench, learns in TheYou’re not paranoid, the saying goes, if they are actually out to get you. That’s what Scott Warms and his friend, narrator Marty Hench, learns in The Bezzle. Cory Doctorow tackles the unscrupulous American private prison system in this book, demonstrating how capitalism’s death grip on the carceral state has resulted in harm beyond the physical cruelty of solitary confinement or guards turning an eye to violence. Nowadays, it costs people money to be incarcerated—money most of them don’t have—and any pretense that the system is designed for rehabilitation has been dropped in favour of pure profit for private equity. The resulting book is, in my opinion, the typical mixed bag one gets in a Doctorow novel: terribly fascinating infodumps explaining systems most of us had no idea existed behind the scenes of our society mixed with unremarkable characters with about as much personality as one of those tiny bags with two biscuits you get as complimentary snacks on Porter flights. I received a copy in exchange for a .Marty Hench is a forensic accountant. He makes his living auditing companies suspected of wrongdoing, and he makes twenty-five percent of whatever such malfeasance he can uncover. Thus, his work is seasonal—after he finishes a job, he takes a few months off to relax and live off the proceeds. Sometimes he vacations on Catalina Island as a guest of his friend, Scott Warms, who made his millions selling his start-up to Yahoo! during the dot-com bubble and never looked back. However, when Marty interferes with a tycoon’s pyramid scheme on the island, Scott ends up with a target on his back that. From there, the story develops into an exploration of the injustice baked into the justice system, from traffic stops with corrupt cops to plea deals and private prisons. As Marty learns more about how unfair the system actually is, so too does the reader, in excruciating financial detail. Can Marty and Scott beat the house?This is a loose sequel to Red Team Blues, the first book to feature Marty Hench. However, aside from some vague allusions, that’s about all the two books have in common: I haven’t read the first book, and I can say that The Bezzle stands alone.Even within the book, there are distinct parts. The first third is the most dynamic in that it involves Marty’s interaction with the greatest number of people at once—paradoxically, it also might be the least interesting part? I kept waiting for the inciting event, and it eventually arrives, but it takes far longer than I expected for Doctorow to get us into the story. Once we’re in it, the novel becomes seventy-five percent Marty talking to the reader and twenty-five percent Marty talking to one other person, a series of two-hander vignettes that punctuate the equilibrium of exposition Marty supplies about how the prison system in California is nefarious and exploitive.As far as what I learned from The Bezzle: I already knew the private prison system was bad, and I knew some of the details, but this book sketches an even bleaker picture. Y’all really let it get that bad, huh? (I am aware, as a Canadian, I should not throw stones given my country’s own awful track record when it comes to detention and detainment.) The way that Marty gradually uncovers just how bad it is works really well to help people who are less familiar with these systems get a glimpse into how they work (and they do work, as designed—it’s simply that they are designed to siphon money from the poor to make the rich richer, rather than rehabilitate).As far as this being an entertaining novel goes … well. Marty and Scott are about as thin characters as you can get and still have them breathing on the page, so to speak. All I really know about Marty is that he is well-off, savvy with the numbers, loyal to his friends, but somewhat of a loner and single—but presumably into women given his occasional comments about how attractive they are. (Let’s not even get into how the only significant female character is a classy sex worker with a heart of gold. Oh, and there’s also a female prosecutor who shows up near the end for like two-point-five seconds.) Scott similarly gives me richie white playboy vibes.Now, I want to give Doctorow some credit: he’s clearly designing these characters to be satirical exaggerations of the archetypes involved in Silicon Valley. The Bezzle is essentially a parable of the financial turpitude of the last quarter century, with Marty playing the role as a David mosquito taking a tiny yet juicy bite out of Goliath. So the fact that these characters are little more than sketches is almost certainly intentional. I’ve seen Doctorow have greater range than this before. On the other hand, I’ve not seen him have much greater range than this, and none of this changes the fact that, ultimately, this book has little in it that makes me connect with these characters.Indeed, Cory Doctorow is a dichotomous author for me: I seem to enjoy his nonfiction but, at least as I have matured into adulthood, find his fiction lacking. In part, I suspect this is because both end up as vehicles for his polemics. My politics and Doctorow’s are often in alignment (and even if they weren’t, Heinlein would attest that I don’t mind myself a polemical work of science fiction—that’s kind of what the genre is for). No, it’s because his polemics are so thinly veiled, his characters so uninteresting beyond their service to the plot, that in some cases the books seem to turn into Socratic dialogues. I do love that he’s a firebrand of a nerd who hyperfixates on subtle slivers of injustice and then magnifies them into entire novels. The Bezzle is no exception here—but I still liked it, enough that I might go back and check out the first book in Marty’s series.So if you want to hear more about how prisons (especially privately run prisons) suck, but you’d rather read a novel instead of a nonfiction exposé, The Bezzle is for you. It’s a burn-down-the-system, fight-the-power paint-by-numbers novel, which is not a bad thing—exactly what I have come to expect from Doctorow, yet comforting and satisfying in its own way.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

In the case of But Everyone Feels This Way, I hadn’t heard of Paige Layle before. Instagram recommended a Reel by her. I don’t remember the Reel or what she said in it, but she mentioned her book coming out soon. I was intrigued, looked it up, and was able to get an eARC through NetGalley/Hachette.Paige Layle is a twenty-three-year-old from Ontario, Canada—the same province as me, and a fact I only realized when I was well into the book and noticed she was using a lot of Canadian school terms, like saying “Grade 3” instead of “third grade,” and then she mentioned Toronto, and I was like, “CANADIAN. WE HAVE A CANADIAN HERE. FROM ONTARIO LIKE ME.” Sorry, I get unreasonably excited when unexpected Ontarians show up in my to-read list. Anyway, Layle is quite young to write a memoir, but they are passionate about being an autism communicator. Layle takes us chronologically through their life, sharing how they struggled through early childhood and adolescence. She expected her autism diagnosis, received at fifteen, to change everything and was surprised when it didn’t—but it allowed her to better express her needs, work on her relationship with her mom, and figure out what she wanted after high school.Autism as a condition is drastically misunderstood. At its core, But Everyone Feels This Way is a first-person account of “discovering” autism. It has two major audiences: allistic people like myself who want to learn more about autistic people’s experiences, and young, neurodivergent people who might be autistic and not realize it. For that latter group, I hope some of them find this book illuminating.Women in particular are underrepresented among autism diagnoses. This compounds misunderstandings about what it means to be autistic, what “#ActuallyAutistic” looks like, as the hashtag might say. I briefly perused Layle’s Instagram as I prepared to write this , and I noticed a disturbing trend of comments like so: “You aren’t autistic, stop pretending. If you were autistic you wouldn’t be able to talk to us like this.” Now, it’s no surprise that the comments are a toxic trashfire. Still, I think these comments represent an unwillingness among the public to believe that autistic people can be verbal, can communicate with grace and elegance, can have complex and nuanced takes on things. This comes down to stereotypes—but I’d argue it’s also symptom of insecurity among neurotypical and allistic people who are invested in the idea that autism is something to be feared rather than embraced, at best tolerated as opposed to accepted and even celebrated. It’s these people whom Layle hopes to disarm, I think.But Everyone Feels This Way is quite raw and pointed. While some will call Layle’s style simplistic, there is a difference between simplistic and simple, and Layle’s writing is the latter. It’s clear, and it’s honest—allistic readers are just used to people not saying exactly what they mean, engaging in ellipsis, etc. While I won’t litigate the legitimacy of Layle’s autism, let me say that Layle’s writing is, to me, one of the clearest indicators that they are autistic. It’s not bad writing; it’s just different from the range of styles that tend to be drummed into neurotypical writers—and if that isn’t your thing, cool, but I think you would be missing out.What I found most compelling about this book is how Layle builds, layer by layer, our understanding of her experience of autism as she moves through the each year of her life. I like to think I had a good handle on general facts about autism, many of which Layle shares in various fact-box sidebars throughout the book. However, there is a difference between holding a mental list of autistic traits in my head and actually hearing an autistic person describe how she embodies and experiences those traits on a daily basis. In this way, this book serves its primary purpose as a memoir: to build a richer empathy for autistic life than a work of more general reference nonfiction could ever achieve.As a teacher, I found the chapters in which Layle is in high school very helpful and challenging. She describes in detail the process of getting an IEP, an individual education plan (this is the point where I realized she’s in Ontario) and how some teachers would abide by this plan while others would … not. This doesn’t surprise met, but it does sadden me. I would like more Ontario high school teachers to read this book so they can hear directly from an autistic person why the accommodations in an IEP are not niceties, not wants, but needs.The problem, Layle makes clear here, is not Layle themself. It’s that we built our society for neurotypical people, so neurodivergent people are often at a disadvantage in meeting expectations. School is difficult because you need to be quiet, sit still, not challenge your teacher’s authority or expertise even if you’re confused by how they are teaching you, etc. Neurotypical people, and most allistic, neurodivergent people like myself, learn how to play the game well enough to mostly fit in. (In my case, for example, I can relate to a lot of Layle’s experience in terms of being highly intelligent and academically motivated while not very socially involved. However, I didn’t experience her struggles to understand her teachers’ or peers’ emotions and motivations, so I had an easier time figuring out “how to behave” in high school. This is the privilege of an allistic brain.)Ironically, for a book with a subtitle all about the diagnosis itself, this aspect of the book seems to be the least well-developed. I thought it was really interesting how Layle admits to disappointment that their diagnosis did not magically fix how people relate to them—there is a particular scene between Layle and their former best friend that highlights this keenly. I wish Layle had gone more into this side of things, but instead she focuses more on how the diagnosis changed her family dynamic.This isn’t a perfect book, and of course it behoves me to observe that Layle in many ways fits the mould of influencer: young, white, woman. But Everyone Feels This Way runs the risk of being elevated into some universal tale of autistic experience because we would like it to be that simple. We like it when we can read one book about something and say we know about that identity. But it’s not that simple, of course. Layle can’t speak for all autistic people, doesn’t pretend to, and if you expect this to be a general crash course in autism, look elsewhere. Although there are some basic definitions and facts sprinkled throughout, this book is a memoir first—it just happens to be a memoir by an Actually Autistic person.And that, in my opinion, is a good enough reason to pick it up. Layle’s unrelenting honesty, the way she matter-of-factly links her struggles to her suicide ideation and attempts, is a good enough reason to keep reading to the end. Because ultimately this is a book about someone trying to come to terms with the fact that the world was not built for them—and the people for whom it was built have no idea just how different things seem the people on the outside. Sometimes bemused, sometimes distraught, sometimes nonchalant, Layle’s memories reveal the kaleidoscope of rich, wonderful, uplifting, terrifying truths that accompany being a young autistic person coming of age in the 2010s and navigating adulthood in the 2020s.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Recreating the saThe description of Floating Hotel overtly likens it to The Grand Budapest Hotel, and this comparison is both correct and compelling. Recreating the same tragicomic balance with her wandering space hotel, Grace Curtis takes this story places I didn’t expect it to go. Simultaneously heartwarming and heartwrenching, this is a book about doing what you love—and then saying goodbye to what you love. I received a copy in exchange for a .Carl is the manager of the Grand Abeona Hotel. This spacecraft makes a circuit of the known galaxy, taking on new guests for a system or two, hosting conferences, etc. Populated by a quirky cast of misfits and the occasional malcontent, the hotel is renowned and beloved by many, yet behind the scenes it has seen better days. The book follows Carl and several employees and guests in a series of interwoven plots, culminating in a confrontation that threatens the survival not only of Carl and his guests but of the Grand Abeona itself.Curtis is skilled at a kind of shorthand with characterization, and the structure of this novel serves that well. At first, I was annoyed that I didn’t learn more about Carl immediately, didn’t get more of his backstory with Nina and how he came of age aboard the hotel. However, Curtis quickly won me over. With each chapter and each new viewpoint character there is a new opportunity to learn about the hotel through their eyes. I’m not exaggerating when I say that each character’s story has sufficient depth to be its own novel (or at least novella). Although Curtis returns to some of them throughout the novel, others only have a brief moment in the spotlight, and it always felt bittersweet to swipe left and say goodbye.There are several intersecting mysteries at the heart of this novel. None of them by themselves are particularly deep or intricate. Whether it’s the identity of the Lamplighter or the nature of the mysterious message investigated by the Problem Solvers conference, I thought the solutions were fairly obvious from the start. However, that’s OK—the mysteries themselves are kind of beside the point, for the real reward here is the immersion in the setting and the characters who populate it. The vibe reminds me a lot of Becky Chambers’ Wayfarers series, though less cozy than quirky.Indeed, the transformation in tone that this book undergoes is perhaps the most enjoyable thing about it. When I reached the chapter with the spies, when there was a scene with the bathtub, I realized this story was turning serious. From there, each chapter turned up the tension, yet the book overall never lost its charm and wit. Once again, a delightful sense of balance infuses Curtis’s writing. After several heavier books—many of which I enjoyed—Floating Hotel managed to be exactly what I needed.Although I easily guessed the resolution of most of the mysteries, I was surprised by how the book itself ends—and I’m happy about that. Without spoilers, let’s just say that I expected Carl to come up with a very different plan from the one he ends up implementing. I expected something … perhaps more trite, more storybook? And instead, Curtis reminds us that sometimes the only way to win is not to play the game. It would be harsh if it weren’t also so hopeful: this book is a reminder that no matter what you lose, no matter what happens, your life goes on and you can always move forward. You’ll be different, that’s for sure, but you can move forward.This is a sweet, sometimes sad, always entertaining novel. Highly recommend for people who want some soft, creative, and satisfying science fiction.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

The same goes for Canada, where we learn about the enslavement of African people in the US, but we don’t learn about slavery in Canada or our own history of anti-Black racism following abolition. So I do my best to read and learn, especially from Black women. In You Get What You Pay For, Morgan Parker engages with the legacy of slavery and nearly four centuries of anti-Blackness on this continent. Her tone is brutally forthright, holding nothing back as she looks at how the shape of American society has influenced her life. In an era that has too long billed itself post-racial or colour-blind, Parker insists that, yes, you need to see her race in order to see the arc of her life so far. I received an eARC from NetGalley and Penguin Random House in exchange for a .This is an essay collection loosely masquerading as memoir and following a rough chronology of Parker’s life. She returns to a few regular motifs throughout: her next therapist, the slave ship as a metaphor for living under white supremacy in the US, the impossibility of survival for so many Black people as a result of police brutality. Many of the essays engage with seminal moments of the American zeitgeist in the past couple decades: the ascension of Serena and Venus Williams, Ye’s infamous remark about George W. Bush in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the trial of Bill Cosby.Parker acknowledges the complexity of her subject while writing with an appealing simplicity. Some of her discussions of her therapists reminded me of It’s Always Been Ours, by Jessica Wilson. Both books were illuminating. We white women often fail to consider race as a factor in our professional interactions, whether it’s therapy, treatment for eating disorders, or in my case, teaching. Which is not to say that race is the only factor in finding a good fit with a professional. But as Parker makes clear in this book, it wasn’t until she found a Black female therapist that she was finally able to connect in a way that was authentic and useful for her. Her white therapists prior lacked the experience and ancestors required to see all of Parker.That’s what we are talking about here. Seeing. Seeing the weight of intergenerational trauma. Seeing resilience not as a buzzword (“oh, you are so strong”) but as a rebellion against being put into a box. Seeing and understanding that racism isn’t simply, “Oh, people are mean to you because of your skin colour?”—racism is a kaleoidoscope of Rubik’s cubes of dominoes that fall every single day. It’s a behemoth, visible and invisible at the same time.You Get What You Pay For is dolorous at times. It lacks the rah-rah inspirational tone that we have come to demand from racialized writers. This is my first time reading anything by Parker that I can recall, so my point of comparison is to Roxane Gay, who is likewise unapologetic in her take-it-or-leave-it attitude towards her opinions. This is something we unthinkingly praise in white writers but often see as too adversarial or cynical in Black writers. While Parker has obviously met with a fair amount of success, she opens up and discusses how that hasn’t always translated into better mental health. This reminds me of Ruchika Tulshyan and Jodi-Ann Burey’s Harvard Business Review article, “Stop Telling Women They Have Imposter Syndrome”. Before I read that article, I probably would have labelled Parker’s description of her experiences as imposter syndrome. Now I know better. Now I know that the driving force is systemic, misogynoir.At the same time, I think it’s important to emphasize that this collection is not hopeless. It’s just honest. You won’t exit it with a warm, fuzzy feeling, and you aren’t meant to. Now, that might not be what you want on your reading schedule right now—and I don’t blame you; I won’t pretend that I revelled in reading this. At the same time, I did fly through it, for as bleak as this book feels sometimes, Parker’s writing is also compelling.Intergenerational trauma is no joke. White supremacy is alive and well in the US, as well as here in Canada. You Get What You Pay For brings a powerful voice to the conversation. Above all else, Parker insists that survival is not enough. She wants her life to be hers, as she should. Freedom on paper is not freedom in reality. Not yet.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

I was thinking a lot about trauma as I read These Fragile Graces, This Fugitive Heart, by Izzy Wasserstein.

I received an eARC in exchange for a .If Dora knows one thing, it’s op sec. She left a commune over a disagreement about security: as anarchists, they wanted their commune to be as open as possible, whereas Dora believed more stringent checks and balances were required to keep out people who might have nefarious, ulterior motives. When she is called back to the commune to investigate the murder of her ex-girlfriend, Kay, Dora’s worst fears seem to have been proved well-founded. Her investigation will take her into neighbourhoods even more destitute than the one where the commune crouches and pit her against enemies who wear her face from before her transition.Much of my criticism of These Fragile Graces, This Fugitive Heart might be waved away by simply saying, “It’s a novella, Kara.” The other characters are paper thin. The villain is predictable, and his overarching motives are shrouded in convenient shorthands. The setting is something ripped straight out of Verhoven, Robocop tinted for modern storytelling. These criticisms levelled at a novel-length work might stick. Applied to a novella, however, they actually become strengths. Because this is not really a mystery.No, this is a story about identity. The brilliance of this story lies in how Dora deals with one of her clones, whose life she spares.Here come the spoilers.Dora deals with her rescued clone’s emergence into individuality quite gracefully. I appreciate how much she respects Theo’s agency, to the point that she carefully avoids using pronouns until Theo, at the very end, settles on they/them. This is a potent reminder of the fluidity of gender: Theo might be genetically identical to Dora, but their experiences and memories are distinct. I suppose that should mitigate my discomfort over the idea of Theo and Dora having sex … still.I appreciate that Wasserstein acknowledges in the afterword that this development is hella weird, that she simply couldn’t find a way to tell the story without it happening because Theo insisted. The consent thing isn’t as much an issue for me—I understand Theo’s perspective there—but … yeah … hmm. As an asexual and sex-averse person, I’ve never much thought about sex with a partner—would partnered sex with myself be … better? Even if that self is me through a funhouse mirror, as Dora describes her pre-transition clones? See, this ese are the important questions science fiction is here to ask!Gonzo sexuality subplots aside, Dora and Theo’s nascent friendship is the heart of this story. The way that Theo goes from enemy to lover to friend is very endearing. Set against a backdrop of post-apocalyptic, capitalist purgatory, these connections become all the more significant. Dora, now that she has left the commune, is very alone and lonely. Although her being alone hasn’t changed by the end of the story, I think her loneliness has started to unravel. She starts to see that in order to protect, one has to have something worth protecting.These Fragile Graces, This Fugitive Heart is as cute as a semi-noir, grim dystopian science-fiction novella can be. Wasserstein effectively pulls from established tropes, particularly around cloning, to tell a story of choosing found family over blood and staying true to one’s ideals while still learning to bend and grow. It’s worth an afternoon of your time.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

In 2014, flying back home from England for the first time, I stopped in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to attend the wedding of two Canadian teachers who had been colleagues in England. The timing was perfect, and it also allowed me to visit an old friend who lived there. The two of us took a trip out to Peggy’s Cove, and I touched the Atlantic. Beyond that, I have barely ever been on boats. Water is not for me! So when I received a request to  Be the Sea, I was intrigued. So much of science fiction focuses on space, yet we know more about deep space than we do our deepest oceans. While this book is not a deep dive into our oceans, Clara Ward nevertheless gets you thinking about how ocean life is connected to life on the rest of this planet, including humanity. While there were parts of this book that didn’t work for me, I overall appreciate a lot of the ideas shared here.Marine biologist Wend Taylor invites themself aboard photographer Viola Yang’s zero-emissions sailboat as she crosses the Pacific, bound for Hawai‘i. Viola’s family member and self-appointed cook, Aljon, rounds out the crew. After talking their way aboard, Wend settles in and shares stories with Viola and Aljon as the three slowly bond. When the boat arrives in Hawai‘i, rather than going their separate ways, the three of them remain connected by business and by a mystery that has something to do with their birthdays. As Wend and the others dream of flying, of being attuned to the sea life around them, Wend also reconnects with people from their past—some friendly, some not so much.Be the Sea is set in 2039, which is scary to say only fifteen years into the future. Ward envisions a world that has taken dramatic steps towards mitigating climate change—or at least, islands like Hawai‘i has; we don’t see much of the rest of the world, which is fine. Most of the characters in this story are eco-conscious and very concerned with reducing emissions, and many of their conversations and actions revolve around how to be more energy efficient, environmentally friendly, etc. Ward mixes contemporary technology and best practices (such as reducing meat consumption in favour of plant-based proteins) with logical, near-term extrapolations of technology and ideas (such as the Seward generators that make up one of the subplots). Wend and their cohort are presented as being on the cutting edge, yet at the same time, they clearly live in a world where addressing climate change has acquired a more tragic urgency than we seem to feel here in 2024.If you are into marine biology, then this is a book for you. Told from a limited third-person perspective following Wend, Be the Sea has plenty of discussions of marine ecosystems, from the effect of warming oceans on coral reefs to the way that ocean currents distribute bacteria widely around the world. It’s fascinating, and I appreciate a good dose of science in my science fiction.Without going into spoilers, the science-fictional aspect of the plot comes into play late in the book (though Ward lays the groundwork early on, in the form of people’s flying dreams). Suffice it to say, it’s of the Gaia-hypothesis-we-are-all-connected flavour. Ward’s attempt to provide a scientific basis for this experience is enchanting. I like how several characters raise different philosophical questions that logically follow from what happens, demonstrating how easily scientific discoveries provoke new lines of thinking about not only what we believe but what we are capable of believing.I found myself, as I was reaching the end of the book, wishing that all of this had been more prominent up front. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Be the Sea is slow and feels, at times, interminable. I almost set it aside while Wend, Viola, and Aljon were still at sea; their arrival at Hawai‘i came just in time to prevent this. Once they get there, the plot does pick up—but it also turns into a peculiar genre mash-up. At various points the book is intimate and cozy before quickly turning into a thriller, and there’s a fair amount of tonal whiplash as a result.Wend is a neat main character. They’re seventeen years older than me, yet I could still relate to and appreciate the portrayal of a progressive person in their sixties, grappling with how much the world has changed while still trying to hold on to ideals that have been bent and stretched by the passage of the decades. It made me think a lot about who I will be in 2039. I also enjoyed, to various degrees, Viola and Aljon. However, as the cast of characters expands, some of the interpersonal conflict feels very contrived, and the book fails to establish a clear and convincing antagonist. Shelley is somewhat one-dimensional in her extreme, hot-tempered perceptions of everything Wend does as a misstep. Mira, similarly a tempest-in-a-teapot, comes in out of nowhere in this brief vignette of indignation before being defused and set to one side. The two characters who seem like they are the primary antagonists have fuzzy motivations, and likewise their actions feel over the top. After spending a third of its length doing almost nothing but character-building among its core trio, the book suddenly springs into action yet cannot seem to decide what kind of story it wants to be. The result is very muddled.I have similar, albeit more mixed, comments on the characterization and dialogue. There’s a lot to like but also a lot that didn’t work for me. First, I really appreciate how hard Ward works to build an inclusive, respectful, and open environment among this cast. There’s a lot of explicit discussion of labels, of boundaries, of the distinctions between kink and sex and the fluidity of gender and attraction. As a trans and aroace woman, all of that is as energizing to me as the pacing of this book was enervating. Not only is Wend a great nonbinary, autistic, demisexual protagonist (whose pronouns everyone respects!), but they are surrounded by a diverse group of people of various ages, shapes, abilities, races, and genders, all of whose needs are discussed, accommodated, and respected. There is often a complaint (sometimes even justified) that, in our effort to improve representation in fiction, sometimes diversity becomes tokenistic, or conversations about a character’s identity become soapboxes that detract from the plot. That never happens in Be the Sea, and this is one of its strongest and most endearing qualities.On the other hand, some of the mechanisms of how we get to know all these wonderful people feel clunky. There’s a distinct dearth of guile among most of these characters. Everyone very plainly says how they feel, and so the conversations become very overt and lack much in the way of subtlety or messiness. Don’t get me wrong—I think there is a time and a place to model healthier communication, so I don’t want to be too harsh. However, conversations in real life are never as cut-and-dry and clean in their process as the ones depicted here. When every conversation goes smoothly and it feels like every character got a chance to say exactly what they wanted, it shatters the illusion. I want dialogue to feel like the conversation got away from the author because the characters picked it up and took it off in their own direction.To summarize: Be the Sea is messy in its plot and not messy enough in its dialogue—maybe I am just too picky. There’s a lot to recommend this book in terms of creativity, diversity, and general ideas. The actual style and execution left much to be desired. I’m glad I read it, and I hope it resonates better with others than it did for me.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Kuang that I added to my to-read list, yet it has taken me this long to get to it. Oops. Shout-out to the colleague who lent me her copy. I’m excited that I was finally able to read this and see that, once again, the hype around a Kuang novel is justified. This is a war novel dressed up in fantasy clothes—and I’m not mad about it.Rin Fang is a war orphan, adopted reluctantly by drug dealers in the south of the empire. Desperate to escape her life, she sets her mind at acing the nation-wide standardized tests that will land her a spot at Nikan’s elite military academy. When she succeeds, she finds herself in a totally alien society on the eve of an invasion by Nikan’s oldest enemy. More than that, Rin discovers she is connected to an ancient and vengeful power—some might call it a god—that is eager for her to use her pent-up rage to lash out against her and Nikan’s enemies.The fantasy aspect of The Poppy War is a slow burn indeed. When the book starts off, Rin herself is very skeptical of magic. She wants to distance herself from what she considers to be pastoral ideas and superstitions from her origins in a remote province. So the first part of the book is much more a fish-out-of-water, underdog story, wherein Kuang has us sympathize with Rin as she perseveres against discrimination and alienation. Sometimes Rin’s actions feel shocking, deliberately so I would imagine, and at points her decisions verge on making her unlikeable. I loved following Rin’s descent towards being a villain rather than a hero.However, the secondary characters in this story are truly what makes it. They are important foils to Rin, whether it’s the innocent and well-meaning Kitay, the venomous and self-assured Nezha, or the deprecating and damaged Jiang—each of them offers her a shattered-glass reflection of a shard of herself. One of the tragedies of this story is that Rin never has a chance to ask herself who she wants to be for her. In her childhood, she was the Fangs’ servant and shopgirl. In her young adulthood, she is forging herself into a weapon for the empire—and as her magical abilities become apparent, she loses agency, at least at first, because she demonstrates her potential usefulness to the Empress.Speaking of which—I wish we had learned more about her. Nearly the entire book is told from Rin’s limited third-person perspective except for a narrow chapter where we follow the ill-fated commander of the Cike and briefly meet the Empress in person. She’s an intriguing character both because of the legends repeated about her rise to power and her role during the previous Poppy War and also because of her personal connection to Altan and the Speerlies. It’s implied the Empress is every bit as cunning as the viper totem she has adopted, willing to do whatever it takes to hold on to power. In a way, she might be a prototypical Rin, but I wish Kuang had made that comparison more explicit.As it is, the plot settles into a kind of predictable cycle in which Rin says, “I’m going to do a thing,” and someone else says, “Don’t do the thing, Rin. Don’t do it” and then Rin goes and does the thing. And the consequences of the thing turn out to be varying combinations of awesome/terrifying/unforeseen. At one point, Rin and Altan travel to a remote prison and kind-of-but-not-quite intentionally unleash an ancient evil upon the land—you know, pretty standard fantasy fare. I appreciate how Kuang basically hands Rin a ton of raw power but then says, “She’s not a Mary Sue: she is going to fuck up and it’s going to be real bad.” While this makes aspects of the plot predictable, it also adds a layer of entertaining characterization to a story that is otherwise quite heavy.Indeed, although The Poppy War has many themes, its meditation on the limits of individual power is probably my favourite. Kuang quite handily subverts the trope that a single, incredibly powerful hero can turn the tide of a war. It’s not only arguable but probably certain that everything Rin does in this story makes the situation worse. She lashes out with her power, acts without thinking of anything except wanting to harm and revenge. The decision-makers in this book who don’t have access to magic repeatedly admonish Rin and hesitate to use her and others like her in battle, and it turns out they are right to do so. This is a fun departure from how most other fantasy novels portray the protagonist as an overpowered and superior alternative to, you know, the entire country’s army.Others far more qualified than me have written about The Poppy War’s parallels to Chinese history, particularly the Nanjing Massacre. All I can say is that I found this aspect of the novel intriguing, and it certainly made me more curious about a part of history that simply isn’t taught in Canadian schools. Unlike Babel, which is recognizably counterfactual history with a layer of fantasy, The Poppy War is closer to something like the Kushiel novels in terms of how it’s a secondary world closely modelled after our own. I hope we get to see more of this in the second and third books of the trilogy.The copy I borrowed from a friend has a stamp on the front cover proclaiming The Poppy War as one of the “Time magazine 100 greatest fantasy books.” I don’t know if I would go that far. It’s captivating, to be sure—although it took me a while to get around to ing, I read this book basically over a weekend. It’s a great fantasy novel. But I don’t know if I would call it one of the 100 greatest. For all her storytelling prowess, Kuang hasn’t actually built something original or daring when it comes to the fantastical elements of this book. Rin’s magical abilities, how she accesses them, her struggle to control them—it’s all done well, but it’s also very standard. No, The Poppy War’s greatness lies not in its fantasy but in its ability to mirror reality. To get us to question the heroics and glorifying of war that we see all too often in our own history and historical fiction. To remind us that a single person can seldom set things right, but given enough power and trauma, a single person can often make things go very wrong.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Become the very thing that you are fighting against? These are questions eternally asked in fiction, especially in science fiction, where the things we imagine we could become can be frightening indeed. Weapons of the Mind continues a long tradition of fugitive arc stories in which a scrupulous protagonist has no choice but to enter the underworld and team up with lowlifes and thieves. However, Owen Greenwald and Paul Kivelson make this trope their own through an intense, thoughtful cosmology that reminds me of David Brin and Iain M. Banks. I received a copy in exchange for a .Tala is an Enhancer, someone who has the ability to amplify the properties of substances—whether that’s her own strength or resilience, her support team, or even just inanimate objects and materials around her. Enhancers follow the Tenets, an ancient code of conduct that ensures they use these abilities for the greater good of the Galactic Coalition. Enhancers who forswear the Tenets become Renegades, and Tala has been trained to hunt those. However, a mission gone awry soon has the Coalition, Tala’s mentor, and every authority everywhere thinking she is a Renegade. If she can’t find a way to clear her name and stop the real Renegade, long presumed dead by the galaxy, then not only is her livelihood and career at stake but so is the stability of everything she knows.The book opens with an extensive prologue that follows Arcus, the main antagonist—we don’t know that at first, but it’s pretty clear by the end that he is Not a Good Dude. From there, Greenwald and Kivelson jump to a day in the life of Tala, introducing us to her and her support team before they embark on what should be a routine mission. The resulting events leave Tala raw, traumatized, and feeling utterly alone.The action sequences in this book, and the emotional weight that their results engender, are intense. Greenwald and Kivelson seem to have assembled a grab bag of their favourite science-fiction and fantasy goodies: power armour, mentalist and telekinetic abilities, genetic mutation/resequencing, and more. It should be a hot mess; I should be criticizing them for not wanting to put some of their toys back in the toy box. So it’s a testament to their craft that they somehow make it all work.I think what helps is that the book is intensely devoted to following people. The political and social setup of this universe is right out of space opera, yet this book is not space opera. There are no big space battles, no massive starships crewed by hundreds. The action sequences are almost exclusively one-on-one duels or close-quarters combat against individual hostiles. (An appendix provides an in-universe explanation for this bias, but it doesn’t really matter.) As a result, Greenwald and Kivelson seldom allow themselves to be dragged down into the morass of math and technobabble that, let’s face it, even the best SF authors wade into once in a while. Space battles are hard enough to visualize as it is, let alone describe on a page. Weapons of the Mind neatly sidesteps the issue. Instead, the battles are lavish, individualized action sequences, and they make use of all the fascinating consequences that arise as a result of the novum of Enhancement.This focus on individuals somewhat carries over to characterization, though in an uneven way. Tala is quite three-dimensional, as she should be, and by the end of the book I had taken quite the liking to Quarack. However, most of the other cast members are somewhat flat and forgettable. Their motives are understandable, yet we don’t really get to know them as people. The two biggest missed opportunities in this area are in Tala’s relationships with Ferric and Scratch, respectively. Ferric is her colleague and part of her support system. The friction between Tala and Ferric is realistic and believable after what they go through, and I like that it takes a while for their relationship to start to mend. However, we get so little from Ferric that he feels like a cipher. Now, in contrast, Scratch is meant to be a cipher. As Tala’s mentor, he is allowed to be old and inscrutable. I just wish we had seen a little more of him hunting her down, or maybe some flashbacks to when they were training. As it is, he never quite escapes being a stock mentor figure who believes he has been betrayed.The villains suffer from similar issues. Greenwald and Kivelson lampshade this later in the book: Arcus talks a lot. He’s like a competent version of a Bond villain, and it’s equal parts funny and frustrating, because he doesn’t actually give much away. We never really understand why he or his allies are doing what they do, unless you accept the premise that they really are just mad. I’m willing to cut a little slack here given that this is the first book in a series literally called the Renegades trilogy, implying that there is a deeper mystery to be explored. Indeed, Greenwald and Kivelson drop tantalizing clues about this throughout the book. Nevertheless, this all means that we have to endure Tala going up against what is essentially “Thanos, but he mugs at the camera a bunch,” and it does puncture the otherwise intense, actually kind of scary atmosphere of these encounters.Finally, for a novel on the shorter side, Weapons of the Mind feels a little too long. Some of the scenes go on and on, and there are times when the story feels like it can’t quite make up its mind what it wants to be. An action-adventure? A heist? A train abduction plot? A political intrigue thriller? Unlike Greenwald and Kivelson’s masterful mixing of disparate tropes, the frenetic number of set pieces and subgenres never quite settles into something unified and fun.Before I wrap up, however, and without getting into spoilers, I need to praise one last thing: the climax and Tala’s breaking point. This is, of course, the moral and emotional fulcrum of the story. This whole time we’re asking ourselves, “Will she do it? Will she go past bending the Tenets and actively break them, break the most sacred ones even? Will she become what she hates?” I won’t tell you what happens, but I will tell you that I couldn’t stop reading at that point in the book. In her final confrontation with Arcus, Tala faces a tough battle not just because he outclasses her in combat skills but because he has nothing to lose; she still does. And the moment where that breaks her, where you realize she knows how deeply she is outmatched by this bad guy yet has no choice but to keep fighting—that’s intense. It’s a weight that the novel initially attempted to settle on us much earlier in the story, with mixed success, yet when the weight returns during the climax, I’m ready for it.There’s a lot to like about this book. The whole idea of Enhancement is neat, and I appreciate how much Greenwald and Kivelson commit to exploring what it means and implies for Tala and other Enhancers, right down to the whole thing about “don’t Enhance your brain; don’t do it; don’t you do it!” Similarly, the galactic society that they’ve created and the way the characters fit into it is very impressive. And I did enjoy the action sequences (which is not something, as a reader who is largely aphantasic, I often find myself exclaiming). There is a great novel somewhere in here, weighed down by some clunky elements. But I’ve said it before and will say it again: I prefer novels that take big swings, even if they don’t one hundred percent land, and that’s entirely the case here. Weapons of the Mind doesn’t completely satisfy, yet it does tantalize, and it betokens more good things to come from this writing team in the future.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

These books are a close-knit duology—although the main plot of the first book is resolved, Juliette and Roma’s story is not. Chloe Gong wraps it up here in a poignant, melodramatic way that remains true to the source material while also elevating it in complexity and scope.Spoilers for the first book but not for this one.The monster is dead, and so is its maker. Shanghai can breathe a little easier. The Scarlet Gang and the White Flowers can go back to killing each other. Or can they? The monsters return, blackmail ensues, and the Nationalist army is marching on the city. The only way out seems to be for Juliette Cai and Roma Montagov to work together. Yet Roma believes Juliette has betrayed their forbidden love, believes her to be heartless, to be his enemy now. Juliette has no plans to disabuse him of her deceit. It’s star-crossed love indeed.Romeo and Juliet is not in my top Shakespeare plays, though I gather from Gong’s bio that she thinks it gets a bad rap—certainly enough that she wrote this two-book reimagining of it! Yet what makes Our Violent Ends so good is that Gong has worked around the original play’s key weakness, which is its shallowness. Through her setting of Shanghai, 1927, and the depth with which she portrays the two main characters, Gong takes the themes and major beats of Shakespeare’s most famous tragic romance and makes them her own.She wastes no time throwing us into the thick of things. Juliette and Roma are independently investigating the resurgence of the monsters, but it isn’t long before they are thrown together. In addition to switching between limited third-person perspectives of these two, Gong also gives us a glimpse into the mind of Tyler (Tybalt). We don’t get as much perspective from them, but we still learn a lot about the motivations of Lord and Lady Cai, as well as Lord Montagov. And it all comes down to power.The first two thirds of the book are fine. But that last act, when all hell breaks loose? Oh my. As Roma and Juliette plot their next moves and struggle even to survive, Gong’s themes crystallize. It’s about power. Who has it. Who wants it. Should you even want it? Both lovers were born into power, shaped to wield power, yet their survival might lie in rejecting that power.Juliette and Roma—as well as Marshall, Rosalind, and Kathleen/Celia—endure many temptations towards power. How they respond to these temptations, the courses of action that these characters take, is the principal focus of Our Violent Ends. Gong sets out to remind us that individuals are fickle, complicated beings. We are all capable of good, of evil, of selfish or selfless acts. What is truly monstrous are the systems we set up.While at times uneven, when this book hits, it hits. Think what you will of Romeo and Juliet. Regardless, Gong demonstrates a remarkable facility for adapting Shakespeare’s tragedy into a tale all her own: one full of history, romance, combat, loss, and renewal. This duology, both volumes, is well worth your time.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

I don’t mind this, though, because it means that when they recommend a book to me and say, “I think you will really like this,” as my bestie Rebecca did when she gave me Honey and Spice for my birthday last year, I receive an incredible gift. I love when people push me to read outside my comfort zone. Sometimes I don’t enjoy it. Other times, like with this first novel from Bolu Babalola, I have the pleasure of a breathtaking ride that has left me with a better understanding of romance than ever before.Kikiola Banjo, or Kiki, attends Whitewell College in southern England, where she hosts Brown Sugar, a campus radio show about relationships and situationships. Respected yet somewhat inaccessible, Kiki finds herself the centre of more attention and scrutiny than she desires when she ends up kissing Malakai Korede, whom she had recently met and then excoriated on her show (albeit not by name). Seeking to use this attention to her benefit for a summer internship application, Kiki persuades Malakai to enter into a fake relationship with her.You know how it goes from there. Or do you? One of the best things about Honey and Spice is how Babalola expertly wields foreshadowing that consistently satisfies yet also subverts expectations.I don’t often read romance, but when I do, I want it to be new adult. I want it to be set in a college in the UK. I want it to be diverse, queernorm, and more. Honey and Spice has all that (the central romance is not itself queer, to be clear, but there are numerous queer characters having queer romances all around, and it’s lovely).Kiki and Malakai are both, like Babalola herself, British-born of Nigerian descent, and the story is steeped with references to Nigerian cuisine and dress, lots of unapologetically unitalicized Yoruba, and more. Did I, a white woman from Canada, know what the hell was going on every moment of this story? No, and that is wonderful. Just go with it. Because that part of the book isn’t for me (let’s face it, a whole heck of a lot of this book isn’t for me), and that’s fine. I can only imagine other readers are going to finally see themselves represented in this book, and I am here for that joy. Maybe one of the best yet most understated moments of the book happens when Kiki watches Malakai’s short film, which is about the Black barbershop he practically grew up in as a kid, and how that connects to his ideas of masculinity as a young Black man. It’s raw and powerful and it’s just this moment that underpins, uplifts the beauty of Malakai’s character overall.Alas, such Black joy exists against a backdrop of discrimination. Rather than erase that in favour of fluff, Babalola deftly negotiates the tension between romance/sexytimes and commentary on anti-Black racism in UK society, and it is so good. From the internecine power struggle within “Blackwell” to the wider questions of how to just exist as a minority on campus, Honey and Spice doesn’t shy away from the hard moments. And I want my romance to have some teeth to it. Look, I understand entirely the desire for fluffy beach reads and am in no way dismissing their value. But for me, as an aromantic gal, a little social commentary in my romance is very fulfilling.On that note, let’s get to the part of the  you’re all waiting for. Look, as an aromantic person, romance as a genre is a tough sell for me. Knowing this, Rebecca tried to sell me on Honey and Spice by noting that “it also involves how complicated family can be, female friendships, motivation, creativity, and the importance of vulnerability”—all of which is true, some of which I’ll discuss in a bit. Yet this is also a romance novel, so how did I feel about it?This is one of the best romance novels I have ever read, with some of the best sex/makeout scenes I have ever read. I don’t say that lightly.Bolu Babalola has actually maybe helped me better understand why some of y’all are so obsessed with kissing (ew).I want to give you a little taste of this spice (or is this the honey?):He was good. And not just a One Size Fits All good, but good enough to match me. He was feeling me out, taking the lead gently when it was clear I was ceding power. I could taste that he was having fun with it, deepening the kiss before lightening up, making the increasingly frantic heat gathering inside my stomach rise and then simmer. I could feel a new brand of adrenaline kick up inside of me. He was challenging me. This was a duel. Fine.Wowwwwwww. Is that what kissing is like for some of you? I get it. I still don’t want to do it, but I get it now.Babalola has put such thought into how she describes her characters, their actions, and yes, their making out. It’s my favourite approach to eroticism: descriptive yet not purple prose, full of movement and metaphor. Her mastery of language extends beyond those moments, however, encompassing the book as a whole. Honey and Spice is beautifully written, beautifully told.That beauty is apparent in the characterization, which is so dense on the page. Kiki and Malakai are incredibly round, three-dimensional main characters. They are both likeable and sympathetic, yet at the same time, they mess up. Kiki has baggage, and it makes her refuse to see what’s right in front of her. (Thankfully, her bestie, Aminah, calls her on that bullshit.) Malakai is so kind and gentle and the opposite of the toxic dude Kiki initially believes him to be, yet he is also stubborn and proud. Even the side characters, like Aminah, get some development, and I love it.I love the friendship between Kiki and Aminah, as Rebecca predicted for me. The subplot around Kiki and her former best friend from high school intrigued me. This part of the story gets dangled in front of us a few times, only to be resolved in a weirdly contrived, coincidental way, and then it just … never really comes up again? Like, I love this whole angle to Kiki’s backstory and motivation. However, this subplot is perhaps the only area of the book that I would call less than perfectly polished.Everything else? Amazing. Seriously. If you love romance, then walk, don’t run, to read Honey and Spice. If, like me, it’s not your usual genre, but you still enjoy new adult or intense novels about coming-of-age, dealing with relationships, etc., then you should still give this a try. It’s probably cliché to say this nowadays, but this deserves to be a movie. Babalola does not miss.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Desperate to find eir calling, e is settling into eir first day as a market guard when disaster strikes. The shield dome around Trenaze flickers, just for a second, just long enough for several of the mysterious Fragments to enter and terrorize the population. Horace witnesses a stranger somehow stop the Fragments, and e later befriends this person and joins them as they leave Trenaze behind in a quest for their home and their memories. Rounding out this gang is Rumi, trader and proprietor of a semi-sentient wooden wagon. The three (four?) of them head out across Nerezia, searching for Aliyah’s home, for their memories. But, as is often the case, they run into trouble along the way….From the start, Awakenings is a delight. Arseneault plunges us into the action, introducing us to Horace and then wasting no time in having disaster strike. It’s predictable, actually, what happens—which makes it all the more satisfying. As Horace wins over first Aliyah and then Rumi with eir guileless sincerity and charisma, e wins over the reader too. I haven’t read a ton of so obviously telegraphed embo/himbo/bimbo characters—Kronk from The Emperor’s New Groove is probably my generation’s gold standard, and Horace is an earnest nonbinary equivalent.Indeed, let’s take a moment to marvel at Arseneault’s choice of protagonist. Most authors, especially for adventure-fantasy stories such as this, these days tend to go for the wisecracking, slightly world-weary rogue. Maybe it’s the writer’s own biases for a clever, word-wise narrator. Maybe it’s to avoid the gee-gosh atmosphere of one-too-many young, farmboy Chosen Ones from the eighties and nineties. Suffice it to say, writing a protagonist who lacks much in the way of life experience, who is so uncertain of eir place in the world, is challenging. Arseneault makes it work, however, mostly by committing to the bit.I particularly love the slow-burn nature of the worldbuilding. The Fragments are a devious concept, full of potential. Horace casually mentions them early in the book because, from eir point of view, they are simply a part of life in Nerezia. Slowly, Arseneault divulges a little more—but not much—exposition. Given the length of Awakenings and the number of titles listed in the front matter of this book, it’s safe to say that the overarching mystery of this world will unfold gradually indeed.So what of the plot here and now, Aliyah’s quest and Horace’s companionship and Rumi’s reluctant involvement? If you are expecting a full-throated, epic fantasy, then you will likely be disappointed. This is a novella, and the set pieces are limited in scope and number. That made it the perfect first read for me of 2024, something easy and bite-sized to start my year right. There is plenty of action and combat in Awakenings, but there is also a lot that is cozy about this book in a way that feels like a necessary and powerful antidote to the grimdark stories that inundated the past decade of the genre. Two of the most memorable scenes in this book are not combat sequences but rather when Horace teaches Aliyah how to play a game. Both scenes are masterful examples of characterization and how to write relationships.It should go without saying but, because we live in the world we live in, doesn’t: this is a queernormative book with characters of diverse genders and sexualities, and the conflict does not in any way involve around them struggling with those things. The focus on platonic relationships instead of romantic ones is also something I, as an aromantic reader, appreciate—but to be clear, readers of any background can enjoy the friendships forged here.Awakenings ends with the main quest unresolved. This leaves the reader wanting more—yet it does not leave one unsatisfied! That’s the true magic happening here; Arseneault manages to tell a cozy tale replete with mysterious memory loss, identity crises, and combat against husks driven by eldritch objects. It’s wonderful and wild and maybe shouldn’t work, yet it does.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Sure, Murderbot has been fun and all, but hello? I cut my teeth on high fantasy. Put this directly in my veins, please.Was my reaction, when I picked up Witch King and realized that, while it is a standalone fantasy novel, it is far from Wells’s first.Kai is a demon from the underearth, trapped above when an enemy invasion cuts him off from his homeland. Decades have passed since Kai and a coalition defeated that enemy, and some among the new generation are hungry for power. Kai awakes, entombed in stone, murdered—and now he has to find out who wanted him dead, even temporarily, and what this might mean for the people he cares about the most.I really love how Wells dumps us into the thick of it without too much exposition. Gradually we learn more of the lore behind demons and some of the other strange folx in this land. Other things—like exactly how the Immortal Blessed became immortal (or even blessed)—remain ambiguous for now. Although Kai and Ziede are joined by a couple of minor characters who could use some explanation, those characters never become significant enough to be audience stand-ins. Instead, Wells alternates between the present day and the past. In this way, two compelling narratives unfold in parallel, and it’s very satisfying.Kai and Ziede are an iconic duo. They already have an easy, friendly partnership from the beginning. Wells has done something I have contemplated doing myself if I ever finally write a fantasy novel: start after the protagonist has defeated the Big Bad, and look at what happens from there. When Witch King begins, Kai’s brief moments of heroism are long behind him. Most of the people he knew from back then are dead. The others, like Ziede and Tahren, have moved on to other things. Kai is a relic, and he doesn’t crave power or influence (in fact, Wells is remarkably unforthcoming about how he spends his time these days). It isn’t until someone gets it into their heads to “get him out of the way” that he decides he has to be involved. I love this dynamic.Additionally, there’s some great queernormativity in this world. Ziede and Tahren, of course—we don’t get to know Tahren as well, but she shines especially in the flashback chapters, with a dry sense of humour that reminds me a lot of Teal'c from Stargate SG-1. In Kai, much like with Murderbot, Wells gives us a protagonist whose gender is … complicated. Whereas Murderbot is agender, Kai is male (a Prince of the Fourth House, by the way), but he can possess human bodies of any gender. Indeed, his first vessel above ground was a young woman. Wells doesn’t fully explore the consequences of this incongruence for either Kai or those close to him, unfortunately.Perhaps she simply couldn’t fit it in—this book is already packed to the brim! Nevertheless, that is something I would have liked to see more of, along with a better sense of the underearth and its connection to the human world. Kai mentions at one point that his true body in the underearth is no more, but it’s unclear how that happened, whether it’s a consequence of the Hierarchs severing the connection to the underearth while Kai was still above or something more nefarious. Finally, who are the Hierarchs? Where did they come from? Were they just the vanguard, or were they something else? They reminded me a bit of the Archons from the Far Kingdoms, or the Mein or Numrek from Acacia. So many questions!It’s a testament to Wells’s skills as a storyteller that I don’t mind being left with so many questions. The Witch King is a deep novel and occasionally heavy—Kai carries with him the kind of trauma one only gets from living through and surviving a horrific war. Yet it is also a lot of fun. There is something roguish and likeable about Kai, Ziede, and their allies. Reading this book, going on this adventure with them, is a good time.If I have any criticism, it’s simply that I wish the minor characters were developed a bit more. Sanja and Tenes are just sort of there for most of the book; I wish Wells had given them a little more to do. Likewise, the whole “oooh, is Ramad going to betray Kai?” subplot felt a bit tired and predictable, right up to the reveal of what Ramad is really doing there. The same goes for the Immortal and Lesser Blessed characters, their underlings, etc., who crop up to offer opposition to Kai and company. In the end, I know that Kai being on the periphery of world events is the point of the plot of the novel, so I can understand why we don’t spend as much time getting to know the bad guys and their evil scheme (without going into spoilers, suffice it to say that the problem Kai is investigating turns out to be more of a personal diversion than one with imperial consequences, and that is by design). Nevertheless, the fact remains that Wells introduces a great many named characters who never quite become more than one- or two-dimensional stock players in an otherwise very enjoyable play.Witch King is weirder than you might expect yet also somehow exactly what it promises to be, and that’s cool. If you have enjoyed other books by Martha Wells, as I have, you’ll like this one. It has definitely made me want to pick up some of her other fantasy novels.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

How can we ever really know our gender? What even is gender, anyway? It When you really think about it, the idea of gender is such a fraught concept. How can we ever really know our gender? What even is gender, anyway? It shouldn’t be surprising I have spent a great deal of time in recent years thinking about this, yet I don’t know that I am any closer to an answer. So I was very intrigued by Gender Without Identity, by Avgi Saketopoulou and Ann Pellegrini. This discussion of gender formation from a psychoanalytical perspective, along with thoughts on practical application to the field of analysis, seeks to challenge a lot of ideas about what’s “normal” for gender. I received a  copy.I went into this book hoping to be challenged. It has been almost four years now since I transitioned. Much of that time has been spent rebuilding my identity around my new understanding of my gender. It isn’t easy. I know, and am confirmed in this knowledge with each passing day, that I am much, much happier living as a woman in this world (despite all the challenges attendant in our misogynistic, patriarchal, transphobic society). Transition has not only been a joyful experience for me; it has provided me with perspective and courage to grow in ways beyond or in addition to gender. At the same time, four years in, I’m not sure I have any better grasp on what gender actually means to me. Am I a woman because the label of “woman” enables me to feel more comfortable expressing myself in the ways I want to express myself? Am I a woman because there is, deep down within me, something intrinsically and ineffably feminine? I just don’t know.Gender Without Identity takes the perhaps unsettling position that this uncertainty is irrelevant, because gender itself is process rather than permanence. Key to this book is Saketopoulou and Pellegrini approach to gender, which rejects what they call “core gender identity” in favour ofgender as a wildly improvisational process, which is not rooted in any “observable” or “objective” fact (e.g., body morphology or chromosomes), nor in any imaginary interiorized idea (e.g., core gender identity).They are quick to establish, however, that they are not seeking to invalidate how queer and trans people express the “story of their own origin” even if it includes “born this way” or other such core narratives. Rather, their approach to gender without identity is one of psychoanalytical praxis: it is most useful, they argue, for analysts to look at gender in this way, whether the subject they are working with identifies as cis or trans.Reading this made me think of Julia Serano and her theory of intrinsic inclination as outlined in Whipping Girl. Serano, a biologist, was unsatisfied with the idea that trans people’s identities are purely social construct yet also thought that locating transness within a purely biological cause was insufficient as well. At first glance, one might think this is incompatible with Saketopoulou and Pellegrini’s conception of gender as experience rather than identity. I’m not so sure. I think that both interpretations have value. Certainly, I recognize now in hindsight that I have always had inclinations towards the feminine long before I understood that being transgender was an option for how to label myself. On the other hand, Saketopoulou and Pellegrini’s framework helps elucidate why so many trans people, myself included, only come to realize ourselves later in life. It isn’t just that I didn’t know that being trans was an option; additionally, I hadn’t yet reached a point where I was ready to improvise in that way.So I appreciate that this book did indeed challenge me to think carefully about what I even mean when I say “gender.” I also appreciate Saketopoulou and Pellegrini’s unequivocal affirmation of the validity of trans and nonbinary identities:It is time for analysts and therapists to stop debating trans people’s right to exist, which is what we actually do when we question whether or gender nonconformity is but a manifestation of something else.I am not at all familiar with psychoanalysis and am perhaps wary of it (or maybe just wary of Freud, let’s be honest). My experiences with psychotherapy have been positive. Nevertheless, I know I am an outlier among trans people in that regard, and it doesn’t surprise me to learn that psychoanalysis as a field needs to grow. Hopefully books like Gender Without Identity have the desired effect in that regard.For those of us outside the field, this book can still be useful (as my earlier musings demonstrate). However, be forewarned that the writing is clinical, full of jargon and vocabulary that, quite honestly, challenged even me. Saketopoulou and Pellegrini are not writing for a general audience—which is fine, not a criticism of the book but definitely a caution for the general reader. I won’t pretend I understood fully everything that they discuss in the book. But I did enjoy this glimpse into how analysts and therapists approach these concepts, as well as the challenges of dragging the field kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century.So from this position, I found Gender Without Identity to be what I expected: challenging, occasionally inscrutable, yet altogether quite clever and thought-provoking. While I can’t wholeheartedly recommend it to just anyone, for someone who is curious about the intersections of psychology and gender, I think this is an important and powerful read.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Vassanji novel in 2009, when I was nineteen years old, making it among one of the earliest s I wrote, about a year into this project. It’s wild, going back and reading those old s. Kara of 2009 was so young, and self-deprecating: “I suspect that when I revisit this book as an older, more experienced person, I will see additional facets of the story that escaped me on a first reading.” Well, I don’t have the same feelings about Nostalgia. The only thing that escapes me about this book is how it managed to make its way to Canada Reads.(Obligatory grumbling about not using quotation marks for dialogue. Moving on.)Dr. Frank Sina is a specialist in Nostalgia, a condition that occurs when memories of one’s old life leak through into one’s new, fabricated life. You read that right: in this near-future story, medicine allows people to live much longer, extended lives. To accommodate this, society allows people to radically alter their appearance and then forget their previous lives; they have a new, fictitious persona, complete with childhood memories, that they then take on as real. Dr. Sina’s latest patient has a persistent, troubling memory of a lion. As Frank becomes more entangled with this patient, he starts to question his own reality.Seeing this story through Frank’s eyes is … a time. He himself is a “GN,” someone who has lived more than one lifetime. He is dating Joan, a “G0,” someone still on her first lifetime. Frank is a boor and chauvinist: his comments about Joan are almost exclusively about her attractiveness and sex appeal in a leering, Humbert Humbert kind of way. He does this with every female character he comes across, and it’s uncomfy, to say the least. Was I just not paying attention to this in Vassanji’s other novels, or is this a deliberate characterization choice that falls flat for me because it’s, uh, too real?The novum of Nostalgia—near-immortality coupled with memory replacement—has its intriguing moments, I admit. The conflict between Frank’s generation and Joan’s is pertinent. Vassanji juxtaposes it with a wider story of haves and have-nots in the world: Frank lives within a prestigious, wealthy nation (apparently contiguous with contemporary Toronto); in contrast, countries in Africa remain poor and militant. Frank watches a xenophobic pundit’s television show and obsesses over the disappearance of an attractive reporter when she is “behind the lines” in one such poor country, and this becomes a key subplot of the book.It’s not that I don’t see what Vassanji is trying to do. The possibility for improvements to geriatrics and extended longevity are tantalizing and seemingly within reach in my lifetime—yet they also have the potential to sharpen inequality. If only wealthy countries built on white supremacy have access to such technology, how will that play out when it comes to narratives of race and racism? So these are worthwhile issues to explore.Yet my overwhelming takeaway from this book is one that I had within the first chapter or two: science-fiction authors are much better at writing literary fiction than the other way around. Vassanji joins the ranks of authors like Margaret Atwood in that he is writing science fiction but trying to be “literary” or “elevated” about it—and it’s just not … good. The characters are flat, the dialogue insipid, and the allegory shallow and ultimately unfulfilling.Nostalgia is an odd book, and so much about it did not work for me. Vassanji’s storytelling has impressed me in the past, but literally nothing about this story, aside from some of its basic ideas, has left any good impression on me.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

I received a copy of Interchange in exchange for a . Did it maybe take me a year to read it? Welcome to asking Kara to read things in a timely fashion. Sorry, Garrick Fincham. I’m glad I did finally dust this file off where it was lurking on my Kindle. It’s Mad Max meet The Expanse.Jude Harrison once led the Clan, a ragtag band of Martian settlers now roaming the planet following the destruction of their home in a brief and brutal war with Earth’s navy. Ousted by her sister, Jude makes a living on the fringes of this fringe. Now she has uncovered an artifact that everyone wants: Earth, the surviving Martians, and even the ghosts of scientists past. She has no choice but to go on the run, but the question becomes, is she running from something or towards it?Fincham described this book as “dystopian SF with Gothic undertones,” and at first I wasn’t sure about that latter label, but by the end of the book I understood. Interchange combines several recognizable tropes, leaning heavily on an atmosphere of suspense and dread. It is replete with ghosts, both metaphorical and literal, thanks to upload technology. The way this technology works implies a large helping of existential horror. Fincham examines this in some small way through the aforementioned ghosts; however, I wish the book had spent more time, especially when upload to the Interchange and interaction with its long-lived denizens becomes a key plot point for an important character. There is a lot of deep theory of mind stuff that the book hints at but doesn’t explore as fully as I would have liked.Now, I can probably forgive it for that, as the book is rather busy doing many other things. Though not quite space opera, Interchange takes place at the intersection of political machinations by several parties: a power-hungry general, an overconfident data-analyst-turned-spy, a desperate dictator, and a scheming-yet-stymied scientist. Jude finds herself playing pawn to each of these people at one point or another, and indeed, the main conflict of this book might be summed up not so much as fighting for survival but rather fighting for self-determination.In that way, I am ambivalent about the ending. On one hand, without going into more details, Jude succeeds in the goal of self-determination. The subtitle of this book is “A Dead Mars Novel,” implying that there could be more stories in the works—and I can see how this setting, and these characters, are ripe for that. On the other hand, the machinations of one character also come into fruition in an interesting way—it’s almost but not quite a subplot; it’s an SF Big Idea Fincham has piggy-backed onto the end of the novel in a showman-like twist that is fine but not quite satisfying, if you know what I mean. It’s very Adrian Tchaikovsky and Alastair Reynolds, which I mean as a compliment but also in the loving frustration I seem to have to reserve only for British SF authors.Anyway, thematic satisfaction aside, I admit that I had trouble putting Interchange down. Fincham is skilled at the scene-and-sequel format of storytelling. Plenty of action scenes—the book starts with one—lead into a shorter sequel scene of recovery and recapitulation before we going on to the next problem. Jude and Santiago, the two main viewpoint characters, are adequately fleshed out. The supporting cast personalities are clearly established and telegraphed; however, I didn’t end up developing as much sympathy for them as I did for our two main characters, which I found interesting. Like, I care about Jude, but Sam and Esther? Not so much. I wonder if this is an artifact of that dystopian/Gothic mood wherein most of the characters, having been pushed to extremes in this difficult environment, are heightened people, all sharp edges, and therefore more difficult to like.Interchange, like its title implies, is a meeting of many tropes. From colony spaceships to Mars colonies to uploaded consciousness and everywhere in between, this is a novel steeped in the best that science fiction has to offer. In the hands of some writers, such a cornucopia becomes a liability, jeopardizing unity of plot. Fincham pulls it off and crafts a story of desperation, shifting loyalty, and last-ditch plans to save the world. I recommend.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Before Supergirl, the show that gave me my name. I have watched and rewatched Star Trek to the point where it is now in my DNA. I love all the series (albeit not equally), but Captain Picard is my captain. So, naturally, when I learned Patrick Stewart had written a memoir, I had a mighty need. Thankfully, my dad gave it to me for Christmas! Thanks, Dad!The structure is a simple chronological one, starting from Stewart’s birth and early childhood in Mirfield, Yorkshire, England, and moving from there into his acting career and adult life. It culminates in discussing his two most well-known roles (Captain Picard and Professor Xavier) along with his more recent stage acting, his marriage to Sunny Ozell, and his feelings on the pandemic as well as reprising Captain Picard for Star Trek: Picard. It’s easy to read—beautifully written, in fact. I’m not sure if he had a ghostwriter, but if he didn’t, I’m impressed. My favourite line was, “If I kill Paul McCartney, it will be the only thing I will be remembered for.” (Spoiler alert: Stewart did not kill Paul McCartney.)Making It So, despite its allusive title, does not spend as much time on Stewart’s Next Generation days as one might hope. This is not a tell-all behind-the-scenes memoir of all the hijinks on the sets of the Enterprise-D. I suspected, as I read, that some would be disappointed, and reading other s has subsequently confirmed this. While that’s a valid opinion to hold, I think it’s an unfortunate one. If you’re willing to open yourself up to a different experience, there is a lot to discover through this memoir.First and foremost, this is a love letter to the performing arts and to Shakespeare in particular. Stewart is unequivocal: he only got to where he is today because of state funding for the arts, luck, and people with pull who saw potential in a country kid. I really enjoyed learning more about his early childhood, how he grew up post-war first in a one up, one down house before his family moved into a slightly more spacious council house. How acting captured his heart, and the hoops through which he had to jump to get a serious chance at it.There’s a lot of humour and lightheartedness to Stewart’s stories. Captain Picard is usually a stern figure (with a kind heart), but Patrick Stewart strikes me as a mischievous softie. Capable of summoning great rigour and dedication when needed for his craft, Stewart can also recount his involvement in practical jokes, amorous adventures, and silly moments of good fun. He tells you all of these stories with a smile and a wink, never taking himself too seriously.At the same time, there are serious and sad parts too. Stewart frankly discusses his father’s abuse of his mother. I had some inkling of this, for I had read how this had influenced the second season of Star Trek: Picard. Nevertheless, it hits different when the actual events are discussed in the context of Stewart’s childhood. I appreciate Stewart discussing this so openly in this book, for it provided me with great insight into the complexities of growing up in a situation of domestic abuse. Even as he recognized, as a child, that his father’s behaviour was unacceptable, he continued to learn from his father and seek his father’s approval as a man.Stewart is also very open about his romantic relationships, from flings to his three marriages. Perhaps more surprising is how open he is about the role that his cheating played on the dissolution of the first two marriages. I imagine many will judge him for that, and fair enough. Maybe I judged a little too. Yet if perfection is our bar for someone to write a memoir, no celebrity—indeed, no one—would be allowed to write one. Told from Stewart’s perspective, of course he is liable to make himself look like the good guy—so the fact that he cops to being the bad guy on more than one occasion makes me respect him all the more. I try very hard not to have idols, especially not celebrity ones, for they will inevitably let one down. There is something comforting in the fact that Patrick Stewart, who certainly approaches something I would say I idolize, has done his best in this book not to set himself up as someone to idolize, if that makes any sense.There is also a sense of sadness in the way that Stewart discusses how so many important people in his life have passed away. At eighty-three, of course, this is to be expected. Statistically speaking, he is beating the odds, and the cruel irony of survival is that the longer one sustains it, the more one sees loved ones … not. As he eloquently espouses his deep affection, appreciation, or admiration for someone, only to pivot and remark, “and I was deeply saddened when…,” it becomes a bit of a refrain through the book. I sit here, thirty-four years old, fortunate enough not to have lost that many people close to me just yet, pondering how I might feel if I reach Stewart’s age. Perhaps this introspection hits all the harder for how well Stewart recalls and, more impressively, recapitulates the energetic and brash youthfulness that is such a curious contrast to the statesmanlike composure for which he is most known on stage and screen.Indeed, this lifetime of performance is, above all else, the central theme of Making It So. Even more so than his marriages or his acting career, however, Shakespeare emerges from this book as the biggest love of Stewart’s life. His experience with Shakespeare seems obvious to me in his portrayal of Picard; not only does it influence every fibre of Picard’s characterization, but the character himself occasionally quoted the Bard, had a book of Shakespeare’s plays on display in the Enterprise-D ready room, and tutored Data in performing Shakespeare. I can understand how reassuring it might feel that, in a time as far removed from us as we are from Shakespeare, his words might yet offer guidance and consolation. For Stewart, as he tells it here, it is clear that these plays and sonnets offer great value. It’s wonderful, listening to him geek out about something that is clearly his passion.Making It So is a finely tuned memoir that is overall neither saccharine nor bittersweet, though it has moments of both. Stewart shares plenty of juicy details and intimate moments with us in tones variously sly and tender, affected and genuine. Diehard TNG fans will be disappointed that this is not solely, or even principally, about that part of Stewart’s career—but I think it is a mistake to make that the fulcrum around which one balances judgement of this book. I love that Stewart embraces so fully that vital and powerful character, to the point where he agreed to return to it one more time—yet while there might be more Patrick Stewart in Jean-Luc Picard than in any of his other characters, he is not that character. His story, as a living, breathing, real human being of the twentieth century deserves its own remarkable recounting as much as that of a fictional twenty-fourth-century explorer. Picard’s mission was to boldly go; with Making It So, Patrick Stewart shares with us how he has boldly gone.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Erinsmore works quite well as a standalone novel. However, in Mage Quest, Julia Blake provides us with an excellent sequel story, one that revisits beloved characters from the first book, introduces new ones, and builds further on the lore of this world.On Earth, six years have elapsed since Ruby returned from her adventure in Erinsmore. She routinely visits with Mick, one of the few people she knows who remembers this other world. When a portal to Erinsmore opens for her, Ruby is overjoyed—but her return to Erinsmore is complicated by the fact that Mick’s new ward, his thirteen-year-old nephew, Finn, follows her. Stuck in Erinsmore for the time being, Finn and Ruby acclimate and join the heir to the throne on a quest to find her mage. This quest takes them to the extreme edges of Erinsmore and will force them to confront an existential threat far older and more sinister than they dared imagine.Much as I observed in my  of the first book, the charm of Mage Quest lies somewhat in nostalgia for the fantasy novels of my youth. Returning to Erinsmore is like returning to those good ol’ days of devouring doorstopper epic fantasy novel after epic fantasy novel in the big comfy chair in the living room of my parents’ house. Its style and atmosphere are so much like the fantasy of the late nineties, early oughts—without, you know, any of the racism or sexism or whatnot that often creeped into our fantasy worlds. Indeed, this book introduces a nonbinary character, Xem, to the cast, which was nice.So the plot structure will feel very familiar to fantasy fans, as will the supporting characters, and that’s all to the good. Blake wastes no time, once we get to Erinsmore, getting us into the quest. Ruby’s return to Erinsmore is rightfully treated as a kind of homecoming, but she’s there for barely a day before it’s all, “By the way, the crazy old woman said you should come with us, so you’re coming, right?” and she’s all, “Of course I’m coming, sillies,” and off they go on their dragons. It’s awesome.Last time we were here, the kingdom was devastated and at war. I really enjoyed getting to see Erinsmore at peace, and if anything, I wish we had seen more of that. However, I can appreciate the need for pacing, and I can’t fault Blake for how well she balances wanting to show off this world with the need to get the characters further along the map until they find and fight this book’s Big Bad.As with the setting and plot, the characters are comfy archetypes too, and this goes for the Big Bad. I really enjoyed watching our heroes become ensnared in the Big Bad’s trap, their struggle to escape it, and in particular, the way that Blake finds a way for each of them to shine. This is true even for Finn—whose role in the story otherwise feels somewhat superfluous and disappointing, given how much emphasis is placed on him at the start of the book. He’s rather sidelined by the end, but he still manages to eke out a contribution to the climactic battle.Perhaps my ambivalence about Finn comes from a wider ambivalence I sense about the audience for this series. Erinsmore is firmly a teen/ YA, sitting comfortably on a shelf alongside, say, The Dark Is Rising. Mage Quest, on the other hand, feels a little older and more mature. This makes sense, for Ruby, our protagonist for most of the book, is older and more mature. So maybe Finn’s presence as deuteragonist is to function as a character that younger readers, having devoured Erinsmore, will identify with when they pick up the sequel.All of this is to say, of course, that even though I appreciate the nostalgia factor inherent to this book, I can still only comment on it from my present perspective as a thirty-four-year-old woman—and that perspective is that I am here for this series now in a way I wasn’t necessarily when I read Erinsmore. The first two acts of Mage Quest are a little slow, as you might expect from a sequel that, for some, will be their first foray into Erinsmore. That third act, from climax to denouement, though? Love it. I love the resolution, and I love the way Blake takes her worldbuilding to the next level, opening up worlds (quite literally) of possibility to explore in the future. So it was that Erinsmore was a perfectly fine standalone novel, but I also wasn’t itching for a sequel. In contrast, the ending to Mage Quest, while not a cliffhanger by any means, nevertheless screams for more. It reminds me quite a bit of Lisa Shearin’s Raine Benares series (starting with Magic Lost, Trouble Found: I just want to keep coming back to this world and its characters and its politics and vibe with them. I don’t really even care what the plot is at this point; I just want to hang out with them.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews.

Put simply, she challenged the orthodox opinion that every story must have conflict in it. I find myself thinking of this as I ponder Look to Windward and, indeed, Iain M. Banks’ Culture series as a whole. Banks once again proves himself so skilled at writing interesting utopias.The majority of this book takes place on Masaq’ Orbital. Mahrai Ziller has been living in self-imposed exile among the Culture for decades. An emissary from his people, the Chelgrians, arrives and wants to convince Ziller to return home. An outcast for his rejection of Chelgrian caste structure, Ziller wants nothing less. He has thrown himself into composing an emotional piece for the AI Hub of Masaq’ to commemorate the end of a war between his people and the Culture. Meanwhile, we also learn more about the Chelgrian emissary, his past, and his involvement in that war. Gradually we learn there’s a plot afoot, something far more sinister and devastating than merely persuading one exile to return to his homeland.I want to say that if you have experienced the Culture before, then much of this book will feel familiar to you—but that isn’t quite right, is it? The Culture is not a familiar thing, despite its trappings similar to humanity. It’s a riotous combination of utopianism, hedonism, post-scarcity economics, and redolent solipsistic philosophizing. The more one learns about the Culture, the more bizarre it feels. No wonder Banks often presents us with outsiders as interlocutors—in this case, Kabe, the Homomdan ambassador to Masaq’ Orbital. Through Kabe’s perspective we have a more selective filter on the insanity that makes the Culture work.And it does work, for that is the essential point of this book. The conflict is, at its heart, not much of a conflict. For the first two thirds of the novel, the final threat is hinted at rather half-heartedly, with almost no exposition regarding its true nature. In the final act, as quickly as the threat reifies, it is dispatched with almost no ceremony. The Culture is just that powerful, and that is the point: almost nothing can challenge it, but is that a good thing?At the heart of this book is the question how do we reconcile who we are now with who we used to be? For there is not much conflict in the main part of this book, but there is a history of conflict in these pages. There are many characters in Look to Windward who did terrible things in the past. The Hub of Masaq’ Orbital, though a minor character, played a role in the Chelgrian war, is intimately connected to the events leading up to the climax of the novel, as is the Chelgrian emissary whose arrival sets everything into motion. The Culture’s utopian outlook sometimes means endorsing violence. Is this compatible with morality as we lowly humans know it?As always, it is a pleasure to spend time in the universe of the Culture novels. Banks is such a fascinating science-fiction author: brimming with technological conceits of AI and nanotechnology and faster-than-light drives yet, at the same time, placing all those on the back burner so that he can focus on deep, enduring emotional questions. Can we let go of our past wrongs, and how others have wronged us? Is it OK to forgive? How do we move forward when we have lost so much?Science fiction is at its best when it puts us in milieus that feel simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar. Banks is one of the best at doing that. I don’t enjoy every outing equally—indeed, given the many years over which I have read these novels, it is hard for me to rank them or even compare them. But I always find value in them, and I am always left changed (hopefully for the better) by the experience.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s.

Cherryh, despite being recognized as a titan of science fiction, might be one of those authors whose books just don’t work for me. My other outing, The Paladin was all right but didn’t leave me astonished the way I hope most of my science fiction and fantasy does. I picked up Rider at the Gate and its sequel at the same time from the used bookstore—but I won’t be reading the sequel. I couldn’t get through this one, and that’s OK.Classically, the original Star Trek series was described as “Wagon Train to the Stars”—a western in space. Rider at the Gate taps into exactly this motif. If that works for you—if you’re into westerns with a patina of science fiction layered over it—then you might enjoy this book. Unfortunately, I don’t really like westerns all that much, and it takes a lot of science fiction (like Killjoys or Defiance) to make it palatable to me, and that doesn’t happen here.It also doesn’t help that the protagonist is a very horny teenage boy. (I guess Cherryh knows her target audience?) I noted this in my  of The Paladin: Cherryh’s writing style is heavy on description and exposition and light on dialogue. This makes these novels, not all that long, quite dense. If you are enjoying the happenings, then that’s ideal. Since I was not, it felt … interminable.Suffice it to say, Rider at the Gate is not for me. That doesn’t make it bad, which is why I chose to DNF it instead of trudge onwards and give it an unhelpful rating. I don’t want to discourage anyone from picking up Cherryh if you think her books will be for you, but I am now wise enough to recognize when I am not getting the return I want on my reading time.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

But this is a high note to end this yeThis is my last  of 2022, albeit not the last book I read in 2022 (I am quite behind on writing s). But this is a high note to end this year’s s on. Last year, I read The Rose Code and fell in love with Kate Quinn’s lush historical prose. Or should I say fell in love again? I didn’t mention this in my  of The Rose Code, but I had read one of Quinn’s earlier novels, Daughters of Rome, eleven year prior, and I had greatly enjoyed that work as well. So when I picked up The Diamond Eye, I had high expectations—all of which were met.Mila Pavlichenko really was a sniper for the Soviet Army during World War II. She is credited with 309 kills, and after being injured in the line of duty, she ended up as a spokesperson for the Soviet Union. She toured the United States, where she met Eleanor Roosevelt, among others. Quinn’s is a fictional retelling of Mila’s life, from her early days as a young, separated mother and researcher to the steely, formidable sniper touring America. At each turn, Mila finds herself pulled in opposite directions; she constantly has to make choices about who she wants to be in a world that is pretty sure who she already is.This is a book about war—in fact, it is about the same war featured in The Rose Code and is roughly contemporaneous in many ways. Although Mila is much closer to the front lines than the protagonists of Quinn’s previous novel, she shares with them the obvious quality of being female and being underestimated—harassed, even—by the men around her. The opening scene of the novel is literally a nameless antagonist who is doubtful Mila could truly be “Lady Death,” incredulous that a woman might possibly be such a good sniper. From there, we meet Mila at her youngest: a graduate student, and a researcher, beset by a husband whom she doesn’t love. She resolves to be stronger, and it’s this promise to herself that drives her throughout the entirety of this sprawling story.Like the best books about war this is a book about relationships more than it is about battle. Mila’s friendships, her romantic dalliances, and her rivalries and antagonisms, all of these come alive as Quinn sketches out her life leading a sniper platoon in the Soviet Army. I don’t know much about the Eastern Front; like most Canadians, I grew up on very Americanized (occasionally British-centric) stories of World War II. Drawing on Mila’s memoir as well contemporary accounts, Quinn does a good job (in my opinion) of showcasing everyday attitudes of Russian and Ukrainian people, especially peasants and other farmers whose lands were trampled over as the Germans invaded. There is a notable scene wherein Mila lines up for a shot at her opposite number in the dead of night. As she does so, she reflects on the fact that he, too, has a family waiting for him back in Germany. Then she calmly squeezes her trigger.In this way, Quinn captures the awful paradox at the heart of warfare. The cognitive dissonance required to take that shot, knowing it will end the life of another human. The fact that Mila is capable of that should dispel any sexist ideas that men are intrinsically more barbarous, more violent than women. It’s a matter of training, of belief, of making a decision to become that kind of person, a killer. Mila’s ambivalence over that title, over her nickname of Lady Death, is palpable throughout the novel. She doesn’t want to be a hero, doesn’t care to be lauded—she was there to prove herself to herself, to her son, to step out from her husband’s shadow.As much as I enjoyed the scenes of Mila as a sniper, I also enjoyed her time in America and her budding friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt. Once again, Quinn demonstrates her remarkable skill at helping readers empathize with very different types of people. Through her omniscient narrator, Quinn can show us both Mila and Eleanor’s reactions to meeting each other for the first time—the misconceptions, the stereotypes, etc., all of which gradually dissolve over the course of Mila’s tour, leading to the nascent bond that becomes the crux of the final act of the novel.There is an intensity and an intimacy to The Diamond Eye. I loved The Rose Code for its mathematical aspects and the role played by female friendship. This book feels colder, sharper, more isolated than that one. Female friendship is present but only barely (and the same might be said for math). Rather, this is a book about transformation—of oneself and others. This is a book about how we create heroes, how we build myths from the ground up, and how those myths and heroes just want peace and quiet of their own.If you have enjoyed anything of Quinn’s in the past or enjoy deeply personal historical fiction based on real people, then The Diamond Eye is for you.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Jennifer Marie Brissett brings that energy to Destroyer of Light. With shades of the Oankali from Octavia E. Butler’s Xenogenesis trilogy as well as Emma Newman’s Planetfall, this novel is about people on the brink. There’s ineffable aliens, unrepentant bad guys, and reluctant allies. Although the characterization is messier than I would like, I can’t deny that Destroyer of Light carries within it the seeds of a compelling story.Brissett tells the story concurrently across three different time periods that are set in Dawn, Dusk, and Night on a planet tidally locked to its star. The remnants of humanity have settled here after fleeing an Earth being destroyed by the Kresge—and now some of the Kresge live among them, while the rest exist menacingly out beyond the stars. Not quite living on sufferance yet certainly lacking true independence, humanity seems diminished, scrabbling to survive. Into this vacuum of purpose has leached all our sins: wars over resources, sexual violence, posturing, cultural nihilism and xenophobia. It’s cyberpunk mixed with Afrofuturism mixed with New Wave weirdness, and I’m here for that.The idea that the Kresge are four-dimensional beings and experience spacetime differently from us is a neat one. Brissett plays with it admirably throughout the book, though I feel like the full implications are never truly explored as deeply as I could have hoped. Nevertheless, it provides a good framework for the evolution of Cora, who isn’t always our protagonist but is certainly the main character. My main complaint about Cora—indeed about the plot itself—is that she doesn’t seem to have much agency. Such is a problem with a book with beings who exist outside of time—foreshadowing blurs into prophecy blurs into determinism. It feels like her fate was predetermined, and she sleepwalks towards the finale.That isn’t to say that the characters don’t have compelling features to them. Cora’s mother is so fierce in her loyalty to her daughter, the twins in their moral dedication to saving kids who are like them—with humanity at the brink, Brissett shows us some of the worst examples our species has to offer but also the best.In many ways, this is a story that I think would actually work better as a TV series or movie. It deserves the richness that set design and special effects can provide (at least, my aphantasic imagination cannot). In literary form, the story always seems to be bursting at the seams, confined by conventions of Western storytelling that don’t always work with how and when it’s trying to function.So there are things about this novel that worked for me, and there’s a lot that didn’t. I liked it well enough to get through it, but I won’t be jumping at the chance to return to this universe any time soon. Brissett is a powerful storyteller and a skilled writer—yet these two aspects seem as often in conflict as they are in harmony.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Anyway, VenCo was published earlier this year toMy silly “summer of witches” reading stretches into autumn and now (at least with my s) winter. Anyway, VenCo was published earlier this year to much acclaim. More importantly, it felt like Kara bait! Cherie Dimaline writing a contemporary fantasy book about witches? Sign me up. The result is as enjoyable as it is uneven, and while I wouldn’t call this one a masterpiece in the same vein as some of her other works, it’s a worthwhile read for any fan of Dimaline, witches, or some combination thereof.Lucky St. James had a rocky childhood. Métis but disconnected from her community, largely raised by her grandmother, Stella, while her mother, Arnya, floated in and out of her life, Lucky spends most of her time worrying about Stella and where she and Stella will live now that they have been evicted from Stella’s apartment. As the adulting closes in around her, Lucky discovers a strange, decorative spoon that catapults her into the middle of a centuries-old conspiracy to protect women and witchcraft from the men who would root them out and kill them.It’s interesting: my first time meeting Lucky wasn’t here but rather in the short short story “After ’While” published by CBC Books in 2017. I have used this story in my English class when teaching about fiction, and until I picked up VenCo, I had no idea that Lucky was wrapped up in actual magic! Nor, I suppose, did Lucky.The Chosen One trope is so old and tired at this point as to be creaking under the weight of all its iterations. One would be forgiven for yawning slightly at the descriptions of Lucky’s journey, how she discovers her heritage as a witch and her involvement in a prophecy to protect witches and reignite the magic of a coven in North America. If you decide to follow Lucky’s story, it isn’t likely because you think the story is in any way unique. It’s probably because you like Lucky and Stella and the cast of characters Dimaline serves up to keep us invested. I know I do.Lucky’s fierce protective spirit, especially when it comes to Stella, is front-and-centre in this narrative. This manifests explosively, impulsively. When she butts heads with Meena it’s usually because Meena is trying to be cautious or helpful—the good leader, the good strategist—whereas Lucky is prone to going full throttle into the danger. This makes for compelling tension and helps with the pacing, particularly towards the end of the book.But the supporting cast, including Meena herself, Wendy, Freya, Morticia, Lucille, etc., are also a highlight here. I’m no expert, as a white woman, on Indigenous storytelling; however, I think I can see how Dimaline, who’s Métis from Georgian Bay, has drawn on the structures of Indigenous storytelling for this book. Each member of Lucky’s coven eventually tells her story, the book slowly circling around their characters until finally pulling us back into the main narrative. Of course, you might expect—and you would be right—that I’m particularly drawn to and appreciative of Freya’s story. To see a trans woman featured prominently in a book about womanhood and witchcraft is very affirming (and if you liked that, check out Her Majesty’s Royal Coven by Juno Dawson). Nevertheless, each of the characters has a unique vector into their awakening to their identity of witch. That’s powerful.In contrast, the antagonist, Jay Christos, is … meh. He’s a man. He’s an old and very powerful man, very single-minded in his goals. He oozes misogyny and clearly thrills from the sexual violence he exerts or plans to exert upon women. So he’s an appropriate choice of villain for this tale, and don’t get me wrong; I love the smackdown that Lucky lays upon him. But there is also an element of caricature going on here: the jacked up, ultra-misogynistic men in our world like Andrew Tate are indeed a problem, but so too are the less overtly dangerous men out there who soak up that worldview.Similarly, as much as I enjoyed some of the interactions among the Mother, Maiden, and Crone, I feel like their interstitial moments add very little to the story. Prophetic structures are in general hard to pull off. In this case, it adds a fun ticking clock to the narrative, but even that seems like it’s deemphasized for much of the book.What I absolutely loved, however, was the climax and the ending. I really dig how Dimaline uses Lucky’s dreams as a battlefield against Christos; there was some fantastic foreshadowing earlier in the book that prepared us for this confrontation, and it’s very rewarding. In these moments, Lucky truly comes into her own as a protagonist and a heroine, and it’s in her battle against Christos that VenCo truly achieves its height of unabating, electrifying suspense. I needed to see it through, needed to see her defeat him, needed to see her and Stella safe. I won’t spoil the ending; all I can say is that, for me, it largely makes up for any unevenness in the rest of the plot.VenCo is not as allegorical as The Marrow Thieves and is not as intricately dark and dangerous as Empire of Wild. However, I like the idea and most of the execution. Above all else, I like seeing Dimaline try something new, push off in a different direction. I would read more about Lucky and her grandmother some day.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

But Black people are best positioned to critique it—and to defend the need for academic responses to it. As Florida and other US states decry “critical race theory” i schools, Our History Has Always Been Contraband: In Defense of Black Studies is just that. Colin Kaepernick, Robin D.G. Kelley, and Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor have selected a treasure trove of historic essays that explicate the need for strong academic programs that focus on studying Black literature, Black histories, Black cultures—both within the African American context and beyond. I received a copy of this book for free in exchange for a .As I often do with these kinds of books, I like to start off with a positionality disclaimer: I am, of course, a white woman. This book will hit differently for me than it will for Black readers. The book also acknowledges that it is very focused on the United States, and therefore on anti-Black racism through the lens of African American enslavement and oppression. The editors have done this on purpose to make sure the volume is slim and accessible. I understand that desire, and it was probably the right call—yet my biggest takeaway, having now read all these essays, is that I need more. I’m Canadian, so my familiarity with and relationship to the history of slavery and other, often ongoing anti-Black racism will be different from American readers. That being said, Canada desperately needs more Black studies here, at every level of the education system. So much of this book still applies north of the border!Another strength of this book is how it focuses on historic writings over contemporary. The first two parts, the bulk, are taken up by these essays—or more often than not, excerpts from what are much longer pieces. At first I was annoyed by this strategy, but now I see the value in it: if I was moved enough by one of the excerpts, it is easy enough for me to locate the full-length version elsewhere. This way, Kaepernick and the others expose readers to a wider cross-section of discourse from Black thinkers and writers. I like it.Some of the authors are famous names you have (hopefully) heard of, such as Frederick Douglass, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, etc. Others might be more niche but no less talented, no less important. I particularly want to highlight “Toward a Black Feminist Criticism” by Barbara Smith from 1977. Smith, cofounder of the Combahee River Collective, argues that Black women have too long been invisible in their contributions to literature and art. Black women writers and artists need spaces to share their experiences without being erased by white feminists or by Black men. Smith especially highlights the plight of Black lesbian writers, who face three axes of oppression. In this way I hear a lot of echoes of critiques from Audre Lorde or bell hooks. Indeed, the writing of Black women is so important to elevate and amplify for exactly the reasons that Smith gives in this short excerpt. A feminism built exclusively on the complaints and experiences of white, straight women will never liberate all women.This collection goes hard, by the way—I hope that was obvious from what I said above. These essays don’t pull their punches; if you were looking for something to coddle white fragility, don’t expect anything here. This book makes it very clear that Black people in the US are fighting for survival, still, and that Black studies programs and Black literature are vital to that survival.Part 3 caps the book with three essays written for the collection. They emphasize the need for resistance against the unjust laws and censorship occurring within the academy and the wider education system in the US. Again, as specific as this book is to that context, these ideas are taking root in other places around the world, so these essays are still relevant.This book is an excellent collection of thoughts, arguments, and purposeful expressions of resistance and struggle. It epitomizes why racists are so terrified of allowing critical thinking and history to be taught in schools, of why they are working so hard to ban these books and ideas from classrooms and lecture theatres. Black scholars, Black writers, Black thinkers have always been at the forefront of anti-oppressive thought and action. Now they need our help. Our History Has Always Been Contraband reminds readers that it’s the same dance, just a different tune: the struggle has existed for centuries, and it’s time to fight again.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

My edition is two-toned: pink down one half, red down the other. The “so” in the title is superimposed over a pair of lips, with the lipstick smeared on the right. The lips themselves are actually a cutout, and when you open the front cover, the page beneath is all blue and reads, “You should be so angry”—a stark contrast to the book’s title, You Could Be So Pretty. And what can I say? Holly Bourne does it again.Belle and Joni are the same age and competing for the Scholarship—beyond that, they have nothing in common. Belle follows the Doctrine. She applies her Mask every morning, sweats daily in Body Prayer, and generally does her best to look pretty. Joni, on the other hand, has embraced the life of an Objectionable. She doesn’t put on a Mask, barely washes her hair even, and she doesn’t care for Doctrine. It’s her choice, of course—every woman is free to choose whether or not to follow Doctrine. But that doesn’t stop people from looking down on Joni, her mother, and those like her. That is, until Belle’s perfect Pretty life starts falling apart around her. As she spends more time around Joni, she starts to wonder if Doctrine is as shiny and unimpeachable as it seems.I had so many complicated feelings while reading this. I couldn’t put it down. I also wanted to throw it across the room.See, I understand what Bourne is trying to do here, and I’m mostly on board. I really, really hate to say this given how many of them were TERFy and intersectionality in general was not their strong suit, but the second-wave feminists had a lot of excellent points that feel startlingly relevant these days. Feminism in popular discourse has collapsed under the weight of the rhetoric of “choice,” with the implication being that all the women and girls out there who lean hard into heavy makeup, cosmetic procedures, and emulating a pornified version of sexuality are doing so out of an irreproachable sense of individual freedom. Women and girls choose to be slutty, you see. It’s empowering.Bourne’s disdain for this line, for the patriarchal control that it conceals, is palpable throughout You Could Be So Pretty. Feminism, she charges, has lost the anger that was at its core, and she wants to reawaken that fire and help it burn brighter within young women and girls.Now, on the surface, the dystopian allegory Bourne uses to achieve this mission feels facile. The overuse of proper nouns—Mask, Pretty, Objectionable, Invisible, etc.—and the highly simplified world in which these girls exist gives the book a kind of glossiness that peels as you read and makes it feel … cheap. I can see how some readers, particularly those like myself who have steeped ourselves in decades of feminism and young adult literature, might look at this book and think, “This is too on the nose. Too simplified. There’s nothing here.”Take, for example, the inciting incident of the book—Belle is harassed and almost abducted by a man who wants to give her a ride to school because she’s hot. Joni’s intervention allows them to escape, with some difficulty thanks to Belle’s impractical footwear. The scene is viscerally terrifying and no doubt familiar, in one permutation or another, to a majority of women readers. So familiar that one might wonder if the messaging her is too obvious.Yet I tried my best to take a step back and put myself in the shoes of a younger reader, a teenage girl in our current era of ubiquitous porn, social media likes and comments and filters, and algorithmic content. I live in this world yet am not of this world, certainly didn’t grow up in this world, and it behoves me to consider how a younger denizen of that world would come to You Could Be So Pretty and its central critique of choice feminism.Dystopian allegories are valuable for how they allow us to end-run the complexity of the real world. One of the reasons being feminist in our world is so complicated is that the world itself is complicated. Much as one tries to do one’s best for the environment, for animals, for others, the systems in which we are trapped make it difficult to be conscientious, to be “pure.” Stripping that away in favour of a world of school and Education, of rankings and validation, of Ceremonies, might feel simplistic to those of us caught up in the daily grind of this world. Yet it allows Bourne a much more versatile canvas for the conversation she wants to have on the page. As such, Bourne harnesses dystopia effectively in my opinion. This is also very much a book that is about the imperfection of revolution. Joni most notably embodies this trait. What I love most about Joni is not that she’s “woke” but that she is still young and learning about nuance. Joni’s interactions with her mother are powerful and important, for they reveal how Joni’s passion has yet to develop into the wisdom that comes with experience. In a notable scene, Joni explains how she was confused that her mother makes beauty products available to the women who visit their little feminist shelter. Joni, having been raised by her mother to believe that these products are anathema, doesn’t understand why her mother would willingly give them out to women she’s trying to shake out of Doctrine. Yet Joni’s mother sees the bigger picture, understands that these women need the comfort of the familiar, understands that it’s more complicated.This entire “deprogramming” aspect of the book is compelling, for it really does make a strong argument that the beauty-industrial complex is a cult. Joni’s mission to “awaken” Belle, while cute and very naïvely feminist at times, speaks to the strength of patriarchy’s grip on our minds and souls. It isn’t that Belle can’t see how fucked up her life is, from the constant public exposure to porn to the way she embraces disordered eating to stay fit. But she is in a cult, and when you are in a cult, it’s hard to recognize that fucked up means you should get out.All of this is to say, every moment in this book hits hard. It’s going to be trite and predictable for a lot of older, ardently feminist readers, but I don’t think that should be a turn-off. I think it’s important to meet this book where it is. It’s an awakening of sorts for readers, a primer, yes, but it is also a deep and heartfelt attempt to hold a mirror up to our world and say, “Hey, this is messed up.” And if that isn’t the purpose of dystopia or allegory, I don’t know what is.Now, of course, this book has limitations. I’d love to declare this book the YA feminist work of a generation, but I can’t be that absolutist. For one, this book is very much grounded in white and Western ideas about feminism, patriarchy, and beauty standards. The experiences and anxieties reflected here are largely those of white, cis, able-bodied women. Although Bourne makes some attempts to be intersectional, these generally don’t work very well.First, let’s talk about the gender binary. Trans and gender-nonconforming people are largely absent from this book. To be fair, Bourne tries to be inclusive. At one point, an authority figure uses the phrase “female-identifying students,” and later in the novel, there is a brief appearance of a trans girl. I really do appreciate this inclusion, but I also see it as a band-aid, for I don’t believe that Doctrine is compatible with the existence of trans women and girls. Patriarchy is inherently transphobic, so by hacking the dystopia to be trans-inclusive, Bourne ironically misses the mark on intersectionality. I would have rather she explored the idea that Doctrine suppresses trans people entirely as another dimension of why it must be resisted.A similar problem exists with race. Again, Bourne is clearly aware of this issue: Vanessa, Belle’s “best friend,” is highly melanated. The book emphasizes how Vanessa’s darker skin makes it more challenging for her to be perceived as Pretty, a nod to the misogynoir that Black women face in a world where beauty standards are aggressively white and Eurocentric. So kudos to Bourne for that. Again, though, it’s insufficient and papers over the complexities that racism introduces to critiques of patriarchy.Am I nitpicking? After all, Bourne is clearly writing this allegory based on her experience as a white cis woman. Maybe she feels like it isn’t her place to speak to the experience of trans women or women of colour. Fair enough. Indeed, no single book can be the universal feminist book, and I would never expect You Could Be So Pretty to be everything for everyone.Nevertheless, the fact remains that, as a trans woman, I had a hard time seeing myself in either Belle or Joni at points. The way this book engages with patriarchal ideas of femininity does not always resonate with my own relationship to femininity. That’s OK. However, I can’t lie—it also feels disappointing that in 2023, our feminist primers and manifestos continue to flatten feminism down to something that is most recognizable and most relatable to white cis women and girls.As I said above, this is a limitation of You Could Be So Pretty. I want to be critical of this book precisely because I liked it so much, believe i its themes so much. So don’t let my critique dissuade you from picking up this book, for it is powerful and raw and beautiful in its own, terrifying kind of way. Holly Bourne remains one of my favourite feminist novelists. She is just so good at poking holes in patriarchy and at creating great characters while doing it. You Could Be So Pretty is a striking evolution in her style versus some of her earlier forays into feminist YA, demonstrating that she still has plenty more stories to tell and battles to win. I hope this book awakens more than a few younger people and helps them push back against the absurdity that is the doctrine in our own world. I don’t mind being Pretty sometimes—but I definitely want us to be more Objectionable all of the time. Well-behaved women don’t make history.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Those three words in the subject line of an email were all it took for me to windmill slam “yes” on getting an eARC of The Queen of Days from NetGalley and publisher HarperVoyager. Some marketing person knew the magic words that would pique my interest instantly. I was excited to dive in, and thankfully, the book lived up to the hype! This is a delightful, powerful adventure that left me wanting more in all the right ways.Balthazar, aka Bal, is a scion of a noble family that has fallen on hard times. He now makes a living as a thief in the city that his family once ruled, and his latest heist sees him reluctantly partnering up with the mythical and mysterious Queen of Days. The heist, as heists often do, goes pear-shaped. On the run and outgunned, Bal and his crew and the Queen of Days find themselves as unlikely allies on a quest to kill a god, save their city (and possibly the world), and keep their skins intact.The book opens with Bal meeting the Queen of Days, whose name we soon learn is Tassiel, or Tass. From there, we quickly move into meeting the supporting cast and the heist itself. I appreciate this pacing—I don’t mind when a heist book builds up to the heist-as-climax, but I also like when they do what Kelly does here. The heist, you see, is actually an appetizer before the real plot takes off. After a brief diversion into a mysterious Archive for some exposition and raising of stakes, Bal and Tass and the crew are back out into the city, on the run, trying to figure out what to do next.The found family vibes are strong here. Kelly alternates chapters between Bal and Tass’s perspectives. Something I really liked is how the chapter titles for Tass evolve. At the start of the book, they provide her full name and title; as the story continues, they shorten to “Tassiel” and then eventually “Tass,” signifying her acceptance of this identity and her connection to Bal and his crew.The mystery of Tass’s identity—who she is, where her magic comes from, where she herself comes from—is one of the earliest and most central mysteries in this book, and it’s fun. The way that Kelly teases out the mystery, not giving us everything at once yet also never lingering too long before dropping another clue, is tantalizing and kept me reading. I needed to know more about Tass, more about the magic in this world—and the others. Kelly artfully combines several standard tropes in a way that breathes new life into them.Similarly, Bal’s own character arc, though less dramatic, is no less important in this story. At the beginning, he is fixated on revenge and protecting his kid sister. That second desire never changes, of course. Yet Bal must confront what “revenge” means against the backdrop of bigger, more existential threats, and it’s in this crucible that he demonstrates his ability to be heroic. I really like how his friendship with Tass develops. There is a kindness to the core of his character that often feels lacking in male protagonists of his mould. He isn’t quite a lovable rogue, and he also isn’t a blustering blowhard of a fighter. Kelly has carved out an unique and interesting man who, despite numerous flaws, brings people together in a way that is its own kind of magic.Though I praised the pacing earlier, if I were to critique anything about this book, it would actually be how too much happens. This is a book with a lot of side quests. Not all of them held my interest. I’m thinking of one in particular, a foray finally into Tass’s home—I can see why Kelly includes this, but at the same time, I kept thinking, “I just want us to get back to the main conflict here.” This is the problem when you try to write an epic fantasy story that also wants to be a cozy, family-centric heist story: the two genres are difficult to mash together since they have diametrically opposed atmospheres. That Kelly manages to make them work as well as she does is, in and of itself, quite impressive.If one of those two genres wins out, it’s the latter. The Queen of Days is indeed epic on paper; there is no denying that. There are gods. An entire city trembles. The stakes are real. Yet we don’t really care about that. The readers are here for Bal and Tass and the lovable crew that surrounds them.The Queen of Days raised me from a reading slump. It elevated my resting, reading heart rate. If you could hook me up to a faucet of hot-and-cold running fantasy in this style, I would be a happy woman. As it is, I am left wanting more—in a good way—and I can’t recommend this book enough to people who want epic fantasy with cozy characters.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

From contemporary romance we travel to historical fiction with this small tale of sisterhood nestled in the woods of Norway centuries ago. I’m impressed with how Iversen won me over despite my qualms about the book’s pacing and plot! I received an eARC from NetGalley and publisher Sourcebooks in exchange for my .Kaija and Minna are witches. For most of their lives, they have lived in seclusion in the birchwoods with their adoptive mother, who spirited them away from the village of their birth after their mother was burned at the stake for witchcraft. Now grown, their adoptive mother dead, Kaija and Minna are at a crossroads. Kaija is determined to return to the village and establish an “ordinary” life for herself. Minna, far darker of temperament, sees no need to suppress her magic or fit in with ordinary people. The sisters part ways, each trying to find success at the life they want to lead. Of course, it can’t be that simple….I was intrigued by the promise of sister drama. Minna’s bitterness towards the world as a result of her and her mother’s persecution is a dark seed that she willingly nurtures. When Kaija abandons her—as she sees it—she is rightly furious. As Kaija works to establish a new life for herself, Minna seeks her out and plots something that is, if not revenge, then revenge-adjacent. The tragedy of Minna’s descent into antagonist and eventual blackhearted villain was so tantalizing for me. However, lest I misrepresent the book and at risk of spoilers—it is not quite meant to be.Now, the book is still about the bond of sisterhood. That much remains intact, and it’s this theme that kept me going. Watching Minna pull herself back from the brink of darkness proves compelling even as Kaija must grapple with her own setbacks. I admit that Iversen likely made the right call by ensuring that the worst of Kaija’s misfortunes are not directly wrought by Minna. Not only does it offer a pathway to redemption for Minna in the eyes of Kaija and the reader alike, but it’s a potent reminder that often our worst moments in life are not anyone’s fault. Circumstances just suck sometimes.I liked this book. I also struggled with this book. It’s just slow. It’s a lot of narration from each sister, and it takes forever to get going. Yet at the same time, it feels like we never get to know anyone other than Kaija and Minna. They hold every other character at arm’s length in their narration. Fifteen years in and I still don’t have a great term to describe how I feel about this style of writing. The closest I can get is that I can’t connect with the characters. It’s possibly related to my inability to visualize as I read: authors who rely primarily on descriptive language tend to fall flatter for me than authors who use more dialogue and action.So, as is usually the case, your mileage may vary. This is a sweet story of sisterhood and dreams denied. It’s a tragedy wrapped around family ties, and it’s an interesting exploration of the ways in which internalized misogyny can fuck you up. But it’s a little slow, and it never quite lives up to the promises I feel like it establishes at the start of the story.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Being Ace: An Anthology of QueAsexuality is everywhere, yet because it is classically the absence of something, its presence can be difficult to see. Being Ace: An Anthology of Queer, Trans, Femme, and Disabled Stories of Asexual Love and Connection is an attempt to foreground asexuality within a variety of environments. Madeline Dyer has assembled an ace team (oh, you know the puns are just starting) of authors to contribute stories and even a poem that get you thinking. Cody Daigle-Orians, who wrote I Am Ace, offers a heartfelt introduction to the collection. I received an eARC of this book from NetGalley and Page Street.Some of these authors are familiar to me, either from other books of theirs I have read or simply from following them on social media. Although I’ve pretty much always known I am asexual, it wasn’t until around university that I started to learn more about that label, and it wasn’t until later than that—2012 or thereabouts—that I started to find online community and realize that my sexuality falls under the umbrella of queerness. Following acespec authors and finding acespec stories was very important to me. The same goes for arospec authors and stories (as I am in fact aroace). Indeed, Being Ace serves as a comfortable companion text to Common Bonds: An Aromantic Speculative Fiction Anthology (and the two anthologies share contributors).The stories take place everywhere and everywhen, from fairytale-inspired fantasy worlds to science-fictional settings on asteroids to vaguely contemporary tales in the here and now. Aces are witches; aces are asteroid miners taking on moon goddesses; aces are patients in eating disorder clinics; aces are monster hunters. The potpourri of settings seems to emphasize the anthology’s message: aces are everywhere, deal with it.Stand-out stories in this collection for me include “Across the Stars,” by Akemi Dawn Bowman; “Give Up the Ghost,” by Linsey Miller; “Smells Like Teen Virgin,” by S.E. Anderson; and “The Mermaid’s Sister,” by Moniza Hossain. However, I would like to emphasize that this is a remarkably consistent collection, in my opinion, as far as enjoyment of its stories goes. The hit ratio is high with this one.“Across the Stars” is really just an adorable story about finding friendship while trying to preserve one’s connection to family. I like that it is less about the protagonist needing to navigate coming out or finding acceptance and more simply about them existing as asexual in this universe. (I would also read more set in this universe.)“Give Up the Ghost” is poignant in a really kind of sad, devastating way, as ghost stories and murder mysteries often are.“Smells Like Teen Virgin” is a fun send-up of purity culture as well as monster-hunting schlock. The family and sibling dynamics are very compelling.“The Mermaid’s Sister” is a quaint reimagining of The Little Mermaid told from the perspective of Ariel’s ace sister; I like that the prince was not a dick in this one.I do think allosexual people should read this anthology and will find a lot in it that helps them better understand ace experiences. That being said, I can only  this book from my perspective as a fellow ace gal … and I didn’t expect this book to make me feel so sad at times. So emotional. I am largely having a very happy life as a single ace person, especially now in my thirties—but compulsory sexuality is a trip, and sometimes our society is not kind to single people or people who live alone. Being Ace certainly offers hope and compassion, but there are moments when it really does hold up a mirror to that toughness. Which is, I suppose, a testament to how powerful its stories are.I’m not surprised I enjoyed this anthology, and I highly recommend it. But more than that, I hope that it encourages readers to check out other work by authors in this collection. The more ace voices we hear and read, the better we are able to question what we think of as normal or the default when it comes to our experiences of sex, love, desire, companionship, and belonging in our society.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Oh, and everyone around you keeps acting super sketch? That’s Cordelia Bone’s problem in The Witches of Bone Hill. Part romance, part thriller, all fantasy, this book uses a lot of classic tropes, often to good effect. Ava Morgyn’s writing took me a while to warm up to, yet by the end of the book, I found myself sad to say goodbye to the Bone sisters. Thanks to St. Martin’s Griffin and NetGalley for the eARC in exchange for a .Cordelia and Eustace Bone are estranged sisters of a mother estranged from her family. Cordelia is going through a messy divorce with a cheating husband when she hears from her sister for the first time in years: their great aunt Augusta is dead. Time to return to the family property in Connecticut, where a stodgy lawyer named Todgers (I kid you not) informs them that they can only inherit if they stick around. Sounds strange but OK. Then the weird shit gets weirder, for Cordelia and Eustace’s relatives weren’t just eccentric, reclusive, and rich—they were witches. And so are these two sisters.I did not like the opening of this book at all. Cordelia comes across as a well-off, if scorned, woman of privilege. Morgyn kind of infodumps a bunch of stuff, like her relationship (or lack thereof) with Eustace, as well as most of the John/cheating backstory. Then a mafia boss shows up and shakes her down, and it all feels … cheesy. To be honest, that feeling never really goes away for the rest of the book. I guess I kind of just … started to roll with it. I could have dealt without either John or Busy’s extended involvement in the plot—neither of them feel all that necessary, and Busy is almost completely extraneous. But these are minor complaints.The romance, similarly, didn’t work for me—but that’s just how I am with romance, as many of you might already know. For someone coming to this book specifically looking for such a subplot, I think you’ll like it. Sparks fly, the usual misunderstandings and recriminations occur, but in the end, you know how these things go. It’s standard—though not, I should say, all that steamy.So I won’t lie: The Witches of Bone Hill was a slog for me at first. This book is also long, relatively speaking (I read it on my Kindle, but it’s 384 pages in print), and it takes a while for Morgyn to get to the point of the story.But once we get there, it’s really good.See, this is a story about two sisters who have to find their way separately but together. Eustace is ecstatic with their inheritance. She wants nothing more but to accept it, settle down, and embrace her burgeoning gift. Cordelia sees her gift as sinister, and she isn’t ready to leave behind her old life. The way that Morgyn contrasts these sisters, even as we learn more about their sordid and complex family history, is delightful. This is a book about how inheriting darkness doesn’t mean embracing it.I really liked how Eustace and Cordelia plot to turn the tables on their adversary by throwing a party. The climax of the book is well done—though the identity of the villain is predictable, and the resolution equally easy to foresee, it’s still a fun ride. It’s still powerful to see these two women come into their own, connect to their ancestors, and rise to the occasion.The Witches of Bone Hill is not quite a book for me, but I liked it well enough. If you like romance a bit more than me and want something that feels both fresh and familiar at the same time, I think you’ll enjoy this.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Paige Crutcher brings a dazzling dash of creativity to her storytelling. Alas, I didn’t enjoy her narrative style or her characterization. My thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Griffin for the eARC in exchange for a .Aline Weir was always the loner kid. One day at a sleepover, a ghost of a girl named Dragon befriends her. Aline grows up and grows into her witchy power to help spirits cross over. An accident with a boy her age, however, reverberates across the world and will have consequences for more than Aline. Practically raised by Fates, she finds herself drawn to the magical town of Matchstick. Soon she is in a pitched battle against an ancient enemy who has designs on the personifications of magic themselves—unless Aline and her allies can find a way to restore the balance.What Became of Magic keeps insisting that Aline is special—indeed that she is inextricably bound up with Magic, who is both a force and a man. But I don’t see it. Aline is boring, at least from the distance at which we get to know her. Crutcher’s narrative choices don’t work for me. There is a veritable montage of Aline’s childhood at the beginning of the book. Instead, bits and bobs of flashbacks spread out through the narrative might have kept me more interested. As it is, I never felt myself connecting to Aline. Like, Crutcher makes it very clear that her parents were always distant and never thought Aline would amount to much of anything—but we never really see Aline feel it, you know?Then, after Aline leaves the bookstore for the town of Matchstick, the plot spins wildly out of control. Suddenly Crutcher throws us into a quest-like structure. Again, she puts a lot of work into establishing both allies and enemies, as well as laying out the stakes. It should all come together to create a great story. Yet it’s messy, convoluted—the rules are constantly shifting. And none of the characters are three-dimensional enough for me to care about them. Not even Aline.I also can’t stand romantic subplots premised on destiny, for it veers uncomfortably close to removing agency (or even consent). To be clear, that’s a personal preference of mine; I’m not trying to say that is what Crutcher implies happens here. Indeed, if anyone is going to enjoy this chaotic book, it’s going to be romance fans who want to swoon over the idea of True Love between a witch and a magic man.As it is, there was just nothing for me to grab onto as I read this book. I felt like I was listening to a child tell me the fantasy story they had just made up—each time they jump to a new scene, I need to stop them and ask questions because I cannot keep it straight in my head. Crutcher’s imagination is unquestionable—but the organization of this book, its editing, the plotting and pacing and protagonist—none of it works for me.In the end, What Became of Magic felt like a missed opportunity. I say this not to be harsh. I don’t think it is a bad book. But I came really close to DNFing it.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I feel old saying that—I only just turned thirty-four—but it is true. When I first started using the iBack in my day, the internet used to be better. I feel old saying that—I only just turned thirty-four—but it is true. When I first started using the internet in the early 2000s, the web had become functional enough to be fun, the walled gardens of nineties CompuServe and AOL had come down, and anyone (including fourteen-year-old Kara) could make a website for free on a place like Geocities.And then it all got terrible.Or, as fellow Canadian writer Cory Doctorow puts it, “enshittified.” But unlike yours truly, Doctorow doesn’t just want to complain about this problem: he also has a plan to fix it! Enter The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation, a book-length distillation of thoughts he has been putting out for, well, about as long as I have been alive at this point. Doctorow writes and speaks about enshittification and interoperability (the two main motifs of this book) quite a bit—I recommend this essay in particular if you want a sense of his writing style and ideas before diving into this book. Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for a .Let’s break this down in to the two parts of the book’s title. “The Internet Con” refers to that first concept I mentioned, enshittification. Basically, it means that in the current regulatory climate, Big Tech corporations have a financial incentive—indeed, one might argue they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders—to make their services worse in a way that locks users into them. (As an aside, credit to the CBC radio program Spark for pointing out to me that only tech companies and drug dealers refer to their customers as users….) There’s more to unpack here—which is what Doctorow spends the first part of the book doing—but there are plenty of simple examples. Social networks like Instagram don’t offer strictly chronological feeds anymore (though that might be changing, at least for some, thanks to new EU regulations) because those feeds don’t keep people engaged very long, which means they serve us up fewer ads. Apple has total control over what runs on an iPhone because that locks you in to their ecosystem. And so on. Doctorow attributes much enshittification to weak laws (in the United States, but exported to or emulated by other countries) around monopoly and monopsony.Doctorow’s solution? Legislate interoperability, i.e., force companies to allow others to play on their playground, to make systems that interface with their own, etc. This ensures users’ data can be portable and also gives companies incentives to make their apps, etc., you know, actually good—because there will be competition. Big Tech is, understandably, opposed to interoperability. Doctorow spends most of the second half of the book explaining how a couple of types of interoperability work, and he gives examples of successes in history—a notable one being how the VHS tape won out over Betamax.There’s a lot to love about The Internet Con. Doctorow effortlessly moves among the domains of history, law, economics, and more. He provides important context, stirs up resentment, and then proffers up platefuls of hope. That’s my main takeaway from this book, and it feels so necessary in our current climate of ever-increasing prices for worse and worse streaming services, not to mention the walled gardens of social networks. I really appreciate that Doctorow adamantly insists something can be done.His utter rejection of Big Tech as it currently exists at the apotheosis of late-stage capitalism is also so refreshing. I’ve been spending too much time on LinkedIn lately (one of the hazards of starting a freelance copyediting business, lol). Too many people on that platform talk about “creating change” in tech, usually through a lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion. But then they turn around and embrace super problematic trends, like crypto or generative AI. It feels so rare these days to see a cis white man selling a book that says “down with Big Tech!”The book ends kind of abruptly. There isn’t really a conclusion; the last chapter is called “What about Blockchain?” and focuses on debunking that as a potential solution (following a series of chapters where Doctorow addresses a single objection or alternative to mandating interoperability). Then there’s a further reading list and an index, and that’s it. I found that peculiar—it must be deliberate, perhaps to send the message that this fight is far from over. Or maybe Doctorow just thought he had made his point clear and didn’t want to overstay his welcome—the book is under 200 pages, and I respect that.Though some of Doctorow’s digressions into history or economics might require people to reread them a couple of times to fully grasp what he’s saying, his writing overall is super accessible. This is actually the first nonfiction book by Doctorow that I’m ing here—but I’m starting to get the impression that I enjoy his nonfiction writing far more than I do his fiction projects. His voice and style in his novels just doesn’t do it for me—it’s far too polemical, too bare, which I don’t want in my stories but love in my nonfiction.The Internet Con is a book about what is wrong with the internet and Big Tech and, more importantly, provides a roadmap to fix it. Doctorow has been around long enough to understand these problems and advocate for workable solutions. Now he’s explaining it in a way that all us laypeople can understand, so that we can do the work of organizing and, as he puts it, seizing the means of computation. It’s time to get interoperable, baby.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I loved Em X. Liu’s obvious love for Shakespeare, and as far as Shakespearean retellings go, this one is pretty good. As far as thrillers go—well, we all know I’m not the biggest fan of thrillers to begin with. As far as murder mysteries go—well, it’s not much of a mystery, now is it? Thanks to NetGalley and publisher Solaris for the eARC.Look, I won’t summarize Hamlet for you. Elsinore is a lab rather than a castle; Hayden and his murdered dad are scientists working on life-prolonging serums; Felicia (Ophelia) is an intern, and her dad, Paul (Polonius) is the head of Elsinore’s security. Liu casts Horatio as the lab’s disembodied artificial intelligence. The book opens on Horatio “regaining consciousness” and seeing Hayden next to his father’s body. From there, things quickly spiral out of control. It’s tense; it’s queer; it’s hot and heavy at points (not my thing).I’m mostly interested in looking at this book and how it represents an evolution of Shakespeare. What I mean by this is that Shakespeare has been reinterpreted from the moment his plays started to be performed. Each era, each society, projects its own ideas on to Shakespeare’s stories and reifies them in different ways. Liu has taken Hamlet and reimagined it as a locked-room murder mystery set in the 2050s—yet it is still definitely Shakespeare. However, I also really like how Liu took liberties with the characters and plot—this is more reimagining than retelling, and that is for the better.If Shakespeare were alive today, I have no doubt he would write science fiction (and also historical fiction, and let’s face it, he would probably make his living writing erotica or porn or something). The inclusion of an AI main character—Horatio, no less—and the subplot around developing a life-prolonging serum both feel true to ideas that show up time and again Shakespeare’s work. So much of what he talks about, in Hamlet but also in The Tempest and other plays, comes down to ruminating on how well we can really know others (or even ourselves). Horatio and Hayden’s relationship here, the use of a neural-mapping interface to allow them to communicate with each other and know each other far more intimately than would otherwise be possible, is an intriguing reading of Horatio and Hayden’s relationship in the original play. That Horatio is an AI and thus an “other” speaks to the ambivalence with which the play treats Horatio, the way that he always seems to be present yet seldom gets much acknowledgement from everyone else.I don’t want to go into spoiler territory, but let’s just say that I think what happens with Horatio and Hayden in the end is a great change to the original story. The same goes for the fates of Felicia and even the way that Liu characterizes Hayden’s mother—I feel like Liu spent a lot of time thinking about the role of women in the original play. Felicia certainly receives much more depth and time than Ophelia does, and her fate is likewise both more hopeful and more palatable. She is arguably as much of a protagonist in this book as Hayden is, and the story is better for it.The “lyrical” nature of the book is where The Death I Gave Him loses me. While I really liked Liu’s plot and character choices, I didn’t like their writing style as much. Both the description and the dialogue would occasionally grate on me, and the conceit that the book is a manuscript by a researcher looking back on the entire incident felt unnecessary. There’s a lot of layers here that I’m not sure the story needed.The Death I Gave Him is creative and original (despite being based on Hamlet). It didn’t land all the way for me, but it came close enough that I know there’s an audience out there just waiting to fall in love with this tragedy. I can’t wait for that audience to find it, for I would like to see more of what Liu has to offer in the future.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Lavie Tidhar’s The Circumference of the World is imaginative and, dare I say, quite a bit wacky; however, it never coalesced into something I would call enjoyable. Thanks to NetGalley and Tachyon Publications for the eARC.Delia is a mathematician from Vanuatu, though now she lives in London. Her boyfriend’s disappearance causes her to start looking for a book so rare some think it doesn’t exist. This pulp science-fiction novel is at the centre of a cult-like church that believes reading the book conveys protection against the “Eaters,” mysterious creatures connected to black holes (I am keeping the details vague to avoid spoilers here). Delia enlists the help of a book detective, essentially, who then falls in with a gangster, who then … you know what, it’s turtles all the way down.The best and perhaps also worst aspect of The Circumference of the World for me was the structure of the narrative. We leave Delia in the first part of the book to follow Daniel, and then leave him to follow Oskar, and there is also an interstitial moment where we are in the Lode Stars story itself, which may or may not be real or even more real than the rest of this story. The way that Tidhar plays with the flexible nature of reality and fiction is skillful and thought-provoking. The scenes set within Lode Stars, in a far, posthuman future, demonstrate some really neat thinking about the nature of humanity and the cosmos. The wider novel as a whole dances around notions of the simulation hypothesis, albeit coming at it from a very different angle than we might be used to.This is all to the good. Where the book failed to work for me was the characters themselves. The narration often felt stilted, and I had trouble connecting to most of the main characters. Although I like the segmented structure of the book, I wish we had come back to Delia and spent more time with her than we did. Overall, the book itself felt both too long and too short—with characters and plots being picked up and then dropped without resolution.File this under “some amazing science fiction happening here but in a way that never comes together as a single coherent story.”Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

The Nature of Witches is a delightfully straightforward tale of magic, love, fear, and growth from Rachel Griffin. As long as you don’t expect too much from it, you will be entertained.Clara is an Everwitch, so rare that the last one lived over a century ago. Most witches find their magic tied to and characterized by the season of their birth; Clara, on the other hand, is equally strong during any season—at least in theory. In practice, Clara isn’t living up to her potential, or so it seems her teachers feel. In this world, witches live openly among nonmagical humans (“shaders”) and use their magic to control the weather. Climate change is making that more and more difficult, however, and the higher-ups among witches see Clara’s Everwitch abilities as crucial to changing that. But Clara is afraid: the stronger her power gets, the more likely it is to lash out and kill those she feels close to. It happened when she was younger, and she is determined not to let it happen again.I really like Clara. Griffin makes it easy to relate to her fears and desires. She feels isolated by what she is, and she isolates herself even further in turn, compounding the problem. When the inevitable love interest shows up, she tries to push him away for his own good—classic. As someone who typically doesn’t enjoy romance, that subplot was probably the hardest for me to enjoy—at one point, I thought he was going to betray her, lol, but that’s just me craving more drama.And therein lies my critique: honestly, this book drags in the conflict department. The conflict is there—both Clara’s internal agonizing over what to do about the upcoming total eclipse, as well as how she butts heads with her teachers, etc. But it never feels like it fully ignites, if you know what I mean? I kept waiting for something more intense to happen. Instead, the book just keeps plodding on towards the next summer.To be clear, I don’t need high stakes! This was a great book to read on my end-of-summer vacation at my neighbour’s cabin on a lake. I don’t mind that we don’t see Clara saving the world or that there isn’t a nefarious plot by shaders or anything else another author might dream up to inject more tension into this story. That isn’t the point. Griffin is going for lower-stake, slow-burn character drama, and I am here for that—I just wish she had developed it differently.Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the characterization. I loved how Clara, despite her understandable dislike of Mr. Burrows and Ms. Suntile, also empathizes with their goals. Rather than turn these two authority figures into one-dimensional antagonists, Griffin makes sure they are relatable humans, just trying to do their best with the resources they have—and that includes Clara. I also enjoyed Clara’s method of communicating with Sang.I do wish the resolution hadn’t been quite so neat and tidy. Don’t get me wrong—I like a happy ending, and I don’t know if it was foreshadowing or just predictability that let me see this one coming. In an echo of my earlier critique, I would have liked to see Clara do a little more of her own sleuthing to figure out the solution she hits upon.One final note of praise: I read this book as my summer was coming to an end, and I am writing this  well into September, with each day colder and darker than the last. This book reminded me that the passing of the seasons is beautiful, something to celebrate rather than to dread. Each season has its time in the sun; each has its purpose. Each will come around again. Ours is to appreciate it while it is here.The Nature of Witches is a smooth, easy read. If you like romance and witchcraft and appreciation for nature, you’ll like this book. While I won’t be giving it any awards any time soon, I am truly glad I gave it my time, and it was a perfect read for the time in which I read it.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

So here I am, partaking in Devil’s Gun, having not read You Sexy Thing first. I don’t know if the first book in this series from Cat Rambo just passed me by or if I passed on it because the title made it sound like not my kind of thing. If it was the latter, that was a mistake, for this series delivers delightful and surprisingly cozy space opera. I’m sure I won’t be alone in comparing this to Becky Chambers’ Wayfarers series (though I have also managed to somehow not read all of those as well). I received an eARC from NetGalley and Tor in exchange for a .Picking up on the events of the book I didn’t read, Devil’s Gun follows the now-legitimized crew of the You Sexy Thing, a sentient bioship. It’s a ragtag crew very much giving Farscape vibes, and I am here for it. They spend this book processing trauma from the first while trying to figure out their next move, which eventually comes down to finding the eponymous MacGuffin in the hopes that it will help them deal with the space pirate who is hunting them all. Oh, and there’s clones and con artists and all manner of discussion of food.I took a chance that it was OK I hadn’t read the first book, and that gamble paid off big. Firstly, Rambo has written the book in such a way that despite definitely not being standalone you can slide into this world and still understand the characters and their current struggles. Secondly, this book provides a synopsis of You Sexy Thing at the start—thank you! I really do wish more series did this; it improved my experience of this book immensely. Thus, while I recommend you read the first book, you don’t need to.The cast is delightfully diverse and varied in how they deal with situations. I think I am (re)learning how much I enjoy space opera involving heterogeneous crews rather than the military SF or adjacent setups of more rigid, hierarchal structures. Niko is captain, sure, but she has far from the last word about You Sexy Thing—and Thing itself has a startling level of “ask for forgiveness” attitude about it. This all makes for a great deal of drama and conflict, though it is often very low stakes. Through a hopping, limited third-person narrator, we get to know some of the characters more than others. Overall, I love how Rambo develops each of them. Atlanta is probably my favourite in that respect. Similarly, I loved following along as Rambo fleshed out the larger universe. They draw easily on established tropes (like an extinct civilization literally called the Forerunners) to create their own unique take on a cosmopolitan, intergalactic society. I especially love how they set up what appears to be a great and dramatic mystery surrounding the Gates, arguably the most important Forerunner tech around, only to provide an anticlimactic solution near the end of the book in what is almost a throwaway line. This firmly establishes Devil’s Gun as “cozy” science fiction. Yes, there are hardships and existential conflict; on the other hand, the conflict is extremely interpersonal.If you’re looking for space battles and military strategy or high-stakes, boots-on-the-ground combat, you won’t get it here. But if you want arguments, people sneaking around behind each other’s backs, a sarcastic sentient spaceship, and more such shenanigans—then, yeah, Devil’s Gun and the previous book in this series are going to be just your thing.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

It has been a while since I’ve read a Benjamin Button–style story. A Second Chance for Yesterday has its protagonist, Nev, hurtling backwards in time. The title is everything: sibling authors writing under the name R.A. Sinn ask us if a person can reform simply by having the chance to do things over, albeit in reverse. Thanks to NetGalley and publisher Solaris for the eARC.Nev Bourne is the lead programmer on a technology that lets people rewind time a few seconds. An accident at work causes her to relive, successively, each previous day of her life. Nev is going backwards in time, yet no one else is aware of this. It’s only through an unlikely team-up with a former college associate that Nev manages to wrest some semblance of control from this chaos and work to fix the glitch—before it can happen to the millions of people who will soon use this tech.This novel works best when you don’t try to peek underneath the hood and question the mechanics behind the time travel. Sinn posits that Nev’s employer has a “quantum mainframe” that can somehow reset the universe a few seconds into the past whenever someone triggers an ocular implant. OK, sure. If you can handwave past that, the story itself is quite enjoyable. They take some time developing the mystery behind Nev’s reverse chronological experience. Once she understands her predicament and enlists Airin (or rather is enlisted by them, convinced by their memory of Nev’s … futurepast?), the story ramps up in intensity.I think what makes this story so interesting is the way that it gradually morphs from “I have to escape this fate for myself” to “I have to protect others and prevent this from happening at all.” Sinn is clearly trying to make Nev out to be a flawed, somewhat selfish person who needs to learn a lesson as she travels backwards through her life. It’s a valuable idea, though I’m not sure it is executed very well.The same can be said for the antagonist (if that is what you want to call him) and the eventual resolution of the glitch. In the eleventh hour, Nev confronts the antagonist. It’s a pretty tense moment, yet the result is anticlimactic. The same goes for the ending itself. Not quite a cliffhanger yet also not quite conclusion, the ending might be Sinn’s attempt to say, “It doesn’t matter what happens to Nev from here on out.” It might be an attempt to ask the reader to imagine Nev’s futurepast. I’m not sure—and that’s the problem.This is a book with a very cool premise and a lot of glimmers of brilliance. But everything from characterization to plot to the final lines feels half-finished. Underwhelming. Far from crisp. A Second Chance for Yesterday has great ideas, but it never comes together to become a truly entertaining or enlightening read.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

As far as how this works as a novel: it’s a bit inside baseball, but otherwise it is a very fun and frustrating read.June Hayward watches her not-particularly-close friend die and then takes her friend’s just completed first-draft manuscript. She polishes it up, submits it under her own name, and ends up publishing her second novel under the more ethnically ambiguous name of Juniper Song. This sprawling epic about the unsung history of Chinese labourers in World War I nets June the praise and recognition she has always craved. But as suspicions and accusations over the true authorship of the novel mount, June finds her own mental health deteriorating. The publishing industry is not a healthy or friendly one in this novel, as it is likely not in real life.While this novel lacks the epic scope or fantastical elements of Babel, there are still so many layers to unpack here. I’m going to do my best, with the caveats that I am white, Canadian, and in no way a part of the publishing industry. Most of what I know about publishing I glean from the tweets of authors, agents, and industry professionals.First let’s talk about the obvious (and perhaps most controversial) layer: the central question of who is allowed to tell a story? This conversation continually arises like a phoenix from its own, smoldering embers. The #OwnVoices label is a part of it but also problematic in the way it can reduce authors to their identities and also even pressure authors to come out. Kuang cuts straight to the heart of the matter by asking us what informs an author’s identity. Is it just heritage? Athena Liu was ethnically Chinese, but she didn’t speak Mandarin and wasn’t particularly connected to the story she was telling about Chinese labourers a century ago. Neither is June—but by the time she is done massaging Athena’s manuscript, she has done just as much, if not more, research than Athena herself. Does that make June the more qualified voice for this story? Do either of them have the right to tell this story, or is it nearly as ghoulish as Athena’s reported behaviour with Korean veterans?If you’re expecting Yellowface to give you an answer, don’t hold your breath. The whole point is that there isn’t an easy answer. Indeed, the “right” answer tends to vacillate depending on the calculus of optimizing publisher profit and reputation. June, for a time at least, manages to ride that curve quite well—until she doesn’t.I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I predict that June Hayward will go down in the history of famous unsympathetic and unreliable narrators, right alongside stinkers like Humbert Humbert. This is the second layer to Yellowface. Indeed, given how much of the book is June talking directly at the reader (often justifying her current flavour of feelings), you need to want to read a book with this kind of protagonist. This is not an action thriller, nor is it a story about personal growth. This is not a novel about redemption or even about receiving comeuppance. This is a novel about justifying one’s selfishness in the name of restoring a shattered American Dream.Kuang brings a darkly incisive flavour of humour to her commentary on racism within publishing. June is constantly spouting racist observations to the reader in a way that confirms she is utterly ignorant of her racism. Her comment, “Candice exists entirely to complain about microaggressions,” and later the way she describes an event attendee who challenges her as “dressed like a right-wing meme of a social justice warrior…. Look, we’re all liberals here. But come on,” made me laugh out loud. June is peak white woman throughout most of this book, and it is wonderful as it is terrifying. See, June knows that what she did with Athena’s manuscript is unethical. She knows enough to lie about it, to hide it, and to feel a modicum of shame. But she also thinks she deserves success, that her personal allocation of success was unfairly reallocated to minority voices, and therefore, her actions are just a levelling of the scale. Kuang perfectly encapsulates the way that internalized white supremacy teaches white people who have experienced hardship to project their dissatisfaction with the system onto racialized people and groups who are themselves also targets of oppression.Look, as a white woman reading this, I definitely felt uncomfortable, and I hope that is the point. June is constantly able to brush away and evade consequences for her bad behaviour—the chapter where she’s teaching at a writer’s retreat is a great example. I keep thinking, “this is it, this is where someone will finally hold her accountable” only for it not to happen in that moment, because of course why would it. It feels unrealistic only because that’s the closure we’re conditioned by stories to expect whereas in the real world that Kuang emulates here such closure seldom occurs. White women get away with a lot.I do wish Yellowface had explored the unreliability angle of June’s narration a bit more. There are tantalizing hints here and there that maybe June isn’t telling us everything the way it actually happened. Nevertheless, Kuang largely leaves it up to the reader to fill in the blanks on that score. I personally think the ending is meant to suggest that June is more adept at controlling the narrative than we might have credited her throughout the novel—it is almost enough to kind of beg a second reading, just to see if knowing the ending makes a difference in how we interpret what came before. Clever, that.Some parts of this book are intensely of-the-moment, and I’m curious to see how well they age as the years pass. I’m thinking, in particular, of the role of social media. Almost all of the negative publicity June receives comes from social media, or from social media posts that amplify a few critical articles. As someone who (still) spends way too much time on Twitter, so much of this was familiar, and everything that happens here felt realistic and awful. But I will be curious to see how we look back on this period. A part of me hopes that we will find a better successor to social media and that this will be one of the least relatable aspects of the book.The final layer I want to discuss is simply the way Kuang addresses the intersection of creative arts and business. Publishing is a mechanism for writers to share their ideas with the world. It’s also a commercial industry. June, like many authors, faces the pressure to keep writing and publishing new material. She also struggles with coming up with ideas—a very common issue that, in and of itself, does not make one a bad writer. June herself is obviously not a victim of racism, but she is a victim of capitalism. The pressures of making a living, not having affordable healthcare, etc.—these are all relatable issues that many Americans (and Canadians) face these days. They don’t excuse June’s behaviour, but they do help us make sense of it. In addition to chronicling racism in the industry and the toxic nature of social media, Kuang reminds us that people seldom become villains on purpose but rather because it feels like the best way out of their bad situation.Yellowface is a solid, entertaining, and thoughtful story. I’m not sure how much interest it will hold for readers who aren’t as into books about books and publishing as I happen to be. Then again, I think a lot of avid readers are interested in those things, so maybe it’s a nonissue. All I can really say is that I’ll keep my eye on whatever Kuang comes out with next. She demonstrates versatility and creativity but, above all, she is always willing to shine a light on the parts of our society we’d rather not critique.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

A Snake Falls to Earth satisfied so many cravings I didn’t know I was having! It’s the perfect blend of humour, compassion, tension, and more. Darcie Little Badger impressed me with Elatsoe, but this novel has truly blown me away. It’s going to be one of my favourites for this year—and this has been a good year of reading for me in general.Nina is a Lipan Apache girl living in Texas, obsessed with stories and in particular translating one told by her great-great-grandmother prior to death. Oli is a cottonmouth living in the Reflecting World, whereto almost all animal people immigrated after the end of the time when humans and spirits shared Earth. Oli’s compassion for a friend eventually motivates him to make the perilous journey to Earth (hence the title of the book), while Nina tries to understand the magic that seems to be connected both to her grandmother and the family’s land. These two will need to help each other as enemies supernatural and mundane threaten to pull apart their respective families.The book alternates between Nina’s third-person chapters and Oli’s first-person chapters. Years occasionally pass between chapters, with Nina nine years old at the beginning and sixteen by the time we reach the climax. Little Badger shows Nina growing up, becoming entranced with storytelling and a TikTok/YouTube-like app called St0ryte11er. Her chapters don’t feel any less intimate for being in third person: you can feel her brashness warring with her common sense. She wants to share her great-great-great-grandmother’s stories yet is also intensely aware of the need for privacy and understands that just because an app says something is marked “private” doesn’t make it truly private or safe. She also cares. A lot. About the planet, about her family, and later, about the visitors she hosts from the Reflecting World.Oli is a beautiful contrasting character. Also very caring and ingenious (though he wouldn’t agree with you), he is so cautious by nature. His coyote friends have to drag him along on minor adventures, but he is most satisfied with basking on his rock and chatting with his toad friend, Ami. For Oli to leave his home—and in particular for a destination as exotic and dangerous Earth—represents a huge change that could only be motivated by the most urgent need.I loved reading each character’s individual story and seeing Little Badger draw their threads closer with each subsequent chapter. It’s a masterful display of craft. Her writing perfectly balances description, exposition, and narration. Her explanation of the Reflecting World is enough to help me understand how it works in her narrative without becoming too overwhelming. Similarly, we learn a lot about Nina’s family and backstory in a short time; even though her mom is largely absent in person, text messages establish the two’s deep, personal relationship.I also love how Little Badger has written a story that is deeply, inextricably grounded in Lipan Apache storytelling and knowledge yet also a part of the present/near future. (Nina’s adolescence is in a Texas even more prone to extreme weather than now, and her AI assistant is a bit more useful than the one in my pocket, so this book might be five minutes into the future.) She reminds me of Eden Robinson, who does much the same in her novels like Son of a Trickster. Too often when we talk about stories by contemporary Indigenous authors, we only hype and praise those which focus on the past, especially on the most traumatic episodes of the colonial past. Those stories have value. Yet vibrant new stories have value too, and that’s what Little Badger gives us here. A Snake Falls to Earth is respectful of Lipan Apache traditions while also propelling and projecting those traditions along a future vector. That’s powerful.Lastly, I didn’t expect to cry at the end. Like, I was enjoying the story and could not put it down—I was very invested in how Nina and Oli would help each other solve their respective problems. But I didn’t realize how emotionally invested I had become until the very end of the book, where I teared up as the two of them said goodbyes. I had spent so much time with them, and through Little Badger’s careful characterization and precise worldbuilding, I felt like I really knew them. I was sad to see the story end yet so relieved by how it was ending.This is a beautiful book. There’s no other way to describe it. From the writing to the structure to the cover art and design by Mia Ohki and Jade Broomfield, respectively, this book is beautiful. I’m so happy I finally picked it up off my shelf to read it this summer.A Snake Falls to Earth is everything a second novel should be, building on the success of Little Badger’s first novel while also showcasing the growth of her storytelling style. I’m excited to see what she brings us next.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Polk is fast becoming one of my favourite fantasy authors (love that they are Canadian to boot, eh). Even Though I Knew the End is everything I want in a novella: fast pace, great worldbuilding, and a protagonist I can get behind without too much exposition.Helena, aka Elena, was once in training to be a “mystic,” one of few women accepted to the very sexist Brotherhood. Then she made a demonic deal, sold her soul. Ten years on, Helena has scraped by as a private investigator, but her deal is coming due. Only one last job can possibly save her soul—giving her more time with the woman she loves—but it will be a dangerous one. Chicago in the 1930s is not a great place to be queer, to be a woman, or indeed, to be hunting a “vampire” serial killer.Probably the best aspect of this book is the effortless genre blending. Polk mixes urban fantasy with crime noir—something many writers attempt yet few truly pull off. This book scratched the itch I’ve had since I left behind The Dresden Files. Helena has a hardboiled exterior with the same down-on-her-luck attitude wielded by a lot of private investigators. The additional layers of magic and mayhem, demons and deals, makes the book more appealing to readers like myself.I also really enjoyed Helena’s doomed love story with Edith. I described this as a “love tragedy” to a friend. It isn’t a romance per se, for it lacks the classic happily-ever-after—I would describe the ending as “happy for now.” Indeed, the ending rather surprised me! Maybe it shouldn’t have, considering the title. I won’t spoil it. But it speaks both to the theme of the power of love as well as the obstinacy of people. Polk also exploits one of the virtues of the novella form, which is that it functions well for standalone stories. With no need to worry about continuation, they can draw Helena’s story to a close. Would I read more set in this universe or with these characters? Yes, though to be honest it wasn’t quite as engrossing as Polk’s secondary fantasy novels like Witchmark.This is a cute (in a dark way), clever (in every way) novella. It’s easy to read in a single afternoon yet packed full of emotions, drama, and mystery. Highly recommend to fans of Polk and urban-fantasy fans in general.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

So much of our modern systems emerged from the paradigm shift that was the Industrial Revolution. Nowadays, of course, you have the tech bros at the opposite end of the spectrum claiming that their innovation is the next paradigm shift, that crypt or “AI” or whatever will prompt a dramatic reorganization of society. Maybe, but I doubt it. In any event, the trick, as it usually is with these things, is to figure out the way forward between those two extremes. Too much change all the time is chaotic and unworkable. But to insist that we can never change up a system, even when we readily admit its flaws, is unethical. In Can this be School?: Fifty years of democracy at ALPHA, Deb O’Rourke chronicles the history of a prominent alternative school in Toronto. ALPHA is an exemplar—for those crying “we have always done it this way,” ALPHA’s half-century of operation belies their implicit claim that alternative schools are new or a fad. O’Rourke believes ALPHA offers lessons learned for any other school boards or communities seeking to rethink mass education. The author and publisher provided me with a  copy.Told roughly chronologically, this book presents eighteen chapters of history, quotations from interviews with former students and parents, and meticulous research that documents not only ALPHA’s genesis but the political and cultural forces at work in Toronto in the sixties and seventies that allowed for that genesis in the first place. This is sourced and structured like a thesis (which it was originally), though it has a more personal and admiring tone than a thesis might have—O’Rourke was a parent and employee of ALPHA for a time and obviously believes in the school’s mission. That being said, she freely catalogs the school’s failures as well as its successes—though it’s worth noting that even the idea of categorizing such things into failure and success is suspect if the framework we are using is the one established by over a century of mass schooling.I come to this book as somewhat of an alternative educator with over ten years (cannot believe I can write that) of teaching experience. Trained here in Canada, I taught in England for the first two years of my career before returning home. Then I was hired at the adult high school. It’s on the opposite end of the age spectrum from ALPHA but otherwise is very similar: part of our school board yet unlike the other high schools, always slightly misunderstood by other stakeholders in the education system. Indeed, the concerted effort not to discuss alternative education in our media and everyday conversation is, when you pause to think about it, rather astounding. If it is mentioned, it is almost always in the context of critical discussions about homeschooling. Every few years you get a “gee, whiz” article about an alternative school like an Africentric one, or a school established by a First Nation—almost always acting as if this is a brand-new phenomenon rather than the latest instance in a long line of resistance. Nobody talks about adult education that is not post-secondary, and few people outside of education talk about alternative schools.In spite of my longstanding involvement in alternative education, it should give you an idea of how vast the province of Ontario is that here in Thunder Bay I had never heard of ALPHA down in Toronto. Thus, I went into this book expecting to be sympathetic to the concept but also skeptical. Given its longevity and the glowing s it receives from former students and parents, why has ALPHA’s success not been replicated more? Why does it persist when other efforts have failed? Or is it too good to be true, and will I have to read between O’Rourke’s lines to discover the sinister conspiracy afoot to mould young minds into radical progressives bent on establishing a new world order? (OK, probably not that last one.)A few running themes emerge over the course of the book: the importance of parental involvement and commitment, the impossibility of being everything to everyone, and the challenges of maintaining true independence and alternative ideals in a system not designed for them.ALPHA’s successes and failures correlated quite a bit with its ability to involve parents in the day-to-day running of the school. O’Rourke chronicles the value found in Meeting, an all-hands affair at the end of each school day attended by parents but coordinated by the students. When ALPHA lost its ability to do full-day kindergarten, it was a blow to Meeting because parents who might otherwise be picking up their youngest ones would have trouble attending. In a school where freedom of activity for students is such a big part of its DNA, having enough volunteers to supervise and assist, when necessary, is huge.This has opened up ALPHA and other alternative schools in its vein to accusations of elitism, something O’Rourke addresses here. It’s true that ALPHA’s model specifically works best for middle-class families whose parents have the flexibility to volunteer in some way. It’s also true that ALPHA had, for a time, difficulty attracting nonwhite students and families. I appreciate O’Rourke’s willingness to engage with these shortcomings and discuss them honestly, for I think it can be damaging to alternative schooling movements—especially progressive ones—to make antiracism an afterthought in their missions. O’Rourke documents how ALPHA has, over the decades, sought to improve its admissions process and otherwise expand. At the same time, she also emphasizes that ALPHA is not the be all end all of alternative schooling.That’s an important point that I often think gets lost in these discussions of reforming or revolutionizing education. The whole point is to get rid of mass education in favour of something that I would argue is more compassionate (holistic is another good, albeit somewhat loaded, term). Different communities are going to have different needs and desires; a single model (especially one predicated on Eurocentric ideals and ideas of intelligence and learning) cannot satisfy all of them.These models prove themselves time and again. Yet the proliferation of alternative schools within the Toronto District School Board at the same time that they tend to fly under the radar of the public’s awareness attests to the disconnect and discomfort that even the board itself has with these models. O’Rourke looks at this through her own memories as a young radical and the writings of her contemporaries, along with documentation from school board meetings, reports, etc. As a younger teacher, I found this recounting invaluable. I grew up during the Mike Harris government of the nineties. As Ford’s government recapitulates, quite literally, the neoliberal “back to basics” model that Harris and Snobelen introduced when I was a child, Can this be School? feels more and more relevant to the here and now. These battles in education are cyclical, each generation fighting the same fight, gaining or giving ground as economic and cultural pressures allow. Consequently, it is vital that we do not forget our history so that we can learn from our successes and avoid repeating the mistakes from the previous cycle.In this sense, Can this be school? succeeds. It is not quite a blueprint nor is it quite an oral history, but it has elements of both. It doesn’t quite offer a structural analysis of what else, outside of education, in our society must change to make alternative schooling more palatable and practical on a larger scale. However, what it does offer is detail and salient analysis of a single alternative school in the context of the larger alternative-schooling movement. ALPHA is not the only way to do alternative school; nevertheless, I would say this book goes on the required reading list for alternative schooling. I found it reassuring—so much of what O’Rourke describes of ALPHA is present, albeit in more adult-friendly forms, in my praxis, so there was a little preening happening as I read this on my deck. I also found it galvanizing. I can’t speak to how a parent or interested party who isn’t a teacher would find it, but for teachers less familiar with alternative education, I think this book is a good place to start. It’s up to date, complete, and careful to acknowledge that this could be school—but the choice is ultimately up to the communities a school will serve.

This is a lesson some of us learn sooner than others—and a few don’t ever have to learn it at all. In this timely novelette, Ai Jiang looks down the uncaring maw of capitalism in the form of the exploitation of workers “competing” with artificial intelligence. I AM AI rides the echoes of cyberpunk decades past into a future that is not far off, in many ways, from our distinctly dystopian present. I received an eARC from the author in exchange for a .The eponymous Ai lives ten minutes into the future (though some exposition in the story might place it about a thousand years hence). Her city exists under the monopolistic thumb of a megacorp, and she ekes out a living posing as an AI writing program. She is also a cyborg. Her enhancements allow her to interface more efficiently with the terminals at the cyber cafe where she fulfills her commissions; she can also power the entire block of housing units where she lives with her aunt. But Ai’s battery is faulty and needs an upgrade that means replacing her entire heart. And money is, as ever, tight.Jiang uses Ai’s battery level as a ticking clock to keep the tension high. This combines with the shorter novella form to create a pressure cooker of a plot. As her battery ticks down closer and closer to zero, Ai rushes—to work, to her mechanic, away from the aunt who is so obsessed with plugging her alarm clock into Ai. Her distress might be manifesting in science fictional ways, yet it will feel familiar to many readers: it is the palpable sensation of slipping further down the slope into abject destitution. Ai is desperate, and desperate people do things they might later regret.Her obsession with dismantling her humanity makes sense when you look at what she is up against. She is posing as an AI and competes against actual AI writing companies because her scripts turn out better (no shit). Nevertheless, she can’t beat the speed of these other companies, and it turns out she can’t compete on price either. These pressures mean Ai must make the age-old choice between quality and alacrity. Capitalism moves hand in hand with enshittification: you can’t get it good, but you can get it fast, and you can get it cheap, so isn’t that better?Despite being a shorter work, I AM AI casts a sprawling network of tendrils back through science fiction and history. Its most obvious antecedents to me are classic cyberpunk, from which a lot of our ideas of dystopian cyborgs originated. Ai would be right at home in Chiba City with Case from Neuromancer. But Jiang’s writing also looks at the history of labour and the precariousness of the working class. Ai’s steps away from humanity, her drumbeat decisions to replace more and more of herself with machinery, are born from good intentions—the road to hell and all that. She needs to earn more money to live, not just for herself, but for her family and friends. This reminds me of the history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, solidifying now in the gig economy and the sprawling human labour forces around the world, of workers leaving their families to put in lengthy days only to send money home so their families could live. In the stories that spiral throughout human history, those in power always find a way to create coercive structures that make the working class feel like they have “no choice” but to do what is most expedient, to take on the labour that will earn them the most money in the last time, even if it is ultimately dehumanizing and destructive.I felt uncomfortable reading this book. I didn’t want to like it, for I was uncomfortable with how comfortable Ai seemed to be with her decisions. I love when science fiction does that! But as I sat with it, read over Jiang’s careful monologues from Ai and read in between the lines of dialogue between her and those close to her, I shifted my perspective. I started to see Ai’s cybernetic nature as a metaphor for what we are doing with digital tech, if not in our own bodies than in the extensions we put in our pockets and increasingly invite into our homes. How many of us answer emails late at night, pick up calls from work after hours, constantly check our phones and say, “Just one more task, just one more thing … well I really need to do this or else it will look bad at my next ….” Whether or not we ever reach the level of integration Ai experiences in this book, the ideology that drives such integration exists here and now. That is the chilling mirror I AM AI holds up to our reality.What we are currently calling artificial intelligence is overhyped, of course. Yet it still poses a threat to creative endeavours, such as writing. Jiang’s clever use of genre and history, along with her powerfully descriptive writing, allows her to pack a lot into this novella. I AM AI is deceptive and multilayered. It might make you feel uncomfortable. It will certainly make you think about the cost of competing, and whether or not maybe the answer is—to borrow from a classic—not to play the game at all.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

It features, among other things, a dynamic duo of an AI and a cyborg as private investigators. I predictably loved it. I thought Emergent Properties, by Aimee Ogden, might give me some of the same flavour—and I was partly right. Thank you to NetGalley and publisher Tor for the eARC.Scorn is one of the earliest sentient AIs and one of few AIs emancipated from their creators. Scorn’s creators are a couple of scientists ze calls Mum and Maman; once a powerhouse team, they have since divorced and fallen into a cycle of very public acrimony. Scorn has tried to stay out of it, ducking zir purpose as a space-exploration AI to become an investigator instead. When the story starts, a backup of Scorn has just been restored—missing the last ten days of memories! Ze must retrace zir steps, and fast, not only to get to the bottom of the mystery but also figure out who might have had it out for zir—and why.Lots of stuff to recommend this book to lovers of science fiction. First, it doesn’t overstay its welcome. The plot is brisk. Despite that, Ogden does a lot of worldbuilding. Scorn explains the basics of this world, which is cyberpunk dusted with a bit of failed singularity: corporations have replaced failed nation-states, and AI exists, but most of it is not particularly powerful. Scorn is an exception, a fact that definitely makes zir lonely. We also meet a few other examples of AIs of various levels of complexity, including a “sibling” of Scorn’s.The actual mystery and its resolution is predictable, in my opinion. The culprit was (to me) fairly obvious, the climax pretty clearly telegraphed early on. Since this is a novella I will cut it a bit more slack, simply because it is meant to be shorter and shallower than a full novel. If execution over originality is your desire (and mystery, like romance, often encourages that desire), then this book will work fine for you.Indeed, Ogden has prioritized a fun and sympathetic protagonist over the mystery. And that’s fine. Scorn is cool. Ze is an exhausted, hardworking, somewhat sarcastic AI. I liked how Ogden clearly took time to consider how to write an AI in first person. At a few points, Scorn mentions things like locking zir sarcasm subroutines behind a time-delay lock, so ze will be less sarcastic for a certain period of time. Ogden acknowledges how the vast differences between Scorn’s experience and those of a vanilla human—both in terms of embodiment but also how we process stimuli—would make Scorn think and act differently.Emergent Properties is a great science-fiction novella that’s pretty much what it says on the tin.

I didn’t need those tears on the inside of my body. Oh wow. Cool. Your novels always sneak up on me, both in the sense that I often don’t hear about them until they’re just being published, and also in the sense that the first half or so of the story often undersells itself until it builds to a final, incredible crescendo. Where the Light Goes continues this trend in a big way. I didn’t think I would give this book five stars—unlike Fierce Fragile Hearts, which I identified with very closely, Where the Light Goes is about losing a sister to suicide—fortunately, I haven’t endured any loss like that. I was expecting to find this book beautiful from a distance. But no, you just had to tiptoe around all my emotional defences and tap me on the shoulder, then when I turned around to look you tapped me on the other shoulder, and finally you whispered, “Got you,” before delivering that exquisitely heartbreaking final sequence.Emmy Beckwith is sixteen years old. Her older sister, Beth, is known to the rest of the world as Lizzie Beck, one quarter of a surprisingly successful girl pop group, The Jinks. After Beth dies by suicide, Emmy of course is left with unanswered questions, grief, and the heavy hypocrisy of media and people in Beth’s life who knew her more as Lizzie. The book counts the number of days since Beth’s death. Emmy and her immediate family grapple with what it means to lose a daughter but also to lose the person who provided the family’s connection to fame and fortune.I wasn’t prepared for the staccato style of writing Barnard employs here—but I kind of loved it? And I say this as someone who is generally rather harsh when writers deviate from the conventional chapter-and-paragraph form of the modern novel; the further I get out of my heady days of university literature, the more I just crave that conventional storytelling. However, in this case, I think the choice works very well in capturing Emmy’s volatile emotions and memories. The same goes for interspersing news report excerpts, transcripts from interviews, WhatsApp conversations, etc. Where the Light Goes feels like an attempt at adapting and pushing the novel form in a direction that might appeal more and more to the youngest generation of young adult readers. In the past I have been skeptical of authors including these kinds of devices because they can feel gimmicky. Here, however, it just works.The style also feels very appropriate given the chunking that often accompanies grief. I have the privilege of never having lost anyone as close to me as Emmy was to her sister. So I took my time sitting with what Emmy felt and how she acted. Writing grief, portraying it deeply without shading into melodrama, is a tall order. Barnard really captures how emotions can turn on a dime. How you can be rude to friends and family, do things you might regret, before turning around and needing someone a minute later. Add on top of this the hormones and stress of being a sixteen-year-old girl, of having a famous sister … well, it’s a lot.I have often been in the role of Grey and Emmy’s other friends. Between reading this book and writing this , my ride-or-die’s father died. She’s far away from me, so there isn’t much I can do. I sent her a short text, much like Grey does to Emmy, knowing that she didn’t need one more person blowing up her phone right now. Sometimes the hardest thing to do as a friend is to wait.Lurking beneath these character studies in grief is the even more insidious theme of how celebrity twists relationships. Obviously we see this in how media outlets capitalize on Beth’s death for content in the same way they used her while she was alive. However, the more fascinating example to me is between Emmy and her dad. As The Jinks’ manager, Emmy’s dad must process Beth’s death in two ways. He has lost his daughter, yes. But with the fate of the band uncertain, he is also facing losing his job. The way that this creates some intra-family strife is very fascinating. I love how Barnard manages to portray all three of the Beckwiths with such grace and roundness. None of them are bad people. Emmy’s mum is upset with Malcolm at times, but she also understands why he acts the way he does. Vice versa for Emmy talking with her mum, or with her dad. Again, it’s the way that Barnard navigates through this turmoil without tipping over into melodrama that truly impresses me.And that ending. Yeah, that’s how this book needed to end. I cried. The transcript especially, the way that Barnard privileges us with the glimpse forward so we can see how Emmy continues to deal with this event … it’s great.Where the Light Goes deals with extremely heavy themes around suicide, drug use, and fame. It is an intense book. But it is also a Sara Barnard book—I don’t think she has a gear other than “intense,” nor do I want one from her. If Courtney Summers is the Queen of YA Devastation, Sara Barnard is the Duchess of YA Anguish. She tells stories that always land on the sadder side of real in a way that remind us that sadness isn’t something we can run from, only through.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

In addition to the indignity of merely having one, the way it constantly needs maintenance and has such a limited warranty, bodies are one of the primary ways we interact with our world. And our world is racist. It’s Always Been Ours: Rewriting the Story of Black Women’s Bodies is Jessica Wilson’s attempt to sort through how anti-Black racism permeates diet culture and eating-disorder treatment when it comes to Black women. I found it super insightful and easy to read; Wilson is making a valuable contribution to what should be a much larger conversation. I received a copy of this book for free in exchange for a .First, my positionality in the conversation on body image, body liberation, and most importantly, race and racism. I’m a white woman, and I am tall and thin. I have the economic purchasing power to ensure I can buy the Healthy foods and products we’re supposed to buy, and I have the privilege of looking such that when I choose to buy junk food, people don’t roll their eyes or mutter under their breath as I do so. My upbringing, education, and access to opportunities and healthcare—none of these things have been adversely impacted by racism; if anything, I am the beneficiary of white supremacy in our society. My identity as a transgender woman complicates this story of privilege. As Wilson herself notes in this book, queer bodies also get policed. I have a complicated relationship with my body and how I am read (or not read) as conforming to feminine beauty standards. But mine is a white queer body, not a Black queer body; I don’t intend to equate my struggles with body image to the struggles faced by Black women and people of marginalized gender experiences.As I hope I made clear in my introduction, I loved this book. However, I’m also not the best qualified to critique it—Wilson explicitly states in her introduction that this book is intended for Black women. So I just want to foreground the voices of some Black ers: Christina, Sarah, and Nariah on Goodreads. As I discuss my impressions of this book, keep in mind that my opinion and perspective aren’t as attuned to what Wilson is trying to accomplish as those of her target audience.When I started reading It’s Always Been Ours, I was expecting a book that discussed medical anti-Black racism and threw lots of facts about Black women’s bodies at me. I thought we would get a lot of history of anti-fatness and wellness culture. Indeed, these elements run through the book. However, Wilson more explicitly and emphatically grounds her narrative in discussions of white supremacy and the need to dismantle it. In other words, this book is actually very aligned with a lot of the antiracist reading I’ve been doing, a perfect addition to that shelf, if you will.Wilson is critical of any analysis of eating disorders and diet culture that acknowledges racism’s role in these issues as only one of many factors. She observes,When we relegate racism to “the roots” of diet culture, we send the message that, sure, racism may have played a role in the development of the quest to shrink our bodies, but if we are able to dismantle diet culture, then racism will, by proxy, be destroyed as well. That’s not it. Diet culture is not the driving force behind the ways our bodies are under surveillance by society.This hit me because I am absolutely guilty of minimizing racism in this way. Look, language is complicated. The terms we use to describe the struggle are always evolving. Sometimes—especially, I think, those of us who are more verbose—we trip ourselves up in our desire to be as expansive in our terms as we can be. When that happens, we actually end up erasing important differences (a good example of this is the tendency to lump together very disparate experiences under the umbrella label of “BIPOC”). So I appreciated Wilson’s adamant stance that we treat racism as baked in to diet culture. In other words, there should be no conversation about Black women’s bodies that does not explicitly centre the role of white supremacy in creating the standards for those bodies.This thesis might seem obvious. Yet Wilson shares many stories from her experience as an eating-disorder specialist that belies this. Most of her patients come to her seeking quick fixes, reassurance, granular plans to adjust their eating habits to help them feel better about their bodies. They resist doing the work she asks them to do to dig deeper. Similarly, her colleagues (particularly her white colleagues) resist her attempt to discuss diet culture and eating disorders in this way. In other words, there is a deep, structural desire to maintain the status quo.Although Wilson’s intimate narrative positions her as the brave rebel and maverick in this scenario, she undercuts self-aggrandizement by sharing examples of her own development along this axis. She critiques her performance in her first two years as a dietitian, recapitulating this at the end of the book by sharing how a longtime client of hers noted that, years ago, her advice would have been dramatically different. In this way, Wilson reminds us that no one comes to antiracism work already knowing all the answers. Doesn’t matter how you are racialized. We all internalize white supremacist ideals as we grow up, and it takes work to unlearn that (that is exactly what getting “woke” meant, after all, before the right decided to appropriate and distort the term). Wilson’s very personal and careful anecdotes of her experiences both as a practitioner and a Black woman are the heart of this book. To others in positions of power (and I count myself as one of these in my role as an educator), she is saying that every day is another opportunity for you to do better. To the Black women reading this book, she concludes on a note of celebrating Black joy. She wants Black women to know that their bodies—whatever their shape or size—are not a problem.On that note, however, I was also happy to read such a deep and incisive critique of the body positivity/fat liberation movements. I have heard a little bit about this here and there, particularly how it intersects with Instagram. Basically, there is a fine line between advocating for a positive view of one’s body, especially when one is fat, versus enforcing a kind of toxic positivity that can backfire. Wilson draws on the experiences of activists in this space. While none of what she has to say in these chapters strikes me as particularly new, it’s all a very useful summary of these issues.Again, I’m a very thin woman. I won’t pretend I don’t have body image issues or a complicated relationship with food. But I can generally find clothes that fit me, and people don’t look askance when I wolf down a cheeseburger. It’s Always Been Ours establishes how, for Black women of any size and shape, food is just another item on the list of mental gymnastics they complete each day. Hair too kinky? Eating too much or too little? Clothing too tight or too loose? When you add anti-Black racism on top of misogyny, you get misogynoir, as Moya Bailey coined, and it’s a hell of a thing.Speaking of new vocabulary, this book introduced me to the term food apartheid. This term complements and builds on the idea of a food desert (which I was already aware of); as Wilson explains, it clarifies that such areas are not naturally occurring but rather deliberately constructed as a result of racism. Neat! (The learning, not the racism.)It’s Always Been Ours is moving, well organized, funny, and helpful. This is a book about racism. Its language is more accessible than that of an academic press book, its stories more personal. But it is a book about how our society polices Black women and what Wilson thinks we should do about it (hint: resist). She challenges us to do better instead of simply going along with the narrative of the status quo because it is easier and lets us stay comfortable in the power we have.

I guess I’ll manage, but I have spoiled myself by waiting a year to read Her Majesty’s Royal Coven, resulting in almost no wait between it and The Shadow Cabinet. Juno Dawson has created an excellent new urban fantasy series. However, I am going to be harder on this book than the first one for precisely that reason: she has set me up to expect great things from her!As always, spoilers for the first book but not for this one.The Shadow Cabinet picks up a few months after the end of the first book. Following the disastrous events that culminated in the execution of Helena Vance, previous High Priestess of HMRC, Niamh Kelly is poised to be crowned the new High Priestess. Except she isn’t Niamh Kelly—she is actually her evil twin sister, Ciara, who has swapped bodies. Ciara tries to conceal, with varying degrees of success, this veritable soap operatic twist while she uses her newfound consciousness and freedom to seek out Dabney Hale, disgraced warlock with delusions of grandeur. Leonie is on the case! Meanwhile, Theo and Holly push the bounds of their magic, Elle worries about how her magical life might impinge on the stability of her mundane one, and there’s something going on with simple, uncomplicated Luke.This book took longer to get going, in my opinion, than the first one. Despite plenty happening, it felt like for several chapters nothing was happening. I honestly was much more invested in the smaller personal arcs of Ciara, Elle, Theo, etc., than I was Leonie’s cross-country hot pursuit of Hale and his evil plan for world domination. Yawn. It’s not a terrible plot as far as Bond-level plots go; nevertheless, Dawson’s ability to write interesting, complicated interpersonal dynamics is what The Shadow Cabinet showcases best. There is no better evidence of this than Ciara.Look, I will level with you: an easy seventy-five percent of my reservations about this book have to do with how salty I am that Ciara replaced Niamh as one of the viewpoint characters. So you can imagine how frustrated I became when Dawson actually made me start liking Ciara or at least empathizing with her? As if she was a real human being with complex motives rather than an evil monster? What is this, 2020? I thought I was done with empathy, but no, apparently I still have a shred of it left over from somewhere. No, I never stopped hoping Niamh would somehow return from the dead to reclaim her body—at the same time, I started hoping that there would be redemption for Ciara. In fact, my prediction was that Ciara would eventually sacrifice herself to save the world (if not also Niamh). I won’t tell you if this prediction came true!The same complex dynamics play out in the relationship between Theo and Holly. Theo’s transness was a key point of both plot and character development in the first book, which culminated in Theo’s literal transmogrification: her body changed into one we would typically associate with a cis woman. This complicates things a hell of a lot, and I want to take a moment to unpack this as a trans woman reading a book written by a trans woman.First, I respect the hell out of Dawson for going this route and engaging with these ideas. My thoughts are messy because this is a messy thing complicated by internalized transphobia and internalized ideas of a gender binary. Theo’s reaction to her new body is given to us in Chapter 9:This body. This amazing new body. It made no sense, but it was incredible.Over the summer, she and Holly had watched The Little Mermaid, and Theo knew just how Ariel felt when she looked down and saw her legs for the first time. Only in this case it was a vulva.Any trans person who uses gender-affirming care to help them feel more aligned with their body will recognize something in these words. Transition is literally a journey of rediscovery. When one has access to the care one desires, it is also a journey of wonder. Waking up each morning and feeling a little bit more like yourself because of how you look in the mirror, how your limbs move, how you smell, etc.—it’s not something to be taken for granted. It is a revelation.Down the page, however, we start to get into the more complicated part of Theo’s experience:She also felt guilt. The day of her first menstruation could have been momentous, and it was in a small way. At the same time, she mostly felt bad for the countless other mundane trans girls who may never truly get all they wished for.(“Mundane” in this sense simply means not a witch.) Dawson gives voice to this again in this chapter, first with Theo musing to herself: “There; that stab of guilt again. She was too trans and not trans enough” and then with Holly, a bit later in the chapter, asking, “Do you still consider yourself transgender?” and Theo answering in the affirmative.Theo’s transformation allows her the ultimate kind of passing privilege, the ultimate way to live “stealth” should she choose. It is very similar to Danny’s in Dreadnought, another great book with a trans character written by a trans woman. Fantasy allows both Dawson and Daniels to pose a hypothetical question about the nature of being transgender: what is it that actually makes one trans? Theo says, “I was born one way, and now … I’m another.” Is that all? A surface reading of this arc might open Dawson to charges of transmedicalism. However, I actually see the opposite here—reaffirming Theo’s understanding of herself as trans reinforces the idea that biology is not destiny and that one’s genitals do not make one a woman. This was a stance Dawson already loudly proclaimed in Her Majesty’s Royal Coven with Theo’s power level pretransmogrification already at witchy levels rather than warlock levels (the magic knows!). Instead, through Theo Dawson offers us one reading of a transition story—it won’t be every trans woman’s story, but it aligns with some women’s visions of themselves. Theo is still trans because she identifies that way—however, she also acknowledges that she has privileges many trans women don’t, and this affects how society relates to her along the axis of gender identity.All of this is to say that I really like how Dawson explores these ideas. Theo figures much less prominently in this book than the previous one, something that disappointed me. However, what Theo we get in this story is very good. I admire Dawson for tackling big questions around what it means to be transgender, how we decide these things for ourselves, and how society polices these ideas.As far as the other viewpoint characters go—honestly, there are just too many. Leonie and Elle again from the first book, but then Dawson tosses in Luke and even a few Chinara chapters? I can’t. Let’s do a quick Kara Kharacter Review Lightning Round.Leonie: love her arc of realizing she needs to stop sidelining Chinara. Love the open relationship stuff and her need to find her brother. Again, I think she suffers from the dilution caused by so many POV—neither the overall plot with Hale nor Leonie’s journey receive the time and nuance they deserve.Luke: suddenly turned into the fucking Riley (of Buffy) of this series. Do not like. I don’t see him redeeming himself in my eyes any time soon. Indeed, his role in the climax reminded me too much of Xander at the end of Season 6. (More thoughts on that in a few months on Prophecy Girls.)Chinara: Barely a POV character, clearly a badass, would read a whole book about her but her inclusion here feels extraneous.Would have appreciated more Theo, more Holly, even more Elle—honestly Elle is the unsung hero of this story, intentionally so, and I love her for it. Not every witch needs to be glamorous or 100. Elle’s got a heart of gold and must be protected at all costs—even Ciara thinks so!The Shadow Cabinet is a rad sequel. Did I love it in the same way that I loved the first book? No, for the first book was new and shiny. However, there is no second-book syndrome here. This is an action-packed story with wonderful character development, and if parts of the plot are a bit clunky or predictable or the pacing is off … well, I read literally seventeen installments of The Dresden Files, and this is already way better. So there. If you like witchy stuff and all the juicy drama from the early-2000s TV shows Dawson clearly grew up on, this series is for you.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Barnaby Rudge was the most recent volume I found at my used bookstore, and this summer seemed like a good time—plus, I wanted to slow down my reading for a week, and this certainly did the trick. What I wasn’t expecting was such an interesting example of Dickens experimenting with his style and indeed the form of the novel itself. Barnaby Rudge is a delightful example of nineteenth-century historical fiction.The eponymous character does not actually loom large in the story. According to the introduction of my edition, Dickens originally intended to name the book after Gabriel Varden, the locksmith. The first part of the novel takes place several years prior to the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots before jumping forward in time to tell the story of the riots through the lens of the characters Dickens has established. In addition to Varden and Barnaby, you have Varden’s wife and daughter; John Willet, an innkeeper, and his son, Joe; Barnaby’s mother; Lord Gordon himself; Simon Tappertit, Varden’s apprentice; and Hugh, a ne’er-do-well who throws his lot in with Gordon’s crew because, hey, why not?This novel sees Dickens merge his slice-of-life social commentary with an attempt at retelling historical events and reinterpreting them for his contemporary audience. The “riots of eighty,” as he calls them, were sixty years past when he is writing. It’s so fascinating to read historical fiction written at quite a remove in history from the present day; Dickens himself needed to do research and read both contemporary and historical accounts of the riots to better understand them. As a result, I suspect Barnaby Rudge might be one of the more difficult Dickens novels for a modern reader to follow, simply because of how much it immerses itself in a time even more removed from the modern reader.The actual story is fine but never quite approaches the depth of tragedy or comedy that Dickens is best known for in his other works. Barnaby himself is a sympathetic figure. He has a developmental disability, and Dickens portrays Barnaby as existing in a state of atemporal, child-like wonder and contentment—even when he is about to be hanged for allowing himself to be swept up in the rioting. But some of the other characters, like Joe Willet or even Simon Tappertit, are just a bit too much of a caricature for my tastes.The novel is at its best when it is slowly building the scene towards a short-term confrontation. As the story wears on and the riots reach their peak, there’s actually a good deal of tension—this is especially evident in the imprisonment of Dolly Varden and Emma Haredale. Alas, the Dickensian resolution is rushed, with a trite marriage and a lot of reveals that are not as shocking as perhaps they should be.These issues aside, however, Dickens’s trademark enthusiasm for storytelling is on full display here. It’s hard to deny, or indeed fail to delight in, the cast of characters he has created. The dynamic between the Willet father and son, mirrored by that of the Chester father and son, is interesting, as is the nascent but largely unexplored friendship between Dolly and Emma (oh would a woman had written this book and chosen instead to focus on these two, what a story that might have been). There is much about this novel that can be fulfilling, yet you have to deliberately look for it.Additionally, as I mentioned at the start of my , I really enjoy the historical nature of the story. It’s neat to see Dickens interpret the riots from his position and draw connections to what’s happening in the 1830s, especially around labour movements. Dickens clearly wants to tell a story about the dangers of dispossession and discontent, but because he has chosen to bind himself to a historical framework, he ends up projecting his ideas onto a series of actual events in a way that doesn’t quite work—but it is fascinating to see how things don’t quite line up. Tappertit, for example, could be such a sympathetic character given how he feels hard done by his employer. Yet he very quickly subsumes his pro-labour beliefs into the larger, more nebulous anti-Catholic sentiments as stoked by Gordon and Gashford.Overall, Barnaby Rudge is not the first work one thinks of when Dickens comes to mind, and I can see why. At the same time, I think this might be one of his more enjoyable works (at least of those that I have read so far), certainly one with a very congenial ending for most of the sympathetic characters.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

The Third DauProphecies are tricksy, especially when the prophecies are being manipulated by the humans who run a church for their own temporal ends. The Third Daughter explores what happens when various parties try to shift prophecy in their favour. From a slighted onetime heir to the throne to a power-hungry church official to just a girl from Harborside, everyone wants to have a say in how (or even if) the New Maiden will rule over Velle. Adrienne Tooley’s novel is a delicious mixture of mistakes and missteps, intrigue and indignation. I received an eARC from NetGalley and publisher Little, Brown.Elodie is the eldest of three daughters of the recently deceased Queen of Velle. She should have inherited the throne save for a prophecy that the third daughter of a third daughter would be the reincarnation of Velle’s famous New Maiden. Elodie’s younger sister, Brianne, fits this description, and so the people of Velle crown Brianne instead. Though Elodie claims she has no desire for power for power’s sake, she believes she would be a better ruler—and more importantly, she doesn’t think thirteen-year-old Brianne is a match for the machinations of her new regent, the Chaplain of the Church of the New Maiden. Elodie obtains what she thinks is a sleeping potion from a poor girl in Harborside, but it is actually a magical elixir that plays right into the Chaplain’s hands. Desperate to save her country and retain her freedom, Elodie finds herself working with this girl—Sabine—to right the situation before everything spirals out of control.Tooley sets up complex character dynamics, particularly between privileged Elodie and poor Sabine. Elodie is made out to be an unsympathetic character; Sabine the opposite. Their attraction to each other is also obvious—I really like this queernormative world where they don’t even feel a need to label stuff. Elodie is just very clearly into girls! The romance is an important part of the plot, yet this is not a romance story, and I also appreciate that distinction.The differing motives and needs of Elodie and Sabine create layers of conflict atop the main one. Despite their mutual attraction, they don’t really want the same thing. Elodie wants to be queen without killing her sister. Sabine wants to rescue her sister from a terrible fate but needs money to do it. Both are motivated by sibling love, which is just as valid as romantic love.I wish we had learned more about the Chaplain, his backstory, and the motivations of the Church. Every time the Chaplain shows up, he is such a sneering, supercilious, one-dimensional character. And it remains unclear to me why the Church, at least as Elodie saw it, was courting countries outside of Velle at the expense of Velle’s own citizens. I’m happy for organized religion to be the bad guy, especially when it’s a commentary on how many such religions are misogynist and eager to replace female saviours with male ones. Nevertheless, I would have liked to see more of the Church’s machinations.I also found the overall plot rather predictable. This is not a charge I make lightly, for I understand the value of foreshadowing leading a reader to deduce information before it’s revealed to characters. That’s not what was happening here, in my opinion—Tooley telegraphs certain twists in such an obvious way that I was not at all invested in their eventual reveals. The Third Daughter hence lacks much in the way of suspense, though it still retains plenty of mystery.Whether or not you decide to read the sequel (apparently this is a duology) will likely hinge on how invested you feel in that mystery. I, for one, enjoyed the book enough that I might read the sequel; however, I’m not champing at the bit for it.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Charmed combines a revenge plot with another one of my favourite tropes—a fairy-tale remix setting. Jade Linwood takes elements of some of the most familiar fairy tales of the Western canon, turning their protagonists into women who are out to avenge themselves, and in some cases their countries, against none other than Prince Charming. I received an eARC from NetGalley and publisher Rebellion.Like many fairy tales, Charmed contains stories within stories. The book opens with Prince Charming arriving to rescue Sleeping Beauty (Bella in this version). After he absconds with some of the palace wealth, the book jumps ahead to Bella meeting Marie Blanche de Neige (Snow White) and Doctor Emilia Rapunzel. These two each tell their tale in turn, and having discovered that the rogue in each tale is the same man, they make a revenge pact. The last act of the book comprises the actual plot unfolding, involving a deal with a dragon, another fairy tale protagonist, and more.I love how Linwood has reimagined each of these protagonists. This feminist revisionism has itself almost become a trope of remixing fairy tales. Linwood takes it one step further, however, essentially syncretizing these tales into their own, imaginary European theatre. Each comes from a region clearly reminiscent of a specific part of Europe, such as Italy or France or Germany, albeit with the addition of creatures like dwarves, dragons, and demons. The three women at the centre of this story are each their own person, with different motivations, dreams, and goals. In particular, Bella proves very difficult for the other two to deal with (perhaps because her century of sleep has suspended her growth into adulthood)—however, I think Linwood makes it evident that Bella’s perspective is just as valid as Marie or Emilia’s.The pacing of Charmed frustrated me a little, especially at first. I felt like it was taking too long to go from backstory to revenge story. I’m not sure if there is a solution for this (other than making each story-within-the-story shorter, but perhaps that would lose some of the rich character development). Similarly, I’m glad Linwood did her best to give Charming himself sympathetic motives. At the same time, the way in which that exposition is finally delivered to us was clunky.Finally, our protagonists themselves don’t seem to grow or change all that much. We see a little bit of it in their backstories (any of which could make an interesting novel in its own right), and then the ending hints at growth that can happen now that they are each able to move on. But for the duration of the book itself, they don’t really develop as characters, which is frustrating.Ultimately, Charmed is a charming book (yes, I went there), but like so many remixes, it felt like it was missing something. I don’t know if my bar is just too high or if I have unrealistic expectations. In any event, this is a book that has a great premise that is faithfully and competently executed—I had fun reading it over the course of an afternoon on my deck—but I’m not sure it is memorable.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Now we conclude this trilogy with Long Hot Summoning. Tanya HAlmost a exactly a year ago, I read the first and second books in The Keeper Chronicles. Now we conclude this trilogy with Long Hot Summoning. Tanya Huff increases the role of Claire’s younger sister, Diana, giving her a Summoning of her own and more responsibility for saving the world. It’s a fresh and fun adventure with much of the charm but also most of the flaws of the first two books. Also, the cover art is very DAW and very early 2000s and quite honestly I love it.Diana has graduated high school, which officially means she is an active Keeper. She couldn’t be more thrilled. Her first Summoning comes as she walks out of high school on her last day, and it takes her to familiar territory: Kingston. Normally Claire’s domain, this Summoning requires the most powerful Keeper—and as the second child, that’s Diana. Along with Claire and their respective cats (Sam, a former angel; and Austin, a curmudgeon of a cat if ever there was one), they need to stop an evil shopping mall from manifesting in this dimension.I enjoyed this much more than Second Summoning. I’m not sure if I just prefer Diana’s perspective to Claire’s or if the new main character just made things more interesting. This book is also less frenetic in setting than Second Summoning was: most of it takes place in the mall (albeit a distorted, Otherside version thereof), with secondary scenes back at Claire’s bed and breakfast. There’s also less snarky Hell banter, which I think helps as well.I still struggled with the constant low-level horniness of all the characters. On the one hand, I don’t want to pan the book too much for this because, hey, normalize female protagonists being horny on main (including Diana, who is very obviously queer in this book, yay!). On the other hand, as a sex-averse aro/ace gal, the background horniness does little for me and is, if anything, a distraction.As with the previous books, the way that Hell manifests as a general nefarious force that slowly aggregates its sentience into a single being is an interesting concept on paper but a less interesting concept … well, on paper. The book lacks a strong antagonist, and while we are constantly told that the stakes are high and the Otherside winning would be Bad, it never really seems to manifest. At the same time, the mummy subplot involving Dean, while fun, also feels very trite and predictable.I am working my around to this opinion of Tanya Huff as an author: I really like her sense of humour and her writing, but I don’t know that I actually love her books all that much? Like I heartily recommend her to other people but I can’t call her one of my personal faves—and I guess that’s all right.Not as good as the Gale Women series in terms of story, stakes, or characterization. But still a fun, undemanding read for a weekend on the deck.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

For various reasons, more immigrants have been arriving here in recent years from a wider array of countries. This includes many Muslim immigrants, as well as people from MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) countries. Not only do these newcomers often face challenges with language, but my city can be a racist place. So I was intrigued by Broken: The Failed Promise of Muslim Inclusion because I hoped that I could learn more about the systemic anti-Muslim racism in our society. As is often the case, this book primarily talks about the United States yet the lessons are applicable to Canada as well. Evelyn Alsultany speaks from a potent combination of lived experience and scholarly knowledge.I received this book for free in exchange for a .This is an exquisitely organized book. The introduction and epilogue are excellent end caps, wherein Alsultany lays out her thesis about how Muslim inclusion primarily works through a kind of neoliberal crisis diversity. Each of the five main chapters explores how this crisis diversity (dys)functions. Chapter 1 discusses stereotypes in entertainment; Chapter 2 is about the limits of increasing representation in industries like Hollywood or even politics. Chapter 3 introduces the idea of racial gaslighting, i.e., that how authorities and media downplay crimes against Muslim people (and other marginalized people) when classifying them as hate crimes is, Alsultany argues, important. Chapter 4 looks at examples of what we often call cancel culture: the purging of prominent individuals after they do or say something so racist that their sponsoring organizations have no choice but to distance themselves. Finally, Chapter 5 looks at the issues with diversity and inclusion on college campuses and similar places.Throughout, Alsultany establishes a firm line when it comes to not letting institutions off the hook. At the same time, I really appreciated her ability to empathize with people’s ignorance and prejudice. I am definitely biased, but I think she portrays other perspectives fairly and with nuance. This is particularly true whenever she discusses anti-Palestinian discrimination: she is unapologetic in her analysis of Israel as an apartheid state and condemnation of how Zionist groups weaponize and distort the definition of antisemitism; however, she also recognizes that Muslims and Jews both face a lot of discrimination. Indeed, a great deal of her discussion in Chapter 5 relates to how systems try to divide and conquer, pitting different minority groups against one another.I really appreciated the wealth of examples and analysis that Alsultany brings to each chapter. She looks at specific TV shows, such as All-American Muslim and Shahs of Sunset. She engages with specific scholarship, citing her own contributions to research (like the Obeidi-Alsultany Test) as well as those of scholars whose names I recognized and many I did not. This book is a great entry point into the wider literature around anti-Muslim racism (Alsultany explains in her introduction why she prefers this term to the more common Islamophobia, a distinction I found very interesting!).The nuance I mentioned earlier is also present in how Alsultany discusses improvements we have seen so far. Notably, her analysis of Shahs of Sunset points out that while the show is far from perfect, there are aspects of it that improve the portrayal of Muslims on screen. But she is adamant that there is no “quick fix” for diversity on or off the screen. I think this is an important takeaway—so often people are looking for the easiest, fastest solutions, but the problem here is neoliberalism and a deeply baked-in white supremacy that will take more than bandaid solutions to fix.Broken is a very considered and detailed exploration of an important topic of our day. If we are going to make our society a better place for everyone, we need to make it a better place for Muslims. I appreciated the solidarity Alsultany shows to trans people here, and I hope other non-Muslim trans people will return that solidarity—we are all in this together. Allow this book to arm you with the knowledge you need, regardless of your background or privilege, to change the systems that have failed for so long to include Muslim people in authentic and compassionate ways.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Too often novels think they need to be cleverer by half and jam entire sentences into their titleFirst, some praise for the simplicity of this title. Too often novels think they need to be cleverer by half and jam entire sentences into their titles or create cute, quirky subtitles in emulation of the eighteenth century. Thrust is as prosaic a title as its contents are poetical. Lidia Yuknavitch says in the acknowledgements that she wanted to play with the novel as a form, and that is evident throughout. Now, I like me a straightforward novel, so in that sense the artistic and literary boundaries that Thrust probes didn’t work well for me personally. At the same time, I can recognize good literature when I see it.Laisvė is a teenager living in The Brook, a post-apocalyptic part of New York City sinking into the rising sea. Her father works on repairing the partially submerged Statue of Liberty. Meanwhile, she is a carrier—she has a rare ability to bring objects (and even people) through time via waterways. Laisvė visits people out of order across American history, some of them connected to each other throughout their lives, bringing them objects like pennies and rope. Along the way, Yuknavitch tells us stories within stories: of birth and death, childhood and senescence, of loss and finding. The architect of the Statue of Liberty corresponds with a one-legged woman in the States who oversees not so much a brothel as a kink parlour. A young man runs from a violent past towards a baby girl he found and then gave up. Oh, and there are turtles and whales.There is also a lot of sex and sexual imagery. I’m asexual and sex-averse—I don’t mind reading the occasional sex scene, if it is well written. Honestly the stuff here is pretty tame, just a little florid (on purpose), but for people who are more sex-repulsed or just don’t enjoy explicit writing, you won’t like it.This book was lent to me by the same neighbour who lent me Signs Preceding the End of the World. She, in turn, borrowed it from a coworker. I commented to my neighbour that she “likes weird books” and observed the similarities between these two titles—both involve a young female protagonist who undergoes a journey through space/time that is itself a metaphor for death and rebirth. Laisvė ability also reminded me of The Water Dancer, by Ta-Nehisi Coates. But the closest comp I can make is actually a TV series: The OA produced by Netflix, has extremely similar vibes to Thrust.These connections don’t surprise me. Yuknavitch is undoubtedly trying to decolonize the novel here (as much as a white woman can decolonize anything). Laisvė’s heritage is Sakha (Yakut); there are Kanienʼkehá꞉ka (Mohawk) characters as well, and several times the languages and democracy of the Haudenosaunee is referenced. Laisvė’s journeys into the water have her talking to animals such as turtles, whales, and worms, all lamenting what the colonial parts of human civilization have wrought. The ongoing epistolary plot between Frédéric and Aurora and the hulking presence of the Statue of Liberty throughout problematize coloniality and the idea of the triumph of modernity. Aurora’s ending, in particular, and the gift she returns to Frédéric, seems to symbolize a rejection of a mechanistic, transhumanist philosophy in favour of one rooted in harmony and nature. Now, I have complicated feelings about all of this, but we will get there.Let’s talk a little more about form and style first. Ever since I finished university, I’ve tried my best to hang up the hat that was my pretensions about literature and, as they say, slum it. After all, my first love has and always will be epic fantasy, including the works of David Eddings, who was fairly vocal about how he was just slapping plots together (with a lot of initially unacknowledged assistance from his wife, Leigh) using formulas. The same goes for my other first love, mysteries in the style of Agatha Christie. So as much as my minor in English and love of Regency and Victorian novelists might have you envisioning a classy lady in a monocle and top hat sipping tea while she writes s (well, the tea part is at least correct), really I just like a good yarn.So I guess Yuknavitch has triggered this tension within me between the recovering English lit student and the exhausted teacher who just wants to escape into a straightforward story. I would love to just throw this novel across the room (metaphorically, of course, since this book is borrowed), cross my arms, and slide down against the wall while muttering, “literary fiction, ugh.” Alas, that is an oversimplification of my feelings about Thrust and perhaps literary fiction altogether.It’s cool that in 2022 novelists continue to experiment with the form. Literature, like all art, must continue to evolve as our societies evolve. Poetry often gets the most attention when it comes to being avant garde; I think this is a mistake. I love prose, and the novel in particular, precisely because its apparent structure belies an inherent chameleon-like nature. Novels are empty vessels into which authors pour and then sieve their consciousness.So with all of that in mind, I respect what Yuknavitch is doing with Thrust. It’s not a book that I would necessarily have picked up all on my own—but that is why it’s good to have friends whose literary appetites overlap but do not perfectly match yours! However, it’s always nice to once in a while stretch the mind and see how authors are playing with form. There’s a lot going on here: epistolary chapters, first person, third person, ethnographies, prose poems, time slips, streams of consciousness … Yuknavitch doesn’t make it easy on the reader. I pity the translators!In that sense, if I were to offer serious critique of Thrust’s form and style, it has to be how it feels overstuffed with experimentation. Yuknavitch has put so much into this short novel, transforming it into a kaleidoscope of storytelling that is not so much dazzling as it is dizzying. I prefer my experimental literature to be far more precise; the messiness on display here makes me recoil.I also found it very challenging to connect with our main characters. Of all of them, Aurora was probably the one who felt most tangible to me with her letters and other perspective chapters. Yuknavitch’s heavy reliance on metaphor and other figurative language left me at a loss when it comes to characters like Aster. This is why, as I mentioned earlier, I’m ambivalent about the endings of so many of these characters. With so much going on, despite the intricate intersections created by Laisvė’s travel and storytelling, the characters’ disparate stories did not always come together for me.On the other hand, I really appreciate how Yuknavitch challenges readers with what a novel’s structure should be. In particular, a lot of what she is doing reminds me of Indigenous concepts of circular storytelling—Lee Maracle explains this exquisitely in her essay “Scent of Burning Cedar”. Again, I temper my praise in this regard given that, ideally, we should be reading Indigenous authors who are doing this. But I think it is important to remark on how Yuknavitch is deliberately tapping into our existential dread of climate change through a structure that questions the colonial aspects of our society while championing storytelling that deviates from the dominant, Eurocentric norms of Western literature.Oh boy. All of that in 1200 words simply to say, Thrust is a calculated and messy story that makes for an ambitious read. One of the blurbs on the back cover of this edition calls it “trenchant,” which is a fantastic word, and I agree. If you like intense, evocative sexuality, circular storytelling, anticolonial rhetoric, and vibrant explorations of violent grief, this book will appeal to you. Just don’t expect it to make a whole lot of sense the first time through.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Kate HeartfThis is one of those books I heard so much buzz about I nearly didn’t read it just to be contrary—and what a mistake that would have been. Kate Heartfield’s fantastical take on the lives of two queens—Marie Antoinette and her sister Maria Carolina, also known as Charlotte—at the end of the Enlightenment is exactly the kind of historical fiction I love. From 1768 to 1793, The Embroidered Book charts the rise and fall of these two monarchs: how they came to their respective countries, the challenges each faced, and how they rose to the occasion.Charlotte and Antoine, as Heartfield styles them herein, are two daughters of Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria, who is anxious to secure alliances across Europe. Charlotte is originally intended to marry the Dauphin of France; however, when one of her older sisters dies from smallpox, she must step into the role of betrothed to the King of Naples, and Antoine is sent to France. Thus are their destinies decided. Yet in Heartfield’s telling, Charlotte and Antoine have a secret: they have a book with an embroidered cover that they accidentally inherited from their late governess. This book contains nigh-indecipherable spells that, with sufficient sacrifices, allow the magisters who wield them to achieve great things. Charlotte and Antoine embark on becoming rare female magisters in a world that frowns upon women and disbelieves in magic. But as they turn to magic to secure their realms and their families’ safety, the rest of Europe begins to crumble.I’m sure this story could have been fascinating had Heartfield hewed closely to historicity and eschewed any semblance of magic. Yet for anyone who might worry that this ahistorical addition might stand out, I want to reassure you that it does not. First, Heartfield devises a clever ending that helps to align the events of this novel with the historical record. Second, the presence of magic only enhances the very real dangers and issues at play in this book.Magic or not, the Habsburg queens were always witches. They were women, you see.That’s really what stands out to me about The Embroidered Book: its skillful portrayal of embattled women, queens under siege not only by armies from other nations but their own courtiers and advisors as well. Both Charlotte and Antoine need to be more than chess pieces and heir-bringers, yet their gender makes that difficult to achieve. And while in reality these queens and their contemporaries might not have had the ability to enchant gloves that make people more amenable to persuasion or talk to each other through portraiture, Europe still had no issue with taking down women—especially powerful women—through allegations of witchcraft. So I like how Heartfield must have essentially approached this with the idea of “you want witches? Fine, let them be witches!”There are two central cores of conflict in The Embroidered Book. First you have the relationship between Charlotte and Antoine. Second, the tension between competing philosophies of magic, which also feeds into the first conflict. Charlotte wants to work within the system, remake the Order of 1326. Antoine feels more comfortable working with the rogue magisters who eschew the Order at all. These sympathies mirror the two queens’ political differences as well, with France aiding the American Revolution against Great Britain while Charlotte pursues intense, autocratic and totalitarian policies to keep Naples under her thumb. As the two sisters’ uses for magic and political needs diverge, their personal relationship deteriorates apace.At the same time, Heartfield explores the usual problems that you might expect in a story about two royal women. The pain and heartache of childbirth and child loss. Falling in love, having affairs. Not being taken seriously at court. Being terribly lonely, only to have one’s friends and allies betray one. At first I found Heartfield’s writing overly intricate and slow-paced, but her style grew on me as I came to fall in love with her characterizations of Antoine and Charlotte. The letters between the two sisters are, in particular, a highlight.If you like historical fiction and can tolerate a drop of magic in the mix, The Embroidered Book is everything the hype makes it out to be and more. Adapt this series now, streaming services, and then never broadcast it and use it as a tax write-off!Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

We need stories about young queer people who are already openly, joyously queer. This is true. However, with Friday I’m in Love Camryn Garrett demonstrates why a coming-out story is still viable and valuable.Mahalia Harris didn’t get a Sweet Sixteen—her mother couldn’t afford it. A year later, she decides to throw herself an alternative: a coming-out party. Her plans are complicated by two factors: first, Mahalia doesn’t have much money herself; second, she is crushing hard on the new girl in school, Siobhan, who also happens to have a boyfriend. Oops. Mahalia puts a plan into motion that, if successful, would see her coming out to family and friends by the end of the summer. But, as usual, life finds a way to get in the way.Ever since I first read Full Disclosure, Garrett has been one of my must-buy authors. I love the layers she gives her stories. On one hand, Friday I’m in Love is a romance. It’s Mahalia crushing on and attempting to woo Siobhan, and it is every but as cute and dorky as it sounds (there are playlists involved!). Yet Mahalia has her flaws—she is a teenager after all—and can hurt those around her, like her best friend, Naomi, or her mom, while focused exclusively on her party. This is as much a story about existing in community as it is about individual drive, passion, or love.Along the same lines, I love that even though this book is about coming out, Mahalia herself is very clear on her sexuality (and Naomi is along on the ride with her). Again, there is still a valuable place for books about protagonists who are questioning and discovering their sexuality. But I love that Mahalia is confident and clear: she likes girls, and right now she likes Siobhan in particular. As I often remark, I’m not the right reader to discuss how good the romance tropes are! Nevertheless, I enjoyed the romance in this book and would actively recommend it to my more romantically inclined friends for their reading lists.Each chapter has a banner at the top that displays any recent transactions and then Mahalia’s bank account balance. This is a very overt reminder of how perilous Mahalia and her mother’s financial situations are: even as money comes in to Mahalia’s account from paydays, it goes out again just as easily. Naomi, her family more privileged, acts as Mahalia’s foil in this regard. Through her, Garrett demonstrates how even just a little more money—and more security of capital—can set someone apart. Naomi works at the grocery store just like Mahalia, but she doesn’t have the same constant existential concerns around finances that Mahalia has. And this tension, latent in their friendship, manifests more strongly both because of issues with Mahalia’s mother and because of Mahalia’s focus on pulling off her party.Garrett puts a lot of emphasis on the value of friendship, which I also appreciate. As Mahalia began brushing off Naomi’s attempts to talk about her issues, I smiled to myself, knowing this would led to conflict—perhaps even a blowout—down the line. I love how Garrett walks the line of creating a protagonist who, while very likeable, also needs to be held accountable by others.This is also evident in Mahalia’s complex relationship with her mom. Like so many families where money is an ever-present anxiety, Mahalia’s mother tries her best to shield her daughter from that anxiety while also instilling a sense of fiscal respect and responsibility. When setbacks, racism, and ableism affect Mahalia’s mom’s income, Mahalia unfortunately has to step up. This puts a strain on their relationship in a way that some readers, including myself, have the privilege of never knowing.I could go on about all the other relationships in this book, particularly Mahalia and her dad. But what it boils down to is this: Garrett has created a story that is very slice-of-life. It’s as colourful as its cover. I love the ending, love the way Garrett balanced romance and reality. It was a perfect read for Pride month, but it is also a perfect read any time.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

When We Lost Our Heads is an invigorating, frustrating, dark, beautiful, terrible tragedy. As much as I loved Lullabies for Little Criminals, I think if I went back and reread the book for a third time I would be more critical of it now—both because I’m older and because O’Neill’s writing has improved since then. When We Lost Our Heads displays a mastery over characterization that O’Neill was only beginning to explore in that debut fifteen years ago.Set in Montreal in the nineteenth century, When We Lost Our Heads follows two very different women: Marie Antoine and Sadie Arnett. One is born into privilege, the heiress to a sugar factory, and wants for nothing. The other belongs to a family whose patriarch is a social climber, owner of an expensive house but without much else to their name. The two girls forge an unlikely friendship until an accident causes their families to tear them apart. Years later, they reunite briefly and catastrophically. As their respective personalities crystallize around the environments in which they grow up, they diverge, reunite, diverge again—bad for each other yet unable to stay away.Your enjoyment of the book will depend on how much you buy into Marie and Sadie and their relationship. I loved every moment of it. O’Neill grapples with the messiness of female friendship and attraction. Sadie is like a little Wednesday Addams, all “I love the darkness; the darkness is me.” Marie, on the other hand, is much more sheltered up until her father’s death. Their attraction to one another might feel like opposites attracting, but what I saw cuts right to the theme of the book: two women constrained by patriarchy (albeit in slightly different ways) drawn to each other like moths to a flame. They are both passionate to a fault, both needing some kind of release that they cannot get from other relationships. You know, from the very beginning, it will be their downfall. But you can’t stop reading.Many of the characters are named quite transparently for people involved in the French Revolution, with their personalities and the events in the book loosely following those people’s politics and experiences. It’s clever and, while not subtle, also doesn’t overpower the narrative. Readers with more than a passing familiarity with the French Revolution will enjoy the reference while those who miss it won’t miss out. (The connection is also ironic given that most of the characters in the book are anglophone.) Yet this reference also highlights how When We Lost Our Heads is about class as much as it is about gender.Sadie and Marie’s love transcends the restrictions on queerness in their time. It also breaks rules about class. Sadie moves effortless across class barriers, meeting Marie on her level while also happily slumming it in a brothel. She is a cipher, and Marie is not the only one to get obsessed with—and feel betrayed by—her. George, another prominent queer figure, falls for Sadie’s confidence and the passion with which she hates Marie when she and George first meet. Genderqueer, nonbinary or transmasc (labels are difficult in this time period), George helps Sadie explore not only queer sex but also radicalizes her politically. If Marie is Sadie’s muse, George is Sadie’s enabler. But like all of Sadie’s relationships, this one sours because George, like Marie, mistook Sadie’s interest for investment.The wake of betrayal Sadie always leaves behind is delicious. She isn’t evil; she isn’t really even the antagonist of this book. She is as much a victim as any of the other women herein. Sadie merely refuses to be cowed by her victimhood—nor, I should point out, is Marie, and their reactions have striking parallels. Sadie turns to art and expression, finds her voice in slanderous speech; Marie seizes control of the one thing she can control—the sugar factory—even if it means aligning herself along class lines.This brings us to the heart of the novel, the twisted and sickening knot that underlies every page. O’Neill looks at loyalty from every angle. What does it mean to be loyal in a relationship, romantic or platonic? To one’s family? To an ideal? To one’s gender, one’s class, one’s peers? It is impossible to preserve all of one’s loyalties equally, and it is the conflict between and the intersection of all these loyalties that is ultimately the downfall of our antiheroines. At first abandoned by each other and then seeking to remain loyal to each other, they each sabotage themselves, sabotage one another.I enjoyed this book so much because it is actually a very simple tragedy. You know how it’s going down from the very first page—but you still can’t put it down. There are predictable twists and turns, elements of plot that feel somewhat clichéd—but in the way that a good melodrama feels that way. O’Neill has written a stage play but given it the depth and descriptive power of a novel, and the result is a trenchant work of Canadian historical fiction that leaves me with all the feels. I am really happy her voice is with us, growing more powerful with every book.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

It’s no secret that many societiesBodies by themselves are weird, but what really takes the cake is how we police our bodies based on societal norms. It’s no secret that many societies, including Canadian society, are fatphobic and love to police women’s bodies. This is a difficult subject to write about and get right—and I’m probably not very qualified to talk about whether or not Diana Clarke gets it right in Thin Girls. All I know is that it got me thinking. Also, I have no memory of where/how I acquired this book—if you were the person who gave it to me, please remind me!Rose Winters, like so many girls, developed an eating disorder as a teenager. Now in her twenties, she is an inpatient in a clinic where the hope is that shes will “get better.” Rose’s twin, Lily, visits her weekly—or she did, until she met a new boyfriend whom Rose believes is abusive and trying to isolate Lily. This motivates Rose to pretend to make enough progress to be released so that she can save her sister. Easier said than done when Rose can’t save herself.As the present-day story progresses, there are flashbacks to Rose and Lily’s childhood. Each flashback lists their age and each sister’s weight before describing an episode in their lives that shaped the twins and started them on their divergent paths.Huge trigger warning, obviously, for depictions of eating disorders/disordered eating, discussion of weights and methods for tricking a scale or hiding foot, etc. This book triggered me, even though I don’t have an eating disorder, in some ways, so if you have or had an eating disorder, please tread very carefully.At the core of this book is the relationship between these two twins. Rose tells the book in the first person and is a textbook unreliable narrator: there is really no way to know how much of what’s happening is true and how much has been filtered or fabricated by Rose. At times, Lily is her saviour; at other times, Rose wants to save Lily. The narrative is one of remarkable codependency punctuated by jealousy.The flashbacks are brutally accurate, in my opinion, in their depiction of how teenage girls internalize unhealthy and unrealistic body image standards and then pressure each other into striving to fit those standards. Rose’s accession into Jem’s mean girls squad only for her to develop an eating disorder after discovering the intoxicating sense of control she feels over denying her body food feels very real. Every step in Rose’s descent is predictable, perhaps even familiar to most readers, yet it is no less tragic as a result.The present-day chapters were harder for me to wrap my head around. Clarke is not a very descriptive writer. Her prose has a detached and clinical quality to it. Her plotting has a similar kind of craft quality—beyond Lily and Rose, I would argue, all of the other characters exist only to fulfill certain needs of plot. I appreciate the diversity of female characters, especially how one in particular starts off being portrayed as evil/nefarious only for Clarke to fill her in with nuance and a bit of redemption. The idea that people can change, or that we can be mistaken about someone, is very powerful. And I think Clarke’s thesis, at the end of the day, is that patriarchy can cause women to harm one another but we still need to come together and ignore or take down the men, and I am here for it.I mentioned above that I found this book triggering even though I don’t have an eating disorder. What I meant was that the book triggered my own body image feelings. As a trans woman, I experience gender dysphoria in ways that overlap with a sense of body dysmorphia. I am fortunate enough that my transition has allowed me to experience quite a bit more gender euphoria than dysphoria, especially nowdays (I will often exclaim to friends how much more I enjoy living in my body, how happy I am with how I see myself in a mirror). But I can’t lie: I think a lot more about my weight now that I am living as a woman than prior to my transition. I think a lot more about how people look at me, my appearance, etc.—and it is hard to parse out what proportion of that is womanhood versus being trans specifically versus general issues with aging, etc. It’s all wrapped up in a little ball of emotions that lives in my stomach.All of this is to say that even though my personal experiences have been quite different from Rose and Lily’s and most white cis women, there is still a lot of emotional content in this book that resonates with me. In that sense, Clarke is very successful in her portrayal of a book about eating disorders.I just with the writing and storytelling had felt more intimate in a more interesting way. Similarly, the ending feels a little bit contrived (or maybe unearned). I think in particular what I object to is how the book raises the spectre of the overall wellness industry but then kind of drops it before there is any satisfactory resolution? And just blames it on the man in the picture?Feels like it could be a Louise O’Neill novel yet lacks the narrative and stylistic flair that makes Louise O’Neill novels shine most.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

On Earth as It Is on Television is a quirky, borderline absurdist take on first contact with aliens from the perspective—at least so it seems at first—of ordinary, everyday people. Emily Jane asks us to consider what would happen if aliens show up one day and then leave as abruptly as they came. How would life go on, and how would we all be different? Unfortunately, I can’t say I am all that different having read this book.The story starts thirty years prior, with a brother and his younger sister driving west to escape her abusive boyfriend and start a new life. Following an accident in a winter storm, we smash cut to the present. From there, Jane follows half a dozen different characters. Alien ships appear mysteriously over the skies of major cities around the world (not just Washington, D.C., thankfully), and then after a few days the ships vanish with no contact or explanation. Each of our viewpoint characters struggle to adjust to the new normal, with some of them discovering that there are actually aliens living among them—closer, even, than they initially thought.This is a quixotic book, and for a while I didn’t know what to make of it. The beginning is like a suspense novel, with each character’s stories developing separately and an implicit promise that they will converge (which, to be fair, they ultimately do). The middle is more like a Vonnegut novel in both style and story. The final act reminds me most of an ’80s children’s movie about aliens, where the danger is undercut by the knowledge that everything will work out in ninety minutes or less.There’s definitely something good to this novel. I like how Jane explores different yet equally valid reactions to alien arrival, the way that some people just shut down, others go into overdrive. While the humour wasn’t always my cup of tea (those kids were just annoying, OK?), I appreciate Jane’s attempt at establishing such a voice.I guess what I’m trying to say, however, is that I don’t think the novel made me feel anything. The plot makes sense (in its own weird way). There are emotional notes for each character that Jane hits. But it’s all very perfunctory, very clinical. The narration is so detached, so much telling rather than showing, that it was hard for me to invest myself in any of the characters. I was curious to know the ending, if you will, but I didn’t care about the ending.On Earth as It Is on Television has its moments, and for a different audience maybe it is in fact uproariously funny.

It’s going to be a summer of witches on this site, for I have many witchy books to read and , starting with this first adult novel from Juno Dawson.Helena, Niamh, Leonie, and Elle grew up together in Yorkshire, bonded by age and the increasingly rare inherited gift of magic. As often happens, their lives have diverged in adulthood: Helena is posh and now the head of the eponymous royally sanctioned coven; Niamh is a veterinarian; Leonie has started an indie coven for racialized witches; Elle is a housewife who has largely given up on being a practising witch. The witches of England are still recovering from a brief but injurious civil war, in which a warlock wanted to expose witchcraft and subjugate mundane humans. Now, Helena believes an even worse fate is nigh: a child with inexplicable levels of power has appeared and might be the harbinger of a demonic apocalypse.Though nearly 500 pages and involving four main viewpoint characters, this book feels very spry. I sense the work of a dedicated editor here helping Dawson hone her story into its best-told form. In particular, I like that while we spend time with each of these four witches, the book truly emphasizes Niamh and Helena. They are the two poles of the story, if you will, between which everyone else oscillates. In many ways they are opposite—Niamh the simple country witch; Helena the witch of power and privilege—but they have in common an obstinacy and deep desire to preserve the peace. Alas, Dawson is very good at showing us how two reasonable people can disagree, and how that disagreement can ultimately lead to division and disaster.Indeed, the lifeblood of this story is the conflict among these four women who grew up together, their shared history of loss—the witch now missing from among their number—their multifaceted identities as women, mothers, professionals, etc. I love how Dawson manages to establish each as a credible character in her own right. They explicitly name and discuss the role of patriarchy in their lives—fans of Holly Bourne’s adult novels are going to feel right at home here, albeit with an extra layer of magic on top. I know Dawson is also a big fan of Sex and the City, and while I am less familiar with that show I can also see some connections with that vibe among the main characters.I don’t really know how to talk about the novel beyond this without diving into spoiler territory because I have to talk about Theo and the main conflict. In general, I don’t consider revealing a character’s gender identity or sexuality to be a spoiler, but the case can be made here that it is, and so I flagged my  as such.I love that there’s no mention of a trans character in the cover copy for the book. I knew, of course, that Dawson is a trans woman, and I went into this book expecting to see a trans character, or a few trans characters, simply as a matter of good diversity. But I try to make it a habit not to expect that trans authors will write books whose plots revolve around transgender themes, because that is of course not all that we are. So I appreciate how it kind of sneaks up on you.Not to brag, but I guessed that Theo is trans pretty quickly—Dawson explains early in the book that witches are just naturally stronger than warlocks when it comes to magic. The explanation proffered at the time is cissexist, speculation about X-linked genetic traits, and actually kind of stuck out coming from a trans author—but I was patient. Sure enough, the moment this boy-child shows up on the scene and all these people are all, “But why is he so much powerful than a girl his age, than all of us women even?” it was evident, at least from my perspective, what twist Dawson was working up to. I say all this because I want to emphasize that I really like how Dawson gets there in the end: the way that Theo confides first in Holly, short-circuiting a straight teenage romance and turning it into sisterhood; the delicacy and love that Niamh shows in handling the situation; the indelicacy and vulnerability of people like Leonie, who admits to grappling with questions of inclusion when she was starting up Diaspora, her coven.After I finished the book, I peeped some s and saw a few people levelling the well-meaning criticism that Helena’s abrupt heel turn, somewhat cartoonish in magnitude, undermines her characterization as a transphobe. But I think that’s entirely Dawson’s intention here. Helena is the misguided cis white woman who thinks that feminism belongs to her, and her increasing caricaturization of herself is an intentional comment on how such white women tell on themselves. At each turn, as Helena encounters resistance to her transphobia from her friends, she doubles down on her rhetoric. She can’t possibly be wrong—everyone else is wrong. Helena feels like a clownish character by the end of the book because transphobic women like her are clownish; they are villains existing atop a house of rhetorical cards that threatens to topple over at the slightest wind of wisdom. The fact that each stage of Helena’s regression is logical and measured only adds to the effect. It is important for us to remember that Dawson wrote this novel in a moment where anti-trans sentiment in the UK, particularly among a certain brand of stalwart second-wave feminists (not to mention a certain author of children’s fiction about witches and wizards), was so legitimized in mainstream media and press that it was (and remains) easy to conceive of someone like Helena not only having power but wielding it in the way that she does. I found Helena’s characterization entirely believable, and any caricature therein to be a deliberate and effective strategy at lampooning transphobia.Now, did I love everything about this part of the plot, the portrayal of Theo’s transition, or the transphobia that she and her allies encounter? Of course not. In particular, I wasn’t a fan of how Helena’s defeat and fall from grace radicalizes Snow into a TERF. Though it makes a small amount of sense, plot-wise, it feels a little bit lazy and melodramatic. I would have liked to see Snow break from her mum, or perhaps have Snow accept and affirm Theo’s identity but still oppose Theo, Niamh, and the others. (This is what I think many of the critics were getting at when they criticized Helena’s portrayal as a transphobic villain—although all transphobes are villainous, not all villains need be transphobes, and it would be nice to see some people who are trans-inclusive but still antagonistic for other reasons. Radley, I suppose, comes close to this.)In the end, Her Majesty’s Royal Coven feels like a very timely work. I am so happy the sequel just came out so I can hopefully read that this summer as well! I enjoyed the world that Dawson created here, the way that she explores what magic is, its connection to the natural world and ourselves, and the institutions that have sprung up around it. I loved the characters, especially the tight-knit bonds between women—I hope in the next book we get to see more from Theo and Holly’s perspectives, even though I know this isn’t a young-adult series. Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes queer works, magic and witchcraft, and just really fun adventures.Also, the hot pink cover? I love it so much.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Normally I wI hadn’t read Firebreak, the novel that this novella is a loose prequel to, before I requested Flight & Anchor from Tachyon on NetGalley. Normally I wouldn’t leap into an established world headfirst like this. However, I had a good feeling about this one. It is a standalone story that doesn’t require knowledge of Firebreak. Nicole Kornher-Stace’s writing is very intimate, very in-your-face, and the result is a slow-burn novella that has me wanting to read Firebreak for sure now.Our protagonists are 06 and 22, cybernetically augmented child soldiers who have just escaped from a Stellaxis facility under control of the Director. She is keeping their escape secret at all costs, for it would be disastrous for her career and this program in general. As 06 and 22 try to survive in an unfamiliar, unkind city, the Director tracks them and observes from afar while trying to conceive of a plan to retrieve them that won’t embarrass her or result in heavy casualties.The story starts slow. The first few chapters are from the point of view of a barista, Cassie, who otherwise doesn’t return. She is our first introduction to 06 and 22, whom she views as children—odd children, yes, creepy children, perhaps, but children. From there the story alternates between chapters that present 06 or 22’s limited third person viewpoints and chapters that follow the Director or even her ally, a semi-sentient nanoparticle probe she tasks with spying on and sabotaging the children. After 06 and 22 settle into a shipping container they use as a makeshift shelter, they plot their next move. With limited funds, and concerned about being identified and apprehended, they aren’t sure where to go next. They’re only twelve, after all.So for the first half of the novella, I honestly was unsure what to make of the story and whether or not I was enjoying it. I got it. I understood what Kornher-Stace was trying to do. But I just didn’t see feel it. This changed in the second half, and by the end I was heavily invested in these characters.The introduction of the probe was the first step towards this change of heart for me. I do love myself a sassy AI, which is essentially what this is. It’s basically the Kronk to the Director’s Yzma, if you know what I mean—an antagonist, technically, but only in the most technical sense. Its shenanigans (for lack of a better term) help propel the plot forward in interesting ways.The codependency of 06 and 22, referenced in the title, is also so crucial to the story and one’s enjoyment of it. In her afterword, Kornher-Stace connects this to Firebreak, saying that this story gave her the chance to provide a tragic backstory to where we find 22 in that novel. Obviously I don’t have all the context for that statement, but I like it. I really liked the climax and resolution of Flight & Anchor. Kornher-Stace wraps everything up neatly, but the little references throughout the story to “years later” are tantalizing hints at how various characters (particularly our amoral Director) will regret their present decisions.All in all, by the time I had finished with Flight & Anchor, I was hooked. An obvious comparison would be to Murderbot Diaries—for the length but also the sympathetic killer protagonists—but there are echoes here of numerous other dystopian and cyberpunk worlds I’ve visited in recent years. At the same time, nothing in this setting felt recycled or clichéd to me. Kornher-Stace’s worldbuilding is careful, simple, sufficient. As I said in my introduction, I’m left wanting to read her novel, which is pretty much mission accomplished.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

That’s rare for a work of nonfiction—not that I have any great hatred of subtitles, but the absence of one here is notable. Anyway. Algorithmic Culture Before the Internet caught my eye because the history of computing, intertwined as it is with the history of mathematics and the history of feminism, interests me a lot. Ted Striphas discusses how we conceptualized both the word algorithm and the word culture prior to “algorithmic culture” emerging as a more recent phenomenon from the past few decades. This book is really not what I expected from the description, but that doesn’t mean it was a bad time. Thanks to NetGalley and Columbia University Press for the eARC!Striphas takes a very intertextual and interdisciplinary approach to answering the question of, What was algorithmic culture like before we had the internet? These chapters span centuries, languages, and draw on everything from philosophy to computer science to linguistics and semiotics. It’s truly impressive how Striphas synthesizes writings and ideas from these various fields into his presentation. He references entire areas of study and scholars I had no idea existed (and I have degrees in math and education as well as minors in English and philosophy!).In particular, Striphas grounds his approach through his own expansion of Raymond Williams’s Keywords publication/theory. Look, I’m not going to pretend I have enough background to evaluate this approach. Readers more familiar with this angle of attack and Williams might be better poised to critique Striphas’ strategy. As it is, I liked the emphasis on looking at language as something constructed by and responsive to changes in our society—along with the potent reminder that even a concept like culture, whose meaning we might assume is to be taken for granted, shifts over time. So Striphas definitely exposed me to a lot of new (old) ideas, got me thinking, and that alone is something I appreciate in a nonfiction book like this!On the other hand, this means that Striphas often gets bogged down in the weeds of theory. So much so that I’m not sure each chapter actually accomplishes its mission of supporting his overall thesis. Striphas attempts to trace the history of the word algorithm, then culture, and finally algorithmic culture, but along the way he gets lost in discussing, say, the historical context of the Cold War, suspicion and oppression of gay people in civil service and academia, etc. I’m not dismissing that these could be relevant threads to his argument, but the amount of digression feels, if not boring, then distracting enough to divert me from the overall point he’s trying to make.As a mathematician, I really liked the chapter about the origins of algorithm, algebra, and al-Khwarizmi. I learned a lot I didn’t know. Striphas carefully questions the “official,” simplified narrative we often learn (if we are lucky) in our math classes. He makes it clear that he isn’t trying to downplay al-Khwarizmi’s role, or the wider role of Islamic mathematicians, when it comes to their influence on European mathematics. At the same time, he points out that a reductive approach—tracing algorithm back to al-Kwharizmi’s name, algebra back to a book he wrote (on a method that he probably did not originate)—actually does an injustice, flattening and erasing the complexities of that time period and al-Khwarizmi’s life.I really appreciate how Striphas clearly acknowledges the power dynamics at play, both in contemporary writings of each period along with modern views, the roles of racism and sexism, etc., influencing our perception of algorithmic culture. He references many luminary scholars whose names I’ve heard of (Ruha Benjamin) or work I’ve read (Safiya Umoja Noble). In this sense, Algorithmic Culture Before the Internet continues the intertextual conversation, not just engaging with it but building it and then throwing the ball forward, into the future, hoping that someone will pick it up and engage with Striphas later down the line.This book is very specifically targeted towards an audience with more knowledge of this field than me. I think some people might pick it up (as I did) because of its title and description, expecting a more straightforward history (as I did) of computer science prior to the computer and the intersections with culture. But this is an academic book, not a pop history book, and it shows. If you’re willing to wade into deeper intellectual waters, then you will find parts of this book rewarding—challenging but rewarding. If you’re not wanting that workout right now, then you should skip this one.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Cassandra in Reverse even has a blurb from Margaret Montimore. But don’t let this association colour your ideas about Holly Smale’s take on time-hopping through one’s own life, for this novel is very much its own story—and it’s a good one. Thank you to publisher MIRA for the eARC!Cassandra Dankworth is dumped by her boyfriend and fired from her job on the same day. Also, her flatmate situation has become untenable. After this no good, very bad day, Cassandra is at her wit’s end. Overwhelmed and defeated, that’s when she discovers for the first time that she can, through sheer mental effort, travel back along her own timeline and relive her life from any point. She can’t go back all that far—certainly not far enough to save her parents from a fatal traffic collision when she was younger. But four months is enough time to save her relationship, her living situation, and her career. Right?As I said in my introduction and is worth reiterating here: when you look at Cassandra in Reverse more closely, it’s actually quite distinct from Oona Out of Order. Notably, Cassandra has agency over her time-travel ability, whereas Oona is a passenger on her nonlinear life. Cassandra’s ability is a kind of gigantic do-over button—and who hasn’t wished for this power, let’s be honest? Any time I say something that proves mildly embarrassing or uncomfortable, any time the perfectionist in me thinks “I could have handled that better,” I wish for exactly this ability to blink my way back to that moment and do it ever so slightly better.Of course, this leads to some self-imposed Groundhog Days, if you will, as Cassandra starts to obsess over getting certain days right. The iterations start to blur together (both to her and the reader), a deliberate decision on Smale’s part, I believe, that helps us to see how confusing this experience must be for Cassandra. Living a single day over and over is one thing—redoing weeks at a time, while trying to hold memories of all the different timelines in one’s head? That must be an incredible feat!The book left me with several unanswered questions about Cassandra’s ability. First, there’s no explanation for why she can time travel (fair enough) nor why she can, seemingly arbitrarily, only go back to about four months prior to the start of the book. Perhaps most intriguing to me is the possibility that this ability makes Cassandra effectively immortal, albeit with some caveats. In theory, she could live out her life and then, in her old age, travel back in time to a younger age and keep looping her life, even trying different variations of it. Of course, this assumes that her ability remains viable for the rest of her life (and that she could go back further than four months prior by then). But it’s an interesting idea!To be clear, the fact that none of these questions are answered doesn’t bother me in the slightest, I just wanted to ruminate on them in my .Indeed, I rather like that Cassandra raises some questions about the ethics of time travel at all. As I mentioned in my  of Some Desperate Glory, my experience watching The Flash TV series has thoroughly convinced me that time travel is largely unethical. Cassandra ponders what happens to each timeline she abandons when she travels back to reset hers: what happens to all the other people, all their lives that get reset? At some points, Smale demonstrates how tiny changes in Cassandra’s actions inadvertently ripple out in a butterfly effect to alter the courses of lives of people she didn’t even intend to affect. That’s an awesome responsibility. Moreover, what if there were two people with this ability wielding it at the same time? A kind of time travellers’ duel, if you will? Frightening.Oh, I’m supposed to be ing the book, you say? Oops. I guess you could say this is my praise for Cassandra in Reverse: it does what any good time-travel story should do, which is get me thinking about the wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey nature of time travel!I also have conditional praise for the portrayal of an autistic protagonist in Cassandra. I say conditional because I’m allistic, so it’s not really my lane to evaluate Cassandra as autistic representation. The dearth of autistic representation in mainstream fiction means that, inevitably, we put too much pressure on individual instances of own-voices rep to capture every nuance of identities that are necessarily not monolithic. Cassandra is one particular portrayal of one particular experience of being an autistic woman in English society—and it’s a portrayal that I suspect won’t satisfy some autistic people. At the same time, I hope others feel very seen by what Cassandra undergoes in this book.Speaking only from my perspective as an allistic yet neurodivergent woman: I really liked how Smale captures how much our society is not designed for autistic people. Cassandra is very sensitive to smells, very much likes having all of her things in the right place, has trouble reading people’s emotional states, etc.—traits that we often dismiss or outright mock, usually in ableist ways. Told from her first-person perspective, however, her experiences are less about stereotypes and more about an accounting of the struggle to exist in a society that’s constantly gaslighting you simply for who you are.Nowhere is this more evident than in Cassandra’s interactions with her coworkers. I am so happy that Cassandra ends up finding a friend in one of them—watching that relationship grow, albeit iteratively as Cassandra resets the timeline, was one of the most delightful parts of this book. The rest of her coworkers are incredibly ableist in the most dull ways. There were moments when I groaned because it felt like they were caricatures, almost, or at least not sketched in great detail. That being said, towards the end of the book we see moments of greater depth from some of them (like Barry), and I do appreciate that.Then we have Cassandra’s relationships with her boyfriend and sister. It’s doubly hard for me to comment on the former, because not only am I not autistic but I’m also aromantic (although maybe in this case that means I can at least better approximate Cassandra’s confusion about what Will expects from her, because I would feel much the same, I suspect). Suffice it to say, Cassandra’s attempts to “fix” things with Will are, as far as I understand, a very real if painful portrayal of how our society makes autistic people feel broken for not fitting into the moulds and roles we expect in these areas of life. In the same way, the rift between Cassandra and her sister exists for several reasons—notably the trauma following their parents’ untimely deaths—yet Cassanda’s undiagnosed autism lurks at the heart of those reasons.Again, Smale’s point is not that Cassandra is the broken one but rather that our society is broken. I fear that some allistic readers will pick up this book, read a couple of chapters, and put it down, deriding Cassandra as an annoying or anal character, calling her unlikable—precisely the reaction, essentially, of the coworkers and clients in this book. If you stick around, you’ll see what Smale is doing, I hope. You’ll see how Cassandra is using time travel as the ultimate masking tool.Which is why I don’t know how I feel about the ending.No, actually, I think I really don’t like the ending.I’m not going to spoil it. I don’t want to discuss it here in that much detail. But I can describe how it made me feel: ambivalent, and now as I write this  slightly betrayed. Maybe I am misunderstanding Smale’s theme, or maybe I just don’t see how this ending ultimately caps that theme. From where I sit, unfortunately, the ending seems to undermine it—establishing that Cassandra is as doomed as her counterpart from Greek mythology, essentially. I don’t know—if you liked the ending or want to share your interpretation of it, hit me up on Twitter and let’s chat.Cassandra in Reverse has its rough patches, to be sure. Many of the deliberate artistic choices on Smale’s part (the repetitive structure, the portrayal of Cassandra’s autism) will make this book less enjoyable for some readers. Yet it is those same choices that make this book memorable, unique, valuable, in my opinion. Smale sets out to say something interesting, and her take on a time-travel story involving romance and family drama and dealing with trauma deserves definitely got me thinking about all of these things.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

My amazing new next-door neighbour, with whom I have so much in common (tea! knitting! cribbage!), offered to lend me a bevy of books including Signs Preceding the End of the World. She highly recommended Yuri Herrera, and I was eager to experience a book that she loved. Yes—my enjoyment of this book was likely going to make or break our friendship. Just kidding. Or am I?Set during an unspecified present, this is a novel about borders, transgressions, and transformation. Makina leaves her border town in Mexico and crosses over to the United States in search of her brother, who himself was convinced there was land in their family’s name waiting for them on the American side. The crossing is unsanctioned and full of danger, but so too is existing on the other side. Makina will be changed by what she experiences as she uproots herself from all that she has known in order to find family.Herrera, through translator Lisa Dillman, writes in stream of consciousness. The book doesn’t use quotation marks for dialogue, my one unforgivable sin when it comes to typesetting fiction—if my friend hadn’t recommended this book to me, I would have DNFed it. This flouted convention aside, I enjoyed Herrera’s style and the way that most of the other characters don’t need names. Makina interacts with crime bosses only assigned a letter: Mr. Double-U, Mr. Aitch, Mr. Q. Her mother gets a name (Cora) but her brother, with whom she arguably has a more significant interaction, doesn’t. Herrera is very sparing with how he doles out such personal details.This paucity of details extends to the setting—at least at the broader level—lending the story a timelessness that belies the title’s harbinger tone. This book could have been set yesterday, or two years ago, or next week. Makina’s town is small and has no direct phone service—she prides herself at being a skilled and neutral switchboard operator. Border crossings of the kind Makina undertakes have been common for a long time. Similarly, America is always sending people overseas to fight in one place or another. As a result, the themes Herrera explores feel like they are suspended in time if not in place. The end of the world, it seems, is always ever just over the horizon.Makina’s journey is simultaneously physical and spiritual. As her body traverses borders and nations, her spirit undergoes its own transformation. Her journey opens up her world and helps her to understand that, even in isolation, far-flung events and powers shape her and her family’s possibilities and experiences. Her brother was pulled away by the lure of land, false though that promise proved to be, yet stayed because the dangerous identity he acquired seemed to fit him better than whatever he could have hoped to be back home. In a similar way, Makina is permanently changed after finding and speaking to him.I’m not sure how I feel about the ending. It’s abrupt and almost truncated. Herrera’s narration thins out until it is a tight metaphor suspended in amber, the light shining through his words but distorted, unclear. My interpretation, best as I can make it, is that Makina realizes she must let go.Like many books written by foreign authors, the full brilliance of Signs Preceding the End of the World eludes me because I lack cultural context. A quick Google helped me understand that the chapters of the book are meant to mirror the journey through Mictān, the Mexica underworld—but that knowledge by itself is a mere surface detail; I lack the context of fully appreciating what that means. This is not a flaw of the book (or even of myself) but merely my attempt to remind myself that it’s OK that I’m struggling to articulate my thoughts entirely.That’s the value of Signs Preceding the End of the World, of course. The translation of this book into English provides a portal into the psyche of a certain experience. In this book, America makes its presence felt, always and unflinchingly. Its presence is at times gregarious, callous, dangerous, devious, treacherous. While aspects of this portrayal are recognizable to me, as someone who lives on the other border of the United States, my positionality is very different from Makina’s.In the end, the same sparse descriptive style that I praised (along with Dillman’s assiduous translation) is also my least favourite thing about this book. This novel (novella?—it’s short) is very much like oysters. I don’t mind eating oysters, but I wouldn’t eat them every day, and I probably wouldn’t even eat them that often throughout the year. It is a literary experience in and of itself rather than a literary escape.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Kill Your Darlings by L.E. Harper is another spin on Time and again, I keep saying it: give me the stories about stories, the metafiction, all of it. Kill Your Darlings by L.E. Harper is another spin on this idea. Along with a heavy (in many senses of the word) focus on mental health, this is a story about figuring out who you want to be when everyone is telling you who they think you are. This is a debut novel, and the rough edges that often come with that show. Aside from that, I enjoyed the story and the attempts that Harper makes to go deep on sensitive issues. I received an eARC from NetGalley in exchange for my .An author living in New York City wakes up to find herself inhabiting the body of Kyla Starblade, the protagonist of her fantasy series set in another world. “Kyla” quickly explains to the other characters in this book what’s up, but it’s immaterial—the Shadow War that they have been fighting for the past four books will stop for no one, and it’s up to her to vanquish the dark lord and save the day. There’s just one problem: in the original ending to this story, as written by this author, all of these principal characters die. Can she change what she has written, and in so doing, find her way back home?An author finding themselves transported into their world isn’t the most original premise, but it has been a while since I’ve seen precisely this sort of twist on it. Additionally, Harper leaves the nature of this transposition ultimately unresolved: it could be a “quantum magical” entanglement, or it could be the narrator simply hallucinating everything. Did she create this world, or did she merely perceive its events from Earth, an interdimensional clairvoyant? The ultimate answer is irrelevant because it’s the journey that is important.This is a story that is clearly, unapologetically about mental health and in particular about depression and suicide ideation—there are trigger warnings up front, and I have to say, they are justified. The book contains graphic descriptions of a mechanism of suicide, so practise self-care when deciding whether to read this book.This layer to the story is both thematically and narratively important. The narrator is unreliable—there are a few twists near the end that, when revealed, subtly shift the reader’s interpretation of the situation. She lies to us but also to herself. Indeed, in her role as the hero of this world, the narrator feels the pressure to win against the dark lord, who is constantly telling her that she isn’t good enough. This is all too similar to what the narrator’s own brain has told her repeatedly over the years, resulting in her withdrawing from community with the people who care about her.We don’t get to know the narrator’s world nearly as well as we do the fantasy one. There are a few stolen glimpses, but beyond that it is entirely what the narrator divulges through exposition—mainly how some of her book’s characters are modelled after her close friends, people she has since pushed away or ignored. At first, when the book opened with the narrator already in Kyla’s body in her fantasy world, I wished that we had flashbacks to the narrator’s life in NYC. Then again, I think I understand what Harper was going for here: depression is of the mind. Although circumstances can exacerbate it, the narrator isn’t depressed because of what she has experienced in her life—she’s depressed because her brain chemistry is out of whack. So it does make sense, thematically, for Kill Your Darlings to take place entirely in the narrator’s head (whether or not it is also taking place in another reality), separate from her own external world. There’s an appealing subjectivity to this storytelling.Similarly, I appreciate that Harper doesn’t spend chapters upon chapters of the narrator trying to dupe everyone into thinking she is Kyla. She basically comes right out and says it right away, and the book’s pacing is much better for it. As it is, I think there were moments of uneven pacing—in particular, the middle was a bit of a slog. The story is very much about the narrator overcoming her self-doubt and other inner demons. As a result, the cornucopia of external threats often took a back seat in terms of the actual threat they seemed to pose to the characters. This is the trouble when you posit that a group of people might or might not be “real” in fiction—you have to be really careful to somehow maintain the stakes and our desire to sympathize with those characters. Do I care about the Kyla as much as the narrator? Is Kyla’s survival as important as the narrator’s here? These kinds of metaphysical considerations are fun but can also distract a reader from the mental-health themes at the core of the book.Finally, I of course have to comment positively on the portrayal of a queernorm world (which is pretty subtle) and the narrator as an asexual character. The latter part is important given that Kyla is not asexual—Kyla has a very lusty love interest indeed, and some of the conflict comes from the narrator feeling romantically drawn to this character despite feeling no sexual attraction. I really liked how Harper is careful to establish that the narrator’s asexuality is not part of her being “broken,” despite what her brain might tell her. Her asexuality is wrapped up in her loneliness and isolation, which I think is an appropriate commentary on how the discrimination and erasure that ace people face in our society can converge with mental illness. This is just one more way, in other words, that the narrator feels isolated, even though her asexuality is in and of itself a valid experience.All in all, Kill Your Darlings has its engrossing and interesting moments. Harper definitely made me want to keep reading and find out what happens next, both to the narrator and this fantasy world that she has created. I also like its very overt commentary on mental illness. While the writing itself—particularly the pacing and the challenges of pathos given the story—could be improved, it’s still a thoughtful and worthy story.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Attraction, Love, Sex: The Inside Story examines our scientific understanding of makes humans interested in one another, romantic stylez (yes, with a Z). Simon LeVay, a neuroscientist, brings together research from psychology, biology, chemistry, and more in order to help the reader understand the physiological, psychological, and even evolutionary underpinnings of sexuality and romance. There’s a lot of good science in this book, along with some really bad science that left a bad taste in my mouth. An eARC was provided by Columbia University Press via NetGalley.This book is organized into discrete chapters that are easy to pick up and put back down. LeVay takes us on a tour, if you will, through different aspects of sex and sexuality. Each chapter has a simple title, like “Love” or “Attraction,” yet that simplicity conceals the beguiling complexity of each topic. I really liked the structure and especially the way LeVay consistently includes a conclusions section at the end of every chapter to give us the bottom line.What I liked: this is a book that doesn’t oversimplify and clearly acknowledges that science can be a flawed, human endeavour. As LeVay mentions various studies and the theories they support, he is ever diligent in noting if a study couldn’t be replicated or was contradicted by a more recent study. This is a practice I respect, for I find that sometimes science communicators, in their desire to distill science into a more streamlined narrative, pick one theory (or a couple of most likely theories) and present that version of the science as more settled than it actually is. Given that science is an ever-evolving discipline, LeVay’s approach to discussing these topics is a lot more transparent. In particular, I appreciated how he presented evolutionary psychology theories in a more skeptical light.I also think this book has a great deal of useful information in its pages. For anyone just setting out to get a comprehensive overview of all things love, you could do worse than to read Attraction, Love, Sex. Even a single chapter in isolation, for example as an excerpt in a high school class, could be really useful. LeVay’s writing is skilled, and I learned all sorts of useful tidbits.On the other hand, there were times when this book frustrated me as a queer person. Now, LeVay is gay and also, from what I can infer here, attempts to be trans inclusive. At one point he discusses sex-linked differences in the brain and includes the intriguing result that brain scans of binary trans people are often more similar to the sex they identify as rather than their sex assigned at birth (something also discussed in Cordelia Fine’s Delusions of Gender. So I want to give LeVay some credit here. Nevertheless, I have some reservations.First, LeVay seems to put a lot of stock in defining sexual orientation in terms of physical arousal and being able to quantify this by hooking people up to machines that measure that arousal through, say, blood flow. I understand the desire from a scientific standpoint to be able to talk about sexual orientation in a more objective, measurable way. Yet plethysmography has a troubling history (undiscussed here) linked to authorities wanting to out gay people and even then subject them to conversion therapy. More broadly, I think LeVay misses the point. While there is undoubtedly a physiological component to orientation—whether that is neurological, hormonal, genetic, etc.—like so many other emergent aspects of our identity, I don’t think we will ever be able to reduce orientation down purely to a single test or to concrete and tidy definitions like the ones he mentions here.Second, LeVay’s treatment of asexuality is woefully inadequate. Again, credit where credit is due: he at least mentions asexuality and explicitly declares that “asexuality is not a problematic lack of sexual desire” and also states that “most asexual people are satisfied with their orientation.” So why am I dissatisfied with this mention? Simply put, even though LeVay charitably says that “asexuality should probably be thought of as a sexual orientation,” this single mention of asexuality (all of these quotations come from a single paragraph) occurs in the chapter on “Having Sex” rather than the “Orientation” or “Attraction” chapters. We are once again an afterthought, little more than a footnote—a positive, inclusive one, yes, but not much more than that.Third, I take major issue with how LeVay characterizes trans people. LeVay uncritically draws on the work of Ray Blanchard and his theory of autogynephelia. (Julia Serano has a very cogent explanation of why Blanchard’s work is harmful, so I’ll leave that part to her.) LeVay draws a very artificial distinction between what he sees as “classical” transsexuality and autogynephilic trans women (you’ll notice that this discussion and Blanchard’s original research both focus solely on trans women, with nary a consideration for trans men or non-binary people, insert audible eye-rolling here). Just the label of “classic” sounds icky to me. As with his conversations on orientation, LeVay’s conceptions of gender identity miss the mark in a profound way.I don’t know anything about LeVay outside of reading his Wikipedia article. It sounds like he has been a longstanding expert in the study of sexuality as it relates to neuroscience, along with an advocate for gay rights. With that in mind, I don’t want to be the uppity youngster who criticizes her elders with undue harshness.Even so, as I sat down to write a much softer version of this  … well, I got to the part about trans people, and I found myself unable to be conciliatory. LeVay might be a towering giant in his field and have a long career behind him, but it’s irresponsible to publish remarks like this in 2023 in the current political climate around trans people. I cannot in good conscience recommend this book, because well-meaning and curious allies who read this might inadvertently think that LeVay (and by extension, Blanchard) are accurately discussing transgender people. As much as there are valuable nuggets of information elsewhere in the book, this one section alone is too problematic. Additionally, it represents the challenge of talking so broadly about a topic like this. Rather than specializing, LeVay decided to take on all of human sexuality—and even with his decades of experience in the field, that task proved to be too elusive for him to complete with reasonable fidelity.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

The Mothers approaches this with additional layers of considering race and class. I say “layers” because that’s how it feels like Brit Bennett tells this story: like a croissant, hundreds of thin layers folded over on each other, waiting for you to read them.Nadia, almost done with high school, starts seeing Luke, who is older. When she discovers she is pregnant, Luke comes up with the cash she needs to get an abortion. Later, Nadia goes off to university and Luke marries her best friend. As she returns to her hometown to take care of her father, Nadia has to confront how her choices and those of others around her have shaped her life—and in particular, how our response to the pressures of religion, culture, racism, and society in general shape us.I really liked the way that Bennett uses space as well as time to delineate her narrative here. Nadia leaves her small town in California to go to the University of Michigan and doesn’t return for years, not even to visit her father or Aubrey, not until Aubrey gets married. She escapes and lives so much, goes so many places, experiences quite a bit, before getting pulled back to her hometown in a semipermanent way. Although there isn’t much that I have in common with Nadia, as someone from a small town that many people leave only to come back to, I can identify with that experience.Similarly, I enjoyed the way Bennett charts Nadia’s experiences and comments on them through the omniscient narrators that are the eponymous Mothers of the church. The way they say that they saw this coming (or would have), that they could have warned Nadia off the pastor’s son, etc.There’s also a lot that can be said here about race, though I am sure others have said it better. We can’t talk about pregnancy and who is burdened with the risks of it without talking about the way that healthcare in the United States fails Black women and girls in particular. The story that Bennett is telling her is a story that feels very timeless—aside from a couple of references to texting, and of course Nadia going off to university, this story could have taken place in now or in the nineties.I yelled at the book when Nadia did the thing that she, of course, was inevitably going to do when she returned to her town. The aromantic in me finds it really hard to wrap my head around the choices that people in romantic relationships make sometimes!Bennett’s style didn’t work as much for me as the characterization did. The book is very light on dialogue, heavy on narration and description and telling us what a character feels or thinks. This isn’t to criticize Bennett’s writing skills—I loved some of her turns of phrase, some of the metaphors and descriptive language she uses. But the storytelling happens at a distance from the characters, and it is hard to get emotionally invested in the events despite their intense emotional experiences.I enjoyed The Mothers and think I get what Bennett is putting down here. That, in a way, is a good measure of the success of a book: did I connect to the author enough to hear their message? The answer here is yes.

It was one of her favourite books last year—so much so that she jumped at the sequel. So, you know, no pressure to love it or anything. Fortunately, our friendship can continue. Sue Lynn Tan has written something that I dare call fantasy opera (as opposed to space opera)—which is to say, there is something very epic going on here.Xingyin is the eponymous daughter of the moon goddess. Her mother was mortal but drank a potion that granted her immortality. However, the Celestial Emperor banished her to the moon, where she must light the lanterns each night. She sends Xingyin away when Xingyin is quite young to avoid discovery. And so Xingyin wanders, eventually becoming the companion to the crown prince—Liwei—and formulating a plan to secure her mother’s pardon (and freedom). Dark forces gathering on the border of the empire, however, threaten to upset Xingyin’s plans.This book was exactly what I needed after coming out of a reading slump in April. After a glut of nonfiction, Daughter of the Moon Goddess was a refreshing foray back into fiction. Tan’s writing is so relaxing and cozy, almost lyrical at times. She clearly understood the assignment she set for herself: yes, this book can be sparse on background and character, can leap entire years in paragraphs, and occasionally feels larger than life. But this is a deliberate embrace of genre conventions that allows Tan to draw inspiration from Chinese mythology. From the divide between mortals and immortals to dragons and the need to be honourable, Tan breathes life into a tale that will feel familiar yet also fresh and stimulating.I’ll be honest—my own experience with and understanding of Chinese history and mythology is woefully Western and incomplete, so I can’t comment much on those dimensions of this book. My understanding is that this belongs to a genre called xianxia, i.e. legendary fantasy. I know that Xingyin’s mother and father are based off the legendary figures Chang'e and Hou Yi but that from there Tan has basically made the story her own. Readers more familiar with this genre might find the book more ordinary. All I can say from my point of view as a white woman is that I really enjoyed both the style and substance of this story. Plus, you know something else I didn’t expect to enjoy? The romance!Yes, this book has a love triangle. As you might know, I generally don’t care for the romantic subplot of any given book. I knew it was a given when Xingyin started hanging around Liwei that the two would develop affection for one another. Tossing Wenzhi into the mix only made good narrative sense. But the romance felt really … deep, I guess is the word? When Liwei is, predictably, betrothed for reasons of convenience regardless of his feelings for Xingyin, I love how her reaction is to pull away and, later, tell him that she still loves him but that doesn’t mean they will be together. There is a pragmatism to this that I, as an aromantic person, truly appreciate. The idea that one can love someone, and be loved by that person in return, and even be together in some way for a time, only for that time to expire, is something we don’t see enough in a field of stories that often paint true love as forever. By the same token, I love that Tan leaves the end of the story ambiguous in terms of Xingyin’s romantic relationship status (no spoilers, so I will leave it at that). This is a book that understands how to tell a love story!Xingyin is also a wonderful protagonist. She is prickly and flawed at times, prone to pride yet also quick to find herself wanting. I appreciated that she was seldom perfect from the start—yes, she is very fortunate, such as how she encounters Liwei—that’s the genre boost working in her favour. But when she joins the army, for example, she quickly gets a dose of reality when her first mission is messier than she was prepared for and people are injured or die because of her hesitation. I also love the somewhat usual tests and trials she must endure, such as when she seeks to help the dragons with their pearls. As much as Tan is still drawing from Chinese mythology in these moments, the broader strokes feel like echoes of many other traditions, Western or Eastern, including luminaries like Le Guin.All in all, that’s probably the most powerful aspect of Daughter of the Moon Goddess for me: this is a book that reverberates. The emotions it left me with (because I did cry at the end) are still rattling around in my skull days after finishing it. I would read the sequel today if I had it in front of me. This is a book that makes me think about other books, let me luxuriate in its story for the time I had it, and generally made me feel excited about reading—even after I was finished it. It’s a sweet, simple, sublime piece of storytelling.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

All kinds of dragons—sapient ones, feral ones, ones that pillage and hoard and burninate, and ones that just want to stay home and read a cozy book. When I saw L.R. Lam was coming out with a dragon-centric novel, I jumped at the eARC from NetGalley and Hodder & Stoughton. Dragonfall has a lot going for it, from an original and well-constructed world to a compelling premise. In the end I wasn’t left completely satisfied, but this is still a good book.Everen is a dragon (spoiler?). He is, in fact, the last male dragon. His kind once worked alongside humanity, dragons and humans often bonding and then becoming comrades in a battle against evil. But centuries prior, humans rose up and drove dragons out of this world into Vere Celene, which is where Everen was born. There is a prophecy that the last male dragon will lead his kind back and retake what’s theirs—no pressure, though. Meanwhile, back in the human world, Arcady is a poor, young orphan with a plan to pose as a rich noble and find a way to exonerate the relative who, even in death, is blamed for a plague that ravages the nation. Everen and Arcady’s paths not only cross but become inextricably entwined. Forced to work together, they grow very close—until Everen has to choose between Arcady’s life or his loyalty to his people.See what I mean? Compelling premise here. The reluctant allies-to-lovers trope, the “I love this person but I’m going to have to kill them” sword dangling over the relationship. The utter mismatch of species. It’s a good time! Lam works hard on the slow burn of the romance, developing it quite gradually, layering on the physical attraction, the chemistry, the personality clashes. Anyone who enjoys romantic subplots more than me will hopefully quite enjoy this dimension of Dragonfall.The diametrically opposed desires of Arcady and Everen are also important. There is so much conflict here between the two of them, and I love it. I caught myself cackling at points as I read because of the dramatic irony (the chapters alternate between Arcady and Everen’s points of view—Arcady’s in first person, Everen’s in second person addressed, epistolary style, to Arcady). The storytelling is quite effective, and Lam kept me wondering throughout how things would be resolved, whether Everen could keep his promise to his kin and, if so, how that would affect Arcady’s plans.Also, I couldn’t work this into my summary, but there’s a heist, or at least, a caper. It’s not the smoothest of jobs and not the main focus of the book, but it’s prominent enough that I sat up when I first caught a whiff of it—you all know how much I love a good heist.Finally, loved the subversion of cisnormativity, the way that Locians use hand signals to communicate their pronouns, and Arcady’s role as a nonbinary or genderfluid protagonist.For all that I enjoyed Dragonfall, though, there were elements to it that I found lacking. The ending is a classic cliffhanger to set up the sequel. I don’t mind that by itself, nor do I even mind so much the huge reveal at the very last moment. Lam is trying for tantalizing rather than tricksy, so it kind of works. On the other hand, it didn’t get me excited for the second book. I’m not on the edge of my seat, not particularly invested in Arcady or Everen or Sorin’s next chapters.The thing is, I feel like I should be? There’s so much in here to recommend it, but that’s just the problem—Dragonfall might be pulling from a mixture of too many brilliant tropes, and while Lam uses many of them to good effect, the final result is still a messy kaleidoscope. When I zoom in on it, I can appreciate the individual parts and find lots to praise. But when I zoom out and try to look at the novel as a whole, I’m left with less enthusiasm. If anything, this is a good example of how literature is not only a subjective experience but also can change within an individual reader’s perceptions. I am left, I suppose, decidedly ambivalent.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Ace and Aro Journeys: A Guide to Embracing Your Asexual or Aromantic Identity is yet another, though the Ace and Aro Advocacy Project has done a good job of making sure it is providing a valuable and different perspective. My thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for the eARC.I think the book itself sums it up nicely when it says it aims to be both ace/aro 101 and 201. It covers the basics that so many books already cover about what asexuality and aromanticism are—and then it goes beyond those basics. Like several of the other books I’ve read from JKP this year, this one includes quotations from ace and aro people. However, the authorial voice of Ace and Aro Journeys remains casual yet organizational, a departure from the much more personal voices of individuals who wrote the other books.Another contrast to the other books I read was that they were all mostly aimed at a-spec audiences, especially a-spec people who are just finding or coming to terms with their identities. While allo people could enjoy those books and learn a lot from them, they weren’t the primary audience. Ace and Aro Journeys, on the other hand, aims much wider. It in fact includes a lot of guidance and advice for allies who want to support their a-spec friends and family. So if you are searching for a book to get the allo person in your life to help them understand you, this one might be it.Beyond that, I’m going to be honest: the burnout I’m feeling makes it difficult for me to be as enthusiastic about this book if I had just read it on its own. I’m trying to be clear about this because I don’t want to damn the book with faint praise—I think this book is good, and I’m really happy it exists and that I got to read it, but I’ve had too much of a good thing these past few months, and it is showing! What a time to live in when I can complain about reading too much nonfiction about ace and aro experiences, eh?There are a few other highlights I can mention that make it easy to endorse this book. First, it is very focused on practical steps. It talks about finding support networks and specifically traces the origins of a-spec havens online. From an anthropological perspective, anyone researching or trying to learn more about the earlier days of asexuality on the web could do worse than starting here. As someone who hasn’t ever engaged in specific a-spec communities (I only really found my people on Twitter, and nowadays many have left), this part of the book made me feel a kind of … I don’t know, yearning? So many of the queer spaces where I hang out online are inclusive of ace people but are not necessarily ace-focused. I’m not sure I am going to rush out and join an online space dedicated to a-spec experiences, but this book really got me reflecting on it and what kinds of ace connections I might want in my life.The sheer number of testimonials from different people is also very powerful. My experiences as an ace person don’t always match up with many of the most visible ace voices out there (and the same is true for my experiences as an aro person). This is the case for a lot of marginalized communities; I am sure my experience of this is not unique! But in this book, I definitely heard stories that felt closer to mine. I hope other a-spec readers find that too.On that note, I’ll close my  with one other wish that I’ve said previously: these books do a good job of acknowledging the limitations of their positionality, but we need to go further. It’s great to say, “hey, this is primarily from a white and Western point of view.” Nevertheless, it would be even better if publishers like JKP could invest the time in finding non-white, non-Western voices to explore ace and aro identities from those perspectives as well. I hope in the years to come, I can complain about being burned out by the number of those books too.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

My second bell hooks book, I read this for the bookThis book was published when I was five years old, yet it remains timeless and in a way prescient. My second bell hooks book, I read this for the book club I’m a part of. Teaching to Transgress is quite a different vibe from All About Love. This one is more practical, more focused on work rather than personal life (though hooks, of course, blurs those lines). I value both books but in different ways. As a teacher, of course, this book really spoke to me. Much of what hooks says feels familiar in what I already do; some of what she said pushed me to do better; all of what she says just feels so true and right, especially in the current climate.At the start of the book, and then returning to it throughout, hooks discusses her experiences with education as a student. As a Black girl, and a Black woman, growing up in the American South during desegregation and integration. As a white woman in Canada, all I was taught was that integration of schools was a good thing—makes sense, right? But hooks points that a lot of Black parents were skeptical of integration, were just as against it as white parents, albeit perhaps for different reasons. She laments that she went from an all-Black school that was full of caring Black educators to a white school that treated her poorly and valued compliance over curiosity and actual learning. This is, alas, a story all too familiar today, even here in school systems in Ontario.Thus we arrive at the first meaning of teaching to transgress: hooks wants us to be complicit, to recognize that the system itself is designed to sabotage students. To make them obedient in replicating structures of oppression. She doesn’t say this quite in that way, of course—as I noted in my  of All About Love, hooks has this incredible facility for making her writing accessible, her sentences short—a skill, you have noticed, that still eludes me. So we must teach our students to transgress this system.Beyond that, we ourselves must transgress the dynamics expected between teacher and student by this colonial, carceral system. That is to say, teachers are expected to wield power in a way that dominates students. To change that, hooks says, we have to be vulnerable. We have to invite students to be a part of the learning process in a way that might frighten us (and them). Writing from the perspective of teaching undergraduate university students, hooks remarks that often students will feel lost, will resist her attempts to democratize her classroom, because they are used to being told what to do. As an adult education teacher I feel this way too—my students are suspicious of anything that is different from the high school experience they recall even though that experience was, in part, responsible for them not being successful. Nevertheless, all we can do as educators is keep trying.I call this book prescient because even though hooks is writing in the early nineties, so much of what she says feels like it applies to classrooms today. She witnessed in her time what we are seeing now—namely, the use of shallow stabs at “diversity and equity” that are little more than public relations gambits in lieu of actual systemic change. Much like contemporary Black women are calling out such hypocrisy right now, hooks cautions us not to fall for such pabulum. I drew great inspiration, especially in her conversations with a white male colleague. There is such unflinching honesty in this book: hooks reflects on her own limitations, criticizes others where she believes they deserve criticism, yet is also willing to recognize that people have the capacity to grow and change and be allies.Those of us who are white who read this book and mull over our role in being antiracist educators must confront the fact of our whiteness. This goes deeper than simply “checking our privilege,” as we are often advised to do by the diversity consultants. It means understanding that we can’t always understand, that our experience literally obscures reality as Black people experience it, and for that reason we have to listen to Black voices on these matters—yet not expect Black people to do all the work. We need to understand how we can wield our whiteness to be accomplices.Nearly thirty years old now, Teaching to Transgress has as much or more power today as it did when it was published. I only regret that bell hooks is no longer with us, for I would have enjoyed hearing her speak. As it is, all I can do is keep catching up on her writing. She is honest, thoughtful, deliberate, sensitive. She acknowledges that feminism hasn’t always extended beyond white woman yet strives to change that rather than set feminism aside. She is aware of the paradoxes in which she exists as a Black woman in our society, yet she challenges other Black people, challenges herself, as much as she challenges white people to do better. This, to me, is the ultimate theme of Teaching to Transgress: for hooks, there is always a way for anyone to learn, to do better, to push further and harder for justice.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

From the publicity pitch alone I was nervous this When I requested the eARC of this book from NetGalley and publisher Saga Press, I was apprehensive. From the publicity pitch alone I was nervous this would be one of those white feminist books that purport to provide deeper commentary on social issues but lack an awareness of intersectionality. Then I learned a bit more about Chana Porter, particularly that they are a Lambda Award winner, and I was reassured. Indeed, The Thick and the Lean is a worthwhile exploration of how we police bodies and minds.Beatrice was born and raised in the religious community of Seagate. In this world, the prevailing religion views consumption of food in a puritanical way similar to how some conservative branches of Christianity view sex (and sex is, as you might expect, much less policed). Seagate polices food consumption even more intensely than mainstream communities. But Beatrice loves food and discovers she loves to cook, and it isn’t long before she sets her eyes on leaving. Meanwhile, Reiko uses her hacking skills to move up from life in the Bastian to the Middle and eventually sets her eyes on Above. Both women are influenced by a contraband book, a set of stories purportedly written by a kitchen maid who becomes enamoured of a king, which includes illicit recipes. As the years go by, their covert desires shape who they become and the actions they take in a world that seems increasingly fractured and fraught.Huge content warning of discussions of food/eating disorders, purging, etc.It is, of course, no secret that women in our society are socialized to have a problematic relationship with food. On the one hand, we are typically expected to take on a great deal of the preparation of food. On the other hand, we are policed and shamed if our bodies don’t fit whatever ideal is popular at the time, which often means we’re encouraged to restrict our food intake. Porter exaggerates these mores into a literal religion in The Thick and the Lean. The complex ways in which Beatrice’s internalized shame around food intersect with her feelings about sex, her attraction to people, her attraction to her own body, etc., are fascinating and really got me thinking about my own relationship to food and eating. Again, this could likely trigger people, even if you don’t necessarily have a history with an out-and-out eating disorder, so practise self-care when reading.Beyond the literal interpretation of food restriction, of course, there are so many layers here. Beatrice’s membership in a cult or a strict religious denomination, the exit costs of leaving, its effect on her relationship with her parents—there are many ways one could read one’s own experiences into this, whether one is queer, comes from a highly religious community/family, etc. Porter explores the pain of exile and separation (even when voluntary), found family, and more. The parallel paths of Beatrice and Reiko’s lives are fascinating. Both are entranced by this book that they each come to in different ways, yet for very different reasons: Beatrice latches on to the recipes and the freedom promised through cooking; Reiko is fascinated by the rebellious existence of the maid. They are, respectively, the eponymous thick and the lean: Beatrice literally thick from eating, rich with family and connections; Reiko thin, angular, and isolated despite being in a relationship with someone who thinks he loves her.The story kicks into higher and higher gear, and Porter has her characters grapple with their responsibilities to revolution in each of their capacities. Beatrice, as a chef in a society that marginalizes food, is inherently revolutionary—yet how much is she willing to risk as more and more people protest her proclivity? Reiko has put so much of her energy into creating a sham of a life so real that she has practically become that person, and when she sees her facade in danger of cracking, she has to choose—will she give in, continue being complicit in the literal rising floodwaters that threaten people she grew up with, just because it means an easier life for her personally? Or will she find a way to act?Reiko’s journey in particular is interesting because, unlike Beatrice, she is not always a likeable character (though I would argue she is usually still sympathetic). I really like how Porter illustrates that oppressed people are not always going to be heroes. Plenty of oppressed people collaborate, oppress others, lash out, or simply try to survive even if that means propping up the system that oppresses them. At the same time, as Porter demonstrates through Reiko, such people always still have the capability to surprise you. We contain multitudes.I also adored the worldbuilding in this novel, the way that Porter hints at a whole history that we never truly explore. Is this set in a far future Earth (but it has two moons??)? A planet colonized by our distant descendants? Just a different world entirely? In the end the answers don’t matter—this is set dressing, there to help us understand the allegory that Porter wants to tell.Then there is the story-within-the-story of the kitchen maid. Chapters interspersed between Beatrice and Reiko’s narratives tell us of what happens to the maid and her romance with a king. It’s sweet. It’s a fairy tale too—I think its happy ending is meant to contrast the uncertainty of Beatrice and Reiko’s fates. Stories get wrapped up neatly, whereas real life is seldom so obliging. Beatrice will continue to take leaps of faith, not knowing where she will land. Reiko must reckon with her divided loyalties, her heritage, her desire for a safety that can only ever be illusory.When you get right down to it, The Thick and the Lean is about the price of happiness. What would you do? Would you leave behind your family and all that you know? Would you steal? Kill? Betray? What does happiness even look like in a society that is antagonistic to your very being? (Oof, that last question hit home for me.)I’m really happy I picked up this novel. The title and description initially turned me off, yet the author and the first few chapters were enough to change my mind. I will read more of Chana Porter when I can.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Emily Tesh plays this trope straight to great effect in Some Desperate Glory. This is a story of deradicalization, and it’s one that in this day and age needs to be told. If we as a society are going to continue making progress on issues of social justice in an age where misinformation online abounds and assists in radicalizing our friends and family, we need to learn how to have difficult, nuanced conversations with people who have succumbed to such causes. This book explores that while also delivering action and no small amount of tears. Thank you to Tor and NetGalley for the eARC.Kyr is a warrior dedicated to a cause. She is one of a handful of true humans—Gaians—left in a galaxy where aliens have destroyed Earth and dominated the remainder of humanity. Or at least, that’s the story she was told. As she approaches graduation into the ranks of Gaia’s elite warriors, the facade built around Kyr for her entire life begins to crumble, and she begins to question everything she knows. The resulting doubt will catapult her on a journey across space and time in search of what justice actually means.I didn’t like Kyr at first. We aren’t supposed to—she is a product of a world that this bio-essentialist, rigidly gendered, homophobic, and racist. Tesh warns us of this up front with an author’s note, and I get it after reading the book. In order to truly show us the experience of deradicalizing and leaving a cult or hate group, Tesh has to show us where Kyr starts from: as someone who has internalized all these ideas because that is how she was raised, and even when she starts to question these ideas, often she still falls back on them. That, in my mind, is what makes her a sympathetic character—it’s the struggle against what she “knows” to be true because that was what she was told her whole life.For me, the book’s brilliance is a slow burn indeed. The first part feels like a traditional tale of insurrection: Kyr wakes up, realizes she is one of the baddies, and takes it upon herself to fight back the only way she knows how. It’s the second part of the book, after a cataclysmic event and Tesh’s introduction of time/dimensional travel, that really causes Some Desperate Glory to take off. I love when a story that I think is one thing ends up hopping subgenres to become something else entirely—sure, it doesn’t always work, but when such a leap of faith lands so gracefully, as it does here, it is sublime.From deradicalization we go to bigger philosophical questions of what it means to be human, to be sentient, and who should have the power to decide what course is “best” for the greater good. Though Kyr was definitely on “the wrong side” before, Tesh asks us if she is now on “the right side,” if there is a right side.I’ve been watching a lot of The Flash for the first time alongside my rewatch of Supergirl, and I have to say, it’s making a strong case that time travel—at least, time travel to the past—is straight up unethical. No exceptions. Time travel is an act of hubris that asserts that you, as the traveller, have some kind of right to rewrite the experiences of countless other lives simply because you want to take a jaunt into the past. On the other hand, I wonder if my perspective is biased—no, scratch that, I know it’s biased, but I guess I wonder if that bias actually matters—because I experience time linearly. Maybe entities who see the entirety of time simultaneously do actually know better. I don’t know.I just know that I like stories that make me think about this stuff while also giving me fight scenes and explosions. It’s why I like The Flash and Doctor Who, and it’s why I like Some Desperate Glory.In addition to Kyr, there’s a truly interesting cast of characters, all of whom are flawed and fabulous. I love how, much like Kyr, most of them are hard to fully like—a lot of them are kind of assholes or rude—yet they are all so interesting. I really appreciate the way that Tesh sympathetically portrays how difficult it is to overcome prejudice—even in little ways, like how Kyr has to get used to using they/them pronouns for Yiso, etc. Without making excuses for people who are prejudiced, I also think we need to make space for the fact that it takes people time to work through prejudice and fear—another good example of this is Captain Shaw from season 3 of Star Trek: Picard. Tesh expertly depicts the complexity of the human experience, the ways in which we are all messy and contradictory, whether we are trying to do better or simply obsessed with power and revenge.Then there’s the ending. Some Desperate Glory stands on its own as a novel, which I appreciate. I love me a good standalone science-fiction novel. Yet there is also room for sequels, and honestly the way it ends between Kyr and the Wisdom, that cute little conversation (and who doesn’t love a sentient spaceship with a sense of humour?) … gosh, I would read more. I’m just saying.Some Desperate Glory is some of the most original, delightfully incisive science fiction that I have read in the past few years. I went into it expecting it to be good, to be a fun read—I walked out blown away by the storytelling, the characterization, and the themes. What a great experience.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

And Put Away Childish Things is a novella loosely based on the premise “What if Narnia were real and it were terrible?” Except, that’s kind of already been done? I received an eARC of this from NetGalley and publisher Rebellion.Harry Bodie is an actor for a children’s TV show. He is not beloved. Very few people enjoy his company, and he is resentful that his career has never taken off. His grandmother wrote a series of beloved books called Underhill, which take place in a Narnia-esque world of the same name. Just as the COVID-19 pandemic starts up, Bodie finds himself the target of machinations from several factions, all convinced that Underhill is real and he is the key to accessing it—whether by wardrobe or some other portal.I was really intrigued by the premise, of course, and excited to read the book, but it never seemed to start, for me? Maybe I’m unfairly comparing it to The Magicians. To be clear, this story is very different from that one—both deconstruct the desirability of Narnia, but one is about young adults eager to take up the practice of magic, and the other is about a washed up TV presenter being reluctantly dragged into interdimensional shenanigans. The stories are almost completely divergent, yet that one thread that they have in common made it difficult for me to put the comparison down.Bodie is not a likable character, nor is he meant to be, but I don’t like that I don’t like him! Maybe because there just didn’t seem to be anyone to like in the book. I also think the main antagonist, and their goals/plans for Bodie, gets revealed far too late in the story, resulting in a climax and resolution that felt all too rushed.In the same way, Tchaikovsky dangles little hints of grander things in front of the reader but never explores them. So Snickersnack can move between worlds because she’s got spider powers? OK? Tell me more about these worlds, or potentialities, or how they get manipulated. It’s a very compelling idea and reminiscent of what he explores in Children of Memory, but it doesn’t go very far because of the length of the story. I kept wondering what would have happened if this were novel length—yet at the same time, unlike some novellas and short stories, I have no burning desire to read the novel version of this story.And Put Away Childish Things has clever ideas and solid writing, as I have come to expect from Tchaikovsky. There’s just nothing specifically that I can grab on to, however, and praise as “this made the story for me.” It’s nonspecific portal fiction, a curious blending of fantasy and science fiction. Good for an afternoon’s distraction? Sure. But not the first thing I would recommend.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Ace Notes: Tips and Tricks on Existing in an Allo World by Michele Kirichanskaya is a kind of how-to guide for being asexual in a world that privileges sexual attraction and desire. It’s not prescriptive (as Kirichanskaya notes, there is no one right way to be ace!) but it is very thoughtful. There are two stand-out features of this book: in-depth interviews with other ace-spec people and a very holistic consideration of how asexuality extends beyond the world of sex.All of the ace books I have read recently have, in one way or another, dispensed advice to their audience. This book takes it one step further in that it is meant to be an advice book. The chapter titles, such as “How to Identify an Asexual” or “Explaining the Different Types of Attraction,” reflect this. And whereas the other titles could, in theory, be useful for an allosexual reader, this book’s audience is definitely ace-spec people. This is a book for us, and it’s great.A great deal of what Kirichanskaya covers doesn’t apply to me personally, mostly because I have been out basically since I knew to use the words ace and asexual. That isn’t to discount the value in this book for baby aces but instead meant to highlight what I want to say next, which is that I still found, as an older person who is comfortable talking about her asexuality, a great deal of new perspectives on these pages.In particular, Kirichanskaya has a whole part of the book devoted to “Religion and Identity”—including chapters discussing asexuality and Judaism. As someone who is not Jewish, this is honestly not something that I had ever thought about! So much of the conversation around religion and asexuality in the West revolves around Christianity, and specifically the ideas of purity culture that have come out of Christianity. A lot of ace talk is about how to distinguish asexuality from celibacy, how to push back against purity culture, how to push back against the idea that we should want or have sex to be fruitful and multiply, etc. Reading chapters about asexuality and another one of the world’s major religious and ethnic identities was so cool and refreshing. It makes me think about how I need to seek out some perspectives from Muslim aces as well.Speaking of perspective, Kirichanskaya also interviews many prominent ace personalities. I hadn’t heard all of these names before but suspect many will be recognizable to people who pick up this book. The interviews are dispersed throughout the book based on where they best fit within the book’s larger organization. This is a really nice strategy that breaks up the flow of Kirichanskaya’s writing. Each interview allows Kirichanskaya to elucidate understandings of asexuality that she might not have been able to discuss as eloquently or authentically herself.One of the interviews was with Maia Kobabe, whose book Gender Queer sounds so good I might actually read it one day despite my deep aversion to graphic novels at the moment. Eir interview resonated with me because e and Kiranskaya talk about how transitioning can sometimes affect the labels one uses for one’s sexuality. People have asked me if coming out as trans means I’m not ace any more, something I addressed in a blog post a few years ago. I really like how Kobabe and Kirichanskaya discuss this idea (spoiler: the answer is not one-size-fits-all!).This book is well worth picking up if you are ace or thinking you might fall somewhere on the ace spectrum and want a volume that, rather than explaining asexuality to you, helps you think about what that will look like in your life. It asks you to consider what you want out of this label, what it means for how you relate to yourself and others, and what you want to do going forward. This focus on action rather than introspection is not for everyone, but it is a great complement to the other books this publisher has put out recently. I recommend.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Or maybe I should ask, how does Harrow know exactly what is my literary catnip? Because … wow. The Ten Thousand Doors of January continues my late 2022/2023 theme of reading stories about stories in a big way.January Scaller grows up a ward of Mr. Cornelius Locke while her father travels the world and locates rare items for Locke’s collection. Initially imaginative and precocious, January eventually finds herself pressured by Locke and others to conform to the ideal, modern “good girl” of the early twentieth century. Yet as she enters her teens, January can’t help but shake that there is more out there for her to discover, if only she could find the right door to open. A book that appears in a chest—seemingly by magic—confirms her suspicion, confirms that there are in fact entire worlds to be discovered through the right doors. Before January can truly put this to the test, however, she finds herself embroiled in an age-old conspiracy to close all those doors—and it might just cost her, her father, and her closest friends their lives.I just adore Harrow’s narrative style. She captures one of my favourite genres of fantasy—though this could technically be classed as young adult, I see it as an adult novel, yet it has the same kind of wide-eyed innocent atmosphere that a story for younger readers has. In this respect, Harrow is a worthy successor to Ursula K. Le Guin. I said it. Just as Le Guin created Earthsea (among other worlds) to explore coming of age, the power of names, and storytelling, so too does Harrow. January’s adventure is wide-ranging, and she changes so much from the beginning to the end of the story.In fact, I want to talk about the ending (without going into spoilers). There is an epilogue that made me want to stand up and cheer, except I was in the bath at the time and standing up abruptly might have been a slip-and-fall risk. Basically, January throughout the book has hefty limitations on her power (both magical and mundane). By the end of the book, she has acquired true independence and agency—and she has also grown into her magical power in a way that is truly exciting to see. I would sell a piece of my soul for a sequel that follows grown-up January on her next adventure.I cannot believe this is a debut novel. When I read The Once and Future Witches last year, I was excited to try out Harrow’s earlier work but nervous about whether it would live up to my expectations. If anything, Harrow exceeds them here—I might actually like this book better than her newer novel. In both cases, I would say the principal flaw is in the weak development of the antagonists. Once again, the nature of the main antagonist in this book is easy to discern if you’re even halfway paying attention. While Harrow attempts to portray him in a sympathetic light, and there’s certainly the same kind of theme of feminist empowerment moving through this plot as there is in The Once and Future Witches, ultimately the antagonist in this story just didn’t interest me all that much.Fortunately, January’s characterization more than makes up for it. The way that Harrow talks about stories and words and writing more than makes up for it. The beauty of the love stories here—for there are many—more than makes up for it.Indeed, I really appreciate how Harrow deals with romance. There is an upfront, honest digression about the nature of true love and how love is a process rather than event. January’s parents are separated for seventeen years, and it is painful and raw, and while the love abides, its shape stretches and attenuates over that time. It got me thinking, as a woman in her thirties, how my relationships with the people closest to me will shift with age and experience (and hopefully wisdom). Similarly, January’s own romantic arc is complex, problematized by her circumstances. It would have been so easy for Harrow to put January and her love interest together right away and make their love the deciding factor in January’s triumph. Harrow doesn’t take the easy route, though, and the book is so much better for it.The Ten Thousand Doors of January is sumptuous, fastidious, expansive writing. I luxuriated in Harrow’s storytelling, lingered on her words, longed to explore the worlds she dangles in front of us like so many unreachable horizons. Did I mention I would like more books like this? Not an idle request. This is my jam.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I was intrigued by the title of Camonghne Dyscalculia is finally getting the attention it deserves as the lesser-known sibling condition to dyslexia. I was intrigued by the title of Camonghne Felix’s book, its tantalizing promise to connect dyscalculia to Felix’s tribulations with romance. Dyscalculia: A Love Story of Epic Miscalculation does all of this, though with less focus on math skills than I hoped. Thank you to NetGalley and publisher One World for the eARC!Felix experiences trauma at a young age when her cousin molests her. She recounts in stark terms how the aftermath of this trauma was also traumatic, and as a result, something in her brain changed and she started to struggle with math. Though various doctor’s visits netted pronouncements of ADHD, etc.—with one doctor venturing to suggest bipolar disorder, much to her mother’s dismay—medication regimes didn’t seem to help much, and no one, from Felix’s telling, was all that interested in actually getting to the root of the issue. So Felix grew up, drifted, got into a bad romantic relationship, and here we are. We relive the relationship with her, the break up, the depression, the self-harm and suicide attempt. The psychological evaluations. The cycle.I really enjoyed the style in which this book is written, which surprised me. Each page is short, a paragraph or two. Felix leans on her experience as a poet to conjure up careful descriptions of scenes and action. The chapters here aren’t so much sustained stories as they are lengthy series of missives, back and forth, from different elements of her psyche. They remind me a lot of the poetry of amanda lovelace!I went into this knowing little about the actual content of the book and expecting there to be more discussion of dyscalculia. In that respect, my hopes were dashed. But that isn’t the book’s fault, just a miscalculation on my part (see what I did there). I mention it only to help others who might have formed the same impression. Don’t get me wrong: the dyscalculia talk is definitely there, but it is a part of the larger discourse Felix engages in over these ideas about being broken and whether or not she is fixable.Ultimately, Dyscalculia is about how pain and pleasure are too often connected. How what’s bad for you can feel good, and what’s good for can feel bad. How the people in your life who hurt you can sometimes be the only ones you want to let in, and the ones who are there to help don’t always know how. It’s a deep meditation on how external events can reshape our brain chemistry, which in turn affects how we move through life.Did this book hit me the same I suspect it will hit others? Not really. It verges on poetry in a way that made me zoom through it. And while I can empathize with Felix’s intense episodes of pain, disappointment, and loss, my life has been extremely different from hers; I’m not sure I have ever felt the same depths that she has felt. Dyscalculia did not resonate with me, but I am sure it will resonate with many.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

In the past couple of years, I have become One of my responsibilities as an English teacher is to help my students build their media literacy skills. In the past couple of years, I have become increasingly convinced, in fact, that media literacy is the most essential skill English classes can cover. The deluge of disinformation and morass of misinformation out there is staggering. Throw in the challenges of deepfakes, and, well, it’s starting to get depressing, how difficult it is to evaluate the quality of information that comes across my feeds. For a long time, I’ve been using the Bad News Game in my classroom to help my adult learners understand how misinformation works. When I was approved via NetGalley to read an eARC of Foolproof: Why Misinformation Infects Our Minds and How to Build Immunity, I didn’t know at the time that Sander van der Linden was one of the researchers behind the game! It’s neat to hear him talk more about how the game was designed and other findings about fake news.In the first part of the book, van der Linden discusses the current state of research into misinformation and how it affects us from a cognitive science point of view. Part 2 of the book look at the historical spread of misinformation, from ancient Rome to modern times, and introduces concepts like filter bubbles and echo chambers. Part 3 explains the concept that van der Linden and his team have been researching (building upon older research from the mid-twentieth century)—a psychological vaccine that inoculates us against misinformation. The Bad News Game is an example of such a vaccine in action.My main takeaways from this book (some of which I already knew but which van der Linden explained in more detail): our brains are susceptible to misinformation because of cognitive biases we evolved to deal with environments far different from the ones we find ourselves in today; merely debunking or fact-checking misinformation is seldom very effective; pre-bunking or inoculating people against misinformation can be very effective, but the duration of that efficacy can be variable.Some of what van der Linden says here might seem obvious to anyone with two brain cells to rub together. What makes Foolproof so valuable is the way that he grounds these perhaps obvious ideas in actual research stretching back decades. Reading this book reminded me of the incredible power of science: without this research, we would be in a much worse off place than we are today. This book gave me hope and made me more optimistic for our future. As grave a threat as misinformation plagues pose, there are solutions out there.Although van der Linden briefly touches on the role of artificial intelligence (such as deepfakes) in the book, he doesn’t mention generative AI like ChatGPT. This is likely because the book went to press just before ChatGPT and its competitors launched into the limelight. How’s that for timing? While a great deal of what van der Linden says about spotting misinformation applies to these tools as well, I still have questions. ChatGPT and other large language models open up the door to the possibility of generating so much garbage online that accurate information diminishes simply by volume alone. I’m curious if this new dimension to misinformation spread affects van der Linden’s recommendations or his team’s findings at all.Foolproof is a fascinating and edifying story of using science to push back against one of the most pressing issues in our modern society. Highly recommended for tech people, scholars, scientists, and anyone interested in how misinformation spreads and how we can fight it.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

However, the library had a display of “Girl Power” graphic novels and comic books up for Women’s History Month. This Supergirl comic caught my eye—I named myself after Kara Danvers from the CW Supergirl show! So I decided, why not? I have been mainlining the non-fiction lately. Maybe a comic will be a nice break.Set during Kara’s high school years, Supergirl: Being Super is a coming-of-age adventure that examines the tension between wanting to be “normal” and fitting in versus, as the subtitle says, acknowledging one’s power. In Kara’s case, it’s the power she derives from the yellow sun of Earth. This graphic novel plays fast and loose with Supergirl’s canon and origin story: the way Mariko Tamaki tells it, Kara was sent away from Krypton at a much younger age (similar to her cousin, Kal-El) and therefore does not remember much about her origins. She experiences scattered, intermittent flashbacks to her parents on Krypton, but that’s about it. When an earthquake takes the life of one of Kara’s best friends, she sinks into depression and wonders how she can possibly reconcile having such abilities with no way to help those closest to her.From my perspective this story was all a bit “meh,” but I want to acknowledge that I am not in the target audience. I think a teenager reading this would get a lot more out of the story, from Kara’s devotion to her friends to the ways in which her parents worry over her, love her, and protect her. This is a very different Supergirl from the one I saw on TV, but then again she is very different from the ones in the comics or other media. That is, of course, the strength of comic-book characters: they have a mutability that allow each writer to imagine them anew. So I will praise the interpersonal and internal dynamics of Kara’s journey here.Where I can be more fairly critical, I think, is in the villain and basically the whole A-plot of the story. Without going too deep into spoilers, the villain basically thinks that she should just get to experiment on aliens, and if a few humans get killed in the process, that’s collateral damage. It’s a rather clichéd trope with very little originality applied to it. Tamaki tries to add some depth, granted, giving the villain a sympathetic goal so that we can understand she sees herself as helping humanity—the greater good, and all that.I will say that I really enjoyed Joëlle Jones’s art! The style is crisp and very dynamic. My eyes lingered on the pages slightly longer than they usually do with graphic novels.All in all, as ever, take my s of graphic novels with grains of salt because this is not the medium for me. There’s a reason it took a TV adaptation of Supergirl to get my attention—but I am happy that all these other versions exist to inspire younger generations of girls too.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Usually my response is the unhelpful, “Dunno, figure it out.” But really, the amount of books I read? There must be more books about technology and bias out there, especially in the four years since that one was published. So when I heard about More Than a Glitch: Confronting Race, Gender, and Ability Bias in Tech, I was excited to receive an eARC from NetGalley and publisher MIT Press.Meredith Broussard brings her decades of experience as a data scientist and a Black woman in America to discuss design and data bias in tech, not only along the axis of gender but also race and (dis)ability. As the title implies, the book’s thesis is that the bias we can detect and quantify in tech (and in the social systems, such as companies, that build and maintain our tech) is not present by accident. It’s not just a “glitch” or a bug that we can squash with some crunch and a new release. It’s baked into the system, and solving the problem of bias will require a new approach. Fortunately, in addition to pointing out the problems, Broussard points to the people (herself included) doing the work to build this new approach.When it comes to the problems outlined in this book, a lot of this was already familiar territory to me from watching Coded Bias, reading Algorithms of Oppression and Weapons of Math Destruction, etc. Broussard cites many high-profile examples, and often her explanations of how these systems work start from a basic, first-principles approach. As a result, techies might feel like this book is a little slow. Yet this is exactly the pace needed to make these issues accessible to laypeople, which Broussard is doing here. With systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT making a spectacle, it is imperative that we arm non-tech-savvy individuals with additional literacy, inoculating them against the mistaken argument that technology is or can ever be value-neutral. Broussard’s writing is clear, cogent, and careful. You don’t need any background in computing to understand the issues as she explains them here.What was new to me in this book were the parts where Broussard goes beyond the problems to look instead at the solutions. In addition to her own work, she cites many names with which I’m familiar—Safiya Umoja Noble, Timnit Gebru, Cathy O’Neil—along with a few others whose work I have yet to read, such as Ruha Benjamin. In particular, Broussard enthusiastically endorses the practice of algorithmic auditing. This procedure essentially upends the assumption that machine learning algorithms must be black boxes whose decision-making processes we can never truly understand. Broussard, O’Neil, and others are working to create both manual and automated auditing procedures that companies and organizations can use to detect bias in algorithms. While this isn’t a panacea in and of itself, it is an important step forward into this new frontier of data science.I say this because it’s important for us to accept that we can’t put the genie back in the bottle. We are living in an algorithmic age. But much as with the fight against climate change, we cannot allow acceptance of reality to turn into doom and naysaying against any action. Broussard points out that we can still say no to certain deployments of technology that can be harmful. Facial recognition software is a great example of this, with many municipalities outlawing real-time facial recognition in city surveillance. There are actions we can take.The overarching solution is thus one of thoughtfulness and harm reduction. Broussard directly challenges the Zuckerberg adage to “move fast and break things.” I suppose this means a good clickbait title for this  might be “Capitalists hate her”! But it’s true. The choice here isn’t between algorithms or no algorithms, AI or no AI. It’s between moving fast for the sake of convenience and profit or moving more slowly and thoughtfully for the sake of being more inclusive, equitable, and just.I like to think of myself as “tech adjacent.” I don’t work in tech, but I code on an amateur level and keep my pulse on the tech sector. I think there is a tendency among people like me—tech-adjacent people invested in social justice—to write off the tech sector as a bunch of white dudebros who are out of touch. We see the Musks and Zuckerbergs at the top, and we see the Damores in the bottom and middle ranks ranting about women, and we roll our eyes and stereotype. When we do this, however, we forget that there are so many brilliant people like Broussard, Benjamin, Noble, O’Neil, Gebru, Buolamwini, and more—people of colour, women, people of marginalized genders, disabled people, etc., who care about and are part of the tech ecosystem and are actively working to make it better. They are out there, and they have solutions. We just need to listen.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Fortunately, Clarkisha Kent makes up for that because her writing is intense, rich, and thoughtful. Fat Off, Fat On: A Big Bitch Manifesto is a memoir, yes, but I also love that framing of manifesto as well: Kent is bringing forth a type of energy that she wants to see in this world. I received a  copy from the Feminist Press.From the beginning, Kent does not hold back. She gets into some heavy topics here—just a big content warning for mentions of child molestation and abuse, suicide attempts, mental illness, etc. Kent shares her trauma and talks about how it has shaped her. She is also quite critical of herself. At one point, as she is discussing how her religious upbringing influenced her ideas on sexuality, she describes how fervently she attempted to dissuade her peers from same-sex attraction. Kent, who would eventually realize she is bi, did not have the language as a teenager to properly analyze her experience. This resonated with me as a queer woman, and it also made me think, as a teacher, about why it’s so important to have labels and terms for things. If anyone needs convincing that banning books with queer or Black representation in them is a bad idea, reading about Kent’s experience growing up in a conservative southern state is a good place to start.Fat Off, Fat On reminds me in some ways of Sometimes I Trip On How Happy We Could Be. Perkins and Kent have much in common at least superficially, from their origins in Tennessee to writing on pop culture and, of course, the experience of growing up as Black women in America. If you like one of these books, you will probably like other. That being said, I don’t want to give the impression that they are extremely similar in content. Each has her own unique story, with a distinct voice.Kent’s memoir exists at the intersections of fatphobia, biphobia, and misogynoir. In particular, she returns time and again to the theme of how being fat in a society that mandates thinness for women and dark-skinned in a society that privileges lighter skin, especially among Black women, fucked up her relationship to her own body and to others. Kent makes the point that it is impossible to analyze any one of these traits by themselves—they are all connected, all a part of her. Add in poverty and mental and physical disability and—well, that’s a lot to contend with.Yet never does it feel like Kent falls into the trap of performing her trauma for our entertainment as is so common within memoirs, especially the memoirs of marginalized people. A lot of white women will read memoirs from Black or Indigenous women as a kind of tourism, and then we love to talk about how much we learned, how grateful we are that this person shared their story of oppression with us. Fat Off, Fat On doesn’t let you do that. This is not the plucky story of someone rising above the obstacles in front of them. That being said, did I learn? Of course I did. Kent’s experiences, her identity, her life are all very different from mine. Was I entertained? Um, hell yes. Kent is hilarious. Her writing style is not just present tense but intensely present on the page, with numerous allusions. There’s a whole chapter where she makes connections to Janelle Monáe and Dirty Computer, and had I not already been sitting, I would have needed to sit myself down and taken a moment just to recover. Like, this is the skill of Kent as a storyteller.But I suspect and hope that the people who get the most out of this book are not thin white women like me. I hope this book reaches young Black women, fat women, baby queers stuck in southern states who need some reassurance that yes, you too can escape—even if it won’t be easy, and even if it might never truly be “over.” Kent’s too honest to make empty promises. As the final chapters attest, Kent is nowhere near done, nowhere near arrived; she has barely got started here. The hardship she has faced from multiple intersecting axes of oppression has neither evaporated nor, in many ways, has it ever let up. We need more memoirs like this, especially from Black women—not as educational aids for white women, mind you, but as the antithesis to that. This is a book designed to be seen and in turn make others feel seen. I really hope it can accomplish that.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Thrillers aren’t normally my genre of choice. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised by Ripley Jones’s debut novel. It was darker than I expected yet also has plenty of light character moments. Thanks to Wednesday Books and NetGalley for the eARC.Clarissa Campbell went missing in 1999. The cheerleading captain at Oreville High, Clarissa was in many ways a town darling. Yet even after nationwide coverage, no one turned up any trace of her—dead or alive. Now, over twenty years later, two students at Oreville High decide to make Clarissa the subject of their journalism project. Blair and Cameron start a true-crime podcast, Missing Clarissa. As you might expect, there are many in their small town that don’t want this mystery stirred up again. As Blair and Cameron dig deeper into Clarissa’s disappearance, they find that it’s one thing to talk about a mystery and another to actually solve it.As I intimated above, I wasn’t expecting to be so engrossed with the narrative. There’s something about how Jones crafted this mystery, however, that kept me engaged. I like how, even as the book dangles an obvious culprit in front of us, it’s also clear that we’re not expected to believe this person is the true culprit—we are led to expect a twist, which is indeed forthcoming in the final act. Honestly, the way that our intrepid podcasters uncover the true identity of Clarissa’s assailant, and the action-packed climax that follows, was the least interesting part of the book for me. It’s the journey to that moment that had me hooked, especially when Blair and Cameron are investigating their various leads.Jones’s writing reminds me of another Wednesday Books author, Courtney Summers. Missing Clarissa feels a little bit like Sadie, one of my favourite Summers novels. Both involve podcasts about missing girls whose fates are unknown. Both ruminate on how our society treats lost girls, how we romanticize them, how we give them more attention if they are white and pretty. Sadie is much darker than this book. However, Missing Clarissa still has its moments of asking hard questions about misogyny and patriarchy.This is apparent in how Blair and Cameron interact with the many male characters. Blair and Cameron are well aware of how their age and gender might lead most adults, particularly men, to underestimate them. At times they exploit this to their benefit; sometimes it is more of an impediment than anything else. Jones also explores how the power and privilege that many men accumulate—especially in a small town like Oreville—mean that they can avoid the consequences of their past actions, even if those actions might have landed someone else in jail. I also love the respective characterizations of Blair and Cameron, the way they play off each other as best friends and then also the romantic subplots each of them has. Blair’s delusions about her relationship are classic. Cameron’s obliviousness to Sophie’s interest in her is adorable. The way that the two of them support each other, even when they fight, makes for such a compelling duo—I would read more stories featuring these two. Jones writes with humour and empathy. Blair and Cameron are two very distinct personalities with sharply different voices, and it comes through. As a podcaster myself, I greatly enjoyed the running gag wherein other characters criticize the sound quality of their podcast!While it has many rough edges—especially in regards to how rushed the ending seems to be—Missing Clarissa is that rare thriller that held my attention. I literally didn’t want to stop reading it. This is high praise from me. I recommend it for fans of mysteries set in small towns, as well as people who want to read about intrepid girls setting out to investigate the disappearance of another girl. It’s not true crime—which, fortunately for us, means we get the closure inherent in the ending.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

IFour years ago, after a particularly brutal winter and some damage from ice dams, pigeons took up residence in a section of my house’s eavestroughs. It was unpleasant, to say the least. My bed abutted the exterior wall where they were roosting, and my house is small enough that I generally heard their cooing throughout a quiet Sunday indoors. Eventually, at great expense, I had my eavestroughs redone and the pigeons were summarily evicted. Pests, I thought to myself. That opinion hasn’t changed—however, as Bethany Brookshire makes clear in Pests: How Humans Create Animal Villains, it is important for us to understand how our relationship with animals has evolved over the centuries, and how we come to designate certain animals as pests and others as pets, exotic attractions, or whatnot. That includes my avian nemesis.Brookshire takes us through, one chapter at a time, different animals that are considered pests at some point and in some place in human history. From rats to elephants to our very own house cats, these animals don’t have much in common except for one thing: they live alongside humans, and they frustrate us just by being themselves. Our reactions are varied but usually along the lines of vilifying and then seeking to extirpate the problem. Alas, as Brookshire points out multiple times, it usually isn’t so simple. Most pests are not easily eradicated—we would need to change how we live to achieve that—and even when they are, maybe eradication isn’t the best option. In her interviews with various experts, many of whom often assume contradictory positions, Brookshire explores the nuanced ethics around pest control.It’s difficult for me to pick a favourite chapter. All of them are, in their own way, fascinating and edifying. The pigeon one stood out to me for my own personal experience with them as a pest. That chapter, in particular, really shows us how quickly society’s perception of an animal can shift: Brookshire explains how, up until the early twentieth century, pigeons were viewed in a very positive light. This historical lesson is valuable because it belies our perception, created by our short lifetimes, that our relationship with animals and nature as it is today is how it has always been.For similar reasons, I really liked the chapter about elephants. Brookshire takes aim at white conservationists who are essentially reinforcing a colonial attitude when they seek to preserve elephant populations at all costs. If you talk to the villagers who live alongside elephants every day, the situation quickly becomes more complicated. It’s hard for us white Westerners to view elephants as pests because our perception of them is so influenced by their portrayal in media. For me, as a Canadian, the closest I could liken them to would be moose—majestic creatures worth protecting, yet also incredibly dangerous in the wrong circumstances.I appreciate how much Brookshire, herself a white woman, deferred to Indigenous experts when learning about these creatures and our historical connections to them. Along the same lines, she seems to have gone out of her way to seek out and then faithfully present differing points of view. This was especially notable to me in the chapter on feral cats, where she interviews both proponents and opponents of the trap-neuter-return (TNR) approach to feral cat population control. At times, the back and forth way that she alternates between these people can get a bit confusing (so many names!). However, I respect the work that went into showing us so many sides of these issues instead of being simplistic or reductive. As a result, rather than emerging from that chapter feeling biased in favour of or against TNR, now I understand that it’s a complex issue—one that I would have to do more reading and thinking about before I fully made up my mind. But I certainly see now how different people in different parts of the world come to view the issue of indoor versus outdoor house cats so distinctly and often passionately!Pests is a story of animals, yet it is also a story about ourselves, humanity. How we have made ourselves a kind of pest in so many biomes, moving in and setting up shop and pushing out indigenous species, then bringing in our own invasive species, only to often turn around and yell at them for being too successful. Humanity is a host of contradictions. Brookshire’s compassionate, thoughtful, and informative look at how we relate to the species with which we coexist is a potent reminder that there are seldom simple answers when it comes to conservation, preservation, and urban development. If we are to be successful in managing the pests in our lives, we must come to terms with the fact that pest-management solutions will be different in different contexts. Sometimes that means population control, or changing how we store our garbage. Sometimes that means accepting that we don’t have complete control over our environment, no matter what we might desire.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

But that hasn’t always been the case until very recently—more recently, in fact, than one might think. Dennis Baron explores this in You Can't Always Say What You Want: The Paradox of Free Speech along with a robust look at free-speech debates, legal precedents, and issues in the context of American history and civil rights. I received an eARC from NetGalley and Cambridge University Press, and I was excited to dive into this because the topic feels so timely and important given the current political climate.Baron’s perspective is an interesting one: he is not a lawyer or law professor but rather a linguistics professor. Still, he knows his stuff. He has researched and written about free speech, and he has weighed in on court cases. You Can’t Always Say What You Want takes a historical but not quite chronological look at how the legal and social idea of freedom of speech has evolved in the United States. From the First versus Second Amendments to obscenity to what makes speech a threat, Baron guides us through the many quagmires that await anyone attempting to pin down what free speech actually means.Prior to reading this book I was not, and am still not, a free-speech absolutist. Probably the best way to summarize my position is to say that I believe speech should have commensurate consequence. I think most free-speech absolutists are earnest but mistaken—that is, I don’t think there is a position of free-speech absolutism that is consistent with a stable, functioning liberal democracy. Beyond that, many who claim to believe in absolute free speech do so from a position of rhetorical dishonesty—invoking freedom of speech when, in actuality, they want to suppress the speech of their political and ideological opponents. In this way, free-speech absolutism becomes a form of camouflage.Baron takes aim at both aspects of free-speech absolutism in this book. I spent a good deal of time reading it trying to infer his personal politics—when I first saw this title offered on NetGalley, I briefly worried it would be about cancel culture, etc., before I read the description and realized it was far more interesting than that. I get the sense that Baron and I agree on a lot of points, and where we might be in disagreement, it’s largely because (a) he knows more about this than I do and (b) he’s being a lot more diplomatic than I might. Baron is no fan of current interpretation of the Second Amendment, yet he also has criticism for liberal attempts to curtail free speech in the name of preventing, say, hate speech. Nevertheless, I suspect that conservative readers will see Baron as a woke ideologue, which says a lot more about how far right most American conservatives have been pulled in the past decade than it does about Baron’s alignment.My main takeaway from this book is that very few of us really have a coherent concept of what we mean by free speech. The value of You Can’t Always Say What You Want is its grounding in primary source material. For the most part, this is not a polemic by Baron but a very well-researched tour through the United States Constitution, Supreme Court rulings, and other evidence. Baron explains how popular ideas of free speech depart from the actual text of the First Amendment. He helps us understand that amendment (and the Second Amendment) in historical context, as well as how the courts’ interpretations of the Constitution have changed over the years in things like obscenity trials and charges of sedition. Additionally, Baron emphasizes the ultimate futility of trying to codify free speech in something so brief as the First Amendment: language is imprecise, and the Founding Fathers themselves debated exactly how to phrase the amendment.My main criticism of this book is that Baron’s writing is not always engaging. He repeats himself, both within and across chapters. In particular he really harps on the idea that freedom to bear arms suppresses freedom of speech for some groups—and hey, I don’t disagree, but the way this theme recurs throughout the book felt redundant rather than emphatic. He quotes at length from the primary sources I just extolled. Though still reasonably accessible for an academic work, I think the layperson will need to take their time walking through this one.It’s worth it though. Our society’s idea of freedom of speech has always and will always evolve as our society evolves. At the moment, it feels like we are moving somewhat backwards, and that scares me. But this book didn’t scare me. It reassured me in the way that any knowledge reassures me—I went into this book with a certain idea of free speech, trusting Baron to challenge me. He did that, and while my position hasn’t changed dramatically, I feel much more informed about the topic, and I can recognize now where my thinking previously lacked depth or foundation. The debate about free speech is far from over, but I personally feel like I understand it better as a result of reading this book.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Similarly, as much as I love a good action-packed epic, slow stories have their own unique virtues. Close Your Eyes: A Fairy Tale is such a slow story about stories—and in particular, how the stories we tell about ourselves and one another shape our choices in life. Chris Tomasini uses the backdrop of fifteenth-century Europe and crafts a small, memorable cast of characters. I enjoyed the time I spent in this world and mostly enjoyed the story even though its coda confers sour notes, for me, to its themes. Disclosure: The author provided me with a  copy.More a frame story for a series of vignettes, Close Your Eyes bounces around the first decades of the fifteenth century. Europe is at war. (OK, when isn’t Europe at war?) After decades of papal schism, there’s a new ecclesiastical sheriff in town. And in a small, fictional kingdom named Gora, its heartbroken widower monarch wanders the halls of his castle. Our narrator, Samuel, is a little person and a court jester. He writes to us about his former companions at the castle, including a storyteller named Tycho and a cook named Agnieszka. Samuel laments his own lack of literary ability, but he is determined to muddle through to do justice to the events he wants to share. As Samuel bounces from story to story, he seems to be searching for meaning, trying to understand not only why Tycho left Gora but how he himself can move on in the face of all the change he has endured in recent years.Don’t expect a ton of action or even dialogue here—the book is strictly epistolary, mostly description, yet this works well with the story structure and conceits. Tomasini’s primary challenge is conveying as much of the wider world of Gora/Europe in the 1430s as he can given the limitations of Samuel’s own knowledge. Samuel’s ignorance is useful at times, for it helps Tomasini restrict the reader’s field of vision in interesting and narratively significant ways; at other times, it can be a hindrance. That’s no doubt why Samuel includes excerpts from Tycho’s journals, along with letters from the disgraced bishop dispatched to Gora by Pope Martin V. Through these different perspectives, mediated by Samuel’s curatorial presence always lingering over our shoulder, we start to see what’s going on.This is predominantly a story about the way that love and grief are intertwined. As one loses one’s loves, grief solidifies from an abstraction to a constant companion. King Pawel is, of course, the most overt example in this book, but we see it reflected in other characters as well. Each of the chapters of Close Your Eyes meditates, in some way, on how we love, why we love, or what we might do for love.For the most part, I enjoyed Samuel’s stories. The foolishness of Beauvais. The rambunctious flirtatiousness of Tycho. The confident faithfulness of Agnieszka. Tomasini’s characters are just a tiny bit larger than life in a way that makes them leap off the page, keeping things interesting in spite of the constraints of the epistolary form. Close Your Eyes is an easy book to read.Alas, I didn’t like the ending—or to be specific, the epilogue. Let’s see if I can talk about it without getting into spoiler territory.Samuel’s final part of his epilogue is a meditation on his own loneliness and lack of romantic or sexual connection, contrasted by Tycho’s almost farcical prowess in the bedroom and Agnieszka’s successful, apparently happy marriage. He declares, “I can still write that I have never known love in my own life, only its absence.” I think he’s wrong.In the same section, Samuel recoils from the idea that Princess Alexandra might be doomed to a similar fate, that her unrequited love for another might result in her unwittingly following in Samuel’s footsteps. He says, “surely the pains of unrequited love are preferable to the hollow ache of a chest void of any emotion at all.”I think it’s very apparent from the pages that precede this epilogue that Samuel’s life has been steeped in love, and from what he utters after those words, he will continue to be surrounded by love into the old age he imagines for himself. That his love isn’t the romantic, all-consuming fire of the tales he has been raised on is irrelevant—it’s still love. For the book to end on such a trite and arophobic idea that a life without romantic love is lesser is very disappointing. It’s also so avoidable—seriously, had I stopped reading prior to this very last section, I would have finished the book thinking, “Well, that’s a tidy and sensible ending.”So in that sense, the book in its final moments let me down. Nevertheless, Close Your Eyes is lovingly crafted, clever, cozy. I enjoyed the afternoons I spent with it and would read more from Tomasini.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I came across Tread of Angels at my library and was excited to see a new title from Rebecca Roanhorse. I love the premise and love that it is a mystery and, in some ways, a tragedy. In other words, this was a perfect distraction for a day.Celeste is half Fallen, meaning she is descended from those who rebelled against Heaven back in the day. Thanks to her Elect father’s blood, however, she can pass as Elect. Her sister, Mariel, is not so lucky. Both of them live in Goetia, a town booming because of its proximity to the corpse of the fallen Abaddon, who decays into a resource called Divinity. When Mariel is accused of murder, Celeste takes it upon herself to defend her sister from the discriminatory prosecution of the Virtues. However, as she begins a hasty investigation into what went down, she finds her entire worldview upended. At the same time, she is forced to accept help from an old flame who tempts her beyond redemption.I get some serious Lucifer vibes from this book. I do love me a reimagining of Christian mythology, and this one is more imaginative than most. This doesn’t surprise me, given what Roanhorse has done with Diné as well as Mexica mythologies. She is supremely skilled at adapting entire cosmogonies into new creation myths, and that’s what we are seeing here. Since this is a novella, of course, the actual worldbuilding is slimmer than you would get in a full novel (yet still deliciously richer than a mere short story would provide). Roanhorse wisely sticks closely to the narrative at hand, though I suspect many readers, like myself, will lament that this raises more questions about this world than it answers.The actual mystery, and in particular its resolution, reminds me a little bit of The Peacekeeper, written by another Indigenous author. In both cases, the protagonist must be confronted with the prospect that their axioms are flawed, that people are far more complicated—and treacherous—than they initially wanted to believe. Roanhorse, much like B.L. Blanchard, is unflinching in her ability to put her protagonist through the wringer in this way.I adored the simplicity of this narrative. I would love to see it as a miniseries, for example, because it is so self-contained yet supremely saturated. As Celeste plays detective, we meet any number of colourful characters who reflect her back at herself, forcing her to examine her passing privilege, to question what she really knows, and pushing herself past her own limits. The way that even Abraxas—a literal soul-taking demon—eventually throws up his hands at her and says, “I think you are going too far” is a clever and moving way to emphasize when Celeste hits her nadir.Tread of Angels is a fast-paced, noir, tragic meditation on how far we will go for our blood, the price that might exact on us and the people who love us, and what it means to win at all costs. It was lovely to see Roanhorse flex her muscles in yet another fantastical world, and I am excited to see what she comes up with next.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Nevertheless, I was drawn to Sounds Fake But Okay: An Asexual and Aromantic Perspective on Love, Relationships, Sex, and Pretty Much Anything Else because, hey, asexual and aromantic over here! It feels very fitting that I’m writing this  at the end of Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week. Thanks to Jessica Kingsley Publishers and NetGalley for the eARC.This book explores asexuality and aromanticism (which Costello and Kaszyca often refer to under the united umbrella of aspec, not to be confused with the asexual- or aromantic-specific terms ace-spec and aro-spec) by discussing how these identities relate to specific topics in our society. This is a slightly different and perhaps refreshing approach, finding a middle ground between books that take an “Asexuality 101” stance and more academic work like the fantastic Refusing Compulsory Sexuality. It’s definitely accessible, humorous, and empathetic.The chapters are divided very logically: “Society,” “Yourself,” “Friendship,” etc. Costello and Kaszyca share a lot of their own personal journey with their sexual and romantic identities. Costello is aroace, while Kaszyca is demisexual, so they each bring slightly different perspectives to being aspec, which I think is valuable. As the book progresses, they start to bring in quotations from a survey of other aspec people. This adds other voices as we hear from genderqueer aspec people, alloromantic asexuals, aromantic allosexuals, etc. The goal is very obviously to showcase the incredible diversity of the asexual and aromantic umbrellas within the wider tent that is being queer, and I love that.On that note: this is a masterclass in how to write in an inclusive, expansive way. Many writers, both queer writers themselves and those who write about us, often lament how “difficult” it is not to “offend” or inadvertently exclude people with their language. They point to artificially constructed examples of tortuous, often circuitous sentences supposedly designed to avoid such offence and exclusion. Kaszyca and Costello bypass such malarkey. They acknowledge that labels can be challenging, that terms change, that the split-attraction model isn’t for everyone, etc. Then they thread the needle to get to the point, which is that aro and ace identities are united by the fact that all of us on those spectra, to one extent or another, experience romantic or sexual attraction in a qualitatively different way from other people. That is the basic truth to which they speak in this book. The additional voices included throughout allow them to refine the message to speak to more specific experiences as needed.What I loved most about Sounds Fake But Okay is how it simultaneously resonated with so many of my own experiences while also showing me many different ones. I’m an aromantic, asexual woman—but I am also trans, and having transitioned in my thirties, I spent most of my formative youth under the impression I was a man. So while I heavily identify with Costello and the other female aroaces quoted herein, I didn’t quite share some of their experiences of compulsory sexuality and how that is linked to the madonna/whore paradox of our society. Likewise, in their chapter on gender, they discuss how the proportion of aspec people who are trans is higher than aspec people who are cis. Then we hear from a trans person who identified as ace when they responded to the survey but has since settled on the label of bisexual—because her experience of transition has changed how she experiences and understands attraction. Many people have asked me, as I have transitioned, whether I might not identify as ace anymore—so much so that I actually wrote a whole blog post about this for Ace Awareness Week—and while my answer was in the negative, I totally understand how it’s different for some people.Consequently, Kaszyca and Costello have managed to collate commentary that does a very good job of helping us understand the remarkable diversity of aspec experiences. I love it. I love how sensitively they unpack and critique the amatonormative nature of our society; while a lot of what they discussed in these parts of the book was not new to me, it is an essential part of this wider conversation. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to see other topics included, like a section near the end about kink and asexuality. In short, Sounds Fake But Okay is a careful, thoughtful work that seeks to go beyond its authors’ own experiences and ideas of being aspec.Though this book will be, I think, most fulfilling for aspec readers, I would recommend this to people who are not aspec as well. This book is probably the most concise exploration of the greatest number of topics related to being asexual or aromantic in our society. For any allosexual and alloromantic folx out there, reading this book would be a great way to educate yourself about some of the challenges that we aspec people have navigating a society that privileges romance above other relationships and pressures us to talk about and even engage in sex that we might not want. As its tongue-in-cheek title implies, Sounds Fake But Okay is about challenging our biases so that we can build a society that is more tolerant, affirming, and compassionate, regardless of the extent or ways in which one feels attracted to others.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

How to Overcome Your Doubts and Find Your Authentic Self,"Johnston, Alo",1839975342,9781839975349,,224        pp,4.59,159,unknown,"Feb 01, 2023",really liked it,1 of 5 stars2 of 5 stars3 of 5 stars4 of 5 stars5 of 5 starsadd to shelves,"You know, I don’t really think I ever asked myself this question after the one sleepless Sunday night I spent wrestling with it. I jest, of course. KiYou know, I don’t really think I ever asked myself this question after the one sleepless Sunday night I spent wrestling with it. I jest, of course. Kind of. I think for me my understanding of my transness was sneaky. It kind of grew in my subconscious for years until it burst forth, fully formed, and once I accepted it, everything else happened all at once. Nevertheless, Am I Trans Enough: How to Overcome Your Doubts and Find Your Authentic Self still had some cool insights for me, and I suspect the research, ideas, and questions Alo Johnston has brought together in this book will be helpful for many a trans or questioning person. Thanks to Jessica Kingsley Publishers and NetGalley for the eARC.This is a surprisingly comprehensive book! I say surprisingly because I wasn’t sure it was possible to pull off a feat like this until Johnston did it. Am I Trans Enough? comprises four parts: “The Personal and Philosophy,” “Context and History,” “Mental Health,” and “Interpersonal.” You know how much I love good organization, and this book has that down: each one of these parts is necessary and thoughtful in the exploration of this topic. Johnston begins by asking the reader, who presumably might be questioning their gender identity, to consider how we think of gender in relation to ourselves. From there, he branches into the wider idea of gender as a social construct. Next, a crucial discussion of how gender nonconformity and transition can affect one’s mental health, especially given the transphobic state of our society. Finally, a part that discusses what transition and coming out means for your relationships with others.One of the things I love most about this book is how it doesn’t focus much on medical transition. Of course Johnstone mentions both hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery throughout the book. However, these are always in service of a wider discussion of transition that firmly grounds it in a social context. This is valuable, in my opinion, for three reasons. First, it discourages what’s known as transmedicalization, this idea that you are only “trans enough” if you pursue a certain level of medical transition. Second, it pushes back against the cisnormative narrative that always focuses on medical transition when we talk about trans people. Third, it reminds us that gender-affirming medical care is only one piece of the puzzle. Yes, it is essential for many trans people—including me!—but when we look to hormones or the like as a panacea for all of our mental health issues or questions about gender, we’re setting ourselves up for disappointment.Along these lines, probably my favourite chapter is “The Paradox of Transition.” In it, Johnston reflects on how most trans people would love to say that we are only transitioning for ourselves, but the reality is much more complicated. I feel this, oof. I’m approaching my third anniversary of coming out as trans and pondering what I want to write about to mark the occasion. Though I don’t question whether I am trans enough, I still struggle to explain sometimes why I went from (as an external observer might see it) being comfortable calling myself cis for thirty years to deciding to transition overnight. It is, of course, more complicated than that, and this is what Johnston gets at in this chapter. I love how he discusses how the pandemic belied the popular desire among many transitioning people to go off and transition on a desert island—I have blogged about that as well.In particular, this paragraph stands out for me:The fantasy of complete self-reliance also assumes there is a “true gender” deep down, past the reach of our interactions and relationships. There is no objective, pure, internal self that exists outside of the relationships that form us and help us thrive. We are relational, and our genders are relational too.Louder for the people at the back, please!This is what I have tried to articulate time and again, on my personal blog and in discussions with others about my transition. The piece of the puzzle that burst the dam I had subconsciously built around my gender identity was the realization that I didn’t want to be “one of the girls” in an honourary sense; I wanted to be one of the girls. This flip of a switch from metaphorical to literal was all it took for my resistance to being trans to crumble—seemingly overnight, as I said earlier—because, as Johnston puts it so well in that quote, it’s all about relations. It’s why I needed to socially transition rather than just start wearing cute dresses while still calling myself a man; it’s why the cute dresses make me feel good about myself even though I am a woman regardless of what I wear.In terms of knowledge levels, this book eschews quite a bit of the standard “trans 101” that you might find in similar texts. However, it remains accessible to someone who hasn’t read a lot of books about being transgender. Some later chapters discuss, respectively, the experience of being nonbinary, a trans woman, or a trans man, and I think a lot of people who are much newer to the language and concepts around transness will benefit from those chapters especially.Of course, even though this framing includes nonbinary people loudly and on the same footing as transfeminine and transmasculine people, it’s still somewhat problematic in the way it kind of creates what I call the “bumpy gender binary,” where nonbinary becomes an “other” category outside of a trans experience that otherwise replicates and reinforces the binary. Johnston acknowledges early in the book that his perspective is a limited, Western one. So it’s important to seek out voices that write about nonbinary experiences outside of that sphere—this publisher has such an anthology, and there are others out there. This is not a critique of Am I Trans Enough? so much as an observation of a limitation it has already acknowledged.What about readers who are pretty certain they are cis? Am I Trans Enough? might still be a beneficial read. You are not Johnston’s intended audience, but you would still learn a lot about how to look at and explore gender. Even if you are confident you are cisgender, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend time examining what that means for you. However, there are probably other books out there that will do a better job of guiding you on that journey, just as there are probably better books to learn about trans experiences, ones that are speaking to an audience that includes cis people.This is a book firmly written for trans people, by a trans author who is also a therapist, grounded firmly in theory and praxis. It gets you thinking. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone who comes to me expressing questions about their gender.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Such is the case with Cody Daigle-OriansEven though I don’t have TikTok, some of the best content always escapes that platform to find its way to me. Such is the case with Cody Daigle-Orians, purveyor of Ace Dad Advice. I remember watching some of his videos and thinking exactly some of the sentiments he shares later in I Am Ace: Advice on Living Your Best Asexual Life, such as “it’s so nice to see an elder ace!” Lol, we’re so predictable. But it’s also true. Ace people aren’t visible enough. That’s changing, slowly, and it’s good to see someone like Daigle-Orians helping to make that happen. My thanks to Jessica Kingsley Publishers and NetGalley for the eARC.Although there’s a fair amount of “asexual 101” in this book—and that’s fine—what I value most about this book is exactly what the subtitle promises: the advice. This is a book grounded in Daigle-Orians’ lived experience: that of someone who came out as gay, then came out again as ace after discovering what that was, then started talking about it online and realized he could contribute to the conversation. As he shares his story, he offers advice, yes, but also reassurance.Some of the advice is very quotable, such as when Daigle-Orians reminds us that “labels are tools not tests.” This is such an important idea to internalize, regardless of how one describes one’s identity. Daigle-Orians returns to this touchstone time and again, from an exploration of microlabels to a primer on the history and theory behind the label queer.Much of their journey is very relatable. They discovered the asexuality label on Tumblr. Some people dismiss asexuality as being “Tumblr real,” so I suppose this makes Daigle-Orians somewhat of a stereotype, but there’s a reason it’s a stereotype. Though Tumblr, like TikTok, has largely remained outside my purview, I love how it creates these spaces where queer people can talk, lurk, and just exist, often outside of a cishet gaze. The emotions that Daigle-Orians describes as they navigate the discovery of their aceness—relief, trepidation, excitement, etc.—are going to be familiar to aces even if they came to their sexuality in a very different way. While I came to mine younger than Daigle-Orians and single, I feel like we still have a lot in common. It was really cool to hear them talk about how they had never been to a pride event until recently, for that was true of me as well (and in many ways still is).Similarly, it’s so lovely to hear about his experiences as part of a polycule. I love seeing alternatives to our stereotypical ideas of what a family should be. The way that Daigle-Orians discusses his family, his challenges with dating while ace, the closeness he feels even to those members of his polycule with whom he isn’t in a sexual or romantic relationship—that’s neat. It’s wholesome, even.Some of the advice and perspective here might be hard to read the first time round. At one point, Daigle-Orians levels with us: being ace is not always easy. Boy is that ever true. I really appreciate that he doesn’t sugarcoat his experiences. Sometimes I swing between these two extremes of thinking “oh man, I’m so glad I’m asexual,” versus, “sometimes it feels like it would be easier if I were ace.” Daigle-Orians addresses the sentiment that some people don’t want to be ace empathetically but sincerely: you are who you are. You can deny that experience, compounding your unhappiness, or embrace going on a journey to discover what that experience means for you. Being ace isn’t the best thing ever, nor does it doom you to unhappiness. It’s just an identity like any other.Highly recommend for anyone who wants to spend some time listening to that elder ace’s perspective while you meditate on what being ace might mean for you. For allosexual readers: while this book cannot obviously capture everything about being ace, Daigle-Orians does their best to articulate one version of asexuality, acknowledging the limitations of this perspective by dint of being an older, white, male-presenting person. You’ll still get an interesting window into what it’s like being ace in a world that vacillates between denying we exist and telling us we’re broken.The overarching theme of I Am Ace is that your asexuality does not need to define you, but it can inform you. If you let it, your asexuality can help you feel more comfortable in who you are—whether you’re cis or trans, younger or older, etc. When we realize that our behaviour is not the same as our attraction, that neither of these are destiny, that we can question and change how we identify throughout our life and build, as a result, a happier life—that’s powerful.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I don’t particularly like this fact, but I would be a fool not to acknowledge it. For the majority of my life, money has been more digital than paper-based, even though a fully qualified digital currency in Canadian or US dollars still has yet to materialize. I have never owned a paper chequebook in my name, and almost all of my payments are online or through a chip-and-pin debit card. So I was very curious to learn more about the potential security issues around e-commerce and digital transactions in The Unhackable Internet. Thomas P. Vartanian brings decades of experience in the finance world and the law to chart out some of the biggest dangers along with possible solutions. NetGalley and publisher Rowan and Littlefield provided me with an eARC in exchange for a .Vartanian’s thesis is simple: the internet as it is currently configured is ferociously insecure to the point where it would be extremely easy for a bad actor to compromise vital infrastructure or threaten the integrity of the global economy. He offers up numerous historical examples of cybersecurity incidents. The same week I was reading this, Indigo—Canada’s largest retail bookseller—was hacked, forcing it to pull its website offline and suspend non-cash transactions at its stores. I bet that cost them billions. What happens when it’s a bank, a hospital, the electrical grid? Vartanian’s solution is elegant: scrapping the internet and starting from scratch is not feasible, but we should be able to graft more secure, isolated networks to the existing internet. Safe bubbles, if you will, where access from the overall internet is tightly controlled, and identity and authorization within the bubble is paramount.I don’t actually disagree with Vartanian’s analysis. As I noted above, this has become commonplace. Vartanian criticizes the average consumer’s apathy towards security breaches, which might rankle some readers, but he’s just trying to make a point that our apathy engenders complacency among these corporations. It’s clear that Vartanian is a much firmer believer in, say, capitalism and the free market, than I am, yet even he’s advocating for the government to step in and regulate and centralize some of this decision-making.Vartanian is quite hawkish towards China. Pretty much every warning he delivers in this book is framed in terms of China doing something awful, either towards its own people or towards democratic countries like the US. Don’t get me wrong—China is not a paragon of a place, especially considering its treatment of minority groups like the Uyghurs. I’m not here to defend China. However, I’m also not a fan of sinophobic rhetoric that positions China as an economic, military, or political bogeyman simply to justify enhanced security. Moreover, although Vartanian is highly critical of the United States’ inaction on cybersecurity, he hasn’t quite extended that critical analysis to this idea that the US is a democracy or that it is “the greatest nation on Earth” (at least aspirationally, if not in practice). That is to say, I disagree with Vartanian’s implicit goal to preserve the US as the supreme superpower of the world. Still, I don’t think this hegemonic perspective is all that surprising given his background or even just the description of the book, so I think most readers who choose to pick up this title will either be more sympathetic to these views than me or will at least understand what to expect.Beyond these differences in ideology, my criticism of the book is more about the structure and depth than style or substance. The middle part of the book is a lengthy history of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries through the lens of networking, finance, and cybersecurity. It’s useful, yes—I learned stuff I definitely didn’t know—but it’s also very drawn out and dry. I wonder if a more robust approach, with this timeline condensed into another appendix, might have made things more interesting.On a similar note, Vartanian’s explanations for the internet’s physical infrastructure and cybersecurity in general tend to meander between levels of audience. Some of the explanations are so basic I think he’s talking to people with rudimentary understanding of what a computer is at best; other explanations are so high level that I struggle to understand them. My guess would be that the book wants to cater to a variety of audience levels of knowledge about networking. That’s fine in theory, but in practice it made the book feel very uneven for me.So do I recommend the book? Sure. If you are interested in finances, cybersecurity, networking, etc., this is a thoughtful and very knowledgeable analysis. Vartanian knows what he’s talking about, is a confident writer, and delivers interesting arguments. Even when you disagree, you’re going to come away having learned a lot. Just don’t expect something revolutionary.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Love Is the Drug is just shy of ten years old now, although thanks to its pandemic storyline it feels perhaps even more topical than it did when Alayna Dawn Johnson wrote it. A YA thriller that mixes Washington, DC, privilege with misogynoir, this novel has a lot of individual elements to recommend it, yet for me it never quite came together as an enjoyable whole.Emily Bird has it all. She’s with the in crowd at her private school, has the perfect boyfriend, seems to be going places. But something goes down at a party one night—she gets drugged, or something, hits her head, memory absent—and shortly thereafter, a flu sweeps the world and Washington, DC, goes into lockdown. Emily—or Bird, as she increasingly starts to think of herself thanks to the influence of some rebellious spirits like Coffee—is determined to understand more about that fateful night, even if it means antagonizing a private-security spook with CIA connections. Bird isn’t sure who she is anymore—but she is done being a good girl.Shortly after starting this book, I was beginning to wonder if it would be my first “bad” book of 2023. My reading so far this year has been off to a fantastic start! Love Is the Drug just didn’t grab me. It took me a while, however, to really wrap my head around why that was the case. It’s a less recent book, sure, but there are plenty of 2014 YA releases that still feel relevant to me today. Eventually, I settled on the intersection of setting and character. To be more specific: Bird’s high school experience just feels entirely too bland and familiar. The opening scene at the party felt like the same kind of teenage party scene I had read so many times. Sure, it was a little different because Bird and her peers are mostly rich kids going to one of the most elite schools in the country. Aside from that, however, the setting and the various minor characters who populate it just didn’t feel fresh to me. Paul, Bird’s overbearing sleazeball of a boyfriend, felt like every cluelessly opportunistic young boyfriend I’ve read before. I was having so much trouble finding something about the book to cling on to and enjoy.This feeling continued for most of the first half of the book. Maybe I should have given up on it. I think mainly what kept me going was the pandemic: I was so interested to see how that worked out given its eerie prescience here in our post-COVID world. So I kept reading.And damn it if Johnson didn’t mostly change my mind!Somehow the second half of this book nearly completely turned my opinion around. I think when Bird drops the baggage of her old self, commits to being friends with Marella, decides she’s going to do whatever it takes to bring Roosevelt down—I was like, finally. Let’s do it! The book kicks into a higher gear, and the result is a much more satisfying read.I’m happy about this because there is plenty to like about this book. Johnson is making some very salient commentary on life as a Black girl in the upper echelons. Bird’s parents, particularly her mother, have a very clear idea of who she is supposed to be: relaxed hair, always polite, going to make a name for herself. We see how Bird’s mother has really bought hard into things like respectability politics, and when Bird dares to express a desire to rebel even a little bit, her mother loses all perspective. Yet her mother isn’t a villain, isn’t a bad person per se—she genuinely believes that her very conservative ideas, that blending in, is necessary for Bird’s survival. Her mother understands the harm of misogynoir in America, and her reaction is to try to fit in more rather than stand out and stand up against it. In this way, Johnson chronicles how different generations of Black families deal with the intergenerational trauma of anti-Black racism differently, and it’s fascinating.The pandemic content is also, of course, deeply interesting in our current context. Johnson in many ways anticipates how the country would respond to a pandemic respiratory virus: masks, lockdowns and quarantines, the rush for a vaccine. I can only imagine how readers prior to 2020 might have panned the portrayal as unrealistic, but I don’t think anyone who reads the book now can do anything except shake their head at how optimistic, if anything, Johnson was regarding the swiftness and absoluteness of the US government’s public health procedures.You might notice, if you have read the book, that I’ve said relatively little about the romance between Bird and Coffee. I don’t know that I have much to say, for it’s yet another one of those aspects that just didn’t feel original. I feel terrible saying that because I’m really trying hard not to slate this author. The intensity of feeling that develops is, at times, a very rewarding experience for the reader. But the overall subplot just never feels like it goes anywhere interesting or gets all that exciting.Love Is the Drug is a book with great intentions that just never quite settles into itself. It has all the ingredients for a great thriller, yet it doesn’t turn into a filling meal. While I don’t want to give the impression it’s awful, I also don’t recommend it, not even for the experience of reading about a pandemic set in such temporal proximity to our own. When I return to this  ten years from now, this is not a book that I will remember.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Or in the case of Babel: An Arcane History, stories about language. The power of words. Writers are so meta sometimes, eh. In this alternative history, R.F. Kuang confronts the very real-life history of British colonialism and imperialism and asks us to consider how our relationship with language affects our willingness to participate in—and perhaps even incite—systemic change.Newly orphaned Robin is plucked from Canton, China, by Professor Lovell of the Royal Institute of Translation, also known as Babel. For years, Robin studies under Lovell, first privately as his ward and then as a student at Babel. He is one of four translators in his year cohort—two others, Ramy and Victoire, are similarly racialized, imported for their facility with language or languages, while the other, Lettie, is a white woman determined to buck the trend that says women neither need nor desire an education. But all is not right at Babel. Robin quickly finds himself in the middle of, shall we say, shenanigans most dark. His loyalties divided, Robin must decide what role he wants to play in this system. Does he want to be a collaborator? A dissident? A rebel leader? A fugitive? A martyr? Or something else entirely?So I’m reading this book, and quite honestly by about page twelve I realized that Kuang is both smarter and better read than me, and I’m here for it. Like we’re talking some Umberto Eco–level shit. Kuang’s writing here will run circles around most readers, which some will find intimidating, but if instead you’re willing to set aside your ego and soak up the majesty of the moment, you will not only learn but be entertained. For Babel is a book perched on a pinhead: sprawling and epic in some ways; powerfully precise in others.Let’s ease into the discussion by talking about the magic, for it’s probably the least interesting or important part of the story, and that’s saying something. In Babel, you can engrave words from different languages that are connected in some way into silver bars. When you speak these “language pairs” out loud, the bar activates some kind of magical effect—for example, some pairs can create invisibility; others might help make a garden more serene. One can only activate a bar if one understands the languages used on it, for the actual magic needs human understanding to close the circuit. Hence Robin’s utility as a Mandarin speaker. The British are preeminent in the field of translation and silver-working, but they are running out of pairs to mine from European languages, so they have cast themselves further afield but need minds that understand these increasingly foreign (to them) tongues.The magic system is neat, a nice twist on the eternal quest to seek a balance between rigidly systematic spellwork schemes versus visualize-it-and-it’s-done willpower schemes. This system requires both the rigorous academic knowledge acquired only through years of study, as we see Robin and his peers embark on, along with the kind of understanding and mental awareness that goes deeper than mere scholarship. Its exclusivity, lack so many magical systems, creates a power dynamic that Kuang slots neatly into the existing class system of nineteenth-century Britain.Which brings us to the politics of Babel. Holy shit. I was expecting the trenchant analysis of colonialism but I wasn’t quite prepared for the intense focus on labour (more fool me)—that hit me harder than I anticipated given the current political situation in Ontario and my own involvement in unionism. (It is, of course, all connected, as Kuang seeks to demonstrate.)There’s more to be analyzed here than I can manage in a simple  (I hereby summon the literature undergrads to pick apart this book in a thousand essays). Suffice it to say, Babel is a hot mess—intentionally so. The main theme is simple: revolution is messy, and dismantling the intersecting structures of colonialism, white supremacy, capitalism, etc., are not without compromise. We see this most acutely in how each character wrestles with the consequences, both real and potential, of decolonization. How, even for oppressed people in the system, there are conveniences and perks that maybe we aren’t willing to give up. This felt so real to me, because it’s something I see in a lot of my white colleagues when I start talking about antiracism work—and if I am being honest, it is of course something I feel within myself, as a white woman. Changing this system—truly dismantling it and building something better—will be uncomfortable because it does mean giving up some of the things we currently enjoy, either because they are part of the package of privilege bound up in our whiteness or the end result of unsustainable, extractive processes that are both dehumanizing and degrading.So Babel is a masterclass in depicting how colonial structures persist only because of compliance of the masses. Sometimes this compliance is forced or coerced, as in the case of enslavement; other times it is cajoled. For people whose marginalization exists outside of racial and ethnic axes, our compliance is usually purchased through irresistible convenience. There is a climactic moment in the story—resolved, actually, in a footnote, because that is how Kuang rolls—where Robin’s actions indirectly lead to a dramatic incident that kills people and destroys an important London landmark. And … no one cares. Or rather, people implicitly decide that maintaining the structure of society as it exists requires the sacrifice of some people’s humanity and dignity. Kuang pointedly comments on this through several characters, and it resonates given what’s happening right now in Ontario, as municipalities like Toronto simply refuse to open warming centers for unhoused people, or in the US, as various state legislatures compete to see who can most creatively precipitate trans genocide.We keep underestimating the depths of cognitive dissonance we are willing to practise, as a society, to uphold the existing structure rather than risk discomfort and chaos.Robin and his peers have different views on this fact and what their role should be in revolution. While the three racialized characters agree the system is bad and should be dismantled, none of them agree exactly on what that process should look like. Lettie, meanwhile, very much acts as a stand-in for white feminism, and I am here for it. Kuang’s desire to present revolutionary activities as nuanced not only mirrors myriad examples from history but helps the reader conceptualize the difficult truth: that movements are not monoliths, that some people who say they are allies balk when that means following up with acting as allies (and accomplices), that there is always an unyielding pressure to surrender to the inertia that is “that’s just the way it is.”Kuang’s willingness to explore the messiness of revolutionary politics is what makes Babel such a standout work. The revolution, when it comes for us, will not be neat or orderly—indeed, it probably won’t even be a single, discrete revolution. I don’t think it’s a spoiler to say that, by the end of the book, Robin and his allies haven’t toppled the British Empire. At the same time, the empire is irrevocably changed as a result of their actions. And their revolution, Kuang very explicitly points out, was more successful as a result of the gains won from previous revolutions, strike actions, revolts, etc.—a single act cannot unmake a system, but consistent pressure over an era can erode it to the point of collapse. So although in terms of our characters’ journeys, without spoiling much, this book might be deemed a tragedy, Babel seems to be a relentlessly optimistic story.The characters—and more specifically, their relationships with each other—might be the weak point of the book for me. Robin is decent as a viewpoint protagonist; I often had to take a step back and remind myself that I’m seeing the story from a wider angle than him and have the benefit of a twenty-first–century perspective on colonialism that he fundamentally lacks by dint of being in the thick of it. But Robin was also a little … I don’t know, boring? I found myself a lot more interested in the internal lives of Ramy, Victoire, and even Lettie. Aside from occasional interludes told from the perspective of each of them, Kuang keeps the book firmly focused on Robin, for better or worse.And Robin just … kind of exists, his relationships attenuating and then springing back to tautness like an elastic. He and Ramy have this initial spark of attraction that I thought was going to become so much more. His relationship with Lovell is marred by the latter’s one dimensionality as an antagonist. Similarly, I never saw him truly connecting with Griffin or his other revolutionary comrades. So while I could feel Robin’s angst, especially as he wrestled with his sense of guilt over his class privilege, I never quite felt that connect to the struggles of the characters around him.Nevertheless, even if some of the characters strike me as one dimensional or otherwise unsatisfying, I think Kuang overall has put a lot of thought into what she is trying to say with each character, and that’s valuable. As I mentioned at the top of this , her intelligence and the breadth of her knowledge is apparent on every page—but it is most apparent, I think, in how each of the main characters connects to their personal backgrounds, cultures, and histories. The way that Kuang weaves in allusions to English literature, Haitian politics, or the repression of Punjabi people under British rule in India … seriously. This is no shallowly researched yarn spun for entertainment. I can only imagine the binders, real or virtual, of notes that gird this manuscript, which itself is a hefty thing.I pitched Babel to someone on Twitter (a linguist) as “Neal Stephenson but without all the squick of ponderous white male privilege,” and I stand by this comparison. This is a novel that overstays its welcome deliberately and without apology. It demands your attention and your thoughtfulness. Yet unlike many other researched and dense books that do this, Babel carefully balances its heavy themes with plot and characters that remain entertaining and fun and, yeah, heartbreaking. Kuang’s writing flits from being bold and brash to quiet and understated. While I don’t think everything she attempts in this book works, longtime readers of my s know that I much prefer big swings, even when they don’t completely land. And in the case of Babel, it hits far more than it misses, which is impressive. If science fiction shows us what our society could be (for better or worse), fantasy shows us what our society is, albeit reflected through the funhouse mirror of alternative histories and worlds. Babel achieves this.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

This year opened with another high-profile murder of an unarmed Black man—Tyre Nichols—by police. While it’s true the officers have already been indicted for Nichols’ death, the commentary continues to privilege the idea that this violence is the result of isolated actions, of inadequate training, of something—anything—other than ongoing systemic racism. Some coverage emphasized the race of the police officers—they, too, are Black—and seemed to say, “How can this be racism?” If you think that too, maybe you need to read a book like White Sight: Visual Politics and Practices of Whiteness. My thanks to NetGalley and MIT Press for the eARC.Nicholas Mirzoeff starts us off in the ancient world of Greece, but he brings us all the way to the modern era and the murder of George Floyd. Through an analysis of art, from statues to paintings to photographs and performance pieces, Mirzoeff traces how white supremacy has informed an aesthetic of whiteness throughout our society, and how that aesthetic has in turn reinforced and perpetuated white supremacist ideals of beauty, goodness, truth, etc.If you’re unsure what aesthetics has to do with racism, consider perspective. As Mirzoeff discusses here, the reinvention of perspective drawing in the Renaissance was immediately put to use creating a positive portrayal of colonization. Perspective drawing was an important revolution in art for how it challenged the artist and the viewer to reconceptualize space, something that Margaret Wertheim explored deeply in The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace. The Italian states and early colonial dominions of Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, etc., needed to conceptualize space as something that could be claimed, purchased, sold, lended. Space was something they could move through and indeed have claim to, as white Europeans, while for the people they enslaved, space was something that was laboured over and worked in. As Renaissance styles became more entrenched, artistic styles from other cultures were held up as backwards and barbaric, a way of further Othering and reinforcing the hierarchy between Europeans and non-Europeans.That is to say, art in the West has always been inextricably linked to the project of white supremacy. Likely one of the most important understandings I try to convey to my English students when I teach them about race is that the problem isn’t white people; it’s whiteness. As Nell Irvin Painter discusses in The History of White People, who counts as white has changed over the centuries. Whiteness is ephemeral, fluid, adaptable—and opportunistic. It admits some, denies others, then reverses course when the winds of fortune have changed direction and it would be more advantageous to say, “Hey, you know the Irish? Yeah, you can be white now?” But these changes in status work only if our visual politics undergo a corresponding shift, if the ways in which we represent and discuss different groups adapt over time to the tides of whiteness.Whiteness also explains how Black cops can kill unarmed Black people, and how other racialized people can perpetuate racism and white supremacy. Race has never been solely about the colour of one’s skin, and by the same token, that skin colour cannot determine whether someone is racist. When we look past white fragility, get over the knee-jerk reaction that we’re being told having lighter skin makes us bad people, we can see instead that race and racism in our society isn’t just about how we are seen: it’s about how we see.That’s what I got from White Sight. Mirzoeff chronicles artwork and trends that upheld white supremacy (wisely often refusing to reduce harm by not reproducing some images). However, he also chronicles the long history of resistance through art. How Black and other racialized artists make use of art forms, either from their own cultures or by co-opting European artistic traditions, to punctuate the equilibrium of Eurocentrism. This brings us to the twentieth century, to the meetings of minds of artists of colour from around the world, to the very political works of art that are protest and performance and an attempt to make us very uncomfortable with the world in which we live today.This book is dense, and at times it is very academic—more so than I was expecting, to be honest. For that reason, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it for a general audience, but I also don’t think that’s its purpose. Instead, I think this should be required reading on undergraduate courses from art history to gender studies to political science: any time you are engaging with writing on representation and visual politics, this book has something valuable to say.Though not the entire theme of the book, surveillance runs throughout the text and was something that really jumped out at me. It’s initially what attracted me to White Sight: the idea that the systems we build to monitor ourselves or others are inherently racist because of their links to capitalism. This manifests in very obvious ways, like the constant surveillance of incarcerated people, among whom Black and Indigenous folx are overrepresented. But it’s subtle as well, and sometime surveillance can even be connected to language. In the tech world, there’s a popular tool called Git, which is used for tracking versions of software. Git repositories can have different branches of the software’s code, and it’s common practice to designate one branch as the master. (Master–slave terminology pervades technology, alas.) There was a trend a couple years back to rename the master branch of one’s Git repos to main or something analogous but less loaded with history. While many protested this—believing it to be too symbolic, unnecessary, virtue-signalling—I followed the trend because I figured even though it might feel like an empty gesture, it was still a way of reducing harm. Of stopping a cycle.Our society is constantly being recreated through our interactions. The ways in which we talk, the ways in which we create art, and the ways in which we consume that art all affect how we recreate our society over and over. Whiteness is a property of the system that exists because we constantly reproduce the politics of race and racism, because we uphold capitalism as a framework that values the extraction of labour from people often at the expense of seeing them as human beings. As a result, we cannot ever make the mistake of thinking that art is not political. White Sight is a detailed, thoughtful, well organized exploration of these ideas through specific examples in history and contemporary work. While it is not comprehensive—I don’t think any project like this could be; there’s just so much more that could be written about all the various topics that intersect beneath this umbrella—this book is a fantastic grounding in these topics.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Also highly acclaimed, it didn’t live up to its hype for me—but I wasn’t surprised. I ed it, filed it away, and didn’t really think about Morgenstern again until I saw The Starless Sea in my bookstore. I read the description, and I thought, “Hmm. Another story about stories. Not original. But maybe….”Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a college student who discovers a book that seems to be telling the story of his life. It recounts a time in his childhood when, walking home alone, he came across a door painted in the wall. He didn’t open the door. If he had, he would have discovered an entire world hidden underground—a world of starless seas and magnificent libraries and temporal anomalies and more. Now he’s playing catch-up, working alongside a shifty guy named Dorian, an passionate painter named Mirabel, and fighting against someone who seems determined to cut off access to the world below by the world above.You ever read a book that is just one hundred percent vibes? That’s what this is—and I mean that as a compliment.Stories about stories are not, as I observed, anything new. Cloud Cuckoo Land, as well as N.K. Jemisin’s The City We Became and its sequel, are both examples I can pull from my recent reading. Writers love to write about stories, and I don’t blame them. Storytelling is one of the ultimate activities that define our humanity, and so by its very nature it should examine itself. With The Starless Sea, Morgenstern is asking whether the reality of the fairy tale can ever truly be as romantic as the telling of it.I got strong notes of The Princess Bride reading this. Maybe it’s the mysterious, condemned pirate we meet at the start of the book, or the equally enigmatic Dorian. Maybe it’s the relationship between Zachary and Dorian, the edge of “true love” never quite articulated. The same kind of romance between Mirabel and her paramour. This is a book whose pages resemble dimly lit rooms that cast soft shadows over everything. There are no sharp edges, but there are also no easy answers.As Zachary attempts to learn more about the mysterious world into which he has intruded, Morgenstern presents the reader with more fairy tales and folk stories. Each one feels related, in some way, to the others. They’re all connected, not in obvious ways but not subtly either—themes and recurring motifs, like pairs of lovers, winding their way through these stories before ultimately being distilled into “reality”—such as that is in this book.This is what I mean when I say The Starless Sea is vibes. The characters don’t really matter; hell, the plot itself doesn’t matter. What matters is the experience of reading it, curled up on my couch under a blanket in the depths of January winter. The way Morgenstern’s stories-within-stories trickled into me, warding me against the chill, and stoked the fires of my memories of a decade—or even two—ago, when I had more time to read and more latitude to be amazed.I don’t really know what to say about The Starless Sea as a story. The story exists. It’s fun at times, frustrating at others—the book seems to insist that exposition must be an all-or-nothing affair, and as much as I appreciate Morgenstern’s confidence in the reader’s ability to put the pieces together, sometimes I do just want things spelled out, you know? Moreover, I am often critical of books with ambiguous endings, but this is one of those cases where the book definitely earns it.As a book, as an experience of turning pages and reading, this was very satisfying for me. It hit the right spots of nostalgia for me and my love of stories. Indeed, it is a great example of what we mean when we say we read to escape: for the hours I spent on this adventure with Zachary, I was able to forget about what was happening in this world around us, so enthralled was I in the worlds he was trying to explore. And why else do we read if not for that?Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

What began as a story about the possible evolution of life from Earth on different worlds in one novel has sprawled into an epic meditation on what it means to be alive. Thanks to NetGalley and publisher Orbit for the eARC!Spoilers for the first and second books in this  but not for this one.The seeds of this story are planted at the end of Children of Ruin: some time after contact between the Humans/Portiids of Kern’s World and the octopuses and alien creature from the twin system of Damascus/Nod, the tenuous resulting peace has created a multispecies, interstellar, starfaring civilization. Those who want to explore set out in various types of spacecraft, usually with a mixed crew, looking for new things and new experiences—they are, as the Nod creature would put it, “having an adventure.” One such ship has arrived in orbit of another planet that was supposed to be terraformed by humans from Earth and then settled by a subsequent ark ship. They find a strange settlement that probably shouldn’t have survived this long. But as their investigation deepens, the cracks appear wider than they ever thought.At first, the story seems to be a straightforward plot about a regressive colony being visited by a more “advanced” group of people who then have to decide what to do. Liff, an adolescent girl from the colony, serves as our interlocutor for much of the story. We watch over her shoulder as she puzzles out these newcomers. Liff is perceptive enough to recognize that these visitors are not your run-of-the-mill outsiders and young enough not to be swept up so easily in the xenophobic herd mentality promulgated by her populist uncle. Meanwhile, one of the visitors, Miranda, develops a soft spot for Liff and becomes a proponent of interfering more readily in the colony’s politics, even as her fellow explorers protest that such intervention would be useless at best and harmful at worst.My thoughts immediately went, of course, to the Prime Directive from Star Trek. The multispecies coalition reminds me a bit of the Federation, even if it is a much less cohesive arrangement. They lack any codified Prime Directive—and indeed, as we see later in the book, interference is practically built into their mission—but many of their early actions are reminiscent of how Star Trek’s characters diligently avoid interfering in the affairs of cultures that haven’t developed faster-than-light spaceflight. Both stances are founded upon the philosophy that sufficiently advanced science does not always mean superior culture or morality, and to impose our own ideologies on other cultures that we encounter could easily lead to a recapitulation of the colonialism and imperialism that both Tchaikovsky and Roddenberry imagined as being firmly in the past of their futures.As the story progresses, it becomes clear both to Miranda and us (and to a lesser extent, Liff) that something is terribly wrong. The story itself seems to start to break down, with continuity threatened and characterization inconsistent. The ultimate cause of this issue is not, in and of itself, all that original as far as science-fiction tropes go. Nevertheless, I like how Tchaikovsky uses it here. It’s another interesting idea to explore in this universe he has created over the past two novels. It further expands the universe—the mechanism causing this issue is alien in origin, proof of intelligent life out there beyond the creature discovered on Nod, even if that intelligence might not be living any longer. The questions raised by this discovery are profound, and Tchaikovsky’s characters treat them with the gravity they require.Similarly, Children of Memory asks us to think critically about how we know if we are sentient and self-aware. Two central characters are a bonded pair of corvids who evolved on another failed human terraforming world (well, failed from the point of view of humans—the corvids seem quite satisfied). The corvids exhibit behaviours that seem consistent with sentience, yet they themselves admit that they don’t think they are self-aware! They’re just pretending, the same way that an AI like the currently notorious ChatGPT might pretend to self-awareness. They go so far as to assert that even humans are not, ourselves, actually self-aware either—we’re just algorithms running different software.(The corvids’ bonded pair nature reminded me a lot of the theory of the bicameral mind, although theirs is split into cataloging and executive function. Very fascinating!)And it’s true—can we ultimately ever prove that we are sentient beings as opposed to beings who believe we’re sentient and are good enough at faking it? This is the kind of philosophical quandary I’ve come to expect from Tchaikovsky’s writing, and he hasn’t let me down.I saw a few other early s criticize the portrayal of Miranda and how Tchaikovsky reduces the Nod creature, after spending so much time humanizing it in the previous book, to a self-hating caricature of itself. I don’t agree. I think Miranda’s internalized revulsion makes a lot of sense given that she is basically a copy of a Human woman who has all the atavistic reservations about an assimilating creature like the Nod one. The whole point of the Nod creature is that it becomes what it assimilates, so if it assimilates things that feel revulsion or hatred towards it—even subconsciously—of course it will feel those things too. That’s what makes the conflict, Miranda’s characterization, so interesting. She believes she might be responsible somehow for everything that is happening—and in a way she’s right, but in another way she is also so, so wrong.As far as pacing goes, I will admit that the first half of the book felt like it was slow to me. It was only towards the end, after we know more about what’s happening on this planet, that I started to feel really invested in the story. I think Tchaikovsky’s ideas are always incredible, and his skills as a writer are generally quite strong, but sometimes his storytelling—the way he structures and reveals the exposition of his worlds and characters in particular—leaves me wanting.Children of Memory was better for me overall than Children of Ruin. I hesitate with how to rank it against Children of Time because they are both great, just for different reasons. I really love the thought experiment at the heart of this novel, whereas the first book in this series is a tour-de-force exploration of interspecies communication, conflict, and cooperation. In any case, this is yet another excellent science-fiction novel that I’m quite happy to have read.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

However, it’s the January pick for the Rad Roopa BThis is a great example of a book I probably wouldn’t have picked up solely on my own recognizance. However, it’s the January pick for the Rad Roopa Book Club, and I was intrigued. Well, actually, I wanted to know how to kill a city, should the need ever arise. That’s what P.E. Moskowitz covers in this aptly named book—though I get the feeling they are more interested in fighting against gentrification, and I suppose that’s a good thing.Part geographical rumination, part political manifesto, How to Kill a City is a tour through four major American cities and how gentrification has come for each of them. Moskowitz begins in New Orleans, examining how state and local officials used the destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina as an excuse to enact policy that would encourage gentrification, development, and attract “the right sort” (read: white people) to the city. From there they take us to Detroit, which has been hollowed out by recession and foreclosure. Next up, San Francisco, where the tech bubble has priced millennials out of owning houses some of them grew up in. Finally, Moskowitz’s milieu of New York City, which has waged a decades-long campaign of gentrification across multiple boroughs.Along the way, Moskowitz explores what gentrification is, according to various sources, how it begins, and the forces that drive it. Their thesis is simple: gentrification is a local effect, but the cause is national and even global, so the solutions have to be a similar combination of these levels of community and government. Boots-on-the-ground activists are essential but if fighting by themselves are in for a losing battle. Rather, Moskowitz points out the need for policy change that recognizes how gentrification works and especially how it affects marginalized and vulnerable groups.I’ll demonstrate with one example from the book: real estate development. In many cities (I know this is true here in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver), housing prices are on the rise because developers or other wealthy owners buy up houses, condos, and apartments and then leave them vacant for most of the year. And the ones that are occupied are leased, often without rent control. As a result, people are being priced out of their homes in the cities, putting pressure on them to move to suburbs—and without robust public transit into the city from the suburbs, people often have trouble affording to even work in the city.As I read, I pondered how gentrification manifests in my own city of Thunder Bay. It’s a tough one, because I can tell it is operation, but I don’t think it’s as evident as it is in larger cities. Thunder Bay’s commercial districts tend to be dense and clustered, and while there are residential neighbourhoods that abut them, we have a lot less urban infill at the moment. We’ve always had a lot of chain and department stores, with local businesses eternally clinging to life as we lurch from one economic hardship to another. So it was challenging for me to apply Moskowitz’s teachings to my own city—something to think about, and perhaps watch out for.Then again maybe, as Moskowitz themself reflects, maybe I am a gentrifier. I fit the economic demographic of being a white, middle-class, white-collar worker … but again, the neighbourhood is what I struggle with. I’m in a more expensive yet still heterogeneous area of town, heavily residential yet one where walking barely two blocks can put me among houses that are hundreds of thousands of dollars’ difference in value to my own.Although How to Kill a City acknowledges outright the links between gentrification and racism, I would have liked to see more discussion of colonialism in this book. After all, the land American cities are built on is stolen from the Indigenous nations who predate European contact. The first European settlers were, in a sense, the original gentrifiers, and I think it’s worth examining how present-day settlers like myself benefit from our privilege even if we are not personally in the midst of a present moment of gentrification.Similarly, while not quite in the scope of the book, How to Kill a City got me thinking about gentrification in Europe. Moskowitz briefly mentions London, where gentrification as a term was coined. So it’s not a phenomenon unique to North America by any means. Yet I wonder how conditions in Europe—differences in population and transport density, differences in culture, as well as states with a heavier lean towards socialism—change the face of gentrification. Again, something to think about.That’s about where I come down on this book: it gives me a lot to think about. It’s firm and opinionated without being strident, yet it also admits different points of view—Moskowitz interviews developers and other gentrifiers who emphatically endorse what they are doing in these cities, and then Moskowitz presents the points of view of activists and those who oppose gentrification, with whom they clearly sympathize more. Still, I appreciate the attempt to explore this issue from different angles.Gentrification is ultimately about space, and space does not have to be limited to the physical. I’ve seen people discuss the gentrification of online spaces as well. So I like how this book has me thinking about our relationship with space, physical or not, and especially how I move through it as a white person. I’m thinking about relationality, how I relate to these spaces, to the people and objects within them, and how these things in turn relate back to me.How to Kill a City is a concrete and careful look at an important contemporary issue. While there is room for more breadth and depth than is on offer here, this book feels like a good starting point on a journey to unpacking one’s own role in gentrification and learning about how policy influences gentrification throughout North America.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I’m actually impressed As is often the case, my memory plays tricks on me: I thought I had read Children of Time last year—no, I read it in 2021! I’m actually impressed I recalled as much of it as I did when I started Children of Ruin, though Adrian Tchaikovsky does his best to provide pertinent backstory. I wanted to say he does this without infodumping, because it’s kind of true, except that this whole story is kind of infodumping. It’s … odd.Spoilers, if you can call them that, for the first book but not for this one—and this is one of those cases where I think you can read this book without reading the last.Children of Ruin follows the adventure of one of the Human–Portiid vessels that sets out from Kern’s World at the end of Children of Time. It arrives in a system that was the destination of another terraforming project. Through flashbacks, Tchaikovsky tells us the story of this system while the Humans and Portiids—assisted by a copy of the Avrana Kern intelligence—make perilous contact with the inhabitants of this system, who are a form of uplifted and evolved octopus. For, much like on Kern’s World, terraforming this system didn’t go to plan (when does it ever in this universe), yet life tenaciously found a way. The octopus civilization is difficult to converse with, however—the gap between them seems even wider than the one between Humans and Portiids. Meanwhile, an ancient threat—the first alien life to be discovered in this galaxy—awaits them all on the surface of Nod, and perhaps elsewhere.We like to meditate on the difference between “hard” and “soft” SF. However, maybe the labels should be hard and easy. The latter simply means that the author has decided to dial down the difficulty level of so much related to space travel and life in space for the purposes of a more fanciful story. The former, on the other hand, is less about adherence to science versus a much more granular approach to that science. Children of Ruin is hard in that sense: everyone in this book is playing on hard mode.Consequently, the majority of this book is people of various species struggling and failing to be understood by one another. It’s frustrating—or it would be, if it weren’t so damn fascinating. Tchaikovksy’s talent, as I noted in my  of the first book, is his imagination. He has clearly spent a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if spiders evolved a society, if octopuses evolved on a water world, etc. What would truly alien life be like? What do you do when you run across it and it wants to go on an adventure with you, but this adventure means potentially losing what makes you you?Frankenstein is often cited as the first science-fiction novel, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence that it is also a horror story. These two genres are entwined. Though Children of Ruin is not expressly horror in a classical sense, Tchaikovsky plays with many of the horror tropes, right down to an entity reminiscent of John Carpenter’s Thing. This book is a reminder that non-human life, whether it evolves from terrestrial or extraterrestrial stock, is going to feel very alien to us indeed. And even if it isn’t malicious, its simple fact of existing might be anathema to our own existence.Tchaikovsky asks us to think very differently about what the future might be like. I love books like this, and the thought experiment here is, in my opinion, a very satisfying one to run on the story emulator that is my meat brain.However, I would be hard pressed to defend this book in terms of the storytelling itself. This is one of those books that is light on dialogue—conversations are sparse throughout the text—and heavy on exposition. I was OK with that because I was into the thought experiment, but I know many others would put the book down upon discovering this—and that’s totally valid. Tchaikovsky’s style here is so information-dense that it almost entirely distracts you from the actual narrative unfolding.That being said, don’t mistake all this exposition for a lack of characterization. If you do, you’ll miss out. Tchaikovsky carefully develops so many different personalities in this cast: intuitive and determined Helena, adventurous Portia, frustrated and inquisitive Fabian, and especially Kern herself. Each of these characters, and others, brings something to the mix, and I enjoyed spending time with all of them.So as a result of all this, I really vacillated about my rating. Two stars, because what story is here is stretched tissue thin across the novel? Or do I award Children of Ruin five stars, as I did with Ninefox Gambit, because its overall execution is science fiction in a nutshell? I guess a solid three stars is appropriate, and I hope this  has done its job of adequately evaluating what this book does: push the boundaries of what we might imagine the future to be like in a way that is entertaining, if not consistently so.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Although our economy has long been digital, the rise of Bitcoin and otheCryptocurrency has long fascinated me because it’s mathematics made manifest. Although our economy has long been digital, the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies codified a cashless digital economy through arcane mathematical precepts that nevertheless gave rise to trillions of dollars of worth—even if that value is volatile at the best of times. It’s not surprising that enterprising criminal minds would try to use cryptocurrency for their dealings, and it’s not surprising that others would use math to uncover those dealings. Tracers in the Dark lays out just what this entails, how it led to successfully busting some big criminals, and what this might mean the future of digital crime, cryptocurrencies, and law enforcement.Andy Greenberg knows how to tell a story. I have read parts of this book in his articles for Wired, along with similar coverage of cryptocurrency busts. I forgot I had read one of Greenberg’s previous books, about WikiLeaks, and enjoyed it; in retrospect, I see why. Greenberg has a knack for taking complex technological topics, like cryptocurrency, and distilling them into a form digestible even by people with a tech or math background. He cuts through the complexity, rendering it down until you can—as the tracers do—follow the money.The book comprises five parts. In Part I, Greenberg lays out some of the biggest players: researchers, law enforcement agents, and cryptocurrency business owners who all have a role to play in the events to come. He unpacks the investigation that eventually led to the arrest of Ross Ulbricht and the shuttering of the Silk Road. Part II introduces us to the golden age of Bitcoin tracing. We learn more about how blockchain analysis software, such as that pioneered by firm Chainalysis, became an integral part of investigation by law enforcement like the FBI and IRS. Part III covers the investigations into and subsequent take down of AlphaBay, followed by the Welcome to Video saga in Part IV. The book wraps up with Part V, a look at the future of cryptocurrency tracing and blockchain analysis, especially as new cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash claim to be “fixing” Bitcoin’s privacy and anonymity problems.For anyone who enjoys true crime, this book is awash with detail and compelling description. Though Greenberg has obviously chosen to emphasize the actions of certain people, I like that he doesn’t lionize any one person or try to make out anyone to be a hero. These are law enforcement agents, lawyers, etc. who are doing a job. At the same time, he also helps us see how these white-collar crimes are far from victimless. It might seem silly to some of us, spending resources on computer programs and expertise required to chase down sequences of numbers and letters through a vast database (the blockchain) in the hopes of finding out who paid whom. Why not spend that money on something more tangible, like protecting people from violent crime? As Greenberg demonstrates, it’s all connected. The dark web and cryptocurrency have together enabled criminals to more efficiently acquire and distribute everything from drugs to firearms to child sexual abuse material.The last one was particularly hard to read about, for all the reasons you might expect. I had already read at least the beginning of the Welcome to Video story, and rereading it here, being reminded of the toll it took on the investigators and prosecutors—not to mention, of course, thinking about all the victims of the abuse—well, let’s just say that this book is not for cozy bedtime reading. Greenberg doesn’t shy away from discussing the dark stuff, hopefully with the consequence of helping readers understand that this type of internet crime is not something to be taken lightly. Just because it’s 1s and 0s on hard drives rather than something more tangible, the effects on real people are still devastating.Tracers in the Dark also changed my mind a bit about cryptocurrency, something I didn’t expect! I have always been very skeptical about crypto ever since I learned about it. Bitcoin and its successors have always sounded like scams and schemes—great if you invested early on but far from the libertarian utopian technology some evangelists seemed to think it could be. As we’ve passed the decade mark and more and more people try to bend blockchain technology to their particular business models, my skepticism and cynicism have increased proportionally.Yet Greenberg carefully showcases the diversity of viewpoints within the crypto community. Gronager and Meiklejohn have quite different ideas about how and why blockchain analysis should be done, for example—and Greenberg allows them both the space to explain their beliefs. As a result, I started to understand why there are still some “true believers” within the crypto community—people who don’t see cryptocurrency necessarily as an anarchic panacea for state surveillance and control but rather view it as a logical extension of existing monetary tools. While I still wouldn’t go so far as to agree with that idea, I’m more sympathetic to it than the more extreme viewpoints I’ve seen in the past. Greenberg’s diligence in seeking out contradictory opinions helped me confront my own biases and arrive at a more nuanced view of this topic.You don’t need to understand the math behind Bitcoin to understand the effect it has had on our economy and crime. For better or worse, Bitcoin might not be poised to render fiat currency obsolete, but it’s here to stay in one form or another—and if you’re like me, you might want to see whether your pension fund invested in a cryptocurrency exchange…. Tracers in the Dark is top-notch writing in service of telling a story that anyone interested in crime, computers, mathematics, etc., would do well to hear.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I enjoyed Legendborn so much that I was very happy I borrowed its sequel, Bloodmarked, at the same time. Tracy Deonn bottles lightning again in this novel: it’s everything you might want a sequel to be. If Legendborn scratched my itch for nostalgic YA fiction but with better diversity and racial awareness, then Bloodmarked doubled down on the itch-scratching while truly establishing the Legendborn Cycle as a titanic, powerful, and truly memorable fantasy series.Spoilers in this  for the first book but not for this book.Bree Matthews discovered at the start of her first year of Early College that an ancient Order descended from King Arthur’s Round Table exists and fights demonic creatures. Oh, and she herself is the descendant of King Arthur, whose spirit has awakened within her so she can lead the Order in a climactic battle against the Shadowborn. The existing power structure of the Order isn’t thrilled by this news, mostly because Bree is a young, Black woman and they are a bunch of racists. And there’s also a lot of politics at play. So on the one hand, Bree has a bunch of demons trying to kill her and plunge the world into darkness, and on the other hand, the so-called good guys want her locked away too.Bloodmarked immediately opens up the world and lore of this series in all directions. We learn more about the Order itself and its precarious politics, including how little agency Bree has despite nominally being the king. Deonn also takes us beyond the supernatural elements present at UNC–Chapel Hill, establishing that there is far more out there—rootcrafters as well as more morally grey establishments, such as power brokers—than either Bree or the reader could anticipate. I get serious Supernatural vibes, but with better outcomes for the racialized characters.Race (and also gender) remains at the centre of this story, but it is truly amplified here. Bree faces misogynoir from the white men (and women) who control the Order. So many of them—and even some of her allies—dismiss the idea that race is a factor in her treatment, yet it seems clear to me that if Bree were a white girl, the Order’s Regents would work a lot harder to co-opt her rather than take her off the board. Deonn explores complex issues of intergenerational trauma and the fact that different people with similar marginalizations may disagree on a path forward towards justice.It ultimately comes down to power. Bree has very little social capital, yet she still has raw power, and that’s why people are afraid of her potential for disruption. The question remains: can she harness this power, wield it, or will it end up wielding her?The climax of this book shocked me, and I say this even though I saw it coming from miles away. There was some pretty obvious foreshadowing earlier in the book (and even back at the end of Legendborn), yet Deonn somehow lulled me into … I don’t know, a kind of sense of security that she wasn’t going to go down this route? Maybe I had told myself it would feel too trite, too expected, and so convinced myself it wasn’t going to happen—except when it did, my doubts or worries were blown away by how Deonn pulls it off.In the same way, I really enjoy how Deonn handles the love triangle (if that is even the right shape to describe it) that is often a prerequisite of these kinds of YA fantasy novels. There is a lot of nuance and depth to the feelings of all three people involved, resulting in a situation that goes far beyond “woe is me, for I am not like other girls and thus have two equally bland and uninteresting boys pining after me.” I mean, it’s true, Bree isn’t like other girls—but Sel and Nick aren’t like other boys either, and all three are complex, messy characters.Basically, what I’m trying to say is that Bloodmarked took all the good stuff from Legendborn, turned it up to eleven, and left me wanting more, more, more. I’ve gone from, “this was an enjoyable YA fantasy experience” to “this is among the foremost fantasy series I’ve read” (YA or otherwise). I’m going to be talking about this series for a long, long time, and recommending it to others, and I can’t wait to see what happens next.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I remember reading the description on NetGalley, where I received the eARC,This is one of those books that is far better than it has any right to be. I remember reading the description on NetGalley, where I received the eARC, and thinking, “A space-opera reimagining of Wizard of Oz? Neat!” and being down to clown. But then I actually read Over the Moon—and I was angry. I was angry at the book for how good it was—don’t ask me why, I’m irrational—and irritated that now I will have to wait probably a year before I find out what happens next.Yeah, it’s one of those books.Nymphodora, or Dora as she styles herself, has grown up on a small farming moon in the backwaters of the galactic community. Raised by her aunt and uncle, Dora has led a secluded life because she is an illegal clone of Princess Jo’Niss, and if anyone outside the family recognized her for what she was, they would turn her in for money or kill her or both. Dora isn’t satisfied with a farm life or becoming a farm wife to her childhood best friend, Tobis. She wants to get away, go to school, upgrade her engineering skills. So when the chance comes to run away from home, Dora jumps at it—and it blows up in her face. She suddenly finds herself stranded in the Outer Zone, having accidentally murdered a technowitch. Said witch’s sister instructs Dora to find the Technomage Superius on the moon above Merald City, so it’s off to see the wizard she goes, with the trio of companions one might expect for this retelling, albeit reimagined in interesting ways.Anderson’s approach to repurposing the source material is delightful. She strikes the perfect balance between nods back to the original text while innovating or adding twists that make sure Over the Moon is its own adventure. I love the conflation of sufficiently advanced science with magic through the appellation of technowitch/wizard, along with the Ocugry as the “cowardly lion” of the story. Dora is an excellent modern Dorothy: clever and kind yet—at least at the beginning of the story—too trusting and naïve. The story moves forward at a great pace, scenes and sequels moving us along with just the right amount of parallelism between this as and the original narratives.When Dora’s inadvertently stolen spaceship drops on the Technowitch of Night, she agonizes over her manslaughter. I didn’t realize until this moment how jaded I’ve become when it comes to accepting that most of the protagonists I’ll come across in a science-fiction or fantasy novel are already used to killing. Dora’s sheltered upbringing hasn’t given her much opportunity to engage in that, of course, so her reaction makes perfect sense—and it comes across clearly enough on the page that it jolted me out of my complacency.Anderson’s writing has a way of doing that. Description, dialogue, and characterization—all of it flows smoothly right up until she decides she wants a record-scratch moment, something that makes you sit up and pay attention. This happens a few times throughout the book, from the moment Dora first realizes she is in trouble and has to flee to the final escape from the moonbase.I kept waiting for the other shoe, so to speak, to drop—if you are familiar with the source material, then you know that the Wizard isn’t all he’s cracked up to be, so I knew that had to be the case here. I won’t spoil it, just say that Anderson doesn’t disappoint. Indeed, I think the reason I ended up so pleasantly surprised by this book is how deep the story ends up going. While I hoped that Dora’s adventure would take her deeper into this galaxy that Anderson has built, I had no clue we would go this far. Many of the twists (such as who Abril is) are telegraphed so clearly they are easy to predict chapters ahead of time, but several Anderson keeps more mysterious, and this pays off.I also love the slow burn of the romance in this book. It’s perfectly to my taste as someone who loves queer books but doesn’t particularly care about romance. Dora’s whole, “Gosh, I’m just not all that interested in settling down with someone, but maybe that’s because I’ve only met like one guy in my age bracket” slowly metamorphosing into, “Gee, girls make me tingle in a way Tobis never has” is so much fun to see. Her cluelessness giving away to dawning realization that she is falling for someone is so genuine and contrasts nicely with the true horror of her situation and the enemies she’s making. The roadblocks Anderson throws up to the romance feel realistic, and Dora’s love interest is a great character in her own right.The journey of Over the Moon was every bit as satisfying as I hoped it would be when I picked up the book. Then the ending was even better than I expected, perfectly setting up a sequel and leaving me wanting it right now. That doesn’t happen as often as I would like.

I’m happy to report that this sequel avoids the dreaded second-book syndrome. It builds on the success of the first book’s worldbuilding and story arc while addressing many of the critiques I levelled in my earlier .Spoilers ahead for the first book but not for this one!Frankie Rosenberg, daughter of Willow, is the world’s first slayer-witch. She came into her powers after an explosion in Halifax—one might call it a Halifax Explosion—is presumed to have killed almost all of the extant slayers when they had gathered for a retreat. Frankie now patrols New Sunnydale along with her friend Jake, a werewolf related to Oz; Hailey, who sister of slayer Vi Larrson; Spike, now Frankie’s Watcher; and Sigmund, a Sage demon who feeds off stupidity and oozes charm when he isn’t careful. Having defeated the Countess in the first book, Frankie hopes she can have some downtime to grow into her new slayer abilities—but her hopes are dashed when some force begins to draw demons to the Hellmouth at an ever-increasing rate. It turns out that some new player—the Darkness—has a plan for the Hellmouth, Frankie, Willow, and the Scythe that is connected to the power of the slayers.The elimination of the slayers right at the start of the first book felt like a bombastic but effective way to wipe the slate clean and give Blake a chance to tell a vampire slayer story without too many pieces on the board. Even in that book, there were hints that this event, however distant from New Sunnydale where the books are set, would drive the overall arc of this series. I’m very happy with how One Girl in All the World picks up that thread and runs with it.By and large, I’d attribute that success to an expanded point of view. The first book was very focused on Frankie, with a little bit of time spent on Hailey and Sigmund. That was fine—I like Frankie and think she’s a great protagonist. This sequel, however, really stands out for how it brings in the points of view of Vi and even, at one point, Grimloch. Vi’s connection to the mystery of the other slayers’ disappearance provides the reader with an important perspective that the Scoobies don’t have access to. Similarly, there are some short but excellent moments between Sigmund and his mother, or between Willow and Oz, that help us see the events and characters of this book in a better light. Much like the original TV series, this book is at its best when it showcases the interesting facets of its ensemble cast.That being said, Frankie remains the heart of the story just as Buffy did in her own series, and there is nothing wrong with that. Even though this book takes place mere weeks after the first one, you can already see how being the slayer is having an effect. Frankie feels more mature and sure of herself in this book—though that certainty isn’t always a good thing and, indeed, can land her in hot water.Something I’ll be curious to see if this series continues past a third book would be whether Disney has Frankie age into late adolescence/young adulthood the same way Buffy did in the TV show, and what effect that might have on the atmosphere of the books. As it is, although these books deal with some very serious and potentially dark issues, such as violence, death, grief, and betrayal of the worst kind, there remains a lighthearted goofiness that definitely resembles Buffy circa seasons 1 and 2, when our characters were high school students still trying to balance slaying with more mundane concerns like dating, homework, or being grounded.To that last point: I did not expect to love Willow as a parent so much!! Again, Blake writes this aspect of Willow’s character as a love letter to the TV show. There are a lot of allusions, both subtle and overt, to Joyce’s parenting of Buffy. Unlike Joyce, Willow has been aware of Frankie’s calling since it happened (she is, albeit indirectly, responsible for it). Yet that doesn’t obviate any of the worry that Willow feels, and she reflects on how Joyce must have felt back in the day. Her attempts to parent Frankie responsibly and set in place healthy boundaries—e.g., through grounding—are at odds sometimes with Frankie’s role as the slayer, and it’s fascinating to see Willow, Oz, Frankie, and the others work through all these power dynamics. Though Joyce and Buffy had a loving relationship to be sure, it was definitely strained at times; in contrast, Frankie and Willow’s relationship feels like it’s weathering the new stress of slaying quite well—I’m sure there’s an entire academic essay somewhere in here about this, but I’ll attribute it perhaps to Willow being “in the know” from the outset and having her own decades of experience with the supernatural and the hellmouth to help her navigate the warts and wrinkles of parenting a slayer.Indeed, much more so than in the first book—which I think was really working overtime to establish the world of a New Sunnydale sixteen years out from the end of Buffy—relationships figure prominently here. Not just romantic ones either!I was critical of In Every Generation for the ambiguity it created around Willow’s relationship with Oz, what this said about Willow’s sexuality, and in general the dearth of on-page queerness in a book for young adults. One Girl in All the World allays a lot of my fears about what the Mouse might have sanctioned—I use that word in both of its senses—in this series. It looks like Jake is questioning his sexuality in a very healthy and positive way, supported by his friends, and I love to see it. Meanwhile, Spike of all people calls out Willow’s will-they-or-won’t-they situation with Oz, and Blake addresses the ambiguity a lot more directly here. I won’t give anything away, but I’m really happy with how it plays out.Outside of the romance, we see a lot of parent-child, sibling, and friendship dynamics play out that are super interesting. Vi’s return throws Frankie and Hailey’s budding friendship-cum-sisterhood into flux, just as Sarafina’s presence upsets Hailey and Sigmund’s romance in a way neither of them expected even as Sarafina herself makes eyes at Willow (and possibly Oz??). I love Jake’s frustration with not being in full control of his werewolf abilities and how he feels like this renders him less useful, especially when he’s trapped in a cage during the climax of the book. All in all, newcomers to the Buffyverse get an introduction to a dynamic that is plenty familiar to longtime fans of the series: the slayer must balance accepting help from her allies with the possible dangers this puts them in.This works into a larger question of consent and informed consent. Can the Scoobies really know what they are getting themselves into? Arguably yes, given that Hailey has grown up as the sister of a slayer (though Vi tried to shield her from that) and Jake has been a werewolf from birth. But what about the Potentials who were activated sixteen years ago? What about the slayer herself? The entire foundation of this series rests on a nonconsensual act—first, long ago, men foisting the powers of the slayer on the First Slayer, and then sixteen years ago Willow and Buffy doing the same thing to every Potential Slayer. The TV show stopped at that point and never had the opportunity to grapple with the possible ramifications of such an action. Blake confronts it head-on here, and it’s brilliant..I really like this development in the mystery of who targeted the slayers in Halifax. It makes a lot of sense in the context of the series mythology. Buffy has always been a show that talks about power corrupting, whether it’s people like the Mayor who steeped in it for so long it has literally become their raison d’être or people like Willow, who come to power with good intentions and find themselves always one step away from the abyss. I don’t really think you can have a Buffy story without it being, in some way, a story about power: who has it, who doesn’t have it, who deserves to have it, and what those with it do to those without it. Frankie has always had some power and has come into new power, and so far she seems to be making wise choices. Will that always be the case?I concluded my  of In Every Generation with the somewhat pompous proclamation that “this series has a lot of growing to do before it can feel comfortable living up to Buffy’s legacy.” I stand by this opinion but will add that One Girl in All the World is precisely the kind of growth I was hoping to see. It has left me excited to see what the next book holds for Frankie, the Scoobies, and those who would snark against the Darkness.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

It was released in 2004, the same year I started high school, so I was of the generation it depicted. I also loved math. Indeed, my strongest Mean Girls memory is of my AP Calculus course in Grade 12. There were six of us in the class. One of the other students convinced our teacher to let us watch Mean Girls one day in class simply because it mentioned limits. I don’t remember what flimsy justification she proffered beyond this or why my teacher said yes, but it was a good time.All of this is to say that this is why I was drawn to The Elephants in My Backyard. I saw a clip of Rajiv Surendra being interviewed with the two other prominent young male actors from the movie—all three of whom, it turns out, are gay—and the interviewer mentioned he had written a memoir. Hmm, I thought. He’s Canadian too, which is cool. I also like that this memoir isn’t really about Mean Girls, and while it is about acting, it is only tangentially about the movie industry. Rather, this is a story of what to do when you don’t achieve your dream.Most of the book revolves around Surendra’s quest to be cast as the lead character in the adaptation of Life of Pi, a novel by another Canadian, Yann Martel. He even corresponds with Martel, excerpts of which are included throughout this book. Surendra, upon being introduced to the novel, marvels at how similar he and Pi Patel seem to be. He becomes obsessed with landing the role and devotes all his energy to preparing for it, to moulding himself into such a perfect Pi that no matter which director ends up being attached—for the movie goes through its own spate of growing pains and development hell—they will have no choice but to admit that yes, Rajiv, he is the one! He visits Pondicherry in India, learns how to swim, researches and interviews survivors who were adrift at sea—he pursues his goal somewhat singlemindedly.As anyone who has seen the film knows, he was not successful.In a society that fetishes success and demonizes failure—or uplifts failure only when it is a speedbump along the way to an eventual success—Surendra’s story stands out. Indeed, his story is the story of most people who enter film and television. He doesn’t go on to huge celebrity and an acting career after Mean Girls. He has comparatively few roles and has instead pursued other interests and means of making money, such as calligraphy. We focus so much in our society on career actors who rocket to fame as they land these huge roles or steady work when the reality for most actors is probably much closer to Surendra’s.His writing style in the book is spare and penetrating. I felt like he was looking at me as I was reading his words. He doesn’t hold back in his opinions of people, places, etc., lauding those who helped him and were genuine, and being brutally honest about those who have harmed him. In particular, there is a chapter in which he reflects on his experiences growing up in a household with an abusive, alcoholic father … he doesn’t mince his words and doesn’t try to stay civil, let’s put it that way.This was an easy book to read in a day, both because it’s on the shorter side but also because of how well Surendra has structured his narrative. It’s roughly chronological, with detours and flashbacks as needed, showing us how he goes from Mean Girls to research, living in India before returning to Toronto to resume school and working at a pioneer village. Interestingly, his romantic life and sexuality (Surendra is gay) doesn’t come up until the very end of the book. Again, although much of the book doesn’t discuss the film industry directly, most of the book involves Surendra’s obsession with landing this particular role.I also love how much Surendra is into wool and knitting, going so far as to include a page at the end of the book with a photo of him in his favourite sweater and a technical explanation as to the gansey’s construction and history. As a knitter, this warms my heart.This memoir fills a great niche. It belies many of the dominant narratives presented to us about actors and celebrities. It’s by a young, gay man of colour—a Canadian too—and asks us to think about how the intersections of race, class, immigrant status, etc. figure into our lives. And perhaps most obviously—but no less powerfully—The Elephants in My Backyard dares us to define success on our own terms, reminding us that failure is an option. It isn’t a case of “life works out for the best”—I hate it when people tell me that—but it is a reminder that we don’t control outcomes and that nothing we do can ever be enough to guarantee an outcome we desire. All we can do as we go through life is define our goals, work towards them, and adjust those goals as times change. Surendra may never have been adrift at sea, but in this book he shows himself to be adept at navigating the open ocean that is our lives and our desires.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I remember borrowing Malory’s Morte d'Arthur from my library multiple times despite being way too young to pick my way through the Middle English prose. I devoured all sorts of retellings and reimaginings, like Bernard Cornwell’s Warlord series. So when this series crossed my Twitter feed one day, I couldn’t not windmill-slam the “place hold” button on both Legendborn and its sequel. Tracy Deonn effectively borrows from Arthurian legend, reshaping it, adding elements of West African and Caribbean folklore and tradition, to create a compelling world and tell a story that packs all kinds of punches.Bree Matthews is 16 years old but has been admitted to the “Early College” program at UNC–Chapel Hill. She is grieving the loss of her mother in a car crash, and she isn’t feeling very grounded. Soon after the start of the school year, Bree gets caught up in an on-campus club of sorts that seems to be playing at being a secret society—except that Bree quickly discovers there’s definitely something supernatural at play, and it might be connected to her mother’s death. Determined to play detective, Bree infiltrates this society and gets closer to one of its highest-ranking members, who also has his reasons to support her entrance. But enemies lurk in every corner: can Bree get to the bottom of her mother’s death without falling victim to the Shadowborn or those who defend against them?Legendborn is very much a YA novel, and I mean that as a compliment. It is exactly the kind of YA novel I would have loved to read as a teenager—and to be clear, I also loved reading it now as a thirty-something woman, but there is a special joy that I experienced digging into these thick, often fantasy, YA novels when I was in my adolescence. Deonn deploys many of the best (in my opinion) tropes of YA. Bree must undergo trials to initiate herself into the Order. There’s a clear ranking system (and there’s even a little org chart at the back of the book!) and some other rules that get explained along the way, though ultimately they don’t seem that important to the overall story. There is, yes, the will-they-or-won’t-they romance subplot. There’s a best friend who sticks up for Bree even when maybe they shouldn’t. Basically, this book is YA catnip in the best possible way.Beneath all these familiar trappings however beats the heart of a story that is much deeper and more emotional than you might first expect. Bree is a Black girl growing up in the American South, and Deonn—also Black and from North Carolina—weaves this setting and Bree’s heritage into the fabric of the story. The Order’s origins in Europe, its presence here in North Carolina, its involvement in the powerful institutions of past and present—all of it is grounded in an awareness of colonialism and the history of enslavement of African peoples. Bree’s own abilities are connected to the earth, to her ancestors, and the metaphysical journey of self-discovery upon which she embarks pits Indigenous epistemologies against colonial ones. Echoes of Butler and Delany reverberate as Deonn anchors her magic systems and the central conflict of this book in the rich yet bloody history of the American South.Meanwhile, Bree personally is dealing with a lot of grief. I love how her understanding of the events that unfolded the night of her mother’s death evolves as the story itself goes on. The new information that comes to light, the way it changes how Bree sees the Order and even herself, is fantastic. It just goes to demonstrate how easy it is to latch on to a convenient theory that seems to fit all the available facts only for new facts to entirely upend that theory in favour of something less comfortable.Similarly, I enjoyed how Bree’s enmity with Selwyn evolves as they spend more time in each other’s company. He begins the story as a one-dimensional antagonist within the Order and Bree’s life, yet they reach a kind of detente fuelled by their unlikely common interests. In the same way, the events that drive the climax of the story completely rewrite the hierarchy of the Order and Bree’s place in it, leaving some of Bree’s initial allies—or at least, people disposed to be friendly towards her—uncertain of how they feel towards her now.Deonn has a talent for keeping the story moving, for upsetting existing character dynamics and relationships, and for dropping you into an action scene without much warning. I have very few notes regarding the worldbuilding or the plot itself. My main disappointment hinges around how Bree eventually ends up communing with an ancestor and the way that this fact feels overshadowed by the intensity of the final act’s action sequences. Similarly, the revelations of the ending leave a lot of questions—and while this is obviously meant to be the first book in a series, people who dislike the feeling of a first book as a setup volume might feel disappointed by this. Finally, I take issue with some of the timeline and the rather cavalier way Deonn accelerates things—including healing of injuries—apparently only for reasons of plot. I didn’t need this book to take place over the span of the entire school year, but if I’m remembering correctly (I finished the book over a week ago), it mainly takes place over the first two months of school—but a lot happens!Anyway, I am very glad I borrowed Bloodmarked at the same time and can’t wait to read it soon. This is an excellent start to a new fantasy series with just enough familiarity to be comfortable even as it challenges and perhaps makes you feel a little discomfort over the colonial underpinnings of many of our favourite legends and ideas.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

The eponymous character is a seventeen-year-old boy with a serious crush on his online gaming buddy. When they get a chance to meet offline—but his buddy doesn’t know it—Noah takes it upon himself to launch an epic plan to win this guy’s love. It gets steamy, it gets hot-and-heavy, it gets recriminatory—everything you might want in terms of drama from a romance. Thank you to NetGalley and Page Street Publishing for the eARC in exchange for a .The characters feel really age appropriate in how Madden portrays them, especially in the obvious mistakes they make. You know what I mean: things that we might roll our eyes at, knowing better both as older readers and as members of the audience rather than participants in the story. For example, Noah gets bullied at his private school, but he refuses to tell his vice principal who’s bullying him for fear of greater reprisals. It’s also obvious that lying to Eli isn’t a great idea, or that going to the gym with Alex is going to cause problems—but these things aren’t obvious to Noah, who is in the middle of the story and who is a seventeen-year-old boy hopped up on hormones. Madden has a talent for walking that line between “makes sense for a teenager” and “well that was just for the sake of plot” in a way that errs on the side of the former, keeping the story interesting without veering into the unbelievable territory.It also helps that many of the antagonistic characters have good reasons (from their perspective) for not liking Noah, who himself is quite flawed. The way that Madden takes time to flesh out these other characters and explore their motivations, whether it’s through conversations overheard or heart-to-hearts with Noah, balances the overt melodrama of his relationship with them.There were a few characters or situations where I felt like this didn’t hold true. Noah’s dad is basically a cipher for the entire book: he exists and is a stereotypical mostly absent father figure, and I wish Madden had explored that more thoroughly. Similarly, some of the secrets—what’s going on with Noah’s mom, the big event that broke up Noah and his former best friend, etc.—are not all that surprising when finally revealed. Finally, Noah’s sister, Charly, has some of her own shit going on, which I appreciate—but she largely exists to be a voice in Noah’s head, via text message.I guess what I’m trying to say is that Take a Bow, Noah Mitchell is very dramatic in a way that you might expect for a novel involving a lot of theatre people. Its main character is flawed in a sympathetic way and makes a lot of mistakes. I know that some people will decry this book being marketed as a romance because it lacks a Happily Ever After (HEA). That’s totally valid—I shelved it as romance because, for me, that label describes what’s happening in the book rather than the actual romance genre, but I wanted to be clear in my  for anyone reading this who needs a heads up. I think the ending is realistic and appropriate given the mistakes Noah makes in this book, and there is hope for a happy ending in the future, but frankly if Eli had ended up forgiving Noah so quickly, I would have been a lot more frustrated. So blame the publisher, not the author, for the classification here: as long as you know not to expect an HEA, I think you could still enjoy the romantic aspects of this book.So I will recommend Take a Bow, Noah Mitchell if you want a reasonably dramatic portrayal of a m/m YA love story. The pacing is good, the characters are mostly well drawn and interesting, and the plot takes appropriate twists and turns to hold your interest.

While I won’As I’ve noted in other s, perhaps most recently Refusing Compulsory Sexuality, being ace (asexual) in our society is no picnic. While I won’t deny there are benefits to opting out of the compulsory sexuality of our society, the fact that we must, indeed, opt out is problematic. In particular, I think that many a-spec people have a hard time figuring out their labels—partly because asexuality encompasses a lot of overlapping identities, but also because, as a phenomenon, it remains either erased/ignored or misrepresented/misunderstood. With Ace Voices: What it Means to Be Asexual, Aromantic, Demi or Grey-Ace, Eris Young seeks to change that. Thank you to Jessica Kingsley Publishers and NetGalley for the eARC in exchange for a !Young examines their understanding of their own asexuality (and how it intersects with other aspects of their identity, such as being transgender). Along the way, they cover some basic definitions (ever wondered what the difference is between being demisexual versus grey-asexual?) and include excerpts from interviews and surveys, both ones they conducted personally and others conducted through organizations like AVEN. The result is a book that is at times personal but overall attempts to affirm that there is no one right way to be asexual.This in and of itself is crucial, for one of our major struggles within and outside of queer spaces is being misunderstood. Sometimes it’s a conflation of asexuality with celibacy or prudery. Sometimes we do it ourselves in a rush to explain that “don’t worry, ace people still have sex/‘normal’ romantic feelings!” to make aces seem less Other. Whatever the case, asexuality is as vulnerable to gatekeeping and misunderstanding as any other umbrella identity within the larger queer tent.Let’s get the critiques out of the way first. Young’s writing style, and perhaps more importantly, their organizational style, doesn’t entirely work for me. The book kind of jumps around from topic to topic without a clear through line. This might just be a personal hang-up when it comes to non-fiction, but I actually like a narrative. I like chapters with framing stories and inciting incidents. This book is more of a collection of essays and ideas, and while that isn’t bad, it also hasn’t done more for me than inform me.That being said, I appreciate how this book tries to cover a lot of ground. Young’s voice is passionate, knowledgeable, but also humble. They make it clear that they are not trying to be the authority—or even an authority—on asexuality. This humility makes the book more approachable and accessible.Indeed, I think there are two good audiences for this book. First, young ace or a-spec-questioning people who want to learn more about asexuality without diving too far an academic rabbit hole. Ace Voices definitely checks that “overview/introductory text” box. The second audience, in contrast, would be allosexual/alloromantic people.See, even as publishing opens up its doors to more diverse books, I think we still face a problem of siloing. This is true for fiction—Black authors, for example, are regularly told their books don’t have “crossover appeal,” whereas apparently white authors’ books just appeal to everyone naturally? It’s true for non-fiction too. Memoirs and other books that foreground queer experiences become marketed to queer people—especially young queer people, as inspiration fodder. There is nothing wrong with that in and of itself. However, I want to challenge non-queer people to seek out books about queerness. I want to challenge allosexual or alloromantic people to learn more about asexuality and aromanticism—and this book would be a good place for you to start.I’m reminded of a similar book about trans people that I read in 2017. The author was cis, and you can imagine how bad it was at covering the subject as a result and accurately representing trans people’s voices (I am not even going to link to it in this , it was so bad). Young’s authenticity in this space, the way they share their experience while also making room for experiences that are different, is so important. Overall, Ace Voices didn’t jump out at me as something spectacular. But it’s very solid, and it’s exciting to see books like this published, finally.

As much as I find fiction shorter than a novel less enjoyable in general, some stories are just better as short stories, novelettes, or—as in the case of A Spindle Splintered—novellas. This multiversal reimagining of Sleeping Beauty is a lot of fun, but I think Alix E. Harrow would have had a hard time sustaining the suspense and interest for an entire novel. This is one of a series of wise decisions that result in an eminently enjoyable tale.Zinnia is a dying girl (her words, not mine). No one with her particular teratogenic condition has lived to be twenty-two, and Zinnia just turned twenty-one. On her birthday, she literally pricks her finger on a spindle and finds herself in a fairy tale, complete with a princess—also cursed—a castle, a prince, an evil fairy, etc. Fortunately, Zinnia is Genre Savvy, having become obsessed with the parallels between her life and the Sleeping Beauty story to the point where she has a degree in folklore. To this end, Zinnia seeks to hijack the narrative and give herself and her new princess friend a happily ever after.I won’t spoil the story by discussing whether they get it!As with The Once and Future Witches, this book is about stories and how our telling of stories can actually reify them. I am a sucker for such metafictional and epistemological ideas about literature, of course. The obvious comparison here is Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, which Harrow makes herself in her acknowledgements, and it is apt. She brings together different threads of the same tapestry, if you will, and much like the comic book movie, demonstrates how we as a species hunger to tell and retell the same stories over and over again.Layered atop that is some commentary on gender and sexuality, on misogyny and ableism and how we treat those who are women, who are chronically ill, etc. It’s actually rather ambitious for a novella, and I don’t know if Harrow completely succeeds in this task, but it’s an admirable effort that results in some excellent lines, especially when Zinnia meditates on how painful she finds the unconditional love she receives from her parents and Charm. This is a book of pretty surface yet sharp edges.I liked the ending, without giving too much away. Harrow has a fine line to walk between hope and despair, trying to come up with something not too trite yet also not unbearably tragic. It is fitting, I think, for a remix.At the end of the day, this is not a revolutionary book. But it was an enjoyable diversion for an afternoon. I think for a younger reader, just coming into feminist literary theory and fairy tales, this book could spark a curiosity that would lead them deeper into Angela Carter et al—and that thirst, that desire to know more, is one of the greatest gifts a book can give anyone.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Cloud Cuckoo Land sounds like it should be my cup of tea. It’s reminiscent in some ways of Sea of Tranquility. As gripping as some parts of this book were, other parts were a snooze fest. Anthony Doerr has clearly put a lot of work into this story, from research to setting and characters—and I want to be clear that I think there’s something here. I’m just not sure it becomes a unified story in a way that I consider satisfying.This book is framed around a lost Diogenes story that tells of a foolish man named Aethon who, among other misadventures, visits a fantastical land—Cloud Cuckoo Land. The chapters take place across different time periods. There’s Constantinople in the years leading up to its invasion and sacking of 1453. There’s the decades leading up to Lakeport, Idaho in 2020, where an eighty-year-old man is putting on a play based on this Diogenes text, which he has been translating from recovered scraps of Greek. At the same time, a young man carries out a domestic terrorist plot that threatens the lives of the man, the children in his charge, and others. Finally, in the near future, a generation ship makes its way to a new home for humanity. One of its occupants becomes obsessed with the Diogenes story, for it is her only link to her father, from whom she has become irrevocably isolated.As you can see, a lot of moving pieces and very difficult to summarize!The chapters are largely short and grouped into short parts, each of which is preceded by a quotation from this lost manuscript. The problem, as is often the case with stories dispersed across such varied time periods, is that not every storyline is as interesting as the next. Oemir and Anna’s stories didn’t grab me as much as Seymour or Zeno’s; similarly, Konstance’s story could be interesting but is such a slow burn. Actually, no, I take that back—all of these stories, with the exception maybe of Oemir’s, feel like a slow burn, and I’m not here for it.Seymour’s characterization and storyline are also problematic, perpetuating a stereotype that links autistic people with terrorism. Doerr portrays Seymour as autistic in a sympathetic way: the descriptions of sensory overload and how Seymour sees the world are consistent with what autistic friends have described to me. Unfortunately, Seymour is also a terrorist. His entire plot involves taking revenge on a company he thinks has wronged him, being radicalized and building a bomb in the process. This idea that autistic people or people with mental illness are more likely to commit terrorist acts—as opposed to, you know, actual fascists, militant white supremacists, etc.—is dangerous. For this alone, I would not recommend Cloud Cuckoo Land.Beyond that, however, this is just a messy and boring book. I can see the value that some have derived from it, for Doerr’s writing has some spellbinding qualities to it. I wanted to immerse myself in each of the worlds here, yet I was constantly yanked away, pulled into the next one, before any real development had occurred. Each of these storylines by themselves might have made for a compelling novel. Merged and entwined as they are, the result is a muddy brown where there should be a riot of rainbow.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Except for This was the December pick for the Rad Roopa Book Club, where we read books aligned with social justice and antiracist thought and praxis. Except for Palestine: The Limits of Progressive Politics is an overview of the history and politics of the twentieth century and first two decades of the twenty-first century as they pertain to attitudes towards Palestine.As a child of the 1990s, as a non-Jewish person growing up in Canada, this has always been a part of modern history that I only vaguely understood. I knew the modern nation-state of Israel as we now know it was created by European powers in 1948, and I had a vague notion about what Palestine was, who Palestinians were, and how they contested Israel’s claim to and presence on that land. But for most of my childhood and adolescence, that vague notion was all I understood. As I lay awake in the middle of the night at 14 years old, I would listen to the BBC World Service talk about Bush bombing Iraq, and these kinds of snippets of news informed my view on the Middle East. Truly, it was “somewhere over there.”Thankfully, I have since broadened my perspective. More newcomers coming to Canada from countries in that region—some by choice, others unfortunately refugees displaced by war or other disasters—has afforded me the opportunity to meet more people and hear their stories, learn about their culture. And I’ve learned more about Israel and Palestine, though I have a lot more learning left to do. Indeed, parts of this book left me slightly confused, for I think Hill and Plitnick assume slightly more familiarity with certain names and events from twentieth-century United States politics than I have!But the one thing that I didn’t really get was why it has been (and remains, in many ways) so taboo to talk about Palestine, even among so-called liberal or progressive groups. This is what Hill and Plitnick are getting at in this book. They do a fair job of representing different perspectives, referencing both Palestinian and Israeli sources, discussing the role of the United States and other world powers, and generally trying to inform. That being said, this is not a book that tries to “both sides” the issue—it is clearly, firmly pro-Palestinian, and its attempts to present other perspectives are there only to help us understand how we got to here, not to equivocate. The conclusion makes this clear if it wasn’t already: the authors view what is happening in Palestine right now as a human rights crisis, and this book is one way they are trying to get more people to pay attention to it as such.My thoughts, of course, turned to Canada’s own domestic crisis of colonialism and genocide with the Indigenous peoples from whom Europeans stole this land several centuries ago. The trend right now when talking reconciliation here is to locate that harm as history. In reality, you just have to look at the actions of current governments and institutions to see that colonialism is still happening here. This helps to explain partly why Canada and other states support Israel and, by and large, don’t want to acknowledge what is happening in Palestine or to Palestinians: we are doing it here too.Except for Palestine highlights that, until now, few world leaders have been willing to appear “anti-Israel” because of how easily this is conflated with being antisemitic. They caution us not to view President Trump’s friendship and concessions towards Israel as an incredible outlier, showing that even past Democratic presidents were generally pro-Israel, albeit in a way that walked the line more finely. So much of politics in horse trading: you give me something, and I’ll give you this back, even if it’s not really something I want to do because at least I get something I want.Although often verging on the academic and cerebral side, this book also makes itself accessible to us through oral history. Interviews or excerpts from news reports provide context for the Palestinian experience in Gaza, the West Bank, or abroad. This book is far from comprehensive and doesn’t go too deep; however, you’ll come away with at least a general understanding of the conditions Palestinians experience today, the human rights violations, and the violence.I would have liked the authors to cover more about how Palestine is erased from leftist discourse in general. The book mostly focuses on formal, political speech. How is Palestine ignored or erased in our pop culture? In our memes? Online? How does this connect to intersectional marginalizations—queer Palestinian experiences, disabled Palestinian experiences, etc. That’s probably a wider scope than this book could cover, but these are the questions that are coming to mind now that I’ve read it.I would recommend this for people with an interest in politics and history. As I said at the start of this , the book assumes a certain amount of prior knowledge that maybe I fell short of; nevertheless, I muddled through (thanks, Google!). Clearly I have more learning to do on this subject. Still, Except for Palestine is informative and deep, helping me fill in gaps in my knowledge and helping me ask that all-important question: why? The world isn’t the way it is just because; there are so many whys, and now I know some more of them.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Novels are my jam when it comes to fiction, short stories and novelettes aAs I’ve said in the past, I am very selective about the anthologies I read. Novels are my jam when it comes to fiction, short stories and novelettes and novellas much less so. Nevertheless, when Derek Künsken’s collection Flight from the Ages And Other Stories came up on NetGalley, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to request an eARC for . Künsken might fast become one of my favourite living science-fiction authors. Ever since I read The Quantum Magician, I’ve enjoyed his ability to balance the novum of science fiction with the need to tell human stories. This collection is no exception—if anything, it showcases that ability even more prominently.I know it’s customary to  the individual stories in a collection, especially one this small, but I don’t want to, and this is my book , so you can’t make me! Instead, I want to talk about how all of these stories form a unified view of science fiction and why that works for me.Each story takes place within the shared universe of Künsken’s imagination, the same one that his Quantum Evolution and Venus Ascendant series are set in (though most of these stories, it should be noted, were written and published prior to those novels being written). So if you have read Künsken’s novels, you will recognize many of the settings, species, and even a few of the characters. I do love when an author returns to the same universe over and over, and it’s clear Künsken has put a lot of thought into developing this one.Künsken cites Alastair Reynolds and Stephen Baxter as among his influences and even drops Galactic North by the former as an inspiration and recommendation in the preface to this collection. Now, I read a lot of Baxter when I was a teenager, just before I started ing every book, so I don’t have many s up for his works. But his writing always left me cold. Kind of like Greg Egan, his attitude towards humanity in his science fiction was so unbearably distant and utilitarian—he had zoomed the camera so far out (or so far in, to the quantum level) that as impressive as his ideas might have been, I couldn’t get behind his characters. Reynolds, on the other hand, is definitely up there on my list of great living SF authors—and I would happily compare Künsken to him.There was a time when we might have said that these authors write what we call hard science fiction, though I think that term has blissfully outlived its usefulness in this day and age. Suffice it to say, Künsken and Reynolds both come from scientific backgrounds, and their SF is indeed quite embedded within a scientific framework, albeit one that relies on an artistic interpretation of quantum mechanical theory that is far more forgiving and flexible than our current understanding of the universe. Sometimes authors push that flexibility too far, verging into Clarkian “sufficiently advanced science” science-fantasy territory—and indeed, it can be really difficult to see where we draw the line.I think what allows authors like Künsken and Reynolds to avoid that pitfall, however, is their need to focus on the humanity of their storytelling. This isn’t always obvious at first glance—“Schools of Clay” has no human beings in it, and “Beneath Sunlit Shallows” is about a protagonist who is literally condemning his ancestors for tinkering with his genome to the point where he is no longer recognizably human. Yet each of these stories is poignantly, perhaps even painfully, about very human traits: desiring, yearning, needing to belong and be a part of something bigger. The ensoulled skates, Homo eridanus, a Venusian Quebecoise engineer, a grieving military auditor, a traumatized artificial intelligence, a group of near-future Miao people in provincial China … through all of these characters, Künsken reflects on what it is that makes us human. And that is the ultimate goal of science fiction. If an author manages to do that, they usually have me hooked.But there’s more to it still. See, a lot of our science fiction at the moment is quite dystopian. This doesn’t surprise me, given the state of our world. These trends tend to move in cycles, reflecting the optimism or pessimism of an era. And some dystopian or post-apocalyptic fiction can be painfully good—but it’s still all so depressing, and I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we are going into like the third year of a pandemic that most of the governments of the world seem to have decided to pretend is over, and it’s … it’s all rather a lot right now, and I want to read happy things. Or, you know, if not happy, then at least not terminally sad.Take artificial intelligence, for example. Present in most of these stories to one degree or another, it is in Tool Use By Humans of Danzhai County that we come to its most salient usage vis-à-vis contemporary AI. I was half-expecting, as I read the story, for the AIs being developed by the main characters to go rogue and, you know, take us over in a sinister and dystopian way. And they kind of do—go rogue, that is, and perhaps even take over, but in a much more utopian way. And I needed that.Here I am, doomscrolling on a Musk-infested Twitter far more often than I care to admit, watching people discuss the pros and cons of GPT-fuelled text-generating AIs and Stable Diffusion image-generating AIs and thinking about whether we’re entering the post-truth era, an era of chaotic pornographic deepfakes and undetectably plagiarized student essays and everything in between. For all that the hawkers of modern AI services proclaim them to be revolutionary, they certainly seem underwhelming at best and dangerous at worst—and so much of our modern science fiction seems determined to emphasize the dangers.Along comes Derek Künsken, who has the sheer, unmitigated gall not only to write stories where AIs are helpful and benevolent but to explore how humans can develop them to be that way.Seriously, the nerve of this man.See, that’s the kicker: we have to choose this future. Künsken has hit on the crux of the matter when it comes to AI—or really any technology—a truth that many science-fiction authors explore but few truly succeed at examining so cleanly. We build our future through the choices we make. AI is not the end of the world any more than fossil fuel use or nuclear weapons have to be. It isn’t our tools but our tool use (oh there’s that title of the novella now) that defines us.This theme, so elegantly presented in the final story of this collection, reverberates backwards through the earlier stories much like Künsken’s protagonists so often seem to be involved in anachronistic, atemporal shenanigans. That is the value of reading these stories collected rather than in isolation across various magazines: once you finish this collection, you could easily go back to the start and read it again, and you’ll come away changed once more, iteratively so, because these stories form of a feedback loop of a kind. They pose tough questions about what it means to be human, about the choices we should make as individuals and as a species, asking us what we want our future to be. The stories also go further, reminding us that although there is indeed something quite special about humanity, ours is not the sole inheritor of this universe; the stories challenge the Eurocentric, colonial arrogance that we are the most superior form of life there could ever be. Maybe humans don’t make it to the end of the universe—and beyond—but life will go on.And Künsken dares to dream of a future where, sure, there is still conflict and war and betrayal and sadness … but there is also a hell of a lot of compassion and empathy and love and hope, and that is a message I feel a lot of contemporary science fiction has buried. Again, I’m not yucking your yum if the dark, gritty stories are your cup of tea. But Künsken is steeping my tea the way I like it: big and bold, brash even, with some very Canadian humour and some difficult ideas and just a dash of quantum weirdness.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Brown introduced me to the term chrononormativity when I read Refusing Compulsory Sexuality, and that made a lot of things click for me. So When Are You Having Kids?: The Definitive Guide for Those Who Aren't Sure If, When, or How They Want to Become Parents is a practical guide for addressing a very specific aspect of chrononormativity (which is the expectation that your life will unfold in a predictable, progressive, mostly linear path). Jordan Davidson’s look at the important decisions and facts around having kids is incisive, inclusive, and extremely comprehensive. This is the kind of book I think a lot of young adults need access to!I received an eARC from NetGalley and Sounds True Books in exchange for a . I was drawn to So When Are You Having Kids? because of its promise to truly include gender and sexual diversity in its discussion of childbearing and childrearing. Davidson does her best to include as many different perspectives and experiences in the book. There are first-person testimonials from people of all shape, ability, and genders—yes, this is a book that boldly announces up front it will be gender-inclusive, and it follows through in its language and the people Davidson interviews. From cis men and women to non-binary folx, straight to gay to bi or pan or ace, from people who can get pregnant to those who can’t—this is a book that acknowledges that there is far more to a family than one man, one woman, and the hope that baby will make three.This is valuable to me. When I was a kid, of course, thanks to chrononormativity I just kind of assumed I would be a parent, likely of biological children, one day. Yet as I grew up, I learned a lot about myself. I’m asexual and aromantic. Neither of these identities precludes me from having children, of course, but it is one way in which I diverged from the heteronormative narrative. Then, a few years ago, I realized I’m trans. As Davidson explores in this book, trans people often face steep challenges when having kids—not just as a result of the rising tide of discrimination and stigma, but also because of gender dysphoria and financial pressures that make it harder to access gender-affirming care.So as I move through my thirties, my life looks a lot different from how teenage Kara imagined it. And I’m ok with that! I want to be the cool aunt who takes care of my friends’ kids so they can smash. I want to be the one who is available for a late-night phone chat because I’m not exhausted taking care of my own littles. I want to build a big, big chosen family around me full of people from all kinds of backgrounds—people with kids, people without kids—who take care of me and are taken care of by me in return. I don’t need biological children to do that.But boy, was this book ever a fascinating education about having children!See, I came for the inclusivity but I stayed for the science. Each chapter here was a revelation. Like, I think I have a reasonably good level of sexual education—certainly more than, alas, your average American, and probably more than most Canadian chicky boos too. But Davidson has done her research, oh my. First with the social science—stats upon studies of information about who’s doing it, at what age, or why we’re not doing it. A lot of this connects with things I’ve read in other books, like The Burnout Generation or treatises on climate change. Then with the biology: how ovulation, fertilization, and implantation actually happens. There’s also a lot of information on the expense of having a kid, a chapter that is very US-focused and reminds me of how important it is to stop Doug Ford from privatizing our Canadian healthcare system.If you have a question about having kids, the answer is probably in this book.There’s also a whole section dedicated to not having kids! I would have liked to see a little more time spent on reproductive rights and abortion rights—the book includes testimonials from some people who have had abortions, and Davidson does mention that women (we do not have much data for other genders who can become pregnant) who delay having children tend to be more successful and satisfied in other areas of their lives. However, given the political climate around abortion access in the US right now, I wish this book had been louder in pushing for a conversation around why protecting abortion access is important.Our society puts a lot of pressure on us—especially women—to have kids. (My bestie and I did a whole podcast episode about this.) As Davidson remarks early in the book, we are expected to justify a decision not to have children, yet we seldom, if ever, ask people why they have children. And whatever your stance on our evolutionary duty to pass on our genes, the fact remains that many people for a variety of reasons cannot have kids, cannot even be parents to adopted kids, no matter how much they might want to. On the flip side, many people who think they will never have kids end up becoming parents through one turn of events or another.This was what stuck with me the most from this book: the sheer unpredictability of life. The fact that we cannot have it all. As always, I come back to My Real Children, by Jo Walton, which follows one woman across two parallel lives. We can’t have kids and also not have kids, and as much as we try to steer our lives, nudge them along certain trajectories, external events will always shape those paths as well.Oh yeah, this book gave me the philosophical feels, big time.So When Are You Having Kids? is a fusion of fact and testimonial: each is powerful on its own, but the combination of the two makes this book extremely satisfying. As much as I learned a lot from the science, I also just enjoyed hearing all the varied stories from the voices that Davidson includes. This is a book I would recommend to anyone starting their journey into adulthood, anyone considering having kids—or not having them—and especially couples pondering if they want to become parents together. This is a book that will spark conversations, pose hard questions, offer advice on finding the answers to those questions, and help you become more prepared to navigate a world that insists it knows what you should want.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

However, I was able to borrow The World We Make and the first book, The City We Became, at the same time from my library. After I finished the first book, I decided that it made sense for me to dive into its sequel right away, before I forget anything about the series. I’m not mad about that decision!Spoilers for the first book in the series but not for what happens in this one!N.K. Jemisin picks up three months after the end of the first book. The five avatars of New York, along with the primary, who has taken the name Neek, are settling into their roles as embodiments of a living city. They are still missing among their number Aislyn/Staten Island, who has holed up in her borough and invited the Enemy—now known as R’lyeh—to establish a foothold in this reality. But the attacks on New York City are less extradimensional, more mundane—like a xenophobic senator running for mayor. Meanwhile, Manny tries to convince the other cities to convene a meeting. He’s convinced that they need to work together to defeat the Enemy, but very few of the elder cities are interested in listening to an upstart like New York.In many ways this book is more explicitly political than the first book (which predated the pandemic). The City We Became is socially aware and pushes back against set-pieces of injustice in our society, like white supremacy. However, The World We Make takes that much further. In particular, Brooklyn’s decision to oppose Senator Panfilo’s run for mayor allows Jemisin to examine the tensions present in any battle for systemic change. Once again I find myself admiring how she allows the avatars to be so different. Bronca and Brooklyn both very much want the same thing, but their differences in age, sexuality, etc., mean that they don’t always agree (or even get along). Veneza is far more open to reconciling with Aislyn than the others (perhaps because, as Jersey City, she knows what it is like to be of New York but an outsider to New York at the same time).Indeed, as I explored in my  of Sea of Tranquility recently, science fiction often does its best work in liminal spaces. This book is yet another great example. Jemisin’s palette is at once explosively colourful, expressive, celebratory of diversity of personhood and thought and at the same time easily described as shades of grey—that is, very little about what happens in this book is black-and-white. The ambiguous character of R’lyeh probably demonstrates that best, though I won’t go into more specifics!The World We Make also delves more into the metaphysical aspects of the multiverse. This is my sweet spot (as I noted in my  of the first book, I have a particular affinity for Padmini), but other readers might find it less entertaining. I love the discussion of kugelblitzes and Schrödinger equations and observational collapse. Jemisin manages to strike a balance, in my opinion, between trying to make it sound too sensible versus turning it into so much quantum babble. The concept of cities as they relate to the multiverse, Rl’yeh’s role, the mysterious Ur, etc., is pretty cool, and it is one of the two elements of the story I’d love to have seen explored further.(Also, while we’re shouting out my affinity for Padmini: I squeed when Jemisin reveals that Padmini is, it seems, asexual or at least ace-spec—the specific label isn’t used on page, but she says she isn’t attracted to men or women. Any time I run across a casually ace character in my fiction, I am excite!)The other element is what’s up with Manny, his family, and what he apparently already knew before he came to New York City. There is so much more that Jemisin could do with this series. Alas, as she writes in the acknowledgements, her plan for this to be a trilogy was curtailed because of the pandemic’s effect on how she views the series—and I can’t blame her for that. I appreciate we got at least this much to close out this particular story, even if she has no plans for more at this point.I liked this book both more and less than the first book. More because it’s more multiversal, as I just discussed. More because the plot gives us more time to breathe and enjoy each of these intensely different, nuanced characters. Less because the wrap-up is a bit rushed. Less because, in some ways, parts of the storytelling feel less nuanced or more obvious than they did in the first book. I don’t know—I’m going to give it four stars to tie it with The City We Became because it is very good, and I do think that if you like the first book, you should close out the duology. Plus, I think this is consistent with my personal experience of reading Jemisin to this point: fantastic writer and storyteller whose style kind of works for me but also kind of doesn’t, which is totally fine. I’m just glad she keeps bringing this level of creativity to the fields of fantasy and science fiction.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I’m going to do my best only to remark on this book in this .New York is … alive. Or at least, it is in the process of being born. Cities can erupt into a kind of multidimensional sapience and are, as a part of this processed, embodied through human avatars. While most cities only have a single avatar, some, like New York City, are so diverse and varied that there is a single, primary avatar and then others who represent each part of the city—the five boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The City We Became follows these five avatars as they struggle against an extradimensional Enemy trying to kill New York City and race to locate the primary, who lies somewhere in the city, comatose after his battle for the city’s birth.Immediately evident here is Jemisin’s understanding of the differences between the boroughs. I’ve never been to New York City, so everything I know about it comes from our media. Jemisin, in the acknowledgements, describes herself as about 50 percent New Yorker at this point, an interesting way of situating herself in relation to the city. In any event, it’s clear she put a lot of thought into who would represent each borough and the way their personalities reflect and amplify the demographics of their borough. Similarly, the other cities we meet in the book have their own personalities that match Jemisin’s impression of those cities.Much of the story involves fending off feints and direct attacks from the Enemy, personified as the Woman in White. Depending on which borough we’re following, the Woman in White’s attacks come in different forms. I love how Padmini/Queens is the Math Queen, visualizing her defences as equations. In contrast, Bronca/the Bronx’s arts background and deep connections to community liberation mean that her defences manifest more metaphorically. Brooklyn has music, Manny has money, and Aislyn’s is grounded in the spirit of decency she believes to be at the core of Staten Island. The plot’s structure can make it feel a bit on rails at times, with the protagonists lurching from one crisis to the next, barely getting a chance to breathe. But I think Jemisin does a good job of making sure there is enough substance to these events to make the story matter.Take, for instance, Bronca’s struggle against the Better New York Foundation’s attempts to back an alt-right artist group’s attempts to get into the gallery where she is director. The attitudes of the white supremacists will be familiar to anyone following the rising tide of fascism in the US, and this book—having been written in 2019—reminds us just how long this movement has been building. The depiction of Bronca and her allies fighting back against the alt-right attempt to manipulate the narrative and paint themselves as victims feels just as relevant today as it does now.The Enemy is similarly sinister in its attempts to befriend Aislyn and separate her from the other avatars. As the sole white person in the group, Aislyn, like the borough she embodies, already feels out of place in New York City. Jemisin doesn’t hold back in her portrayal of white fragility; at the same time, however, I like that Aislyn is just as nuanced and deep a character as any of the others—she is an exploration of why white women can be so fragile rather than a caricature of that fragility.These are the reasons The City We Became has so much merit, in my view. Despite the conflict itself being quite simple, albeit cloaked in the language of science fiction, the characters and their struggles—both personally and on the city level—are easy for us to relate to. Jemisin has truly embraced the complex, messy, contradictory nature of New York City. It’s a truism to talk about a setting, often a city, is a character in a story—in this case, it is literally true.Jemisin is also making an argument in favour of cities themselves as testaments to human achievements. (She explicitly acknowledges that Indigenous civilizations in the Americas had cities here pre-contact.) It’s trendy among some circles these days to look down at cities as a symptom of capitalism and colonization: cities are the antithesis of the “simpler times” that people want to call back to. They are polluted, crowded, menacing, lonely places—right? But Jemisin challenges this one-sided narrative. She doesn’t romanticize cities, mind you, which is why she has her characters wrestle with issues like New York’s historical connections to colonialism and genocide. But this book is, in many ways, a love letter to the human ability to come together and create. Not being a New Yorker, the ending of the book doesn’t have me cheering, “rah rah, New York!” but it did make me smile.The City We Became is a very satisfying type of modern science fiction. Borrowing from the back catalogue of Lovecraft and the theories of many worlds and multiverses, this book delivers a healthy dose of what if alongside a hell of a lot of personality and pizazz, and I like that.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Heather Radke—a curvy, queer white woman—wanted to know why we’re so hooked on butts, and because she’s a journalist, naturally she wants all of us to know why too. Frankly, I’m glad. Thanks to NetGalley and Avid Reader Press for the eARC in exchange for a .Radke quickly rejects evolutionary psychological explanations for our obsession with butts. She thoroughly explains why evolutionary psychology, unlike evolutionary biology, is unreliable and pseudoscientific. While we have plenty of possible theories for the adaptive value of the butt, its role in sexual selection might forever be occluded by that pesky thing called culture.So Radke investigates how, in Western society at least, we started to care so much about what was behind us. She begins the story in South Africa and London, tracing the life as best she can of Sarah Baartman, a Khoe woman who became better known as the “Venus Hottentot.” Is it any surprise that our obsession with butts is wrapped up in Europe’s history of white supremacy? Of course not. For centuries now, white Europeans have sought to hypersexualize and dehumanize people of African descent. Therefore it is no coincidence that big butts became associated with Black people while the ideal—embodied, of course, by white people—was a flat, more demure behind.From this inauspicious beginning, Radke moves through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Much of our journey centres upon fashion: the bustle, changing hemlines, the flappers, etc. Some of it, too, is rooted in celebrity and media, from the starlets of the early twentieth century to the models and music videos of the nineties. Exercise fads and diets come and go. The one constant? Change. Sometimes big butts are in, sometimes out. The message, however, is the same: for women, your butt is a synecdoche. A sign of how well you meet your generation’s ideal of femininity.Radke echoes this in some of her personal anecdotes throughout the book. She would tag along, as a young girl, on her mother’s shopping mall trips. Changing room try-ons and the betrayals of clothes—or bodies. For, you see, that’s how Radke reports her mother framing the situation, language that she then inherited: my butt is too big. Never that the clothes are wrong, but rather her body is wrong. Whoa.So of course I thought about my body. All my life I have had thin privilege, have never had to contend with being called or understood to be fat. Most of my problems with clothes not fitting are a result of my height rather than waist, hips, or weight. As an asexual person, I didn’t really pay much attention to others’ bodies, and I never thought of myself as a sexual being—and because, for the first thirty years of my life, we all thought I was a man, most of the world seemed content to let that be the case.I thought my issues with my body came largely from how it was changing as my metabolism slowed. Then I realized no, it was because deep down I knew my body didn’t match with my idea of who I am, especially my gender.Transition, then, has done wonders for my confidence in my body. But the euphoria I feel from how my body changes—hair growing, skin softening, curves emerging—is also accompanied by the unease that many women feel in our society. I want curves because I want to feel more feminine, yes, but surely some of my desire for a curvy booty comes from internalized ideas of beauty from my coming-of-age in the first decade of the twenty-first century.So here I am in this liminal space of wanting to accept my body as it is yet also wanting to change it. Therefore, despite the butt holding very little fascination for me as a symbol of sexual attraction, I definitely understand the hold it has over us as a symbol of femininity, of my femininity. Reading Butts has helped me think about my body against the backdrop of our wider cultural and historical zeitgeist.This is a thoughtful, thorough treatment of a topic that many might dismiss as childish or prurient. Their loss. I might not be enamoured with butts, but I was enamoured with Butts.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

We humans are so immured in the linearity of time that these possibilities can be tantalizing, frightening, and even bewildering. Add on top of that metafiction, the idea of a story escaping itself into the real world, and you get some truly fascinating plot ideas. Sea of Tranquility tries to create such an atmosphere of possibility. Though I wouldn’t say that Emily St. John Mandel entirely succeeds in this endeavour, I still respect the big swing and enjoyed the experience.We start in 1912 with Edwin St. John St. Andrew, eighteen years old and newly exiled by his English family to Canada. He ends up on Vancouver Island, where he witnesses something strange in the forest—he hears violin music, and for a moment appears to be in a strange place, before the forest returns. This event unites him with a woman in an airship terminal in the 2090s, and an investigator on a colony on the Moon centuries later still. Is reality slipping? What’s going on?Like so much about time travel, this book feels at times very sad. Knowing the future can be a burden—but so too can knowing the past. Gaspery knows how Edwin and Olive each died, for example. And eventually he puts together his own fate thanks to working out the paradox at which he is the centre. He seems resigned rather than resentful of this turn of events. If our future is fixed, are we better off not knowing it? If we learn it, like Gaspery does, what can we do about it? I think it’s so fascinating that Gaspery desperately wants to change the fates of others yet ultimately embraces his own.Yet, as Vonnegut reflected in Slaughterhouse-Five, experiencing time out of order means that your loved ones are never really dead either. That’s the case of Gaspery and Zoey, for example. Having the privilege of stepping out of time only to step back in a moment later from one person’s perspective but days, months, years from yours—with no more effort, apparently, than leaving and reentering the room—that’s intriguing.Although the title is partially a reference to one of the book’s settings, I also see it as a thematic nod. Each of these characters have something in common (beyond witnessing the anomaly)—they’re just living their lives. They aren’t engaged in any venture more significant than simply going about their everyday life, and there is value in that. I think this is Mandel’s jam, if I recall correctly from Station Eleven, a book I enjoyed but don’t really care to revisit (or watch as a TV series) having gone through a pandemic of my own.Perhaps this is why Mandel, like many other Canadian science-fiction authors like Margaret Atwood, has successfully broken into the mainstream and received the coveted “speculative fiction” label. This is a book about straight-up time travel, but if you read the description or see where it gets shelved (though my library, rightly, put it under science fiction) you’ll see the attempt to litwash it. I’m not complaining, mind you—I am all for sneaking more science fiction into the mainstream, and the success of properties from Westworld to Marvel movies suggests that people have never been more receptive to it. But I think it’s important to point out, whenever I see it, the double standard, the way that some novels are treated as literature and others as pulp even to do this day based mostly on vibes and marketing.As for the plot? Eh. Mandel warns us fairly early in the book, foreshadows it even, by having a character talk about reading a novel which was really a series of stories where the characters don’t quite meet up. I thought a lot of Cloud Atlas when I was reading this. To be fair to Sea of Tranquility, there is a larger plot chugging along in the background, a tantalizing philosophical question hanging over our characters like a Sword of Damocles. But the resolution to that question belies its importance, in fact, to any of the characters. It’s not really about the question or even about the journey. There are whispers of a cabal, implications of shadowy figures manipulating events from afar. None of this is ever reified, however, in any truly fulfilling way. That might be for the best—this would be a very different book if such things had been more prominent—but it also leaves the novel feeling more shallow than I expected. It feels almost like it could have been a novella for the amount of ideas happening on the page.Fortunately, I still enjoyed the experience of reading the book. Mandel’s writing is as meditative as it was six years ago. I’m glad I went on this little science-fictional adventure!Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Lessons My bestie Rebecca lent this to me, and I am glad she did—I don’t think I would have picked it up otherwise, and that would have been my loss. Lessons in Chemistry stands out. It is quite a literary novel, full of narrative tricks and idiosyncrasies and enough contrived character circumstances to make John Irving or Heather O’Neill jealous. But Bonnie Garmus is on a mission in this book. She’s laser-focused on the unfairness of life—not just in terms of institutional sexism but also the way in which life robs us of the ones we love the most. This is a sad yet hopeful story that made me laugh and cry, and sometimes those are the best.Elizabeth Zott is a chemist. She would be a PhD., except for—well, you know, she’s a woman in science in the 1960s. So she ends up as a researcher at a small institute in California, where she unexpectedly falls in love with Calvin Evans, the institute’s brightest and most eccentric researcher. But when Calvin dies, Elizabeth is left as a single (unwed!) mom, and sexism continue to impede her ability to earn money or move forward in the world. Opportunity arrives in the form of an afternoon cooking show—for Elizabeth to host—but neither the television producer who discovers her nor Elizabeth herself know what to make of the success of Supper at Six. Meanwhile, Elizabeth tries to raise her precocious daughter, Mad, the only way she knows how: scientifically.There’s probably many ways for this book to lose the reader. Garmus’s narration is, by and large, flat albeit extensive in description, prone to tangents and meandering towards its point. The dialogue sputters onto the page in fits and spurts before drying up again. Each chapter flits between times and memories, occasionally with an attention span so frenetic it’s hard to read. The characters are caricatures—some of them so sexist and boorish it borders on the incredible, others so buffoonish or farcical as to nearly undermine the seriousness of the story. But I think that’s rather the point, and that’s kind of what Garmus is getting at here—sexism is silly.This is a story about a woman who refuses to settle. Throughout Lessons in Chemistry, so many people—including other women—tell Elizabeth that she just has to accept the way the world is. Maybe you can make a little headway, but eventually you have to give in and play by the patriarchy’s rules. You have to be a Miss Frask instead of an Elizabeth Zott.Garmus perfectly portrays so many of the tropes I see in social justice spaces—women weighed down by so much internalized misogyny it’s painful to see; men who profess to be allies but only if it means you’ll sit down now, please, you’re being disruptive; people of all genders who stand with you and mean well but really don’t understand just how far the fight for liberation must go. From Frask to Walter to Harriet, the characters jump off the page because they are caricatures.Indeed, Lessons in Chemistry rather feels like Garmus is screaming into the void. Because the world has not changed much since the 1960s.Last year I watched Picture a Scientist, a Netflix documentary about historical and present-day sexual harassment in science. While the language we use and some laws have changed, what Elizabeth experiences here remains very much part of women and non-binary people’s experiences in science. Moreover, if there is a flaw in this book, it is the whiteness of it—racialized women continue to face even more hurdles than women like me and Elizabeth.So Garmus wrote a book to scream, and scream, and scream, at the unjustness of it all.There is a love story here too. It’s couched in the language of beakers and rowing and leash laws, but it’s here, on paper, a slow-burn romance that ends too soon and turns into a meditation on grief. Elizabeth and Calvin never had a chance. Calvin and his mother never had a chance. Calvin and Mad never had a chance.Sometimes life just happens, and you never get a chance.I loved all of Elizabeth’s relationships in the book. She’s so careful with her daughter yet so oblivious. Mad is a delightful child, slightly creepy but never in an overwhelming way—I don’t think I would have liked to see her try to carry the whole book, but as a protagonist who joins us midway through, she is great. Harriet too—her development from housewife with little ambition to Elizabeth’s close friend … it’s just so neat, and in the hands of another writer perhaps could have been trite, but Garmus somehow pulls it off.That’s what this is: a magic trick. This book is so raw yet so carefully and precisely crafted, a chemical—nay, alchemical—chain reaction of storytelling culminating in a coda that left me crying. When Elizabeth signs off, when she finally reads the cue cards … well, not to spoil it, but there were tears in my eyes—though so much of the finale is predictable, it is predictable in such a way that Garmus has earned it through foreshadowing. The payoff is so well executed, so satisfying, that I just feel like I’ve come full circle.I want this to be a movie.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Robyn Maynard’s Policing Black Lives was an important book for me a few years ago. I haven’t read anything from Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, but her words here proved just as significant. Rehearsals for Living is a moving and meditative journey through the minds and hearts of two powerful, political women. It gets you thinking—but it should hopefully do more than that; it should get you acting.The book is a collection of letters the two authors wrote to each other over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The letters are long and intended to be turned into a book, yet they still feel very intimate. Maynard talks about her struggles with parenting during lockdown and raising a Black child in an anti-Black society. Simpson recalls how land defence actions, like the Oka Crisis at Kanehsatà:ke in 1990, shaped her as a young activist, and connects this with ongoing Indigenous stewardship, sovereignty, and protection of the land. This is not a history book, yet you will learn history from it. It is not a manifesto, yet it left me feeling energized and invigorated.Canada is an unjust society. A lot of people have trouble acknowledging this fact, owing perhaps to propaganda we get fed in school or a reluctance to feel like we are more like our neighbour to the south than we care to admit. Nevertheless, it’s true. We have serious issues with anti-Black racism, anti-Indigenous racism, and structural social problems that prop up a carceral, capitalist state built on colonialism and resource extraction.Now, if you’re looking for a soft introduction to these ideas, then Rehearsals for Living is not the place. This book assumes you are at least somewhat aware of the problems Maynard and Simpson discuss. That’s what I liked so much about it: I really want to move from ally to accomplice, move beyond “antiracism 101: don’t do a racism” lectures that tend to proliferate throughout EDI training. This book is a great step in that journey, both for how it challenges the reader’s assumptions and ideas and for how it demonstrates concrete action.I read this the week after Treaties Recognition Week here in Ontario. The first full week of November has been designated for teaching and learning about the Treaties between Canada (or its predecessor colonial governments) and First Nations. I live on territory that’s part of the Robinson–Superior Treaty of 1850. Usually in my English course, I discuss Treaties in general and then show the NFB documentary Trick or Treaty?, by Alanis Obomsawin, which is about Treaty No. 9, to the north of Thunder Bay. Treaties are an immensely important part of understanding the historical, legal, and cultural relationships between settlers and First Nations. We are all Treaty people.So land was on my mind as I read these letters. I had tried, as best I could as a white woman, to impress upon my students (some Indigenous, some not) how much colonization comes back to land. How different the worldviews of First Nations are from those of settler-colonial institutions when it comes to even the idea of “ownership” of land. Of course, Simpson expresses it so much more eloquently than I ever could! I read some passages from one of her letters out loud to my class.Simpson and Maynard together help to demonstrate how so many seemingly separate injustices are connected and how they have their root in the land. Black and Indigenous activisms are connected because Black and Indigenous people are both overrepresented in Canada’s prison system. Incarceration is another way of controlling who has access to, who is restricted from, certain land. Whether it’s reserves dictated by the Indian Act and Department of Indian Affairs or sentences handed down by judges empowered by jurisdictions more interested in developing land than serving the people who live upon it, the state has always had intense mechanisms available to it to exercise this kind of control.Rehearsals for Living is also inescapably about the pandemic and how it affected life, including activism. On one hand, there was some early release of prisoners to try to stop the spread of COVID-19 in prisons and jails. On the other hand, lockdown increased the isolation of vulnerable people, made group demonstrations and protests riskier and more difficult to coordinate, and increased risks for frontline workers, who tend to be racialized people. The ground shifted between us in the past two years, and Maynard and Simpson take note of this. Their letters capture their frustration with the moment, their exhaustion, but also their irrepressible hope. Because their people are still here. Indigenous people are still here, five hundred years in to colonization. Black people are still here. The centuries-long project of genocide, the attempt to erase people in favour of persons, of labour, has not been successful.However, as these two authors note with sincerity and admonishment, we cannot think our way out of these problems. We cannot write our way out of these problems. Simpson and Maynard both share details of their actions, how they organize, participate in, support, or otherwise enable demonstrations, protests, sit-ins, mutual aid. The state is not going to save us; we have to save ourselves. This is something I think about a lot lately, both as a white woman with a lot of privilege in our society, as well as a trans woman who experiences structural and individual discrimination. It all comes back to community-building, to finding your people, and rallying around the cause.From prison and police abolition to mental health to climate change, Rehearsals for Living tackles the important issues of our day with grace and optimism and unapologetic honesty. Part of me worries that white women like myself will elevate this book as another kind of feather to put into our reading cap—oh, did you read Rehearsals for Living? Touching, isn’t it? Yes, I learned a lot from it—well, onto the shelf it goes! Look at how educated I am! But as tired as I can tell Maynard and Simpson are from dealing with white people, even so-called allies, I can also see a lot of hope in their writing. All of us who live here can play a role. But we need to step out onto that stage, need to take responsibility, need to start living the relationship between ourselves and the land and other people on it. At least, that’s what I took away from this.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Iggulden before, but I thought I would give it a try. Sometimes that backfires; sometimes it results in some of the best reads of my year. In the case of this book, I would say it landed decidedly in the middle! What started as a dud gradually blooms into … a story of a kind. Darien is somewhat enigmatic, but I dig it.The eponymous city of Darien is built upon the ruins of an empire long gone. It is a world where the affluent have magic and, of course, money, while the poor scrape by with what they can get. A plague has just ravaged the countryside and some of the poorer districts of the city, but the king and the ruling Twelve Families have survived untouched. The book follows a handful of characters from diverse backgrounds: a hunter with a knack for premonition; a retired swordmaster turned thiefmaster; a young woman who doesn’t believe in magic; and a thief with ambitions for a big score. Their fates converge on one of Darien’s most holy nights, and … shit goes down.Iggulden has a distinctive writing style that is spare on dialogue in favour of description and narration. The first several chapters introduce our characters and what they want. Although these characters cross paths in the final act, I wouldn’t quite say that they “meet up.” What makes Darien most distinctive is this lack of a central, overarching plot. I suspect that will drive some readers mad while being enticing to others. In my case, I didn’t hate it—but I didn’t love it either.This is a case where the worldbuilding and ideas grabbed me more than the story itself. Elias Post’s knack for “reaching” into the future—that’s cool. Nancy’s magic-dampening capability? That’s fascinating. Golems exist? Awesome. There’s a whole bunch of magic and myth and mystery here, but Iggulden doesn’t explore it very deeply—and you know, that’s his prerogative. There is a story here—perhaps more accurate to say a bunch of intersecting stories—all predicated upon one of the most essential questions: what do you want? Whether you want to keep your family safe, revenge for injustices visited upon your family, or riches untold … there’s a lot of character development that happens here, even if it tends to be on the page rather than between characters themselves. (A lot of the scenes are two-handers, allowing one of our protagonists to explain themselves to a supporting character.)The final act is quite literally explosive and pretty good, and I like the ending overall. There’s some good setup for the sequel—but I don’t know if there’s enough here to get me interested in picking it up.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I suggThis was the October selection for the Rad Roopa Book Club, a small, virtual gathering of educators founded by the very rad Roopa from Twitter! I suggested this book last year and was delighted to get to read it for book club. Fairest is a fair memoir. Meredith Talusan challenges us to dislike her, to judge her, to question her choices, and I really liked that.Talusan was born in the Phillipines. Assigned male at birth, she has albinism, so her light skin marked her as different from the beginning. Talusan tells of her childhood, immigrating to the United States, and attending Harvard as (at the time) an out, gay man, passing as white. Eventually, after various attempts at relationships, Talusan makes the decision to transition. Along the way, she grapples with her racial identity, her relationship to her family members, and her obligations to her past.I wanted to read this book because I want to read more memoirs by trans people whose experiences are quite different from mine. Talusan and I are both trans women, but she is a racialized immigrant to the US, and albino. While we both transitioned after finishing university, she spent her university days as a gay man, while I was (and remain) aromantic/asexual. So there’s a lot going on here that helped me see her experience of transition, contrast it with my own, and learn more about myself in the process.Indeed, a lot of what Talusan says isn’t my experience of being trans—and that’s ok; we are not a monolith. But I really like how Talusan breaks down these questions. I like how she talks about facing the choice of transitioning—because being trans is not a choice, but transitioning is a choice, an action one undertakes. Talusan reflects on how she could have continued living as a gay man, married her longtime partner, and perhaps even be happy. I feel that, for I, too, probably could have continued being happy living as a man in my thirties—but something would have been off. And it’s for the same reason Talusan shares when she says, “Being a woman gave me access to an entire gamut of behaviours I never knew were inside me….” It isn’t about performing femininity in a stereotypical way but rather recognizing that presenting myself as a woman aligns my inner self with the actions and behaviors that are most comfortable for me. I didn’t want to be a man in a dress or a man who was “like one of the girls”; I wanted to be one of the girls—and now I am.In other respects, as I said, it is more difficult to relate to Talusan and her transition, and that’s all right. Similarly, she’s also not the most likeable narrator. She has done things in her past that she regrets (or at least admits are regrettable) and dares us to judge her for it. I appreciate this candour in a memoir, where there is always the temptation to self-aggrandize. Talusan has not led an unimpeachable life, has hurt people and been hurt in return. Trans people are like anyone else—we are human, flawed, and deserve to show those flaws.The ending of the memoir reminds me of My Real Children, by Jo Walton. Talusan reflects on what her life might have been had she made different choices. Her conclusion mirrors Walton’s work: we can never truly know how our other lives might have turned out, but it’s unlikely there is one, true, perfect life out there for us. It’s very hard to say whether we would have been happier, or more successful, or more content in another life, for it would have brought its own share of challenges and successes.Fairest is an honest book that meditates upon race, gender, sexuality, privilege, and what it means to be honest with oneself and others. It isn’t revelatory in any big and explosive way. But it has a steady, inexorable beat to its story that will keep you reading and thinking about the ways our lives tug and pull at us in all sorts of directions.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

She wove a finely balanced tale of murder, magic, and intrigue. I was so excited for the sequel and pleased when I received an eARC courtesy NetGalley and Tor. I knew the sequel was going to be good. I was not prepared for it to be this.A Restless Truth follows Robin’s sister, Maud, on an ocean voyage from the United States back to the United Kingdom. A murder most foul catapults Maud from the role of companion into detective. Out of her depth, Maud nevertheless resolves to rout a murderer and retrieve the piece of the Last Contract that her companion had been protecting. Fortunately, she collects some allies, including Lord Hawthorn from the first book, and a new character/love interest in the form of Violet Debenham, intentionally described socialite-turned-performer. That’s right—after the m/m pairing of the first book, Marske gives us a f/f romance here.As with the first book, the romance/sex scenes are far steamier/spicier than I tend to seek out in my non-erotic fiction. But I loved the development of Maud and Violet’s relationship every bit as much as I did Robin and Edwin’s. This one is different because Maud is only gradually realizing her sexuality. Violet’s consequent ambivalence—she isn’t sure she is the right person to be Maud’s first, to guide her through this—is sweet and tender. There’s so much discussion of consent, fights over things both silly and significant, and then make-up sex. I love a book that just has some joyously normalized queer romance even though romance is not in and of itself my genre.Fortunately, A Restless Truth has a lot more to offer than romance. This book presents a mystery, but unlike the first book, it’s much closer to a locked-room mystery. We’re on a boat! In the middle of the Atlantic! So the killer can’t exactly go overboard at any moment, and while magic is a factor, everyone who knows this is also motivated to keep the rest of the boat unaware—to avoid “unbusheling” them, if you will. This gives Marske quite a lot of room to escalate the drama and tension gradually. What begins as a straightforward mystery with a side helping of romance blooms into a tense, explosive, seditious plot that has Maud and her allies making plans, breaking plans, and eventually just fighting for survival. Whether it’s exposition or a climactic confrontation, Marske’s writing is tight and so satisfying to read. I had a busy week, so I did end up putting this book down more than I wanted to, but I didn’t want to put it down!Maud is a delightful protagonist, though I think Violet ultimately stole the show for me. The way that Marske balances contrasts their upbringing—Maud’s sheltered life, Violet’s more worldly experiences—is beautiful. There’s a scene two thirds of the way through the book where Violet considers opening up and sharing more of her concerns with Maud and ultimately doesn’t, and it’s that withholding, and Maud’s sense of understanding, that is so heartachingly good. Sometimes, no matter how whirlwind a romance is, you just aren’t ready to divulge your most intimate secrets yet.The supporting characters have so much to offer as well. Marske has a talent for foreshadowing, for laying out the pieces on the board in such a way that you know they are all going to come together before the end of the book, but you can’t quite see the final layout. It’s very satisfying, watching these minor characters who were introduced in the first chapters show up here and there to help nudge the plot along without it feeling too contrived or heavy-handed. Because we’re on an ocean voyage, Marske has the ability to introduce a quirky but limited cast and then work with them to advance the story.I also love how Marske continues to build this world, its magic, and the mystery around the Last Contract. I had no idea that this book would take us away from Robin and Edwin—and it is a sign of how much I am coming to appreciate Marske as a storyteller that I found myself relishing their absence. Now I’ve met so many other characters I’ve enjoyed, and I can’t wait to see what the third book brings!A Restless Truth was not the book I was expecting as a sequel to A Marvellous Light—it was better. That’s no mean feat for a second novel. Also, because this book is very “contained”—both in setting and characters—you could dive into this one before you read A Marvellous Light as long as you don’t mind general spoilers for the first book. Nevertheless, I would recommend you read both.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

We also interviewed Lily Anderson for my Buffy rewatch I received an eARC from NetGalley and a hardcover from Disney Hyperion in return for a ! We also interviewed Lily Anderson for my Buffy rewatch podcast, Prophecy Girls, and I will update this  with a link to the episode when it’s out!It’s 1999. In an alternative version of Sunnydale, the Mayor doesn’t ascend but rather blots out the sun and renames the town Demondale to attract, shall we say, a new type of resident. Jonathan and Andrew are in league with Warren—who is trying to ascend, when the surprise arrival of the Slayer makes that all go very wrong. The Slayer makes off with some magical artifacts and then invades the vengeance demons’ dimension, hopping dimensions and destroying hellish Sunnydales in an attempt to find her own. Meanwhile, Anya teams up with Jonathan, Andrew, Angelus, and others to find a way to stop the Slayer before she returns to Demondale to destroy their home.So this is Buffy, but not. Fans will recognize what’s happening here; newcomers to the franchise should probably start elsewhere. If you were looking for a straightforward story with Buffy as the protagonist and some bad guys lining up to be defeated, then you won’t find that here. But you will find a book packed to the brim with loving references, along with some very fun characterization of characters we adore.Anderson makes a point of interrogating the motivations and emotions of Jonathan and Anya in particular. Jonathan is a really interesting supporting member of the Buffyverse. He starts as little more than an extra, the butt of jokes about his height and uncoolness. “Superstar,” of course, introduces the idea that Jonathan could be more. And then he joins up with Andrew and Warren in Season 6, and … well, the rest is history. In this book, Demondale Jonathan reflects on whether Warren was a good friend (he wasn’t) and whether he and Andrew should stay friends (they totally should). But it’s cool to see Anderson spending time on a character who didn’t get enough of it on the show.Anya, on the other hand, receives a lot more development on the show—and this Anya is consistent with that personality, albeit different because she never gave up being a vengeance demon. Here, Anderson embellishes the lore on vengeance demons, emphasizing Anya’s opportunistic enjoyment of capitalism. It’s fun, and her voice really rings true in her chapters.Other familiar faces grace us as the book goes on, and Anderson nails their voices too. From Angelus to Spike, Drusilla to Darla, it’s clear that Anderson understands how each of these characters thinks, speaks, moves, acts. As I’ve mentioned in the past, I don’t often enjoy tie-in novels, but this one was easy to follow and a joy to read.As for Buffy herself: this is a young, inexperienced Buffy. She is tragic: lost, adrift across dimensions, unsure of where home even is. She is determined to get home at any cost, even if it means destroying … entire worlds. As we learn more about her predicament, we can sympathize, but it’s also hard to discount what she’s doing. Ultimately, I like how Anderson resolves this part of the plot.In the end, Big Bad has two functions. The first is simply to be a fun romp through the Buffyverse. As I said earlier, there are so many references in this book to characters, episodes, villains, moments … in some hands it might have felt like too much, but Anderson somehow makes it all fit and feel right. The other function is to remind us, as the show itself always did, that evil is seldom one-dimensional and moustache-twirling (even when it lacks a soul). Evil is a complicated combination of factors, not just the absence of morality but morality twisted in service of selfish ends. This book reminds us that our heroes could be the Big Bad too.Also, there’s no Xander. Because fuck Xander.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Do I lament sheepishly how I’ve slept on bell hooks my entire adult life, and it is only now, at thirty-three, now that she has passed, that I’ve made time to read even one of her books? Do I confess that this was a revelation, that it was exactly the book I needed here and now? This  will be purely encomium, for that is what I feel about All About Love: New Visions. I loved it, every word.A great deal of what hooks writes about certainly pertains to romantic love, yet from the very beginning she makes it clear that she is writing about all kinds of love. As I have shared in many of my previous s, I am asexual and aromantic. I have no desire to have or intention of having a partner in the traditional, romantic sense of the word. Yet my platonic relationships are still incredibly important to me—if not more important, consequently—and are loving. So to hear this noted feminist writer who didn’t identify as asexual or aromantic come right out of the gate and frame love in such a diverse and inclusive way? Wow. Powerful.Now, I don’t want to erase what came before. Indeed, something I loved about All About Love is the way that hooks consistently cites her sources. She frequently dropped the name of a book title that I knew I should look up. She is not the first person to write about love this way, nor will she be the last, and her careful acknowledgement of those who came before her reminds us not to read a writer in a vacuum. She is responding to these texts and ideas, building upon them, or considering them and then rebutting them.As you might expect, hooks approaches frameworks of love from a feminist lens. She is rightfully critical of books like Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus—yet she is also perhaps more tolerant, or at least more understanding, of them than I have been, for she has lived longer and loved more than I have so far. This is one of the endearing teachings of All About Love: our society shapes our conception of what love can be and our perception of how we can give or receive it. That was why a book by another Black woman, Refusing Compulsory Sexuality, was so important to me. Sherronda J. Brown’s scholarship around asexuality dovetails with what bell hooks shares in these essays: when we get wrapped up in privileging romantic and sexual love above other types of love, we end up leaving ourselves open to toxic situations and less capable of receiving love from others who would give it to us.So many parts of this book demanded that I record them for posterity. In her second essay, “Justice,” hooks talks about how we love our children and notesThere can be no love without justice. Until we live in a culture that not only respects but also upholds basic civil rights for children, most children will not know lovegoing on to connect this to ideas of corporal punishment being unjust. But it made me think of how the rising tide of anti-trans sentiments in the States (and here in Canada) is metamorphosing into a “parents’ rights” movement of sorts, claiming that what’s happening here is an oppression of parents by the state. This framing makes me deeply uncomfortable, not only for its intersections with the transphobia that is materially threatening both my liberty and my existence, but also because it ignores, as hooks points out, the rights of the child. I am not a parent, and I know I don’t fully understand the emotions a parent will experience as they watch their children grow, mature, endure hardships, etc. But I do know that there is something very unhealthy with the way many parents discuss their children as if they are possessions or extensions of their own person. And this is what hooks is trying to teach us.In math, we have the concept of something being finite yet unbounded (such as the surface of a sphere—finite area, but no boundary) or infinite yet bounded (such as the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1). Love is the latter. We are capable of infinite expressions and depths of love, yet boundaries are necessary for love to flourish. When we lack boundaries—when we see love as something we are owed or something we are duty-bound to give, we twist love. (There’s probably a “Tainted Love” pun very close by but I don’t have the heart to make it.)Later, in her essay on “Values,” hooks remark on the importance of living by our values. She uses the example of domestic violence:… almost everyone will insist that they do not support male violence against women, that they believe it to be morally and ethically wrong. However, if you then explain that we can only end male violence against women by challenging patriarchy … that is when the agreement stops. There is a gap between the values they claim to hold and their willingness to do the work of connecting thought and action, theory and practice to realize these values and thus create a more just society.Can I just … give bell hooks a standing ovation right here in my ? Yes, so much this.Again, relating it to current events and my own values and fight for social justice … I see this all the time when people talk about trans issues. A lot of cis people are very happy to say that they support “the LGBTQ+” community or say things like, “Trans women are women.” Cool. But what are you actually doing about it? Are you lobbying for gender-neutral bathrooms? Are you standing up to the transphobes running for our school board? Are you challenging the gender binary and cissexism as it manifests at your workplace, your school, your social club? The above passage is hooks’s succinct way of reminding us that there is a gulf between allyship and complicity.Though this book is deeply personal and vulnerable, it is also with every paragraph political and polemical. Taking aim at patriarchy, capitalism, and white supremacy, hooks demonstrates to me why she is such a revered figure in the arena of social justice. I get it now. I mean, I didn’t doubt, given the little snippets I had read here and there, the thoughts attributed back to her that others have shared … but it’s something else entirely to mainline it. On that note, it took me over a week to read this book (which is a long time for me for such a short book). I was savouring it. I was also aware that I needed time to process each essay. This is very rare for me; even for a collection, I typically read it through in a few short sittings. But I could tell hooks needed my time, needed me to let each essay unpack itself in my mind.That level of care and thoughtfulness for each essay is reflected in her skill as a writer too. Something that jumped out at me, almost from the beginning? Her diction. Her sentence structure. She has a propensity simple sentences and often short sentences. Even her longer sentences, however, tend not to be complex (in the grammatical sense). The result is prose that feels deceptively simple until you actually start parsing it for meaning. I could learn a lot from her style. As you have noticed, my sentences are often as meandering and weighed down by thoughts as the brain behind them!All of this is to say … wow. I need to buy a copy of this book. (I borrowed this copy from my bestie.) I need to buy the other two books in her trilogy on love. I need to read the rest that she wrote—not to consume her, as I know white people often do with Black writers, but to appreciate her. To love her, the mark she left on our world, by being brave enough to write to us. She does here, with her simple sentences, more than I’ve managed to do in nearly two thousand book s.

Nancy Mauro is a dangerous temptress with The Sugar Thief. Set The downside of a book about a delicious pastry is that it made me want to eat pastry! Nancy Mauro is a dangerous temptress with The Sugar Thief. Set primarily in Mauro’s and my hometown of Thunder Bay, Ontario, this novel is a mystery wrapped in the warmth of family and iced with the frosting of betrayal and recrimination. It asks us what happens when people go to any lengths to establish the life for themselves that they think they deserve.Sabine is a YouTuber renowned for her baking channel, and she is about to get a Netflix show. She returns to her hometown of Thunder Bay to visit her family—but what should have been a celebration of her father’s achievements in life turn into mourning his sudden death. He bequeaths to Sabine the secret recipe of the Persian. Sabine wants no part of her father’s small-town bakery, but when she pulls on one thread of her family history, the entire tapestry of her past starts to unravel. Soon she discovers that she has to keep going, keep digging, to find out who she is, where the Persian actually came from, and what her father has been hiding her entire life.The Persian is a real thing. It was a ubiquitous part of my childhood, growing up here in Thunder Bay: schools would have “Persian days” where we would bring in a loonie (or eventually, a toonie—that’s a two-dollar coin) for the sweet treat. To be honest, I’ve never enjoyed Persians all that much—too sweet—and their uniqueness seems overhyped. But I like how Mauro, whose family here in Thunder Bay produces the Persian, seized on this as an idea for a novel. I really love it when authors return to their roots, so to speak, in such an authentic and grounded way.Indeed, that’s what this novel is all about. Sabine’s reluctant return to Thunder Bay triggers a cascade of emotions. Her father was emotionally distant for her entire life, and now he’s gone. She arrived in Canada at four years old, uncertain, and he never did make her feel all that welcome or wanted. So Sabine wrestles with the stories that other family members tell her about her father.Mauro employs some interesting narrative structures. The chapters mostly alternate between the perspective of Sabine or Wanda, her producer. Here and there we get chapters set in Italy or in Thunder Bay’s past that follow people like Sabine’s uncle. Although the narration itself is third person limited, there’s still some unreliable narration at work. Sabine and Wanda, despite being peers, have aims that are sometimes at cross-purposes. (Interestingly, we don’t get much in the way of perspective from Paul, the camera operator.) The flashback chapters are meant to be what happened based on the version of events told to Sabine by someone else, such as her aunt or uncle. So who’s to say what really happened?Sabine is a textbook unlikeable protagonist. Wanda starts off as much more sympathetic although I suspect that by the end most readers will not like her either. These two women actually have a lot in common: both belong to immigrant families (Sabine herself is technically an immigrant as well). Both have parents who came to this country in relative poverty, though Sabine’s family has become fairly successful whereas Wanda’s is still struggling a great deal—commentary both on the differences in opportunity in Thunder Bay versus Toronto as well as the differences in discrimination of Italian immigrants versus Filipino ones.Sabine and Wanda are both very motivated by money. Wanda is supporting her parents—and money just seems to slip through their fingers. Sabine is chasing a big Netflix deal for a few reasons; she has a secret that she doesn’t want getting out, and she also has an expensive lifestyle in an expensive city. Throughout the story, money talks.Mauro keeps the pacing tight and keeps you guessing about where the book is going next. My main criticism is simply that the ending wraps things up a little too neatly and too quickly. There are a couple of twists that feel very trite. But the second half of the book does not live up to the anticipation stoked by the first half.There’s also a certain element of style and satire at work here that might be off-putting for some readers. It’s most obvious when dealing with Colette, Sabine’s agent, or with the producers from Netflix. They’re caricatures, slightly buffoonish in their one-dimensional portrayal. I’m largely convinced this is done on purpose, hence the way I’ve labelled it as satire. Despite being a mystery, The Sugar Thief actually has a lot more in common with a comedy, almost a farce even. It’s less hard-boiled, more deep fried.So as long as you’re clear on what to expect, I think there is a lot of potential for enjoyment in this book. I, of course, have a soft spot for it because of its setting. But it’s precisely because of such vulnerability that I’m relieved to report it’s actually good! Just don’t expect it to be more than it is. And next time you’re in Thunder Bay, try a Persian. They aren’t amazing, but they’re ours.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

That’s the situation Zoey Prescott faces in Memories, Lies, and Other Binds by Katy Foraker. This urban fantasy twist on vampire-hunting and immortality mashes up time-worn tropes with a dose of family drama and unexamined angst. It’s a fun ride! However, I received a free copy of this book in exchange for a .Zoey Prescott stopped aging in her twenties. That was in the eighteenth century. Since then she has been an employee of the Research Institute of Demonic Entities and Rarities (RIDER), a private corporation bent on researching the supernatural and protecting the mortal world. Zoey has risen to head a department in RIDER, but her status as a quasi-immortal bars her from rising much further, and RIDER’s bureaucracy means she isn’t allowed to leave headquarters. When Theo, one of the most infamous extant vampires—and Zoey’s brother—surfaces, however, Zoey inveigles the brass for permission to join the field team sent to capture him. Of course, that just launches her into a conspiracy that upends everything she thought she knew about the world.This book is clearly a labour of love from a writer who knows these genres and wants nothing more than to build on top of what has come before. First, there are little nods and tips of the hat to previous franchises—much of the vampire lore will feel very familiar to fellow Buffy fans, and at one point Zoey mentions a group of vampires in the Pacific Northwest whose skin sparkles in the sun (she thinks they are actually faeries). Foraker pulls off these homages and callbacks, making them fun without being too intrusive. A lot of urban fantasy writers feel the need to change up the lore and mythos for supernatural beings—Twilight being an example of that—and there is a good argument for doing so, but this book is an example of why there isn’t anything wrong with sticking to the classics.Foraker also pulls off a tricky bit of characterization in Zoey, our viewpoint protagonist. Zoey’s willfullness and stubbornness are an appropriate response to the way she has been cosseted and infantilized by her own organization. Yet it is challenging to write a protagonist whose special power (in this case, a lack of aging) is entirely passive. In these situations, the protagonist often seems to lack agency, which generally makes for a less satisfying story. Zoey might not pack as much oomph as her comrades, but one thing she has is a lot of courage and an agenda of her own when it comes to Theo. This kicks off what is probably the best part of the book.Memories, Lies, and Other Binds is at its best when it questions how supernatural powers affect one’s ability to participate in the mortal world. This happens over and over, from Zoey’s old flame Augustine to Charlotte’s desire for a “normal college experience.” RIDER’s entire existence is predicated on the idea that the supernatural has to be managed—they run private nature retreats for werewolves when it’s that time of the month—in a way that does not disrupt the flow of ordinary, mortal lives. Foraker explores all of this mostly on the individual level, with some hints there and there (like with the werewolves) at structural inequity as well. Throughout the book, we are encouraged to move from viewing RIDER as a benevolent force to a much more morally grey one.Alas, that brings me to what didn’t work for me about the book, and it’s a pretty big one: the plot. I just feel like we had a little bit of a bait-and-switch situation; the first part of the book sets us up to see Zoey’s lack of aging as this big mystery that needs to be solved. But as we get deeper into the conflict with Theo and learn more about the villains behind the scenes (that’s all I can really say without spoiling it), events occur that basically obviate the mystery of Zoey. I don’t like it. However, this is an example of a criticism where the author and I happen to disagree about the story that should be told here rather than something that is objectively wrong with the book. So I’ve tried to set aside this preference and look at the rest of the story and ask myself, “do I like what happens from there?”Yes and no. I really like Zoey’s attempt to process and understand what’s happening to her. Foraker has a talent for description in her prose and puts it to good use here. Her relationships are also irrevocably altered, and I appreciate the nuance at work here and the way that Zoey herself is going through a fair amount of trauma (and trauma bonding).The antagonists, on the other hand, are just kind of boring. A little mustache-twirling for my taste. I was hoping for something deeper or certainly something juicier, and for a consequent conflict that really required more exertion on the part of the protagonists to resolve. Everything gets wrapped up nice and neat, little bow on top, with the door left just open enough for a sequel.So where does that leave us? Well, I would read a sequel. Despite my reservations about the plotting, I enjoyed reading this book, which is usually the criterion that matters most to me. Memories, Lies, and Other Binds reminds me a lot of The SPI Files, by Lisa Shearin, and hits that same sweet spot of fun characters, some good dialogue, and interesting fantasy set pieces. This book is not a revelation, not an earth-shattering entry into the genre. Nevertheless, Foraker has managed to create something that is comfortable without feeling cliché, and I think that in and of itself is a pretty good accomplishment.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Her best friend from adolescence, Jessica, suddenly re-enters her life. But Jessica used to be a hot mess, as they say, and still might be, and Fern is ambivalent about rekindling this friendship. After a tumultuous adolescence including self-harm and suicide ideation (trigger warnings for scenes with these in the book), Fern is finally on a better path, writing about mental health for a digital publication and training to become a counsellor. She even has a boyfriend she loves and who will probably propose to her any day now—right? He’s going to propose to her, right? RIGHT?Seriously, though, I don’t know what kind of magic Bourne puts into her books, but they feel so incredibly relatable despite the fact that I came to my womanhood only recently, have no romantic or sexual interest in men, and generally have eschewed or not had the opportunity to participate in a lot of the conventional activities that white women of the age and class of Bourne’s heroines tend to do. I don’t really think I am the target audience for this book, and yet it has won me over. That’s just how good she is.I think partly it’s just the ease with which Bourne includes little examples here and there that, I imagine, resonate for much of her target audience. To give myself credit, many of my friends are straight cis women, and so I have a lot of experience empathizing with this group. I’ve been a shoulder many a time. So Bourne has this way of leaning into tropes, playing them straight when it helps establish character and scene (as we see at the beginning with Fern’s encounter with a youthful influencer) and averting or subverting them in the most dramatic moments (as we see at the climax of the story). Some of the best parts of this novel are the quietest, the most unremarkable, depicting everyday stuff that a lot of women will smile and nod along to, whether it’s Fern’s body image issues or her anxiety and insecurity in her relationship with her boyfriend, Ben.Honestly, Fern is kind of an unlikeable—albeit not unsympathetic—character. For much of the book, I was cringing a little as I read her thoughts (and I had her pegged as an unreliable narrator from the start). I don’t think we are supposed to like Fern unconditionally, because it’s kind of the point: Bourne is illustrating that Fern’s hang-ups over Jessica, over Ben not proposing, over needing to be completely secure and in control of her entire life, are normal but not desirable. Fern is an extremely flawed main character, and she makes a lot of mistakes. But the book never judges her for this. Never encourages us to think less of her. So even though I felt uncomfortable at times as I watched Fern spiral, I knew this was happening for a reason.I loved the alternating chapters. First, I’m a sucker for how these encourage you to keep reading so that you can get back to the time period you just left. Second, younger Fern is even more fucked up than older Fern in so many ways—but again, she’s also a very normal teenage girl in many ways. There’s one scene in particular where Bourne describes how she’s trying to pose attractively while suntanning near an attractive boy, and it made me think about what must be going through many straight teenage girls’ minds in those moments. The calculation. The emotional devastation that can be wrought with a single look. As with her depiction of older Fern, Bourne makes us conscious here that younger Fern’s actions aren’t good but never encourages us to judge her for that.For a book that is, in many ways, an indictment of patriarchy on the development of women’s psyches, Girl Friends has an admirably diverse cast of male characters. Most of the men in this book are indeed terrible, but they are terrible in different ways. And some of the men aren’t terrible at all, or at least, we don’t see that side of them. Sometimes, the differences of opinion between Fern and a male character, like Ben, are less about patriarchy and more about coming from different backgrounds and experiences—Ben tries hard to be a good man and a good partner to Fern, but he didn’t experience life as a teenage girl in a small English town. Despite sharing a knowledge base in psychology, the two of them don’t always see eye-to-eye because their insecurities and fears are drawn from different places. That’s really interesting to me, the dynamic between them. Something similar happens between Fern and her best friend, Heather, who is a lesbian and much more strident about her feminism. Heather is not a better feminist than Fern simply for being more direct about it, but she also isn’t a worse one.Girl Friends is a messy book in this way. Bourne reminds us that all of us, no matter where we come from, are struggling with our imperfection. We cannot be the perfect feminist, the perfect counsellor, the perfect girlfriend, or the perfect girl friend. We are, all of us, prone to making mistakes. We are also incapable of remembering our pasts objectively. The central question of this novel—should Fern allow Jessica back into her heart—is simple, poignant, yet so tough to resolve precisely because we can’t trust what Fern remembers—and neither can Fern. And it’s the answering of that question as the novel slides from climax to conclusion where Girl Friends finally won my heart.Although Fern’s relationship with Ben is front-and-centre for much of the story, this is not a romantic comedy. The most important love in this book is a love between women, a platonic love, a love that pauses and then resumes across decades and distance. And as an asexual, aromantic woman, I am so here for that. Bourne says in her acknowledgements that this book started as a celebration of female friendship but, for various reasons, transformed into a book about dealing with trauma, and I get it. But I appreciate how, deep down in its bones, this story still celebrates the fact that women can love each other as fiercely and deeply as friends as they could if they were romantically attracted to each other. Perhaps the truth of that is only obvious in how they can hurt each other as much as one can be hurt by a lover.Two of my auto-buy authors, Holly Bourne and Courtney Summers, have released novels with girl in the title this season, and both novels examine how girls and women get messed up by our society. I’m fine with this trend in my reading! The power of story to illuminate, excavate, exonerate, and when necessary, eviscerate, elements from our past … it’s exhilarating and intoxicating, especially in the hands of writers as talented as Bourne and Summers both are. These stories make me think and feel. Where my experiences of being a woman overlap, there’s a tenderness. Where my experiences of being a woman are different, there’s empathy. And in the liminal spaces, there’s curiosity and connection.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

That’s how I learned about Shout out to CBC Radio’s Spark for their episode on protecting our intimate data, which interviewed Danielle Keats Citron. That’s how I learned about The Fight for Privacy just ahead of its release date and managed to snag an eARC courtesy of NetGalley and W.W. Norton Company.This book is primarily US-focused, which probably shouldn’t be surprising. That being said, Citron references South Korean examples quite a bit, along with a smattering of other countries, particularly Europe. That’s one of the big takeaways from this book: the fight for privacy is global, because the internet is global; however, American laws and regulations have an outsize effect. Many websites that host things like nonconsensual porn do so in the United States because of things like the Communications Decency Act’s protection from liability. Similarly, Citron explores how some corporations like Facebook and Google end up operating with one regime for their American customers and another for their European customers (who are protected under the GDPR by stricter privacy laws).Citron first establishes what constitutes intimate privacy and why American law is so woefully inadequate at protecting it. She outlines who is most vulnerable to violations of intimate privacy (three guesses—yep, marginalized people, especially women, and especially racialized women!). Finally, she sets forth specific and attainable solutions in both law and the corporate world. She is able to do this because she knows what she’s talking about—Citron has literally written the book on online abuse, along with this book, and co-founded initiatives dedicated to fighting back against intimate privacy violations. She speaks with the expertise of a law professor yet is able to explain everything to the reader in plain English—no mean feat!I’m not really one to advocate for incremental change—more and more, I feel like burning the whole system down and starting over, and when politicians instead seem to compromise their radical ideals in favour of working within a system or status quo, I am often disappointed. Nevertheless, Citron makes some really good arguments here for the value of incremental change within the existing legal and regulatory frameworks that corporations use to manage our personal data. In one chapter, she describes sitting down with Kamala Harris and her team back when Harris was the Attorney General of California. As Citron describes working with the now–Vice President, I suddenly understood how people like Harris can go into politics in the hopes of making a real difference. It’s almost enough to make me optimistic again!Anyway, my point is that The Fight for Privacy walks a fine line. Citron is pragmatic: you aren’t going to throw away your phone and go live off the grid, and that is literally the only way to avoid allowing companies to collect your personal data. Citron is also not radical: according to her, the solution is not to dismantle capitalism per se, not to replace these corporations with a different type of entity, but simply to offer them market-based and political incentives to be better. I’m skeptical of that approach, of course, but I can see where she’s coming from. This is not a revolutionary book, but it is a very practical one, and I think there is real need for that.At times, however, I found myself wondering who needs this book—its target audience wanders a little. I thought about my dad, who is a lawyer and might enjoy this book, though I wondered if it would be technical enough for him. As I mentioned earlier, it’s accessible enough for a layperson, but at times it does get bogged down in discussions of regulatory technicalities. On the other hand, people involved in regulating tech companies would probably want something a little more focused. In trying to be too many things, The Fight for Privacy ends up feeling scattered and unfocused. If I could change one thing, it would be to cut down on the exhaustive examples Citron offers up in chapter after chapter. A little more editing, a little less rock and roll.This book is also, I need to be frank, somewhat disheartening. To be fair, Citron does end on a note of hope by describing successes she has witnessed in recent years. Unfortunately, her exhaustive documentation of the not-so-successful situations left me feeling very discouraged as I read. It is so challenging to navigate our digital world, because so much of our interaction with corporations and governments and the corresponding exchange of data exists beyond our direct control. These issues came up in my English class a few weeks ago, and we talked about how hard it is to understand or have any concept of how companies are using our data.The issue feels, at times, insurmountable. But I will give The Fight for Privacy this: if it is not clear in its audience, it is certainly clear in its purpose. It is a manifesto, a clarion call for stronger privacy protections, data use transparency, and a civil right to privacy. Citron’s presentation is level-headed, thoughtful, measured—she has worked hard to come to the table with actual proposals, backed by her years of experience. I was disheartened by this book and buoyed at the same time! Do these feelings cancel each other out? I’m not sure. All I really know is that if, like me, you are concerned about how corporations and governments are using the increasingly complex web of data available to be harvested from each and every one of us … you would probably get something out of reading this book.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I love thinking about how we think. About why we think. ConsciousnessPhilosophy of the mind has always been one of my favourite realms of philosophy. I love thinking about how we think. About why we think. Consciousness, sentience, intelligence—how did these traits evolve? How do they even work? Patrick House explores Nineteen Ways of Looking at Consciousness (literally what it says on the tin) and tries to address these questions. As he admits in the introduction, he doesn’t have all the answers—none of us do—but he has a lot of fun mulling over some of the theories that are out there. However, I didn’t have as much fun reading this book.Thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for providing the eARC!I’m not going to attempt to summarize the nineteen ways. Some of them are a little out there, a little difficult for me to conceptualize let alone express. Basically, each chapter is a different way of explaining or examining consciousness. In all of these chapters, House relates these ideas back to a single study, published in Nature, in which electric current applied to a teenage girl’s brain during surgery stimulated laughter. He tries to apply elements of the chapter’s theory or lens for viewing consciousness to the study to see what we might learn.Something I loved from the beginning of this book is House’s enthusiasm for and wonder about consciousness. He states that neuroscience is at a stage right now similar to how physics was, say, four hundred years ago. I thought that was a really interesting and apt analogy. Despite all our scientific progress in the last century or so, we really have so far to go in our understanding of the brain—and I’m not talking about that myth that we only use ten percent of it! If you stop and think about it, as House points out in his introduction, it’s wild that non-living matter (amino acids) can somehow come together to form life, and that in turn, we are somehow conscious and actually give birth to other organisms that develop their own, distinct consciousness.So in this respect, House does a great job at communicating his appreciation for diverse views on consciousness. Each chapter reads in some ways like a revelation, and I think many readers will appreciate how he unpacks these various ideas and challenges us to think about consciousness differently.Unfortunately, I think my expectations for the book weren’t aligned with what this book actually is. I was hoping for a book that was grounded a bit more in scientific theories, whereas House gives us a lot of philosophy. While the theories House has chosen to present here are all grounded in some type of scientific research, this book is less about explaining the whys and hows of that research and more about describing the consequent theory in a very poetic way. Like I said, I don’t mind philosophy—it just isn’t what I was expecting here.I don’t want to damn this book with faint praise, because I really do think there is an audience out there for it. This book just wasn’t right for me at this time.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Sometimes fictionalizing the truth—books based on a true story, if you will—helps highlight true stories that have yet to receive their due. History is seldom boring. The Rose Code is that type of historical fiction. Set primarily in Bletchley Park during the Second World War, this book is not about the genius of Alan Turing or Dilly Knox. It’s about love and sex and betrayal. Kate Quinn follows three women who become close friends only to be torn apart. It’s a perfect, dramatic mix of spy thriller and romance.Osla, Mab, and Beth are three very different Englishwomen. Osla, technically Canadian (the best kind of being Canadian), is high society yet determined to prove she is more than a “dizzy deb[utante].” Mab is working class yet determined to climb that social ladder. Beth is a village girl, raised sheltered and never allowed to flourish. All three of them end up working at Bletchley Park, helping in various ways to crack codes and translate German messages. As the war drags on, they face personal challenges. Meanwhile, Quinn feeds us chapters set in 1947, on the eve of the royal wedding of Elizabeth and Philip. One of the three women has ended up in an asylum, framed, and now she has appealed to the other two for help. But their friendship ended long ago, on D-Day. If they don’t reconcile, a spy who operated out of Bletchley Park might continue to walk free.The differences among our three protagonists is key to the success of The Rose Code, at least for me. I love how Quinn gives each of them such distinct motivations, personalities, etc. Firstly, it helps reify the setting—though England remains very stratified, WWII certainly changed much in terms of social mobility, particularly for women and the nature of marriage. Secondly, it makes the falling out among Osla, Mab, and Beth that much more understandable and realistic. The actual reasons they each have for souring on the others seem a bit trivial—but isn’t that how it goes? Aren’t we all capable of undeserved or unexpected spitefulness, especially when emotions are running high?This book just gave me so many feelings for these three. I related quite a bit to Beth. Though my childhood was much happier than hers, I share her mathematical inclinations. Quinn has clearly written her to be neurodivergent, possibly autistic. I love the character development that Beth undergoes as her work at Bletchley Park draws her out from the mask she built in her mother’s home. I also sympathized a lot with Mab and her fierce desire for independence. Osla was probably the character with whom I identify the least—so it is all the more impressive that Quinn had me caring for her and understanding her need not to be written off as a high-society bimbo.The code-breaking setting of the story also feels quite real, thanks to the intense amount of research Quinn put into it. The chapters are tight, paced in such a way that I really didn’t want to put this book down. Quinn carefully balances historical events, up to and including the end of the war and Elizabeth’s wedding, with the need for smaller stakes and antagonists within the reach of our protagonists. The bad guy in this book is not particularly interesting, I grant you, but he’s sufficient for Osla, Mab, and Beth to grab on to as an enemy. The stakes here are less about losing a war and more about losing one’s friendship, perhaps one’s life…. (Lobotomies sound terrifying!)In the hands of another author, The Rose Code easily could have become a huge mess. I didn’t know exactly what to expect going in, but I’m glad that I finally found my way back to Kate Quinn. This book has so many different entry points I can see it appealing to a broad variety of readers. It was a really pleasant way to say goodbye to the final days of my summer reading on my deck.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

From Caddy to Suzanne to Rosie, we’ve come full circle. Now the three girls are on the cusp of womanhood, two of them university-bound, the other working a full-time job. Told from Rosie’s perspective, Something Certain, Maybe embraces the uncertainty inherent in youthful transitions and coming of age. It’s a story of slow, simmering upset and long-term, lingering emotions. Barnard is just so good at writing from the heart, and this novel is no exception.Rosie Caron has made it, or so she thinks. The pharmacy program. A vocation. But her time at uni quickly descends into disappointing doldrums of unsympathetic housemates, difficult coursework and long hours of classes, and the gulf of distance from her best friends. Only Jade offers a bright light in all this: Jade, older and more confident in her queerness, her role in life, seemingly her everything. Rosie latches on to Jade like a romantic life preserver. Except not everything is OK in Rosie’s life—not her mum, not her friends, not her housemates, not even the once-bedrock certainty of her choice of career. Soon, things feel like they are all spinning out of control, and Rosie has to decide if she wants to confront the one constant amidst this upset: herself.I get Rosie quite a bit. It has been several years since I spent time with her, Suzanne, and Caddy, but suddenly it feels like I’m back with friends. The way she wants to be part of a group but doesn’t really know how. The awkwardness she feels. The desire to have a plan. Oh, yeah. Not bi, myself, didn’t drink in university (don’t drink now)—but I get it.Barnard is very good at deciding which events to highlight, which ones to mention in passing versus drawing out. Often, young adult and new adult books focus on telling grand coming-of-age stories, with pivotal scenes happening as the protagonist experiences a party, has a fight with her bestie, etc. Don’t get me wrong—such storytelling is immensely valuable. But I also find value in the big quiet that Barnard demonstrates here. The way Rosie just casually drinks and goes to these parties and gets her first girlfriend (go, girl). I though Jade’s initial erasure of Rosie’s bisexuality might be the sign of a biphobic subplot, but in reality this book is just a great big slice of queer acceptance.No, the conflict here comes from the most mundane and ordinary moments of drama. A lot of it is manufactured by Rosie herself—not on purpose, of course, but in that unfortunate way we all have of making our lives harder on ourselves. As Rosie’s dissatisfaction turns into depression, she naturally responds with denial. Now, I’ve never experienced chronic depression myself, so I won’t comment on how accurate a portrayal this is—but it feels very real to me, because it feels so unremarkable. Rosie is living with a mental illness, just getting by, but every little hit is a little harder as a result. From conflicts with Suzanne and Caddy to spats with Jade and finally her mother’s issues, Rosie struggles more because she already has a great weight on her.It’s really tough to admit to yourself that your plan isn’t what you wanted after all.Another quirk? Throughout the entire story, Barnard throws us character after character who delivers compassion. At one point, Rosie meets with her adviser about finishing out her first year. Some books would make this character a mouthpiece for an unsympathetic university establishment—after all, the more cynical among us might point to all the examples of universities hearding students through like cash cows and not caring about their mental health. While there is truth to that systemic story, there are also people doing their best for students, like this adviser does for Rosie, and it’s heartening to see that.The same goes for Rosie’s relationship with Jade. It gets rocky, of course, and I won’t reveal how it ends. But the best part of it is the gentleness throughout. It’s a healthy relationship, one in which they allow each other space to recover from arguments, then they talk it out. I loved seeing this portrayal.You’ll notice that unlike my s of Beautiful Broken Things and Fierce Fragile Hearts, I haven’t quoted extensively while praising this book. Partly that’s because autumn and a new school year caught me unawares, and so I’m writing this  two weeks after finishing the book, oops. Partly it’s because, while I enjoyed this book a great deal, and I get Rosie, the book didn’t speak to as much as Fierce Fragile Hearts did. For one thing, the friendship elements were less in the foreground, and we all know that’s ultimately where my interests lie.Nevertheless, Something Certain, Maybe is yet another solid novel from Sara Barnard and only reaffirms my desire to read everything she ever publishes. This is a comfy type of new-adult fiction that I love.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

But twenty years prior to the start of this book, something terrible happened. The entire town chose to forget that summer. And now, with the death of a Bonner, everything comes back to what happened in 1997.I love the premise and the setting Parker creates here. There are some great seeds of conflict, from Addison’s inability to wield her family magic effectively to Irene’s attraction to a prodigal Bonner son. The family dynamics, both within and among the families of Yarrow, are well done. The dialogue between family members is crisp. There’s a lot about the atmosphere of this book that made me think of Gilmore Girls for some reason—I think largely because of the grown-up mother/daughter relationship between Irene and Addison. That’s about the highest praise I can offer!Beyond that, however, there isn’t much I can say that I enjoyed. The mystery/thriller aspects of the novel are underdeveloped. Most of the plot is predictable, the villains obvious and their motives uncomplicated. Even the secret of Addison’s parentage is obvious from pretty much the first time her hair colour gets mentioned. There’s a single red herring that is only half-heartedly dangled in front of our faces before it is hastily resolved to make way for the romance, which is tepid. Now, that’s my cup of tea when it comes to romance—but I was hoping to recommend this to one or two of my friends who enjoy romance more than I do, and I don’t think I will, simply because there’s no steam here. We get told there’s an attraction between the two characters involved, but it’s wooden (or at least, doesn’t seem distinct from any of the other relationships in this story).The magic aspects are somewhat better off yet still stop short of truly hooking me. I love the idea of the shadow garden and the description of the Haywoods’ magic. As a tea drinker, I approve of the number of cups of tea consumed by everyone in this book! (As someone who doesn’t drink alcohol, I was less interested in all the bourbon consumption, but you do you!) Again, Parker’s descriptive writing skill is not in question—how she spins that into a story, unfortunately, is less rewarding for me.Really all I can say about this book is that it feels full of missed opportunity, a garden planted and tended to with love yet never fertilized in a way that would let it flourish. I wish I could have been more excited by this book, because it’s a great concept. Parker could have done so much with this story. But the characters are flat, the plot overly simple, and the narrative unremarkable.This one is a pass from me.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Alas, procrastination got the better of me, so I dipped into the ebook the weekend prior and then finished I’m the Girl in all its hardcover glory. I braced myself for devastation, and I was not disappointed. Courtney Summers just seems to be continually reaching new heights of her powers. If I sound like a fangirl, it’s because I am one!Sixteen-year-old Georgia Avis lives in small town Ketchum. With her mother having passed not too long ago, Georgia is supported by her hard-working older brother. But she has aspirations of her own: she wants to become an Aspera girl. Aspera is the ritzy private retreat on the outskirts of town, and Georgia’s mother worked there—as a cleaner—before being fired in disgrace. Georgia’s brother wants nothing to do with Aspera. But the sudden and shocking murder of the thirteen-year-old daughter of a police officer—on the road that leads to Aspera, no less—throws everything into turmoil and doubt. Even as Georgia’s desires seem to be within reach, she has to decide if that is truly what she wants—or would she rather figure out what she has with Nora, and who killed Ashley?At its most basic, I’m the Girl is technically a murder mystery. Nora and Georgia are allies—albeit reluctant ones at first—in solving the murder of Nora’s sister. Indeed, this was my first impression of the book from the marketing I saw. But please don’t be mistaken: this is not a cozy sapphic detective team-up. It is brutal and twisted and you are not going to feel comfortable reading it. It’s about the ephemeral and illusory nature of power in a misogynistic society that regards women as bodies more than people. Ashley’s murder is a part of that, of course, as is what Georgia experiences. But there’s a reason that Georgia is the sole narrator of this book.Georgia is young. Sheltered, even. Her mother has gone to great lengths to protect her from the harshness of this world, but of course, Georgia resents her for this. I love how Summers subtly reinforces Georgia’s youthful inexperience. At various times throughout the book, Georgia will casually remark about how she doesn’t know or doesn’t understand something, whether it’s how to do something on the computer or the meaning of a word. Sometimes these confessions are solely to us, the readers; sometimes they are to people in her life. It’s a small thing, but it reminds us that everything we read in this book is being filtered through the mind of a sixteen-year-old girl from a small town. Lots of books are like this, of course, but what I mean when I highlight this fact is that Georgia is more conduit than character.Indeed, this book at times feels like an arthouse film where the cinematography and scene structure matters more than the acting. If I have a criticism of I’m the Girl, it’s mainly that Georgia receives very little character development for a protagonist. She is stubbornly fixated on becoming an Aspera girl, even as the flags around her turn deeper and deeper shades of red. I bet that if I head over to the Goodreads s of this book, I’ll see—yep, there’s a bunch of 1-star s highlighting this flaw. And I get it! We all want to see an innocent protagonist who gets taken advantage of, victimized, abused, grow and challenge her abusers and somehow win. Summers is as stubborn as Georgia in refusing to give us that satisfaction. If you have read Sadie then you shouldn’t be surprised, though you are allowed to be disappointed.But I don’t really even consider this a criticism on my part if I look at the book through that different artistic lens. Georgia is how Summers distills the theme of the book into a reasonably linear narrative. Georgia doesn’t change for most of the book because part of the point of I’m the Girl is that our world doesn’t change, at least not in this respect. Even after #MeToo and #TimesUp, even when a big man falls and ends up in prison for his crimes, the fundamental fabric of our society remains patriarchal. The players and pawns change but the game itself does not.With this in mind, an ending that might feel frustrating and meaningless becomes, in many ways, the most uplifting part of the book. There is incredible power not just to the final line itself, but to how the book design actually supports its delivery. The line is its own final chapter, and the book is typeset in such a way that it appears on the verso, so you’re forced to turn the page before seeing it. The last thing you read, the penultimate line, is “I bring my hands to the necklace.” In that moment, everything Georgia has experienced hangs in the balance. The necklace is a metaphor for the life Georgia has been trying to build for herself, at only sixteen. What she does next is everything, is an indication of where Georgia will be going from here. So you have to pause. You have to take in the blank space at the end of the chapter, a yawning lacuna fraught with possibility, before turning the page to read that final line and learn Georgia’s fate—or at least, rather, get the barest of hints. It’s brilliant.Summers has a well-deserved reputation for devastation, a reputation I have long agreed with in my s. Make no mistake: I’m the Girl is a devastating novel. As I said earlier, it’s brutal. There are graphic depictions of the body of a murdered girl and multiple scenes of rape. This is not a nice book to read; I didn’t particularly enjoy it. If you came here looking for a more straightforward thriller, I think you’ll be very disappointed. Similarly, though this book will inevitably be labelled as young adult thanks to its protagonist’s age, it is not. Not really. But the book’s refusal to conform to neat genre lines isn’t the book’s problem; it’s ours.Indeed, you can dislike this book and criticize it for being a hot mess of an experiment—as long as you recognize that’s what it is. And that, I think, is what I am celebrating here as a Courtney Summers fangirl. A decade ago, Summers was writing relatively straightforward young adult narratives about how we fuck up the lives of high school girls. They were good, sometimes even great, and even then Summers demonstrated her power to plumb the depths of teenage angst. But her last three novels have, in my estimation, eclipsed her earlier works by dint of her willingness to play with story structure and character in a way that she did not or could not before. I can see how someone coming to this book as their first Summers experience, or coming to it hoping for a retread of any of her previous works, might feel let down. I can’t say that I feel that way, though, because all I feel is awe.Despite Summers being the Queen of Devastation, and despite this novel being so unrelenting in its brutality, I feel compelled to conclude that this might be one of the more hopeful entries in Summers’ entire repetoire. Is that weird? Like, Sadie remains my far-and-away favourite simply for the indelible space that girl has set up in rent-free in my mind, but that book is also quite graphic and bleak in its telling and does not, in my opinion, offer even the smallest morsel of hope for a better future. I’m the Girl, on the other hand, grants us at least one moment of hoping for something more.Our world doesn’t change, alas. Georgia’s story is too many girls’ stories. It shouldn’t be. One day, I hope, it isn’t. But until that time, novels like this bear witness to the fundamental flaws of our society. They refuse to glorify or excuse this violence, but they also don’t sanitize it. They refuse to let us look away. The powerful men at the centre of this story are truly heinous, yet they cannot operate with such impunity unless they are supported by people—including women—who manage to rationalize their complicity until they can still sleep at night. Because, yes, men do these awful things to women and girls. But the rest of us are the ones who keep letting them get away with it.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

In paSometimes being asexual (and in my case, aromantic) can feel very lonely, for reasons perhaps obvious but which I will elaborate on in a moment. In particular, it feels like we are usually an afterthought when it comes to research about queer people and sexuality. I know that’s not entirely the case, though, and am always looking to broaden my knowledge about those who study and write about asexuality. So of course I leaped at the chance to read Refusing Compulsory Sexuality: A Black Asexual Lens on Our Sex-Obsessed Culture by Sherronda J. Brown. Not only does it discuss the ways in which our society privileges allosexual people and pairings, but it also challenges some of my understandings as a white person, getting me to think about the intersections of racism and acephobia.The book comprises twelve chapters (plus a foreword, introduction, and afterword). Each chapter explores a different dimension of compulsory sexuality, which is a term Brown uses to build on top of the more well-known compulsory heterosexuality, which is the idea that social pressures encourage and reward heterosexual expressions of love and desire and punishes those who deviate from that norm. In uplifting voices on the asexual spectrum and research into asexuality, Brown wants to emphasize that beyond compulsory heterosexuality, there is a wider idea that sex itself is a requirement for full admittance into the human experience. Hence, compulsory sexuality: moving the gatekeeping goalposts so that queer people are OK as long as they’re having sex with someone, but if you don’t actually care all that much about sex … well, that is just a bridge too far!This privileging of sex as a determiner of identity has long bothered me, and I’m glad more people are calling it out. Your sexual orientation is whom you’re attracted to, not who you do, if you know what I mean. Yet even in queer spaces, the performance of sex and sexuality often become more important than the underlying attraction. Brown argues that this is inherently exclusionary of ace people:In order for asexuality to be understood and recognized as the queer identity that it is, sex acts and sexualization would first have to be removed from the center of dominant conceptions of queer identity.This can be a touchy subject among queer rights activists, and understandably so. A great deal of the queerphobia lobbed our way these days comes in the form of accusations that we are predatory, as the recent co-opting of groomer by far-right activists demonstrates. I get why allosexual queer people are very invested in celebrating non-normative sex and sexuality in a healthy, sex-positive way. Yet I appreciate that Brown is unyielding on this point:Hyperfocus on queer sex and sex roles is a direct result of the oversexualization of queerness as a means to construct it as nothing more than sexual deviance and also to reassert heteronormative gender roles within queer relations….That is to say, the way our mainstream society oversexualizes/hypersexualizes queer people is an intentional form of controlling and minimizing our queerness as a political and personal identity. It is a radical act, therefore, to reposition our queerness along those axes—and in doing so, realigning allosexual queers and asexual queers.Brown’s unrelenting grounding of asexuality in the history and politics of queer liberation is refreshing. She makes it clear that we have always been here, always been a part of queer movements. It’s gratifying to see it all spelled out this way in black and white, for so often, asexual exclusion takes the form of asexual erasure. This is a book that is determined to make us feel seen.Then we have the way Brown discusses how compulsory sexuality overlaps and interlocks with anti-Black racism, especially misogynoir, along with fatphobia. She relates well-known stereotypes of Black people, such as the Jezebel, Mammy, Mandingo, etc., to compulsory sexuality, demonstrating how white supremacy has long set up a correlation between hypersexualization and race (at least in the eyes of white people). Hence, Black asexual people face additional challenges that white asexual people like myself don’t because they also carry the burden of numerous racist stereotypes. Something I really like about Brown’s presentation of these ideas is the way she works them into every chapter, truly ensuring that this important element receives thorough examination instead of, say, a token chapter like it might be given in another scholar’s work.Indeed, while I would have read this book even if it was solely about asexuality, the intersectional component is what truly got me excited. As a white person, it’s important to me that I understand not just the privilege I have in terms of how society treats me but also the ways in which our society has shaped my very thinking. Brown does not mince her words:What is true of whiteness in every space, even in “progressive” and “inclusive” spaces, is that it will always work to create some form of exclusivity as a means to reassert white superiority. Therefore, white asexuals often claim asexual queerness as a property, just as whiteness itself is claimed as a property, as a space that others are barred from entering into.I’m being called out—and I appreciate it. I think this is one of the most pressing challenges that white queer activists face right now, i.e., acknowledging how we inadvertently work against the overall cause for liberation by refusing to acknowledge the presence of race and role of racism in our spaces. This book is a direct challenge to any claims on asexuality as a bulwark of whiteness and white supremacy. While we white asexuals might not be intentionally perpetuating those ideas, we have grown up with them and internalized them. So this book, in addition to validating us, will challenge us in the best possible ways.And Refusing Compulsory Sexuality is so validating! The older I get, the more that compulsory (hetero)sexuality bothers me. I used to think that I had escaped it, having grown out of the dating-heavy period of my twenties wherein all my peers seemed to be hooking up and then shacking up. I thought that once I reached the refuge of my thirties, I could start my inevitable evolution into the “cool spinster aunt,” the friend who would take your kids for a night when you wanted to fuck, the perpetual bachelorette sipping tea on her deck, ready when you called to vent about your partner. That was supposed to be my life!But I am realizing that compulsory sexuality will continue to stalk me through my decades, evolving as I evolve yet ever present. Nowadays it’s the gentle but hollow caress of loneliness as I watch more of my peers pair off and embark on a new phase of their lives that I have opted out of. (Brown introduced me to chrononormativity, coined by Elizabeth Freeman, to identify this idea that our lives should unfold along a particular trajectory as determined by social and cultural norms.) I have no desire to have a partner of any kind, to have children of my own; I enjoy living by myself—yet I live within a society that is constantly telling me such a state is unnatural, pitiable at best and deviant at worst.Please believe me, my allosexual readers, when I say that you don’t truly understand how much of our world is built upon this assumption that sex and sexual attraction are required and normative. You don’t. It isn’t just the idea that our society itself has become over-sexualized, the so-called “raunch culture” that other books I’ve read have tried to unpack. It goes so much deeper than that, intersecting, as Brown notes, with forces like white supremacy. For us asexuals, it’s a world that holds us at arm’s length, misunderstanding or mistrusting us.But maybe if you read this book, you can get a glimpse into my world. Truly the most fulfilling part of this book for me is Brown’s unapologetic tone. Early on she calls out how we asexual writers often attach disclaimers and qualifiers to our statements: oh, some ace people masturbate; some of us choose to get married or even have sex; some of us might even enjoy sex! Partly we do this because the asexual spectrum is incredibly diverse, ranging from people who experience zero sexual attraction, like myself, to people whose attraction fluctuates based on factors ranging from time to connection to someone. But we also do this because of internalized acephobia and this idea that we need to make ourselves more palatable to allosexual readers, reassure you that we are actually Just Like You! Brown recoils from this, as do I (though I freely admit I am guilty of acceding to the pressure to do this in my blog posts), and it endeared me to her writing immediately.Refusing Compulsory Sexuality is not just a succinct and edifying work of Black asexual scholarship: it’s an unyielding assertion of the belongingess of asexuality in our society and sociology. Not only does this book make me feel seen, but it makes me feel valued and recognizes my humanity. It centres me in a way that many queer conversations do not, even when they are inclusive of me. If you have any interest in a more scholarly read about sex and sexuality in our cultures, you need to read this.

She’s preaching to the choir when she talks about wearing them pretty much exclusively. For me as a trans woman, dresses are my way of embodying and expressing my femininity (they are not, of course, the only way to be feminine). I’ll talk more about that later in the . For now, I’m happy that NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press provided the eARC! Skirts: Fashioning Modern Femininity in the Twentieth Century is a thorough overview of how skirts and dresses have evolved in response to our changing society and cultures. I learned a lot, and it gave me a lot to think about.This book is not for the fashion faint of heart! Now, it’s ok if you are a fashion neophyte like me! I don’t know much about fashion. I recognized a couple of the bigger names dropped here—Chanel, Dior, Versace, et al—but Chrisman-Campbell demonstrates why she is the fashion historian and I am not with the effortless way she elucidates connections among fashion designers, fashion houses, and various other parts of the industry. I added a great many words to my vocabulary as I read. So unless you too have studied fashion history already, be prepared to be immersed in a whirlwind of new ideas and concepts.The book is structured into ten chapters, each of which is named after a particular garment: the delphos, the wrap dress, the little black dress, the mini skirt, etc. Upon this structure, Chrisman-Campbell layers and drapes and pins on the development of milestones in dress and skirt fashion. Though the chapters are arranged in a loosely chronological way, Chrisman-Campbell continually revisits important touchstones in history, such as the two world wars, to connect their dramatic reshaping of Western society to the particulars of the garment she’s discussing at the time. Hence, Chrisman-Campbell spends much of the wrap dress chapter commenting on Diane von Furstenberg’s iteration of it, she does trace its origins to the taxicab dress earlier in the century, created in response to women needing to get in and out of their dresses more easily and with fewer hands to assist.It’s somewhat of a truism that the world wars, particularly the Second World War, upended the social order. For that reason, much of what Chrisman-Campbell has to say might feel at first glance very obvious. What makes Skirts so enduringly edifying, then, are the particular facts that she brings to bear in each moment. It’s one thing for an historian (or even a grandstanding layperson holding court at a dinner party) to make sweeping proclamations about how the Second World War liberalized clothing customs or whatever. It’s another thing entirely to drill down into the details and the nuance—the way that hemlines fluctuated over the decades, for example. Shorter hemlines were a response to rationing of fabric during the war, and longer hemlines took over afterwards as a sign of prosperity, only to rise again as fashion designers carved out a new category, teenager. As Chrisman-Campbell tracks these decade-by-decade, sometimes year-by-year, changes, she names names and even goes so far as to cite specific shows, catalogues, or photographs that incited new fashion. It’s so much more complicated than “shorter hemlines correlate to women’s liberation.” It’s a complex ecosystem of designers, celebrity models, advertising campaigns, parties, entertainment media, and yes, the economy.As the subtitle of the book suggests, and as Chrisman-Campbell refines in her introduction when she traces the metonymy of skirt, ultimately she is trying to unpack the complicated way in which skirts and dresses are linked to each era’s concept of femininity and women’s bodies. Women’s dress has historically been a tool for exclusion, for titillation, or even for asserting power. The shifting nature of what is acceptable, when, and where reveals a lot about how our society polices women’s bodies. There’s also a need to be intersectional in this conversation, for Black women, fat women, and disabled women receive more scrutiny and censure than white, able-bodied, or thin women.Ultimately, I’m not sure how successful Skirts is at having that intersectional conversation. That probably means it’s not as successful as it should be. To her credit, Chrisman-Campbell signals that she is aware of the need for this intersectionality and brings it up on occasion. She mentions the misogynoir that Serena Williams has faced on the tennis court over. Later, she touches upon the queering of fashion, from dancehall and Pose to male celebrities like Kurt Cobain and Harry Styles wearing dresses. All in all, I think Chrisman-Campbell tries to be inclusive, but she could do more to acknowledge how the fashion industry has historically been white and cisnormative—partly because fashion was, until the middle of the twentieth century, very much a rich person’s game as well.That’s the other area in which I was expecting more from this book: commentary. Each chapter is very illustrative and comprehensive in tracing influences, developments, etc. Yet Chrisman-Campbell mostly saves her editorializing for the introduction and conclusion. I can understand the possible reasoning behind this writing decision, yet for a book that seems to aim broader than an academic audience, it doesn’t do much to establish Chrisman-Campbell’s voice, as a writer, throughout. Consequently, I was less excited in the reading of the book than I was by how much I had anticipated reading it!I was drawn to Skirts because I was drawn to skirts. Well, mostly dresses. I came out as transgender two-and-a-half years ago. Part of my social transition has involved redefining my wardrobe in a way that authentically represents my gender. For me in particular—not, I want to stress, for all trans women—this means dresses. I really identified with what Chrisman-Campbell says about how comfortable they are, how easy it is to slip into one before you go about your day … I love dresses. Embracing the dress was a way of embracing the womanhood that had, until recently, eluded me. Replacing my old wardrobe with a new one full of dresses was a transcendent experience: gone were a couple of mix-and-match separate sweaters and jeans and dress pants (for work); in came the dresses in a riot of colours and patterns and prints, particularly polka dot. I love polka dot. Also, because I’m a knitter, I have now knit myself two skirts, projects which have once more helped me connect with and reaffirm my femininity.So reading this book was, for me, an important way of connecting with traditions of femininity that are my heritage but were denied to me as a result of being assigned male at birth. When I put on a dress in the morning to go to work—whether it’s a comfy wrap, slinky sheathe, flowing midi, etc.—I’m joining a long tradition of women embracing not just fashion as it exists in this moment in time but echoes of fashions past. (In my particular case, I have quite a late ’50s/early ’60s vibe in a lot of my wardrobe aesthetic—I adored hearing about how tights took over in the 1960s as hemlines rose again.) In an era where we are, hopefully, all starting to become more aware of the harms of fast fashion, learning about the history of our clothing is as important as understanding the present state of the fashion industry.Skirts is therefore one of those books I would recommend in this way: if the description sounds like it’s a book for you, then it’s going to be a book for you. It is exactly what it says on the tin.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

But when Into the Broken Lands became available on NetGalley from DAW, I couldn’t not request it. I picked up some of her earlier secondary-world fantasy (Sing the Four Quarters) from the used bookstore but haven’t read it yet, so my experience with Huff has been limited to her urban-fantasy offerings. So I leaped at this chance to read a different type of fantasy from a Canadian author whose storytelling I enjoy, even if her writing hasn’t always worked for me. I wanted to see what she was like in a different element, and I got my wish.In a severe case of Aerith and Bob, Ryan is the Heir of Marsan, whether he likes it or not. He has travelled the Mage Road for its requisite twenty-eight days from Marsanport to Gateway, a town built atop ruins. There, he hopes to embark on a quest into the—wait for it—Broken—I said wait for it—into the Broken Lands. With me so far? He’s got your standard group of warriors, rogues, mages (but they’re called scholars because mages got a bad wrap after breaking said lands), and even a tank in the form of Nonee, aka “the weapon.” As Ryan quests for fire—er, fuel for a symbolic fire that burns back in Marsanport—death visits the party because Huff is a mean DM. Oh, and there are flashback chapters to when Ryan’s granduncle, Garrett, did this all sixty years ago.If my summary sounds tongue-in-cheek, believe me when I say that I enjoyed this book and am teasing it with love simply because it is so easy to tease! I seem to be on a fantasy kick at the moment with a lot of new books that attempt to recreate or pay homage to classic fantasy. As I noted in my recent  of The Oleander Sword, the best of these books do so in a way that improves on diversity and storytelling and makes it the author’s own while preserving the tropes of classic fantasy that make it so addictive to a reader like myself. Huff’s worldbuilding and cultural elements are not as refreshing as Suri’s, but I think she still manages to strike a good balance.This book feels like a D&D adventure or an old-school quest narrative. The in-and-out structure makes it easy to follow, if a tad linear for my tastes. Huff tries to offset this with a dash of parallelism in the form of the flashbacks to Garrett and Arianna. These offer a contrast to what Ryan’s party experiences in terms of differing setbacks and hardships but mainly serve to establish the throughline of Nonee’s increasing sense of self and agency, which is arguably the most important and interesting part of the book.Nonee was designed, shaped in the womb by a mage, to be a weapon. She has supernatural strength, endurance, etc. Ever since Ryan’s ancestors fled the Broken Lands and founded Marsanport, she has been with them, a potent reminder of a past filled with now-forbidden magic. Is she a person though? Most of the scholars and nobility who had access to her in Marsanport would have said no. When Ryan arrives in Gateway, where Nonee has lived for the past sixty years, he probably would have said no based on all the stories he was told. But we know better, of course, and Ryan soon learns better, as does much of his party. The question Huff actually wants us to ponder is a little more interesting than the simple affirmation of personhood; she wants us to ask, “Who is Nonee if she isn’t just a weapon?”As we ponder this, we’re treated to an adventure narrative featuring monsters, traps, and the madness of mages of a bygone era. Huff delivers all of this in her usual expressive style, along with banter and humour among her characters that is familiar to me from her Gale Women and Keeper novels. There’s a little less focus on sex in this book, which I enjoyed, but don’t worry, there’s still some good innuendo and a fair amount of queerness here as well. Huff is very good at writing characters who are believably flawed, people like Ryan who are only trying their best, or Lyelee, corrupted by her thirst for knowledge.I like how Huff sets up the general antagonism towards magic and mages as a function of the history of this world. It would have been cool to learn more about cultures outside Marsanport, like Shurlia, and their attitudes towards magic—we get tantalizing glimpses, but that’s all. It’s unclear from the marketing whether this book is meant to be standalone or the beginning of a series—to its credit, it can function as either; like so many chameleon novels, however, that makes it somewhat of a letdown as both.See, I enjoyed this book a great deal—I was always eager to pick it up again after I had put it down—and it lived up to my expectations for it. But it only lived up to my expectations; it never once was in danger of exceeding them. Ryan’s quest is perilous, and at times its intensity becomes engrossing. Yet the resolution is about what I expected to happen. The characters develop roughly along the trajectory I expected them to develop. Nonee’s emotional journey she undergoes as she grieves for Arianna while simultaneously developing a grudging respect and camaraderie for Ryan? Par for the course.This is a book that does everything it sets out to do with all the exquisite skill that a writer of Huff’s experience and talent can muster. It is a serviceable fantasy novel that scratches my itch for more classic epic fantasy. But it doesn’t swing big, doesn’t take advantage of the potential of the world Huff has created.Would I read a sequel if one is forthcoming? Yes, absolutely. Huff and the book have both earned that much. Yet I don’t find myself clamouring for such a sequel quite as much as I need from other series. Into the Broken Lands is a fun, fulfilling fantasy adventure—but it just leaves me wanting instead of wanting more.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Not sure yet.” Well, thanks to NetGalley and Orbit giving me access to the eARC, the answer proved to be yes! I’m pleased to report that The Oleander Sword improves upon much of what I already liked about Tasha Suri’s first novel in this trilogy.We pick up some months following the end of the first novel: Malini is prosecuting her civil war against her brother for control of the empire of Parijat. In Ahiranya, her love interest, Priya, is working with temple sister and fellow elder Bhumika following Ahiranya’s secession from the empire. Initially separated, events conspire to bring Priya and Malini back together, while Emperor Chandra resolves to crush his rebellious sister. Rumblings of old gods renewed mean that a mortal war may be the least of everyone’s worries.It has been a while since I have enjoyed a military fantasy novel as much as this—or to be more accurate, a fantasy novel that depicts nations at war. Suri focuses less here on the logistics of campaign than the relationships among characters. I’m not knocking bean-counting fantasy novels if that’s your thing, but it is increasingly not for me. Whether we’re talking the star-crossed romance between Malini and Priya or the battle of wills between Malini and her generals, Suri delivers an ever-shifting set of circumstances that always left me wanting more.At the same time, Suri delves deeper into the mythology of this world, and this is why I marked my  as containing spoilers: the yaksa are fucking terrifying. They land perfectly in that uncanny valley between human and eldritch horror: just human-like enough to feel relatable, except there is something so off about their conduct. Suri captures this perfectly by having the returned yaksa literally wearing the bodies of former temple elders. The yaksa are the type of gods who see humans as uninteresting except as worshippers. Their chilling amorality is, to me, a thousand times worse than a malevolent deity, because there is so little to bargain with when it comes to yaksa. Either you serve them or they wipe you off the board.So whereas the magic in The Jasmine Throne was interesting and fresh but underdeveloped, here it becomes its own subplot, takes on its own life. Priya and Bhumika’s powers, the rot, and a deeper story of how the yaksa came to this world—all of it comes together quite nicely. To make things even juicier, there are no heroes in the building: the people who drove the yaksa from this world long ago? They worship either a nameless god or deities who demand that women willingly throw themselves into a fire to ascend. So, that’s not a great choice either….Indeed, “there are no good choices” might sum up the theme of The Oleander Sword quite nicely. This is a book about sacrifice, both willing and unwilling. It’s about second chances and grand mistakes, as well as incredible gambits that fail more often than they succeed. It’s a book about the cruelty of doing what is right instead of what is easy.So much of this book feels like Suri read a lot of classic fantasy and then said, “OK, but let’s make it diverse and make it my own.” You’ve got your multiple POV characters. You’ve got your maligned heir to the throne attempting to take what’s hers backed by a prophecy. You’ve got your priesthoods and religions and various gods ranging from merely “burning women at the stake” to “transforming you into an Ent if you piss them off.” You’ve got your two main characters in love but of course they can’t be together because reasons.Basically, The Oleander Sword is catnip for fantasy readers. If, like me, you read The Jasmine Throne but were on the fence, give the sequel a try. I love it when I take a chance on the second book in a series and it elevates my opinion of the series and the first book. Now I’m excited for book 3.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

This summer I tackled Agnes Grey, Anne Brontë’s first novel. I knew that I had read The Tenant ofHigh time I read more nineteenth-century fiction! This summer I tackled Agnes Grey, Anne Brontë’s first novel. I knew that I had read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall prior to the pandemic and my transition, but wow—I didn’t expect it to be five years ago! How time passes quickly. It’s difficult to compare these novels given that they are quite different in their goals. Nevertheless, I think it’s fair to say that The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a superior work of fiction overall, but Agnes Grey has a lot of heart to its storytelling.Our eponymous heroine is the daughter of a clergyman who, because of his failing health, can no longer support his wife and two daughters. As Agnes comes of age, her prospects for marriage are slight (the introduction to this edition explains that, during the time Brontë was writing, eligible women outnumbered eligible men in England by a considerable margin, causing somewhat of a crisis!). She fixes on being a governess so as to earn money for herself and her family. This is easier said than done, however. Even after Agnes obtains a situation, she finds her charges very difficult to wrangle. The novel relates, from Agnes’s perspective, her time with the Bloomfield and then the Murray families. As Agnes struggles to find the respect and fulfilment she believes due to her as a governess, she also observes the lives of those around her. In this way, Brontë creates a delicate portrait of a slice of English life in the early nineteenth century.Let me tell you: this novel was giving me flashbacks to my own two years teaching English schoolchildren! Agnes complains about the intractability of two or three children—try thirty! Nevertheless, I found her a likeable protagonist especially with her flaws. A story of a super-governess might make for a good musical, but a governess who struggles to manage the children in her care makes for a far more interesting story.It’s tempting to read into this book much of Brontë’s own experiences, and indeed, the introduction does just that. Brontë worked as a governess for a time. Much like Agnes, Anne was at times treated like the baby of the family. While some of these similarities are undeniable, I think it is also important to read the work as a far broader attempt to chronicle the experiences of a young Englishwoman of a certain social standing.Much of the narration is incredibly descriptive in style: Agnes will spend the majority of a chapter painting us a picture of the faults of the children in her care or relating a specific event she witnessed. Despite this, Agnes also has a fair amount of agency in her story. When she realizes that she is more of an erstwhile companion to the Murray children than a true governess, she seems to relax and decides to make the most of the situation. This includes doing things like visiting elderly people in the village and salivating over the new curate, Mr. Weston. We get to witness Agnes’s disappointment at feeling of the same social standing (or nearly so) with her charges, yet she is treated as a servant.The ending comes upon us suddenly and wraps things up rather neatly. This is another area wherein Brontë shows her relative inexperience as a writer. Yet she makes up for this in the quality of feeling she puts into Agnes Grey. This is a book about teenage and new adult angst. It’s about not fitting in, feeling adrift. There’s probably even an argument to be made that Agnes is neurodivergent, though it’s difficult to ascribe that to fictional characters from the nineteenth century. For all these reasons, I enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to Brontë fans or indeed anyone looking to get into early Victorian literature.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Facing discrimination and prejudice as a refugee who belongs to an ethnic minority in their new city. Dealing with the complicated history of one’s culture, one’s past. Pushing back against for-profit healthcare. These are all powerful elements in The Bruising of Qilwa by Naseem Jamnia. Thanks to NetGalley and Tachyon Publications for the eARC!Although novella-length, this book brims with plot. Firuz, a Sassanian refugee, joins a free healing clinic run by Kofi. There, they study under Kofi while also secretly practising the blood magic they learned from their homeland. Once, the Sassanians ruled a vast empire. Now, their homeland conquered, they are the targets of genocide. As more Sassanians arrive in Qilwa, anti-refugee sentiments rise, and plagues and disease do not help matters. The title of the book refers to the most obvious symptom of a mystery disease that Firuz spends much of their time diagnosing—when they aren’t helping Kofi with the political battle to keep the clinic open, or teaching their adopted charge how to control her blood magic, or feeling like a bad sibling for not helping their brother with a gender realignment spell … yeah, Firuz’s life is complicated, hectic even.It’s through such an embattled narrative that Jamnia explores questions of identity and motive. Firuz hides their blood magic use, because in Qilwa, blood magic is the stuff of nightmare legend. They know they would be ostracized. Yet, despite the considerable abuse they endured at the hands of their Elders while being trained, Firuz is also proud of their abilities and their ability to heal with blood magic. As the novella progresses, we see Firuz wrestle with larger questions of identity, such as what it means to be a member of an ethnic group that is now marginalized but once was the conquering power across this continent.Throughout this story, Jamnia finesses the scale of the narrative with impressive skill. It’s always tempting to see the novella as merely a “short novel,” but that would be like saying a 22-minute television show is simply half a 43-minute television show. The novella demands more character development than seen in a short story, yet the shorter length means different pacing from its longer cousin. Jamnia has Firuz encountering the Governor of Qilwa and pleading for assistance on a municipal level, yet they also have Firuz essentially down in the trenches, fighting against the bruising disease on the level of individuals. This is a story where the smallest action matters, yet large actions also have correspondingly large consequences. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it cozy fantasy, but there are certainly some moments of more intimate joy and sorrow here, especially as Firuz navigates their relationships with their chosen and found family members.Jamnia has created a queernormative world here, one in which diverse sexualities and genders are respected as a matter of course. As I have said in other s, this should essentially become the norm within fantasy (and any genre, I would hope), for the idea that a fantasy world must somehow be “historically accurate” is … contradictory at best. Yet a queernormative world doesn’t mean that queer people are free from struggle, as Firuz’s relationship with their brother, Parviz, illustrates. For all Firuz’s magical talents, they don’t quite have the skill or knowledge to realign Parviz’s body (i.e., magical gender-affirming transformation, omg) to match his gender. As a result, Firuz blames themself for Parviz’s ongoing struggle with dysphoria. Qilwa might have allowed refugees to settle on the outskirts of its city, and it might be accepting of gender diversity, but this society still had broken and jagged edges and prejudice against certain types of medical treatments or the magic used to provide them. That’s why Firuz must teach Afsoneh blood magic in secret, even as she chafes under such restrictions and Firuz wrestles with whether or not they do Afsoneh more harm than good by trying to be a teacher without any formal training as such. In this way, Firuz’s relationships intersect with and inform the political dimensions of the novella, which in turn lead to Firuz’s involvement with the main conflict.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the construction of The Bruising of Qilwa is the way that the antagonist is revealed only at the climax of the novella. Honestly, this is the part I found least interesting. This character’s motives, while clearly explained by Jamnia, are not all that compelling—perhaps because I spent so much time with Firuz that this antagonist feels less developed as a result. While the physical and magical conflict that ensues is a fun and tense moment of action, I would have liked to see more pages spent drawing out the antagonist’s plot in a way that builds more suspense. That being said, I really enjoyed how Jamnia depicts Firuz’s sense of betrayal and the way that this overall influences their outlook going forward.So The Bruising of Qilwa is a good time. It’s a novella of deep, layered relationships between characters who all have well-defined personalities despite the deceptive brevity of this book. The main character in particular is so flawed and fallible yet still someone I want to cheer for. While I can acknowledge the Persian influences Jamnia weaves in here, I can’t comment too much on those given my ignorance, except to say I’m here for it. I’ve kind of slid sideways into Persian-inspired fantasy stories with the likes of Girl, Serpent, Thorn. But I love seeing the genre move away from thinly veiled analogues of Eurocentric feudalism or appropriation-driven attempts at mirroring other cultures at the hands of white writers. Mostly, though, I loves me some urban fantasy set in a secondary world, where characters are free to be themselves even as the world around them feels like it’s coming apart at the seams.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

For those who don’t know me, I want to be upfront: I don’t generally read horror. It takes a special kind of speculative-fiction author to get me to do that, and Gailey happens to be such an author.Vera Crowder is returning to her childhood home to care for her dying mother. The wrinkle? Vera’s father was a serial killer; he killed people in that very house, and this one fact has shaped Vera’s entire life and torpedoed her relationship with her mother. Or at least, that’s how the story starts. As Gailey weaves flashbacks into present-day tensions, we start to learn that there is more happening in the Crowder house than meets the eye. Vera feels a connection reawaken, and as she begins to prepare the house for her mother’s death … maybe it is preparing her.Can we just talk for a moment about the luxurious quality of Gailey’s writing? They are a master of analogy, metaphor, and simile. The majority of this book is narration and description, something that sometimes doesn’t work for me. But Gailey is so adept at deploying figurative language without verging into purple prose, and the result is … just sumptuous. I read this in a day—and that isn’t only because, as a new release, it has holds on it and so I have to return it within a week instead of two weeks, oops, should have realized…. Anyway, I read this in a day because it was so easy to keep reading. I love how each flashback chapter begins with Vera’s age and ends with such explicit and ominous foreshadowing. Meanwhile, the chapters set in the present day have their own kind of foreboding created by the mood of Gailey’s writing as they unspool the mystery of Vera herself.You see, I won’t spoil the plot, but Vera is not an innocent person, shall we say? There really are no innocents at all in this book, from Vera to her mother and father to James Duvall—everyone has an angle, has a secret or a weakness or an urge that beats deep inside of them. Vera is not an easy character to love, for Gailey presents her to us in a very detached way. That is the point, I think—this is less about cheering on a protagonist and more of a study in what a serial killer’s daughter might become, with a dash of the supernatural thrown in for good measure. Vera essentially walked away from her entire life: her hometown, her parents, her childhood—and when it comes roaring back, when it pulls her back home, it threatens to swallow her identity whole.There are echoes in here of commentary on the place of spectacle in our society. The way that Vera’s mother allowed the Crowder House to become a tourist trap, leveraged it to survive under capitalism, and how this allowed James and his father into the Crowders’ lives. This is a theme that isn’t fully explored, much like I wish Gailey had spent more time on Vera and Daphne’s relationship as well.Just Like Home is what I would call an experience. The reading of it is about as joyous an experience as a dark, bloody horror novel can be. Afterwards, the memory of it starts to fall apart a bit in your mind, as you realize there are pieces that maybe don’t fit quite right. But this novel just confirms my impression that Gailey is a speculative talent to watch, simply because they don’t do things by half measures, and they are bringing deeply imaginative stories into this world.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I picked up a whole stack of her paperbacks from the used bookstore; I decided to start with The Paladin because the internet told me that it was a good standalone work. No lies! Now, it took me over a week to read this little story because I was distracted and, perhaps, not in the mood for exactly this type of tale. Nevertheless, while I didn’t love this book, it showcased Cherryh’s writing skills in a way that left me wanting to read more of her work.Shoka, once Lord Saukendar and swordmaster to the Emperor, lives in self-imposed exile on a mountain on the outskirts of Chiyaden while the young Emperor continues to be overshadowed by a tyrannical regent. His peace is disturbed by Taizu, a peasant girl on the cusp of womanhood. She has crossed the empire in search of the fabled Saukendar and is determined to have him teach her the art of the sword, despite her unfortunate gender and Shoka’s own desire for solitude. Taizu’s goal is no less than the killing of Gitu, the Emperor, and Ghita, the Regent. As you might imagine, she gradually wins over Shoka, but things don’t quite turn out the way either would expect.I loved the start of this book. It feels a bit like an ancient legend, you know? Determined, plucky youth convinces the grouchy old master to take her on so that she can train for her revenge. All the ingredients are here. Cherryh’s style, at least in this novel, is incredibly lush and descriptive—the dialogue is sparse, but she spends a lot of time on setting, as well as on what’s going through Shoka’s head. The narrator is quick to highlight that Shoka is past his prime, both in age and in political will. Similarly, Taizu’s revenge plot is absolutely bananapants—something Shoka never fails to point out to her—and the way Cherryh handles this later in the story is pretty good.I could have done without all the lust on Shoka’s part. I have come to expect that from fantasy novels written by men, and perhaps from Tanya Huff, so this was a bit of a surprise. It’s not quite lechery, I suppose, on Shoka’s part, but it just weirds me out, the way it goes beyond addressing the elephant in the room and turns into a kind of fixation for him.Nevertheless, the first half of the book is quite the training montage. The second half turns into what I can only describe as military fantasy, and that’s where the novel starts to lose me. I had trouble following some of what was going on—there were a lot of names of people and places, a lot of discussion of tactics and difficult situations, and not a lot of moments for our protagonists to pause and work things out. When we finally get to meet the Emperor and his evil Regent, it feels hollow because we don’t really know either of these people. They were just names to us, and then their encounter with Shoka and Taizu is all too brief.At the same time, as I said earlier, I really respect Cherryh’s storytelling chops. Even as I felt my interest flagging, I could see the wonderful story structure and thematic elements at play. The way that Shoka must shift back into his old persona of Saukendar, how his legend precedes him as he and Taizu travel towards the capital, his awareness that this is a double-edged sword that might get others killed … it’s very good. It’s a slick commentary on the issues with placing our faith in legends who turn out just to be men—with all the fallibility and foibles of age!I doubt The Paladin will sit with me for a long time. We’ll see how I feel about the other Cherryh novels I pick up in the months to come! But it’s an example of how a novel can still be a solid work of story even when it doesn’t personally grab me the way I want.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

In Eversion, though space is a part of the setting, time is far more important. Reynolds takes your classic science-fiction trope of a time loop story, and he spins it just enough to keep things fresh. Thanks to Orbit and NetGalley for the eARC!Silas Coade is the assistant surgeon (well, only surgeon) aboard the Demeter, a sailing ship bound for the coast of Norway. Sorry, a steamship bound for the coast of South America. Sorry, a zeppelin bound for—OK, that’s about all I’m going to reveal. It’s a time loop, but it isn’t a time loop. Silas lives through similar-yet-subtly-different events over and over as part of an expedition to explore a curious and alien Edifice. Each time, he dies in some spectacular fashion, and another member of the expedition consistently drops her mask long enough to reveal that she knows something about what Silas is experiencing.The key to the success of Eversion is in Reynolds’ delight in how he describes each setting. The first several chapters of the book only ever hint at the science-fictional premise behind the events; taken separately, they are simply adventure stories about a ship on a mission for exploration and profit. Reynolds harnesses the tropes and storytelling devices in the tradition of authors like Jules Verne, creating an immersive, entertaining atmosphere with each setting Silas finds himself in. I love each of them.Alas, Reynolds finally drops the mask and allows Silas (and by extension, the reader) to see “reality,” I as let down. I thought the twist regarding Silas’s nature to be somewhat boring. It wasn’t predictable per se, at least not for me, but I was hoping for something … deeper, I guess? The same holds true for the nature of the Edifice and its antagonistic qualities. The second half of the novel is weaker, for there is much less danger for our protagonists. It becomes a kind of journey of exposition and self-discovery—and that has merit, I would agree, but it doesn’t hold interest as much as the tension of the first half did for me.That being said, I liked the ending and the resolution. As always, Reynolds might not consistently wow me with his stories, but he does make me think. His approach to science fiction is always interesting, thoughtful, and worth a read.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

That can’t be true, of course, because as far as I am concerned, the internet is for writing book s! Anyway, The Pornography Wars: The Past, Present, and Future of America’s Obscene Obsession is yet another entry in a long line of books that looks at how people have lined up against one another to support or oppose the creation, distribution, and consumption of pornography. Some people on both sides call themselves feminists. Kelsy Burke looks at who the people are on these sides, and how we got here. Thanks to NetGalley and publisher Bloomsbury USA for the eARC!I’ve read several books that touch on similar themes. Way back in 2018, I read the much older Female Chauvinist Pigs, which Burke cites here. More recently, I’ve read The Pornification of America and Why We Lost the Sex Wars, both through NetGalley as well. Why do I keep coming back to this topic? I think it has to do with a fascination with the limits of feminism. I identify as a feminist, but I also recognize that my views on feminism have been shaped by my privilege as a white, able-bodied person with a good education and job. A lot of my learning in recent years has focused on unlearning my white feminism in an attempt to look at things more intersectionally. Porn, and its influence on our culture, is at the centre of a lot of debates about what it means to be feminist. As usual, historically, it has been middle-class cis white women leading the charge, while sex workers are disproportionately poorer women and non-binary people of colour.Burke’s book intrigued me because, while didn’t go so far as to promise objectivity, it did say it would strive to include multiple perspectives on “the pornography wars” and to critique those perspectives. This was something I felt was sorely lacking in Levy’s Female Chauvinist Pigs, which despite professing feminist views and a neutrality towards porn, interviewed mostly people one would describe as anti-porn. In contrast, The Pornography Wars has data and stories gathered from across a vast spectrum, ranging from interviewees who are staunchly anti-porn on moral grounds to people who are staunchly pro-porn to people who are just confused, unsure, or who don’t like porn for their own reasons but aren’t opposed to its existence socially.Although I’m not going to get into it here, you can imagine, I hope, that my own relationship to porn, as a 32-year-old asexual transgender woman, is complicated. Indeed, Burke elucidates how most people’s relationship with porn is a complicated one, which is why this subject needs to be studied and discussed. Though I would largely describe myself as “pro-porn, sex-positive, pro-sex-worker,” I must admit that Burke’s work has me feeling more negative towards the porn industry than ever before.Now, I knew already about how problematic PornHub/MindGeek are. But as Burke peeled off the layers of corruption and dysfunction within the industry, I started to realize that the idea of “ethical porn” is problematic, to say the least. It’s great that one can pay for one’s porn, but that only solves a single problem and doesn’t address the underlying abuse of sex workers within the porn industry. A consumer must embark on more extensive research—has that talent ever been accused of sexual assault of a fellow talent?—to feel confident in the ethics of one’s pornography. Suddenly the idea of consuming porn ethically feels closer to the idea of consuming meat ethically—and while I haven’t gone vegetarian, I am all for dramatically reforming the meat industry.At the same time, Burke is careful not to repeat, and indeed she calls out, when critics of the porn industry cherry-pick the most sensational stories of abuse. As the subtitle of this book implies, part of her examination of the history of the pornography wars involves the battle to have pornography declared “obscene.” Burke is very careful to delineate between opponents of pornography who hold it as immoral versus those who see it as unhealthy (although there is often overlap).Her exploration of whether or not there is science to support the idea of porn addiction reminds us that science is a tool prone to being biased or misused. Plenty of evangelicals are seizing on science, albeit often junk science, to back up gender-essentialist ideas of brain function and sexuality. Though out of the scope of Burke’s thesis, these findings hint at the underlying problem in American society—a general dismantling of scientific literacy to the point where what counts as science and fact is now up for debate.As Burke points out, the pornography wars have become increasingly polarized and moralized. She wants to demonstrate that there is common ground between those who would describe themselves as anti-porn or pro-porn (or at least, porn-neutral). This might seem like an impossible task, but I think through the patient exploration of her topic from different angles, she succeeds. At the very least, The Pornography Wars shows that the history of smut, obscenity, and pornography in America is not as simple as many of the people on either side of this battlefield might claim. I really enjoyed learning about that history, and I think Burke did a great job of presenting different perspectives in a way that truly challenged my own existing views on pornography, both as a concept and as an industry.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

The idea that we can enter the world of dreams is as old as dreaming itself—many Indigenous cultures privilege the dreamworld and use it as a source of stories and even wayfinding. The Extractionist joins a very long line of science-fiction novels, then, that contemplate what happens if you get stuck in a dreamworld or virtual reality. Kimberly Unger imagines a world where this is common enough that it is someone’s job to go in and get you out. Throw in your standard double-crosses, action sequences, and murder attempts from any sci-fi thriller, and you’ve got this book!Thank you to NetGalley and Tachyon Publications for the eARC!Eliza McKay’s true passion is engineering nanomachines. Alas, the United States government revoked her licences to do so. Blacklisted, she resorts to other jobs—like extracting people whose personas have become stuck in the Swim, a collective cyberspace that people can visit for business or pleasure. Eliza’s latest job involves extracting a government spook, and as these things tend to go in a novel like this, everything goes sideways fast. The next few days entail tiny moments of respite in between intense scenes of terror and mortal peril. Along the way, Eliza has to decide whom to trust, who deserves her help, and how far she will go to finish the job.Probably the inevitable comparison ers will make here is to William Gibson, who coined the term cyberspace (which is not actually used in this book, but that’s what the Swim is). Gibson’s vision of a virtual reality achieved by directly networking one’s brain has indelibly shaped this entire subgenre. Generally, comparisons to him will not be favourable, so this is one of those rare cases where I’ll come down with the utmost compliment that I think Unger actually takes up Gibson’s legacy in a very appropriate and interesting way. She builds on Gibson’s influence on cyberpunk while taking into account things like quantum computing and the proliferation of VR/AR in today’s world.McKay is also quite a likable protagonist, all things considered—yes, she has trauma and a healthy heaping of avoidance issues, but she is also very self-aware and emotionally intelligent. This is a nice departure from the hard-boiled hacker stereotype. At one point she remarks on how she’s going to need sleep soon; not only did this feel refreshingly realistic in a thriller, but it’s nice to see our protagonist considering her limitations. Similarly, she has a good support network: a friendly AI to help her out, actual friends she knows in person, some dysfunctional family dynamics (don’t we all?). All in all, Unger has put a lot of work not only into the world but her main character and supporting cast.While the “good guys” are a force to be reckoned with, the antagonists in this story felt a little weak to me. On one hand, I like how the eventual “big bad” proves to be a sympathetic one. On the other hand, the red herring antagonist falls flat because he just doesn’t ever come off as much of a threat—and we only meet him once, then never really hear from him again. This misdirection, if that is what it is intended to be, misfires. The climactic battle in both the Swim and the real world is intense courtesy of Unger’s descriptions, but the build up to it feels lacking.Indeed, the pacing at the start felt very slow (despite some explosive beginnings)—it really wasn’t until I was about a quarter of the way into the novel before I sat up and said, “Oh, there’s something here.” Even though a lot happens, I admit, the book dragged on for me. Fortunately, I was interested in enough in the story, in finding out who was behind all of this and why, and I liked Eliza enough, as I said above, to keep reading.Equal parts exciting, then, and enervating, The Extractionist is a pretty strong contender for a new generation of cyberpunk that hews to the traditions of the subgenre while also carving out new ones given our modern society’s flirtation with a metaverse. Unger has a keen talent for description and characterization, even if her plotting and pacing left something to be desired (in my opinion). I had forgotten that I had previously read (but didn’t much like) Nucleation. So I’m glad I got to read another book of hers, one that I have enjoyed much more.

It’s rare that I manage to read the next book in a series in such close succession, butClaire Hansen returns in this sequel to Summon the Keeper. It’s rare that I manage to read the next book in a series in such close succession, but here we go! The Second Summoning embraces and builds upon certain elements of absurdity present in the first book. I admire how Tanya Huff can write urban fantasy that is simultaneously tense and intriguing yet also funny and lighthearted. However, the plot of this book didn’t entertain me as much as the first; I think this Huff series might just not be for me.Spoilers for the first book ahead but not for this one.Picking up shortly after the conclusion of the first book, The Second Summoning sees Claire and Dean have a fight over Dean’s continued association with her. Despite being in lurrrve, Claire is worried that Dean will get hurt (you know, standard superhero stuff). When they do finally consummate their love, it’s apparently sooooo good, so magically significant, that it leaves enough raw energy lying around to help jumpstart some shenanigans of Claire’s sister into a real, living embodiment of an angel. And where there’s an angel, there’s bound to be a demon….I’m starting to realize that maybe being disinterested in sex is one of the reasons I am less enthusiastic about Huff’s writing in this series. Her Gale Women trilogy certainly mentions sex (and in semi-incestuous ways even), but I don’t know—something about this series just feels so horny, and it doesn’t work for poor, ace Kara! The constant innuendo about Claire and Dean’s relationship, followed by all the references to Samuel having genitals (oh my!) … I’m trying to register how much I didn’t enjoy this writing while not condemning it, because my goal is not to be prudish but instead communicate what didn’t work for me.My favourite parts of the story probably involve the dynamic between Claire and her younger sister, Diana, who is an even more powerful Keeper but, of course, less mature. Diana acts not just as Claire’s foil but at times can even be an antagonist or anti-hero. Her fluid role in the story helps to keep things interesting. Ultimately, she and Claire are always on the same side—but as with her other series, this one demonstrates how Huff has a great handle on family dynamics and the ways in which family members will often be at odds over smaller issues even as they agree to work together on larger ones.Like I said at the start of my , the actual plot did very little for me. It is a lot of running around in Toronto, a lot of sex jokes, a lot of “isn’t being human weird but also kind of fun?” Though the stakes are arguably higher in this book, they don’t feel all that higher.I guess my overall opinion of The Second Summoning is that it was fine as a distraction, a decent novel, but nothing I got excited about. I will read the last book in the trilogy because I have already bought it; I’m curious to see what Huff brings and whether it will alter my “meh” reaction.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

The Disordered Cosmos appealed for a few reasons: I want to read more I am such a junkie for popular science books, especially popular physics books. The Disordered Cosmos appealed for a few reasons: I want to read more popular science books by people of colour; from the description, it sounded like it also would address discrimination within the fields of science; and I enjoy Chanda Prescod-Weinstein’s tweets.The first few chapters are heavy on physics. It is tempting to be lazy and call it your “standard” rendition of particle physics. Yet Prescod-Weinstein carefully layers in connections, even in these early chapters, to the themes she will make more prominent in the later chapters. She discusses her own attraction to physics at a young age, and she relates how the knowledge she shares here is as socially constructed as other concepts, like racism and race. For instance, she criticizes the very term dark matter, arguing instead for the name non-luminous matter, because “dark” matter is not only a misnomer (it isn’t actually dark), but it also reinforces the idea that “light” (i.e., white) is the default and “dark” (i.e., black) is something strange.Prescod-Weinstein also works to undermine the Great Man presentation of history. A lot of science books fall into the trap of treating scientific discoveries as a linear story of great men (and, sometimes, a couple of women) having eureka moments and building on what came before. While Prescod-Weinstein certainly names names, she is more interested in establishing an over-arching understanding of what we knew, collectively, at the time of a discovery, making connections between things like Minkowski’s block time and Einstein’s relativity. She is not the only person to strive to do this in her presentation of the history of physics, of course, but it’s great to see how she chooses to focus on certain aspects of the story. As a specialist in both cosmology and dark matter, of course, she especially illuminates us on what we know (and don’t know) about the earliest days of the universe, along with what we know (and don’t know) about what makes up the bulk of our universe.These first few chapters are edifying (and essential—I’ll come back to that); however, it’s really the later chapters of The Disordered Cosmos that truly make it shine. The book shifts in part-memoir, part-polemic as Prescod-Weinstein gets very personal and very political, and I love it. She tackles racism, misogynoir, sexual assault, and more. She calls out astronomers and other scientists for their complicity in ongoing colonialism in Hawaiʻi.In doing all of this, Prescod-Weinstein pulls back the curtain on “science” itself. Those of us who are not scientists or not directly involved in the business of science often forget that this knowledge is ultimately produced, held, and transmitted by humans. So science can be biased because humans are, ourselves, biased. When we read a science book, whether a popular science book or a formal textbook, we’re reading the story of science as filtered through one or a small number of humans’ perspectives. Add in the fact that, historically, most of those humans have been straight, cis, white men, and you start to see why the picture of our universe that we have used science to assemble in these past centuries might be rather incomplete.It is tempting to lament, then, about the loss to science that has occurred because we have failed to cultivate more women, more scientists of colour, more trans scientists. Yet Prescod-Weinstein cautions us against this line of thinking, and this is where The Disordered Cosmos truly feels breathtaking in its radical stance. You see, it is one thing for marginalized scientists to point out the lack of representation in the academic systems that drive scientific inquiry. But the solution can’t just be “fix the leaky pipeline, and let the science continue.” Science itself is the problem. That might feel hard to accept for those of us who have grown up viewing science as neutral, like I was just discussing.This is why the first chapters, the ones that cover scientific knowledge, are essential to this book, why The Disordered Cosmos is not simply a memoir of Prescod-Weinstein’s journey through academic and particle physics as a Jewish, queer, agender Black woman. In those first chapters, she models for us how she thinks our story of science could be told. We have to find the human connection within physics and with the greater universe. I know that sounds backwards given the great lengths physicists have gone to over the decades to paint physics as the ultimate, untouchable, most objective of all the disciplines. But that’s how you get atomic bombs and telescopes on sacred mountains. That’s how you justify medical experiments on Black people. When science becomes only about seeking knowledge, at any cost, it becomes the problem. Prescod-Weinstein’s solution isn’t just to improve representation in science; it is to have us question, dismantle, and rebuild the very structure of our scientific disciplines.I’m in.Anyway, this is one of the best non-fiction books I have read this year. Combined with Bitch, I’ve now read two kick-ass books about science (and issues with science) by two amazing women scientists. If you’re looking to shift your worldview and get more radical, both of these books are for you.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I’m glad I went with my gut and read both books in close succession. Had I waited, I’m not sure I would have enjoyed Steelstriker as much as I did—and as you read this , you will see that I still liked it less than Skyhunter. My chief critique from that  is repeated here: this series is fine, and that’s about it. There is precious little happening here in terms of storytelling risks or fantastic characterization. So while the writing is competent and even entertaining, it still leaves me fairly cold.Spoilers for Skyhunter but not this book.This book picks up about six months after the fall of Mara. Talin has been transformed into a skyhunter, much like Red, except she has actually been bonded telepathically with Premier Constantine. He can hear her thoughts, feel her emotions—so Talin does her best not to reach out through her bond with Red to see where he and the last few Maran striker rebels are hiding. Meanwhile, Talin must protect Constantine on pain of her mother’s life being forfeit. But she chafes under this yoke and does her best to undermine him at every turn. The only question is: will it be enough?It’s a good premise. The threats are real. I like how Lu explores the unsettled nature of conquered nations, how rebellion is always a real threat and the Federation is not quite as seamless and assimilated as it might appear. Similarly, the way Talin meets the rebels—and who they are—makes a lot of sense to me. All in all, the plot is solid and works.In fact, before I get into my critique, let me give a big round of applause for the ending. I really like most of Lu’s choices, from Talin’s ultimate fate to the way they handle Constantine. I was a little critical of how the first book ended on close to a cliffhanger, but this is a notable example of a duology that truly lives up to that title—again, I made the right decision to borrow them both from the library and read them close together.I also like how Lu portrays Talin’s struggle with being forced into being a collaborator. I think the book walks a fine line, trying to keep Talin likable as a protagonist while still showing the horror of her being coerced into doing Constantine’s bloody bidding.So why the lower rating? A couple of issues.The book alternates between Talin and Red’s perspectives this time. That in and of itself is not bad. But it feels like there is a lot of back-and-forth. The romance between the two of them gets hot and heavy, especially towards the end as the plot ramps up and they have to fight for their lives. But the nature of the plot also means we never actually get to see them talk about anything outside of the immediate threat/rebellion. They don’t spend time together just getting to know one another, bonding, joking, etc. This was present in Skyhunter and was one of the more pleasant elements of the book. This book, being bleaker in its circumstances, lacks that. Lu tries to make up for it with some good bonding between Red and Adena and Jeran, but it isn’t the same.The rebellion leaders who find Talin are also somewhat two-dimensional. I say two rather than one because there is some depth and nuance happening. But it reminds me a lot of The Hunger Games, which I guess would be a good thing for some readers. These characters feel very cookiecutter, with not a lot going on beyond their purpose for the plot.Finally, the whole subplot involving what is supposed to be nuclear reactors/weapons is … confused. At one point, it seems like a reactor is detonated in the capital, and everyone outside of the immediate blast radius is fine even after, chapters earlier, it was established that yes, radiation damage is a thing. It’s clever and all for Lu to have her bad guy dig up atomic technology from the Early Ones, and for the most part, I like how she goes about describing it; it reminds me of the difficulty we are having figuring out how to warn far-future generations of the dangers of our nuclear waste disposal sites. But when your character is close enough to see the Cherenkov radiation before blowing up the reactor … is that survivable? I don’t think so.I guess what I’m saying is that Steelstriker lacks a certain level of complexity that I was hoping for given the world and plot Lu has constructed here. Again, I don’t want to be too harsh on it, because as a novel it works, and it actually delivers the one-two punch that a good duology should. For me, personally, however, I wish it could have done a lot more.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Harrow previously, but the title, description, and cover sold me on The Once and Future Witches. And, given the climate of hostility towards women and people of marginalized genders in the United States in 2022, this book set in 1893 feels oddly, uncomfortably familiar.Taking place from the spring equinox to summer solstice, roughly, of 1893, The Once and Future Witches is set in a slightly alternative version of the United States. Salem, Massachusetts was razed by a witch-hunter who is now regarded as a hero. Near its ruins rose New Salem, and for a couple of centuries, women have kept their magic minimal, hidden, for fear of persecution and death. Against this backdrop, the three Eastwood sisters find themselves unexpectedly reunited (and recriminations will abound, don’t you fret) in New Salem on the equinox, where they witness a vision of a tower that could, if located, help them bring witchery back into the world. So they form a radical organization, even more radical than the suffragists that attract Juniper Eastwood to the city, a sisterhood that will stop at nothing short of liberating women from the patriarchy’s fear of witchcraft. Or, you know, they might themselves be jailed and executed. Such is the danger of revolution.I’m getting the sense, looking at Harrow’s other published novels that have now swiftly been added to my to-read list, that Harrow is very interested in telling stories about storytelling, and I am here for it. Chapters of this book occasionally end with a story—always a fairy tale, always familiar yet somewhat different from how you might have heard it. Harrow tries to draw from a variety of folklore, not strictly European. She emphasizes that women’s magic is from every culture and does her best to confront the whiteness and racism that was present in the suffragist and other women’s liberation movements of the late nineteenth century.Indeed, this book is also queer. One of the main characters, Beatrice Belladonna, is lesbian. I was pleasantly surprised when at one point one of the minor characters is revealed to be a trans woman (with some clever foreshadowing prior) so that Harrow can make the point that women’s magic is not gender essentialist. (There is also men’s magic, and it’s implied that the division between these two disciplines is itself arbitrary rather than fixed, but I won’t get into that too much for fear of spoilers.)The way that the Sisters of Avalon prove to be more radical than the suffragists and align themselves with a labour movement also speaks to my unionist heart. I really like how Harrow uses this book as a platform for emphasizing that we are not free until all of us are free, that the struggle for liberation must be an intersectional one. This is probably most apparent in the interactions between Beatrice and Cleo. I love how, in presenting us with the Daughters of Tituba, Harrow reminds us that even as white women have viewed themselves as saviours of Black people, Black women have done a fine job of liberating and protecting themselves.And that’s really why I loved this book so much. It mixes my love for story with my passionate beliefs regarding freedom and liberation. And it stokes those beliefs, reassures me. This book does not end where I expected it to. In fact, the initial mystery gets solved early on—only for it to be a brief calm before the larger storm as there is an intense backlash against the emergent witches of New Salem. I really enjoyed how Harrow handled this pacing and plotting, presenting us with a larger conflict and a reminder that progress is neither linear nor inevitable.Perhaps the most obvious weakness to this book, in my opinion, is the villain. First, his identity is rather easily guessed long before it is revealed. Second, he is almost a caricature of the evils of patriarchy. Although I appreciate the way Harrow ultimately paints him as a frightened little boy, I think that embodying the antagonist in a single figurehead like this does a disservice to the fact that patriarchy is a structural issue. Even if this one person is vanquished, there is still so much work to do before women can approach equality or witches are accepted. To be fair, the book acknowledges that in its coda. Nevertheless, I just felt like the machinations of the villain and the confrontations the sisters have with him are the least interesting and fulfilling parts of this book.In contrast, I loved the complicated relationships among the Eastwood sisters. As the book begins, they are estranged. Each one blames the other (or others) for letting her go, betraying her in some way. There is a lot of distrust and hard feelings. Harrow captures the damage that betrayal—real or perceived—can wreak on the relationship among sisters, as well as the long road one must walk to repair it. As with the social progress depicted in this book, the progress of repairing these relationships is far from linear. Yet in both cases, Harrow’s message remains one of an abiding, persistent hope.The Once and Future Witches is a novel set in the past yet speaking to our future of possibility. Women are, to quote amanda lovelace, “some kind of magic,” and all of us have power even when society does its best to make us feel like we do not. But we have to come together to wield that power in solidarity. We have to believe we can make a difference, collectively, rather than shrinking ourselves so that we can merely survive within the system that seeks to harm us. This is something I truly believe, and in this novel, I encountered a sublime telling of that story in a way that inspires, empowers, and awes.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

That being said, I have no problem with DNFing a book if it isn’t right for me.Hooked is a reimagining of the Peter Pan mythos. It is, apparently, a loose sequel to A.C. Wise’s earlier novel, Wendy, Darling (I haven’t rea dit). I love the premise behind these two novels. Retellings remain all the rage, with good reason, but the challenge is to twist the source material in such a way as to find new themes and entertaining layers to it. The idea that Captain Hook was the victim of some kind of fae spirit masquerading as a boy is really cool, and perhaps this book will work better for others, as many of the more positive s it has attracted so far seem to attest.Why didn’t it work for me? Pacing was a big one. And the style of writing overall.I am only about ten percent into the novel, which I admit isn’t that much. Normally I give a book a little longer to grab me—but something is telling me that Hooked won’t do that, and I want to listen to my gut. Very little has happened so far. The chapters are long and meandering. Wise flits in and out of flashbacks, taking us from present-day London, 1939, to James’s time as Hook in Neverland. The exposition this provides allows me to understand what’s happening, yet I don’t feel it, if that makes any sense.Stylistically, then, Wise and I seem to be working at cross purposes. These days I much prefer novels with shorter, concrete scenes, and a good mix of dialogue and narration. Though Wise is fond of in media res storytelling, the action we get dropped into doesn’t seem to culminate in anything that then furthers the plot, so far as I can see.Consequently, what I have read of the novel so far feels very jumbled to me. We have James, haunted by the ghost of someone I think was a former lover? Wendy, all growed up, off to help her daughter, who just witnessed a murder most foul. Pan and his monster are lurking somewhere. Like I said—this is a really intriguing premise, and I wish I could have enjoyed the writing enough to keep going. As it is, I will pass on this one.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I had gifted her Come As You AreI received this book nearly a year ago (maybe a whole year ago) from my friend and former teaching colleague Emma. I had gifted her Come As You Are, Dr. Emily Nagoski’s earlier book about sex. Burnout is, as the title implies, about the sustained sensation many of us feel when we have overextended ourselves and depleted our resources. As the subtitle implies, this book promises to deepen our understanding of burnout. It is a self-help book, but only in the most scientific and compassionate sense of that genre—the Nagoski twins make no promises of “curing” your burnout, and they evince a healthy skepticism of the self-care industry. Instead, this is a book about recognizing and understanding where you are in your stress cycle and how you can manage that stress in a healthier way. It won’t fix your problems, but it might make life a little easier to bear.This was an emotional read. Page xi of the introduction states, “Twenty to thirty percent of teachers in America have moderately high to high levels of burnout.” I nearly broke down crying when I read that, and we weren’t even into the book itself! I am a teacher in Canada, and you can read a little rant about my burnout here. Suffice it to say … yeah, this book is meant for me.Now, I already knew a lot of what the Nagoskis share in this book. I think that will be true for most of us who live with burnout. Some of the advice is very obvious, like the value of physical activity (though I am pleased how they emphasize that physical activity includes more than exercise!). I like this. I also appreciated how they frame everything in terms of “completing the stress cycle.” They distinguish between dealing with the cause of stress and dealing with the stress itself, acknowledging that the former action can be difficult but sometimes when we deal with the cause, we forget to deal with the stress that was caused.There might be a few good revelations in here, but the value of this book isn’t in revelations; it’s in relevance. Emily and Amelia ground their recommendations in science, examining how hormones, neurotransmitters, and other physiological markers of stress response influence our emotions (and vice versa). Similarly, they connect their ideas to exemplars drawn from their experiences with real people. They engage with structural issues of racism and sexism, acknowledging that a great deal of our stress comes from harm baked into the system rather than our own individual choices.Indeed, Burnout’s attention to structural causes of stress is so important and another way it stands out from much self-help literature. The Nagoskis explicitly call out patriarchy as a reason so many women experience burnout. Through their explanation of “Human Giver syndrome,” they explore scenarios that many women will find all too familiar thanks to the ways in which our society encourage us to give, give, give. Certainly I could identify with this.I found their reminder that we can “smash the patriarchy” in small ways very valuable and important. There is so much happening in the world right now, so much hatred, and it can feel discouraging. How can I stand against this, especially when I’m burnt out? They provide some practical tips, which boils down to do something rather than wallowing in the idea that we are powerless.This book focuses a great deal on women, and in particular cis women. Regardless, I think that people of all genders can appreciate most of this book—it’s just that the Nagoskis point out that certain manifestations of burnout (such as Human Giver Syndrome) tend to be more prevalent in women. In their introduction, they include a disclaimer that is meant to be trans-inclusive, boiling down basically to the idea that because the research has only been done on cis women, they can’t reliably discuss or draw conclusions about a more gender-expansive definition of people:In this book, when we use the word “woman,” we mostly mean “people who identify as women,” but it’s important to remember when we describe the science, we’re limited to the women who were identified at birth and raised as women, because that’s mostly who has been studied. (Sorry.)So. We try to be as science-based as we can be, but we’re aware of its limits.It’s a nice apology, and I truly believe the Nagoskis are allies to trans and gender-diverse people.But it’s also not good enough.Cis authors, you cannot keep throwing your hands up in the air and saying, “But science doesn’t see trans people!” This just perpetuates a cycle of erasure. In the case of Burnout, the next paragraphs attempt to assert that where science doesn’t suffice, “art comes in,” yet that promise is not actually borne out in the book. This reinforces the dichotomy that Western, peer-ed science is the ultimate arbiter of truth. While the Nagoskis claim they will “talk about Disney princesses, sci-fi dystopias, pop music” and more, these references are fleeting and seldom accorded the same weight as the science. More importantly, after taking the time to acknowledge the existence of gender diversity, trans people are not mentioned at all for the rest of the book. Even if there is a dearth of research on us, you could at least have gone around and interviewed some of us and done a chapter—hell, I would take a section—about how burnout affects trans people in particular.Don’t get me wrong: as I stated earlier in my , I love the emphasis that Burnout places on science. At the same time, I have committed myself to doing better at noticing the erasure of trans people and calling it out, because that’s the only way we are going to do better. (If you want an example of a science book I recently read by a cis author who actually includes trans people, check out Bitch by Lucy Cooke!)Aside from that caveat, I greatly enjoyed (if that’s the right word) this book. Emily and Amelia’s writing style is pithy and amiable despite talking about serious topics. The strategies they suggest, while not new, are a good reminder of what I can be doing to help myself reset and recharge this summer. I am burned out, and Burnout does not offer a panacea—but it does offer explanations, guidance, and hope.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Turns out I diThere is a reason I write book s: I thought I hadn’t enjoyed Warcross, the first and only other book I have read by Marie Lu. Turns out I did like it! Skyhunter is a different genre, but a lot of the same tropes are present: you have male/female romantic leads paired up to fight against an authoritarian ruler. I definitely didn’t like this one as much as Warcross, and I debated reading the sequel (which I just finished today, as I write this ). Ultimately, I think this is a good young adult or new adult novel about dystopia and rebellion, but it’s a so-so novel overall.Talin is a refugee from Basea. When the Karensa Federation swallowed up her country, she and her mother fled to nearby Mara. Mute, Talin eventually finds a precarious position among the Strikers, Mara’s elite fighting force, who also communicate via sign language. Though Talin has earned renown for her fighting prowess, she is always an outsider because of her nationality. When her Shield is killed, her status is in jeopardy—until she ends up becoming crucial to managing a prisoner of war who might be the key to protecting Mara from the Karensa Federation’s army.The setting is decent. There are suitable vague references to Early Ones (forerunners) with enough hints dropped that maybe this is a post-apocalyptic part of Earth, though it could just as easily be an alternative world where the forerunners developed parallel to our society. In any event, this continent is dotted with ruins of fantastic technology and materials that contemporary humans have scavenged. Mara is the only country that hasn’t fallen to the Karensa Federation, which makes use of Early One science to transform its captured enemies into fearsome beasts—Ghosts—that are controlled only by the Premier of the Federation. Strikers are adept at killing Ghosts before they can bite someone—if they fail, the victim is doomed to transform into a Ghost unless someone delivers a mercy blow.The spectre of transformation and body horror looms large over this book—not in an unpalatable way, but it’s clear that Lu is thinking about the ways in which our modern society polices our bodies. The mental link between the Ghosts and the Premier, and the similar link shared by Talin and Red, demonstrates different sides of a coin: mind control versus a kind of enhanced empathy (some would call it telepathy). The science in Skyhunter is cold, grey, and hard—it is a science of steel.For Lu, this is a story about allegiance. Talin is Basean, yet her allegiance is staunchly Maran. She fights for an adopted country that nevertheless discriminates against her—a familiar story for many marginalized groups that nevertheless choose to serve in Western militaries. Red was Karensan, yet he has defected. The tenuousness of his allegiance is one of the critical plot points of the book, along with the question of how much someone has to prove themselves before we accept that they are loyal. Going deeper still, we see personal allegiances: Adena and Jeran, and Jeran and Aramin, and of course, Talin and her mother. We even see unhealthy allegiances, such as the fealty Jeran feels he owes his abusive father.All of this boils down to a cauldron of conflict that should be very fulfilling. And at some points, it is. Talin gets a lot of character development, and the supporting cast gets their fair share. I think what bothers me is that the climax of the book feels somewhat contrived—particularly, a betrayal just gets revealed out of nowhere, pure exposition, with very little foreshadowing. I think it’s supposed to come across as a big twist—but it’s just so logical, so cynical and pragmatic on the part of the traitor, that it hardly feels surprising.So despite the setting, the interesting use of science and atrocities this leads to, and some good characterization, Skyhunter doesn’t do anything particularly new for me. I think for younger readers who haven’t yet steeped themselves so thoroughly in dystopia, this book is going to be a much more interesting read. For me, it was fine. (Also keep in mind that I am, unfortunately, writing this from the hindsight of having just finished the sequel, which I think has coloured this  a little bit. But you’ll read more about that soon.)Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Finally got around to reading it!This might be one of those books where I have had it on my to-read list almost since it came out … eleven years ago. Finally got around to reading it! Beauty Queens is a rollicking young-adult satire of reality television, beauty pageantry, and the corporate hostile takeover of feminism. Libba Bray brings a lot of humour and sweetness to these pages. I enjoyed it. Yet I also think it has a lot of limitations, some due to its age, most due to its construction.The fifty contestants for Miss Team Dream crash land on a deserted island (or is it?). At first, the challenge seems to be surviving long enough to be rescued—although if some Teen Dreamers have their way, they will also somehow practise for the pageant at the same time. As the days pass with no rescue, however, strange events reveal that maybe these girls aren’t alone on this island. They’ll need more than the skills they profess for the talent part of the competition to survive, escape, and reveal the Corporation’s treachery to the world.Reading this book a decade after its publication leaves me reflecting on how much the world has changed since Bray wrote at the start of the 2010s. Beauty Queens is ultimately very much a rah-rah book of female empowerment (and I mean this in a good way). It explicitly calls out and questions harmful beauty standards and ideas of feminine comportment that are baked into beauty pageantry. Many of the girls in this book are, at the beginning of the story, what we might describe as “shallow.” Thanks to a couple slightly more aware contestants, along with the pressures to survive on this island, the girls gradually come to understand the value of independence and the toxicity of what Miss Teen Dream represents.I respect, however, that Bray also takes the time to reassure us that femininity and the modern tools associated with it are not, per se, bad. In this way the book harnesses the political brashness of second-wave feminism while also retaining much more of the intersectionality and post-modernism of third-wave feminism. Bray’s feminism is also trans-inclusive (more on that in a moment) and anti-capitalist. Though the nominal enemy of this book is the Corporation, the arguable leader of this antagonistic force is actually another women. In this way, Bray reminds us that “leaning in” is not the answer: women can reinforce patriarchy as much as other genders, especially if they think it serves their own purposes.Still, this book definitely feels a decade old. It predates the rising awareness among white moderates and progressives of the vicious modern racism and police brutality that exists within the United States (and here in Canada)—from Trayvon Martin to Michael Brown to George Floyd and the too-many names in between that marked the 2010s as a time of increased visibility of violence against Black people. Beauty Queens certainly engages in a discussion of racism and intersectional feminism, such as it can, but it feels out of place against the backdrop of the last decade.This holds true for Bray’s portrayal of a transgender character as well. Indeed, Bray goes out of her way to make sure the cast is as diverse as possible, including a Deaf girl, Black and brown girls, a lesbian girl, etc. I really appreciate this. I’m going to focus my critique on Petra, as I am also trans, whereas it is harder for me to discuss how the others’ identities are portrayed. I’ve really mulled over how I feel about Petra. On the one hand, it was just nice to be included in an overwhelmingly positive way in a book from 2011. On the other hand, there is a clumsiness to how Bray writes Petra. It makes me wonder if this book had a sensitivity reader all the way back then.To summarize my thoughts: I appreciate how Bray presents different reactions when the other girls find out that Petra is trans. Forcibly outing her is not cool, of course, though I understand how one can argue it would be quite realistic in this setting. I don’t have a problem with how some of the girls react in transphobic ways; they learned it as a part of their upbringing, and this book is all about unlearning harmful, internalized bullshit. Indeed, Bray just wants to show us that there is no One True Girl, and trans acceptance is a part of that.But then we have a scene where Petra pees on a guy’s leg to clean out a jellyfish sting (which, by the way, is a myth)—because she has a penis and can pee standing up, get it? It’s just a very weird scene overall. Beyond that, the portrayal of Petra’s transition is very 2011 in its focus on medical transition—she’s hoping to win the contest so she can afford gender confirmation surgery—and very little discussion of the social reality of being transfeminine. This is a bit hard to read in a year where conservative media has become ever bolder in focusing on transmedicalism as a way to Other trans people. That’s not Bray’s fault, of course. Nevertheless, I think Petra’s portrayal (along with some other clunkiness in the portrayals of the characters of colour) highlights how a well-meaning author trying to do diversity can come up short.In a similar way, I wish I could have been more entertained by the satire. It’s just layered on so thick. I understand that YA sometimes needs to be brasher because of the age of its audience. But the result is oddly jarring. There are inane uses of PowerPoint, half-hearted antagonist characters, and a madman dictator who feels like he would be played by Sacha Baron Cohen in a way that has you going, “Umm, this is kinda racist, isn’t it?” The cohesiveness of the plot in the final act feels more like a stage play than a novel, with loose ends getting too neatly tied up. The satire verges more on farce, which I think undermines its teeth.All of this being said, please don’t get the impression I’m criticizing this book simply for being a decade old now. But I think it is important to consider how we react to a book in the present of our reading it, and my reaction to Beauty Queens is, “This is a hot mess, and I love parts of it, but so much of it doesn’t gel.” Would I have liked it more ten years ago? Probably, in the same way that subsequent rewatches of comedies from ten years ago have left me cold, and the same way that ten years ago I was far, far fonder of The Hunger Games than I am now. We move on, and as we grow, the media of our past doesn’t always grow with us.This is a good and entertaining book, especially for teenage girls. But it’s also messy and flawed. You know what was also really flawed? Lord of the Flies, yet it still gets taught in high schools like it’s the real shit. I can say with confidence that Beauty Queens is, if it is anything, far superior to that “classic” in every possible measure. So make of that what you will.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

The Paradox Hotel is another such blend of mysterEvery once in a while, I dip my toes into a science-fiction thriller, like I did with Constance. The Paradox Hotel is another such blend of mystery, science fiction, and tension, but this time instead of human cloning, we get time travel! The question at the heart of Rob Hart’s story is actually asked by an artificially intelligent drone: why do humans deal with pain by lashing out at others?January Cole is the head of security for a hotel next to the world’s only functional timeport. The U.S. government has, of course, turned this into a tourist business catering to those rich enough to travel through time. Nevertheless, the business isn’t profitable, so it is being privatized. January is preparing for an auction that will see some of the richest people in the world arrive to bid for the timeport—and the attached hotel—but as she does this, other events threaten the security of the auction, the hotel, and January’s job. See, January is Unstuck—her years of serving as a Temporal Enforcement Agent have left her with the ability (or disability) to experience moments from her past or future as if they are the present. You would think this would be a cool power, but it’s slowly killing her, and if anyone learns how much her condition has progressed, she would be removed from her position faster than you can say “Einstein–Rosen bridge.”January in many ways embodies the typical, sardonic hero we tend to see in these kinds of thrillers. She carries a heavy burden of grief—in this case, a lost love—and guilt—not being able to save said love. She’s dealing with a chronic illness—or not dealing, depending on whom you talk to. She’s gruff and no-nonsense but always willing to crack a joke if it will deflect from anything getting too real. We learn precious little about January’s past or her interests outside of doing her current job.Nevertheless, Hart somehow helps us connect to January and relate to her struggles. I think it’s because, deep down, she really does care about this hotel and what happens to the people in it. We see this in her (strained) relationships with other employees, such as her boss, Allyn; the hotel manager, Rob; or the non-binary head concierge, Cameo. January bridles when people with power mistreat those who lack it, and she refuses to step down when she thinks she is in the right. These qualities help establish her as a sympathetic protagonist even when she isn’t always being a likable one.For a novel about time travel and paradoxes, the actual time travel shenanigans here are fairly light. Indeed, aside from January’s premonition-like ability, you could get through the first two thirds of this novel before getting any kind of headache from time travel. It’s only during the climax, after January unravels how her unseen enemy has been manipulating events, that the time travel angle truly comes into focus and threatens to bemuse rather than amuse.Indeed, if you were hoping for more than only a surface-level explanation of how a time travel tourist agency would work, you will be disappointed. There are some interesting tidbits (such as how the hotel keeps a period costumer on staff, but there is a strict no-Blackface policy—good). However, I think this is probably for the best. This is not a mystery about time travel tourism. Rather, the mystery here is about much more familiar topics: greed, lust for power, betrayal, and the desire for dignity.I don’t know that I would say I loved this book, but I think a good measure of how much I enjoyed any book is how much I wanted to keep reading. While I wouldn’t say this was “unputdownable,” and perhaps much of my reading was motivated by the nice weather that let me sit on my deck for an extended period of time for the first time this season, The Paradox Hotel definitely held my interest. Fans of thrillers might enjoy this even more.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Having finished the Gale Women series (though that didn’t stop me from accidentally buying another copy of The Future Falls by mistake, oops), I was happy to discover several books in two different series from Huff. I decided to start her Keeper Chronicles first with Summon the Keeper. It was a great change of pace from some of the other books I have read lately. Tanya Huff’s storytelling is that comfy kind of familiar where you always feel like you’re coming home.Claire Hansen is a Keeper, which is an efficient way of saying she is a member of a supernatural lineage dedicated to preserving the fabric of the universe. She does this by sealing sites where the fabric of the universe has worn thin, sometimes as a result of people unwittingly using what we might call magic but what Claire calls “the possibilities.” Summon the Keeper sees Claire arrive at the Elysian Fields Guesthouse in Kingston, Ontario. Previously under the supervision of a Cousin—a less powerful ally to the Keepers—he scampers off Claire arrives, leaving her in charge of this dilapidated hotel. She has a talking cat, Austin, by her side, and quickly charms the hotel’s one employee, Dean, a handyman/chef/all around hunk. There’s an evil, sleeping Keeper in room six and a literal hole to Hell in the furnace room, and Claire is determined to seal this site and get out of Kingston no matter what.Most of the fantasy novels I picked up from the used bookstore are what I would call “classic” fantasy from the 1980s and 1990s. Summon the Keeper, published 1998, is no exception. There’s something really quaint about reading a book that is now twenty-four years old—I love the references, now so outdated, to things like computer towers with CD-ROM drives. The fact that Huff sets her stories so often in Canada also makes me smile!Huff is a master at writing compelling and intense scenes whether they are action-focused or feelings-focused. Claire is a great protagonist: she is capable and confident in her abilities, yet she also has plenty of flaws. Sometimes we might describe her as overconfident, though in a different way from her younger sister. I like that, at twenty-seven, she is older than a lot of female protagonists that we get in urban fantasy, yet she is still young enough to be plenty inexperienced, both at her job and her life.Though the love triangle between Claire, Dean, and Jacques does very little for me, I appreciate what Huff is trying to accomplish. Claire’s reluctance to deal with the tension between her and Dean drives, directly or indirectly, quite a lot of the conflict in this book. Though Hell, personified by an ALL CAPS split personality that comments sarcastically on events throughout the book, is the nominal antagonist, one might also argue that Claire is her own worst enemy. She spends so much time trying to “solve” the problem of the Elysian that she keeps stirring up trouble. My main reaction, as I was reading, was “Man, Huff is never giving Claire a break,” but this is usually the result of Claire’s own actions.In this way, Summon the Keeper, despite being a slimmer novel, is packed full of entertaining action and intense drama. I was genuinely enthralled by the plot, curious to find out how Claire would resolve the problem of the evil Keeper and seal up the hole to Hell. The ending is fine—a little rushed, a little too cinematic for my aphantasic brain to process—but I am looking forward to reading the sequel, and likely soon, given that I acquired it at the used bookstore too!Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Consequently, most of the medicines that make it to market have only truly been tested on men. Then there are inevitably—you guessed it—complications in some women who take these drugs, except doctors are just as likely to blame the issue on—you guessed it—hormones. Or it’s all in our head.Gosh, sexism sucks.Lucy Cooke examines exactly this kind of bias in science and medicine, but she does so with a particular eye on evolutionary biology. Bitch: On the Female of the Species is a tour through some of the weirder corners of the animal kingdom and species that defy our stereotypical understanding of the differences between the “two” sexes. It is also a polemic against bias in evolutionary biology and science as a whole, a bias against studying the female sex, which has resulted in gaps in vital knowledge. Cooke rightly points out that when we allow our human biases to influence our methodology, we short-circuit the scientific method—and all of humanity loses out.Thank you to NetGalley and publisher Basic Books for the  eARC!I read a lot of popular science books, and often—especially when written by a scientist—they can be ponderous and dull, at least in parts. Not so with Bitch, which is a riotous romp from the beginning. The first chapter, “The Anarchy of Sex,” lists off examples of ways in which females of various species break our idea of sex stereotypes and the binary. In particular, I found myself picking my jaw up off the floor as I read about the female spotted hyena’s testerone levels and her eight-inch clitoris and fused-together labia! By the time I got to the third chapter, “The Monogamy Myth,” I was calling my friend to read her a passage about the libidinous activities of female Barbary macaques—“once every seventeen minutes”??—and laugh in astonishment—the things they don’t teach you in high-school biology, hmm?Where does this so-called wisdom come from anyway? That’s another question Cooke sets out to answer. She not only debunks sex myths but actively draws a line through research, from the writings of Darwin all the way up to the modern day—1990s and early 2000s—when some female scientists were still having their papers turned away from journals for being too “political.” This is, of course, the cardinal sin of the dominant group: conflating one’s own perspective (in this case, that of the cis, white, male scientist) with objectivity and neutrality. When a scientist announces findings that confirm our biases about males being stronger, more active, more promiscuous, then the world rejoices. When a scientist announces findings that confirm the same facts for females, then it’s “political” because it goes against the received wisdom. This confirmation bias, along with measurement, selection, and sampling biases, results in a lot of holes in our science. Cooke stresses the importance of reproducibility of results and long-term studies that, instead of anthropomorphizing the subjects or looking for certain expected traits, observe what the subjects do and record those observations without leaning on established stereotypes. If we look at a female animal and expect to see maternal behaviour, we will likely find it, and discount any behaviour that might not contribute to that narrative. Instead, we should just look at the behaviour, record it, and then we can sift through the data to see what we have found.Bitch and books like it are important for laypeople to read because we are taught, growing up, that science is objective, impartial, unassailable. This is the hill that transphobic people are often willing to die on. Whether it’s the inclusion of trans women in sport or the very existence of trans people, transphobes (TERFs or GCs or whatever they want to be called these days) are quick to cry “but biology!” as if this is the ultimate argument against my existence when I am … you know … here. Existing. Lol.When we make this mistake, when we assume that just because something is written in a book, published in a peer-ed study, repeated at conferences and in sound bites on the news, that it is the unassailable truth, we do ourselves a disservice as critical thinkers. This is particularly the case when the narrative being presented is simplistic and binary. As Cooke works so hard to elucidate here, nature is seldom either of those things—so when someone announces that it is so, we should be skeptical. Note that this is different from science deniers, who also profess skepticism—for theirs is, similar to the scientists whose bias is taken apart in this book, a form of confirmation bias rooted in conspiracy theories that ultimately advocate the abandonment of the scientific method. Cooke is not doing that here. She is not saying we need to throw out the baby with the bathwater—but it is probably time to change out that bathwater, and maybe get a bigger tub. The baby might be all grown up now.Incidentally, as a trans woman, I certainly went into this book with a small amount of trepidation. Any scientific book that discusses the sexes can be, even inadvertently, trans-exclusionary. So I was reassured when, even before the introduction, Cooke includes an “Author’s Note on Language” that asserts, “This book intends to demonstrate that sex is wildly variable and that gendered ideas based on assumptions of binary sex are nonsense.” Fuck yeah. As I already commented above, the first chapter then being about “The Anarchy of Sex” cemented my sense that I was going to be safe reading this book. If that were not enough, Chapter 11 is called “Beyond the Binary” and features the work of trans ecologist Dr. Joan Roughgarden! This is important—there is also a common trend among people who want to be allies to shrug and say, “Hey, trans women are women and valid and whatnot, but eh, the data is just for cis men and women. So we know you exist, we know non-binary people are out there, but for our purposes we’ll just have to ignore you for the next two-hundred pages. So sorry.” That’s not acceptable. Trans people are here. We are in the fields being spoken about. So Cooke not only professes her allyship but actively includes trans people in her writing and actively makes sure that her approach to analysis is trans-inclusive rather than agnostic. That is true allyship. (I’m applauding right now.)Ultimately, Bitch is, as the introduction says, about “a sexist mythology [that] has been baked into biology” and how “it distorts the way we perceive female animals.” Cooke comes with proof to back up this thesis, and most importantly (from my perspective as a curious reader), she presents this proof in an engaging, often hilarious way. Honestly, this book was the next best thing to watching a nature documentary, and probably slightly more informative given that it isn’t limited by time slots. It is worth your time and energy: not only will it entertain, but it is going to help you on your way to breaking down the gender and sex binary we are immersed in, along with the stereotypes that, for too long, too many people have propped up with faulty science.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Add in the allure of an alternative world in whichAlthough I read fewer murder mysteries these days than I did in my youth, I still have a soft spot. Add in the allure of an alternative world in which Europeans never colonized what we call North America, and … yeah, I’m into it. The Peacekeeper is both a satisfying mystery and a thoughtful work of science fiction, and as such, it works for me on multiple levels.The novel takes place in and around what we would call Sault Ste. Marie but what the Anishinaabeg call Baawitigong. (Blanchard is a member of the Sault Chippewa nation.) For those unfamiliar with it, Sault Ste. Marie is actually two cities—one on the Canadian side of the border, in Ontario, and one on the American side, in Michigan. (This is actually more common than you might expect, though they don’t always have the same name.) In The Peacekeeper, of course, it’s one place because there is no border. Baawitigong itself is a village, small enough for everyone to know everyone (and their business). Chibenashi is one of the village’s three peacekeepers. On the night of Manoomin, a festival celebrating harvest, someone murders a close friend of Chibenashi’s—twenty years to the day that someone murdered his mother. Chibenashi leave behind his fragile sister, Ashwiyaa, to seek answers in the nearby metropolis of Shikaakwa. Not only is he unused to the big city, however, but he is unprepared to confront ghosts from his past—an ex-girlfriend turned Advocate, and the estranged son of the murder victim. This case might prove Chibenashi’s undoing.I love how Blanchard goes about creating a flawed protagonist in Chibenashi. He is not your stereotypical hard-boiled detective with an ex-wife and a chip on his shoulder and a drinking problem. He doesn’t drink. He doesn’t do much of anything, really, except his job (which is not exactly demanding) and trying to take care of his sister. This latter duty has kept him from expanding his social circle or setting his sights on a life elsewhere, like Shikaakwa. Yet the murder of a close friend, someone who was like an Auntie to him and Ashwiyaa, forces Chibenashi to leave Baawitigong. In an unfamiliar milieu and confronted by a peacekeeper from Shikaakwa who gets on his nerves, Chibenashi’s patience is tested. Is it any surprise when he breaks? I appreciate that our protagonist is flawed—I would say he teeters on the point of being unlikeable, yet for me he never quite crosses that line. Rather, he’s just never really processed his trauma. Now that this crime has stripped away the time that has passed since that trauma occurred, he has no defences left to keep his demons at bay.The mystery itself is pretty good. I guessed who the killer was pretty early in the book (I mention this only because this is rare for me). Nevertheless, Blanchard handles the reveal and climax quite well. This is a case of a whodunit where I solved it because the clues were laid out plain to see—indeed, if Chibenashi were not so distracted by his own issues, he would have seen them too. Through this mystery, Blanchard asks interesting questions about our obligations to our kin. How far would you go to protect your child? Your sibling? Your parent? Chibenashi and Ashwiyaa’s relationship is one of intense co-dependency—it is not healthy—yet neither are the relationships between Sakima and Wiishkobak or Meoquanee. When Chibenashi meets Daaksin again, he is reminded that she chose to left—he sees this as a betrayal, but it is in reality perhaps one of the healthiest relationship endings we get in this book. Sometimes you have to walk away. Chibenashi doesn’t learn that for a long time.I suspect, however, that for most readers of this book the standout aspect will be the worldbuilding. It certainly was for me. Blanchard does not spend much time justifying this alternative world—we never learn why colonization didn’t happen. And that’s OK. I’m happy to leave that blank, take it as read, and simply consider the consequences—and there are many. This is a world that has developed parallel to ours: there are cell phones and tablets, movies, guns, etc. Yet at the same time, so much is different. The justice system is restorative rather than punitive (or at least, it tries to be). Settlements try to coexist with the natural world. Movies get dubbed into Anishinaabemowin because most of the characters in this book don’t speak English. The African slave trade never happened, and so nations in Africa have flourished in various ways.Despite colonization never happening, Mino-Aki (the nation where Chibenashi lives) is not a paradise. As we know, there are crimes. The novel features an incident of domestic violence, abuse, and stalking that has a grisly end to it. Through Takumwah, Blanchard explores how conflict among nations, and issues of assimilation and discrimination, is still possible in an uncolonized world. In so doing, she affirms that this alternative world is different but still realistic—humans are flawed creatures capable of darkness no matter who we are, where we live, what societies we build.Nevertheless, I loved this thought experiment. As a white person, I can’t pretend to comment on this from an Indigenous perspective. But I would love to see more stories like this—not just stories of possible Indigenous futures, but also stories of different Indigenous presents! In imagining a different world, Blanchard helps us to imagine alternatives to the current world we inhabit. She reminds us that, in fact, none of the world we inhabit right now was inevitable. It is the result of a series of choices, and we can make it different—can decolonize, build something new—if we choose.So The Peacekeeper is many novels in one. It’s the story of a man whose relationships are attenuated and fragile. It’s a murder mystery that hides a tragic truth at its core. And it’s a testament to imagining a different present, one in which the nation on whose land I reside (I’m in Thunder Bay) was able to continue thriving as it was long before European contact. It succeeds at all of these things, to varying degrees, and certainly enough that I would love to read the next book Blanchard writes in this world.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Shakespeare retellingI was somewhat skeptical about this book going into it simply because of how it was marketed as a retelling of Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare retellings can be hit-and-miss. Thankfully, These Violent Delights is a hit! Chloe Gong takes the broad strokes of Romeo and Juliet but adapts the story quite heavily. There are some subtle nods (like a bar named Mantua) and some really nice set pieces (like the mistaken-for-dead moment) that Gong makes her own. All in all, I was able to sink into this story and not worry about comparing it to the material that inspired parts of it.Juliette Cai is the heir to the Scarlet Gang, which runs one half of 1920s Shanghai. Their rivals are the White Flowers, and Juliette once had a forbidden romance with their heir, Roma Montagov. That was nipped in the bud, but Juliette is back after four years away in the United States—just in time for a madness to sweep through Shanghai, the people afflicted all tearing out their own throats. Juliette and Roma both become the investigators for their respective gangs, so they get thrown together under extreme circumstances: enemies turned lovers turned enemies again—can they put aside the betrayal of the past to prevent a betrayal in the present?It took me a while to get into the story. I think this is because of how Gong throws us into the plot very quickly. I barely had time to get to know Juliette before Roma’s first appearance, and that apprehension in the back of my mind about how closely this story might hew to the play likely had a role as well. So it says something about Gong’s storytelling that, eventually, I got sucked in. I wanted Juliette and Roma to find the solution to this deadly mystery as much as they did.On top of the mystery, there is a lot happening regarding the power relations in Shanghai. Partly historical, partly science fictional, this book plays fast and loose with the political situation in Shanghai in the 1920s. Nevertheless, as someone who isn’t familiar at all with Shanghai and its history, I found it fascinating. The cast are diverse in terms of race as well as gender—I was pleasantly surprised to see a trans character among Juliette’s allies—and Gong explores how this Chinese city has been encroached upon by foreign powers (i.e., white people). Indeed, the mystery itself is a kind of commentary on the fight for the very heart of Shanghai and its people.My one criticism? The cliffhanger ending. This appears to be a duology, and I am so glad that the second book is out (and also available from my library), because I was incensed. Yes, the primary mystery gets solved—but enough of the plot is left unresolved that it almost ruined my enjoyment of the rest of the book! Again, this says a lot about how much faith I’m putting in Gong that I will read the sequel after such a betrayal. I need to find out if Juliette Cai is truly the ruthless killer she has told herself that she must be.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

My public library even had a copy right away. The Memory LibrarianWhen I heard Janelle Monáe had a book coming out, of course I was going to read it! My public library even had a copy right away. The Memory Librarian is an anthology of science-fiction stories set in the world Monáe created for her Dirty Computer album and emotion picture. Jane 57821, the protagonist from those pieces, returns in one novelette (Nevermind). Other stories explore more corners of this world in which memories have been weaponized in white supremacy’s war to maintain its grip on our society.I cracked open this book on one of our first sunny days of spring on my deck. The first story, also called The Memory Librarian, is one of the longest. It follows Seshet, who is essentially a collaborator: she is the Director-Librarian for a town called Little Delta. She has risen to a position of great responsibility in a racist organization, New Dawn, that has acquired great power and convinced people they should surrender “unclean” thoughts or be branded “dirty computers” and taken in for cleaning. In this story, Monáe continues to explore some of the ideas of conformity that she brings up in her album. This novella was fascinating for the romance that Seshet embarks on and the conflict of interest that lies at the heart of the story.I also really enjoyed the next story, Nevermind, for its commentary on gender identity and roles. Though Jane 57821 is one protagonist, the story actually revolves around a friend, Neer, who is a non-binary woman. Another member of the Pynk Hotel community objects to the presence of people like Neer; she believes that Neer and others dilute the definition of womanhood to the point where the hotel might open itself up as a space to (gasp) men. This is such a powerful story—Monáe, of course, recently came out as non-binary, and this (and all the other stories) display a nuanced grasp of the gender identity issues rocking our society today. (It’s worth noting that the co-author of this story, Danny Lore, is non-binary as well.) This is the one of the types of queer stories I think we need more of. So many of our queer stories focus on things like coming out, but I want to read about the messiness within queer communities. I feel like Monáe and Lore are channelling Audre Lorde in this story, the way they interrogate how members of marginalized communities will further marginalize one another.“Timebox” was an intriguing story, but I confess I don’t get the ending. (I’m not sure if I am just missing something, but my understanding of how the timebox dilates time for the user means that what happens at the end … doesn’t matter? I feel like I’m missing something.) Nevertheless, the theme is a good one. I am all on board with questioning how we use our time under our capitalist system.The other stories I could take or leave. That’s not to say that they weren’t good, but I just wasn’t as enraptured with them as I was with the ones I have highlighted. Overall, though, The Memory Librarian is a great collection, and I just love its whole vibe. From the talented Black and Latinx and queer writers Monáe chose to collaborate with all the way to the way that the stories interrogate the intersections of Blackness and queerness in a near-future society that highlights our own society’s shortcomings … yes. Just yes. This is a book that really exemplifies what science fiction can be: painful and beautiful and inspirational and hopeful, all at once and in various times.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

WhatI’ve always maintained that Jenny Lawson is hilarious in the best possible way, and Broken (in the Best Possible Way) only sustains this opinion. What is the best possible way to be hilarious? With a generous helping of compassion. With self-deprecation that also recognizes that your self is human and valuable too. Even as Lawson makes fun of herself and others, she acknowledges that she deserves compassion and patience. To be broken is not to be without value—a message that our capitalist society forgets at times.If you have read either of Lawson’s previous books, you’ll know what to expect for this one. If you haven’t: basically, it’s a series of essays that pose as memoirs and hilarious stories but are also, often, thoughtful reflections on our lives. Lawson lives with several chronic illnesses, such as rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, and depression. In several of her essays, she describes to varying degrees her frustrations with her mind, her body, and the insurance company that seems determined not to let her treat either (fuck the American healthcare system, wow). She talks about undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). But she also writes about trying to befriend an owl, about shaving her dog’s vulva, and so many other things (actually, a lot of it is animal related, now that I think about it). While the goal is certainly to make us laugh, it’s the kind of laughter that comes with an awareness of the heavier things in life.One part of the book that really got to me was when she described her experiences with family members with dementia. This runs in my family and scares me. I understand that Lawson’s framing of senility as a kind of second childhood is meant to be reassuring, but it left me uneasy (this is not a criticism, just a reflection of my reaction to this essay). This is not something I like to think about, the prospect that one day, I too may begin to lose myself, or at least become unmoored from the linear experience of time and left to drift on the ocean of my memories.It was a little easier to absorb Lawson’s moving discussions of things that feel a little more removed from me. I haven’t experienced depression or serious anxiety, and I appreciate how open she is about her battles with both. In particular, I appreciated her acknowledgement that TMS worked for her but has not cured her, that it is a wonderful treatment and could potentially benefit others but isn’t some miracle therapy we should immediately recommend to everyone. So often, when someone with clout undergoes such a treatment, they stan it so hard that it makes me uncomfortable. Lawson responsibly and honestly documents her experiences, diary-style, in a way that I imagine will resonate with many.I also enjoyed Lawson’s honesty about how difficult a marriage is, and her opinion that the secret to not getting divorced is, in her case, a combination of laziness and a faulty memory!Finally, as someone who has recently started a career as a freelance copyeditor, I enjoyed the chapter where all she does is share notes between her and her editors. Brilliant. I definitely think copyediting this book would have been … interesting.Overall, this was a good read and perfect for my mood when I read it. I do think that Lawson’s sense of humour is the kind to which I become inured over time. Don’t get me wrong—I definitely laughed out loud, multiple times, as I read this book. If anything, I am impressed that Lawson can so consistently produce these quality books. At the same time, I’m struggling to come up with praise that is unique from what I have said in the past. She’s a brilliant, funny writer, and if you want to laugh about the sensitive side of life, come and join her in these pages.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I think I’m so well-disposed towards Revenant Gun because of Yoon Ha Lee’s dedication to wrapping up the story. Finishing a trilogy satisfactorily is no mean feat, especially when you’ve created a universe as intricate and far-flung as Lee’s.We pick up nine years after Raven Stratagem, although some chapters are flashbacks set shortly after that book. The Nirai hexarch, Kujen, has resurrected Shuos Jedao—or bits of him, at least—in a new and “improved” body and given him command of what is left of the Hexarchate’s Kel forces. Meanwhile, Brezan leads the rebels, and Cheris/Jedao is missing—she has a plan of her own. As war flares up over and over, it starts to look like Jedao vs Jedao might be the only way to end things—but what will the price be for humanity?It’s so interesting, all these viewpoint characters, and the sympathies that they create. New Jedao (as I will call him) is unsure of himself. He doesn’t trust Kujen (good), yet also has no idea how he could wrest more control over his own destiny. He also really has no purpose outside of being Kujen’s weapon. It’s fun watching him grow a conscience, of sorts.Similarly, I enjoyed seeing more from the servitors’ perspectives. Without giving too much away, let’s just say that the servitors are not a united front. They too have factions and allegiances, and it’s interesting to see how those overlap and intersect with the human powers. There is one servitor main character in particular whose allegiance shifts quite a bit over the course of the book, propelling them from a servant of one person to an autonomous being that sets its own goals.Then we have Cheris Jedao, who is making it her mission to assassinate the immortal Kujen at all costs. Although we don’t get to spend much time in her head compared to the other characters, hers is the journey I most enjoyed in this book. The ending, in particular, feels very fitting.All of the main characters are, in a way, trying to find themselves. In a galaxy where the old ways have quite literally been supplanted by a new regime, everyone is uncertain. Some people, like the Jedaos and even, to an extent, Brezan, have been robbed of their identities in one way or another. Lee asks us to consider who we are when we are torn away from our old support systems, our friends or family, and told we instead have a different purpose.I also enjoyed the political commentary. As much as it might be difficult for some to wrap their heads around the calendrical mechanics that underlie this story’s worldbuilding, at the end of the day, this series is about revolution. It’s about fighting back against the idea that it’s OK to sacrifice some people in order to preserve an order for the rest. Yet it also acknowledges that if revolution erupts into war, tough choices might result in the people you think of as the “good guys” looking an awful lot like the bad guys at times.If I have a criticism of this book or this series, it’s that I would have liked more time outside of the faction-controlled spaces. I would have liked to hear more about civilian life in the hexarchate, and to understand how the foreign nations (which I’m given to understand are also human) operate. I understand why Lee might have wanted to keep the story razor-focused on these characters, and it works quite well. Nevertheless, I feel like I’ve only been skimming the surface of this interesting universe. I want more! At the same time, I’m also satisfied with the ending of this story, and I’m not sure I need more, if that makes any sense.The comparisons to Ann Leckie and doubtless others are obvious, and I would agree with them, but don’t let those make you lose sight of the inarguable fact that Lee’s voice rises original and refreshing in this genre.

I chortle every time I hear such patently absurd allegations, for anyone who levels them clearly has spent little time around not only young adult literature but also young adults themselves! Adolescents and young adults are passionate and aware about social justice. They want to learn, want to share, want to act to make the world a better place. All too often, it’s us adults who are getting in the way—yes, we need to help younger people channel their enthusiasm in safe ways, but we shouldn’t mistake “safe” for “status quo.” This is what Rénee Watson and Ellen Hagan try to convey in Watch Us Rise, a book about two girls taking on “the Man” because the patriarchy is getting them down.Jasmine and Chelsea are starting their junior year of high school. They go to an “alternative” school in New York City, and it requires all students to be enrolled in an after-school social justice club. Yet Jasmine and Chelsea realize that the clubs they naturally gravitate towards aren’t working for them—Jasmine because of an incident of anti-Black racism from her teacher and some fatphobic bullying from a student; Chelsea because her poetry club wasn’t interested in reading outside of the canon. So they make their own club and start posting radical blog articles—and soon they get in trouble from the administration because of the waves they make and the people they piss off.An obvious comparison might be to Moxie, though I have only watched the movie and not read the book, so the comparison might be less commensurate. Moxie also features teen girls inciting others to stand up for feminism; however, my critique of that movie was that it centred a white girl as its protagonist when there were perfectly interesting protagonists of colour right there. In this respect, Watch Us Rise wins out by centering a fat, Black girl as one of its two protagonists. Indeed, some of the most intriguing moments of the book come not from racism but from fatphobia and the way Jasmine often feels erased as she navigates a world made for thinner people.The trouble that both Jasmine and Chelsea land in as a result of their Write Like a Girl blog feels so timely right now. We live in an era where people with fascist sympathies claim to fight for free speech yet will do everything they can to drown out marginalized voices. The people who complain to Jasmine and Chelsea’s school about Write Like a Girl exist in real life. They complain about teachers who tweet too much about progressive issues and try to get books removed from school and public libraries. They complain that their white children are “harmed” by learning about the enslavement of African peoples or the genocide of Indigenous peoples.These same people have no interest in letting kids speak their minds. As I mentioned in my introduction, part of what makes Watch Us Rise powerful is that everything in this book comes from Jasmine and Chelsea. The supportive adults in their lives—their parents, the bookshop owner—guide them, offering suggestions for how they can get their message out, but they never attempt to filter or minimize the girls’ messages. I especially appreciate how the bookshop owner lets the girls make mistakes but also nudges them as appropriate—such as when an act of resistance ends up making a lot of extra work for the school custodians, and Jasmine and Chelsea realize they should probably apologize.This is the trajectory for anyone who is learning how to be an activist. All of us, no matter our age, will get things wrong. Chelsea screws up and has to apologize to Jasmine. Jasmine has a lot of trouble working out her feelings, whether they are her romantic inclinations towards a friend or how upset she is about being bullied by a pretty white girl at school. Activism is hard enough when you don’t have a chronically ill parent or a judgemental grandmother!Watch Us Rise is incendiary yet also compassionate, interesting and eye-opening. I think it will make some adults groan and say it is “heavy-handed,” but I would disagree. It’s the perfect level for young adults who have the passion for activism but need some inspiration. I loved so much about this book, devoured it so quickly because I couldn’t wait to see how it ends. The ending, while far from perfect, might best be described as quite realistic yet also hopeful. Maybe that’s what we need in this world right now.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

So many elements must align: the writer’s voice and style, the topics of their essays, and what I take away from the book. Sometimes I Trip On How Happy We Could Be is a great example of an essay collection that I enjoyed reading a great deal, yet I’m not sure I emerged as transformed as I might expect. Which, honestly, is fine—not all reading has to be transformative! Sometimes it’s nice just to have fun.Nichole Perkins shares her thoughts on childhood and adulthood and the ages in between, on growing up, on sex and dating and other such activities, and on how her existence as a Black woman from the southern United States intersects with all these experiences. Although all of the essays are tinged with humour, they also often tackle serious issues of sexism, racism, misogynoir, domestic abuse, etc.Going to be honest: I had a hard time seeing myself in Perkins’s experiences—and no, it’s not because she’s Black. Rather, there are so many stories in here about sex! I find sex very fascinating in general, and I don’t mind reading about it, but there was something about the way Perkins writes about her sexual experiences that left me bemused. For example, the collection opens with “Fast,” in which Perkins describes the ways her body and behaviour were policed so that she wouldn’t be perceived as promiscuous, even in middle school. She includes an extremely graphic depiction of kissing boys on the playground at five years old. And I remember just reading this passage and being totally unable to relate to what she was describing—because I have never kissed anyone, aside from a quick peck on the check for a relative.I want to be clear that this is not a criticism of Perkins or her writing but rather an observation I’m offering up about my reaction as I read. Even though her understanding of her sexuality is so incredibly different from my own, I still thoroughly enjoyed reading about her experiences.Also, in a strange way, I feel like this book brought me closer to my bestie? She’s the one who lent it to me, and as I read it, all I could think was, “This is Rebecca. I am reading about Rebecca’s life.” Well, Rebecca also doesn’t have a lot in common with Perkins, but the way Perkins writes about her sexuality, the confidence and joy that she derives from it, fits Rebecca to a tee. So I am grateful to this book for making me feel almost like I’m talking to my friend on the phone, a long afternoon chat in which I get to listen to the latest in her love life.That’s really what Sometimes I Trip On How Happy We Could Be feels like: extended, one-sided phone conversations. I always hate to use trite adjectives like “vulnerable” and “honest” when I revoir memoirs. They never really capture what’s going on between the covers. So instead let me describe this book as a careful consideration of love. Whether she’s talking about her sex life or her family, TV shows or her involvement in message boards … Perkins is really talking about love for oneself and love for one’s community. Hence the title, which invites us to meditate on the what-ifs of our lives (and the possibility that, just maybe, we could indeed be that happy, if only for a time).Do I recommend it? Yes. Does that surprise you, given my ambivalence of spirit? This book perhaps isn’t for me as its ideal reader. I still liked it. I would read more of Perkins’s writing. That alone is enough for me to cast a recommendation out into the world, because some of you out there will love this book, and I hope it finds its way to you.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I missed The Lonely Hearts Hotel when it first came out, but when I saw she has a new book coming out soon, I finally learned about this one and jumped on borrowing it from my library. Also set in Montréal, albeit decades prior to Lullabies for Little Criminals, The Lonely Hearts Hotel echoes motifs from O’Neill’s earlier work. Once more we have substance use and addiction, sex work, poverty, domestic violence, etc. But this novel digs deeper into the psyche. My library stuck a “romance” sticker on its spine. I don’t know if that is correct … I don’t know, actually, that I liked this book all that much. Nevertheless, I cannot deny the grip it held me in for the duration that I read it!Rose and Pierrot grow up together in an orphanage in between the World Wars. Separated in their teens, their lives diverge despite living not that far away from one another. Pierrot finds himself in great luxury, only to be cast down into destitution and drug use. Rose finds herself a servant, only to be suborned further into the role of mistress. As each endures the vicissitudes of life, they dream of finding the other, of putting together a circus like they had fantasized about as children performing together in the homes of wealthy Montréalers. But life is seldom so accommodating.O’Neill really knows how to sucker punch her readers, let me tell you. This is a bleak book at times. If I were to give content warnings, I’m not even sure where to start, but let me try: pregnancy, miscarriage, abuse, sexual assault, murder, substance use … and a lot more. This is a book where bad things happen to bad people and to good people and to everyone in between. Indeed, I’m not so sure by the end of the book that we can call our protagonists “good people” any more, if ever they were. O’Neill might be trying to show us that people are not good or bad per se but rather that we are products of our environment. There is nothing naturally angelic or diabolical about Rose, or Pierrot for that matter—they act as they need to survive. They seldom ever flourish.O’Neill’s writing style remains quite narrative, with dialogue almost an afterthought. I see why she attracts nominations for such things as the Giller Prize and Canada Reads. This is exactly the kind of CanLit that CanLit loves to celebrate: seedy and sensational, focused exquisitely on the tragedy of white people, writing steeped in references to a version of Canada that no longer exists (and perhaps never did). I say none of this to mock the book, mind you, but rather to demonstrate that if there were a formula for CanLit award bait, O’Neill has cracked it. This book has serious Fall On Your Knees vibes (and remember, I cite that as one of my faves as well).Now, all this being said, I’m actually not sure that I enjoyed this book. I’m not sure that I would enjoy Lullabies for Little Criminals if I were to reread it now. I’m a different person from the one I was ten or even six years ago, when I last read that book. Having lived through the trauma of a pandemic, I find my tastes gravitating ever more strongly to more hopeful, happier fiction.Is there a place for the grimdark historicity of The Lonely Hearts Hotel? Absolutely. Indeed, I want novels like this that depict the grimy past of our cities and culture as much as I want war movies that show war as messy, dirty, and bloody. We need fiction that doesn’t glamourize and romanticize past eras. We need fiction that tells us the truth as much as we need fiction that lets us escape. Of course, one could question whether a book like this is any more truthful and any less of an escape than a happily-ever-after romance—after all, does not O’Neill romanticize a certain type of absurd serendipity that can only ever exist in art?Some authors, I feel, write because they yearn to live within a story themselves.That is ultimately where I think I must land on The Lonely Hearts Hotel. As captivating as it is haunting, this book is a melody played on a sad grand piano by a pianist with healed broken hands. It washes over you, crashes against you, asks you to let it in lest it break you down—your choice. I don’t think I enjoyed it, but I respect it, as art and story and something both truthy and escapist. O’Neill remains talented, and she deserves those award nominations and wins.And yet, I still yearn to leave behind the bleakness in favour of a little more hope.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I knew nothing about Freya Marske or this novel, A Marvellous Light, but the description was sufficient to persuade me to buy it. No regrets. This Edwardian fantasy novel about magicians, with a gay romance and plenty of class and family drama, is a perfect spring read (or indeed, a perfect read for any season). Marske takes a mystery and spins it out into a tight drama with an interesting cast of supporting characters.Robin Blyth learns about magic on his first day appointed to a new civil servant position. Still dealing with the death of his parents and becoming head of his small household, Robin struggles to make sense of what he has learned. But he has no time to adapt: the shady people who killed his predecessor come after him, hoping he knows more, forcing him to team up with his sullen colleague, Edwin Courcey, magician. Together, Robin and Edwin need to figure out what these people want, why they are willing to kill for it, and how to save Robin for a curse that might otherwise kill him.Let’s get right into talking about magic. I enjoyed Marske’s portrayal of magic as a combination of power and technique. Some magicians have a great deal of power but struggle to use it well. Others, like Edwin, have very little raw power yet have the intelligence and wherewithal to figure out more innovative spellwork. The actual casting, involving complicated finger positions (cradling) would doubtless be visually intriguing if this book were ever adapted—your aphantasic er here had to put her book down and rearrange her fingers in order to visualize it!The relative inequities among various magicians, and the intersection of this with class in Britain, works very well. I like how magic is secret yet not a particularly closely guarded one. Edwin’s frustration that Britain’s magic has ossified compared to other countries, some of which actually do research, is really interesting and something I hope we get to explore further in the series. Overall, the worldbuilding and action here reminds me of both C.L. Polk and Naomi Novik!The actual plot is … fine. It’s a good mystery, if a little obvious at times, and the action and pacing are uneven. While I enjoyed the climax and conclusion, they came upon suddenly, with a supporting character and a new minor character being introduced to quickly round out the cast of allies. Marske wraps up the “mystery” in a sense while leaving plenty of room for sequels. It’s not a totally satisfying ending, but it works.No, A Marvellous Light shines on its main characters. The alternating perspectives between Robin and Edwin are great. The burgeoning romance is ever-so-subtle before blossoming into need, which I’m told is good. The sex scenes turn more explicit than I expected, and this book confirmed for me that, while I really don’t think there is any good word for genitalia, I would at least like variety in the words being used. That complaint aside, I enjoyed the cut-and-thrust of attraction, desire, disappointment, and dissatisfaction in this romance.Come for the magic, stay for the characters, and allow yourself to get enveloped in this world. There is so much more I want from Marske (in a good way). I am definitely reading the second book.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Nevertheless, at some point Dinosaurs grabbed me, as usual, when I was a kid, but I wouldn’t say that my fascination has endured as it has with some. Nevertheless, at some point last year, I had a moment where I decided to seek out more information on these creatures and their extinction. This is not the first book I added to my to-read list, but it happens to be the first book I’ve read, mostly thanks to getting an eARC from NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press. The Last Days of the Dinosaurs wasn’t what I was expecting, yet it was a pleasant surprise.Have you ever watched one of those “documentaries” on Discovery Channel that are more like recreations? It starts with an asteroid hurtling towards Earth, and then there are computer-generated sequences of dinosaurs running for cover while a narrator in a refined British accent explains how they are all about to die. That’s what’s going on here. Riley Black narrates the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs (and many other species). She chooses a main character for each chapter, a Triceratops, Edmontosaurus, or sometimes even a plucky mammal perhaps distantly related to us. Then she uses that focal point to explore changes to the environment and the evolutionary adaptations and accidents that contributed to some species surviving and others … well, not.That is the crux, of course: we think of the extinction event as “the end of the dinosaurs,” and it was … but it was also the beginning of the Age of Mammals. Without that asteroid, then in all likelihood there wouldn’t be us. Moreover, Black correctly situations this mass extinction on a continuum of other such extinctions throughout the history of life on Earth—each extinction altering the balance enough to allow different types of life to take hold in ways never before seen. So while it probably sucks from the perspective of a species going extinct, these extinctions are, in the end, part of the natural cycle. Also, the dinosaurs had a pretty good run—orders of magnitude longer than we humans have been around—so I don’t feel that sorry for them.At first, Black’s decision to narrate events without any reference to how we might know, for example, that dinosaurs used trees as back-scratching posts, annoyed me. I like the story of how. I want to understand how the human ingenuity that is the scientific method led to the knowledge we have of events millions of years in the past. That is what I think is so cool.Fortunately, Black did something clever. After the conclusion of the book (I was surprised to run into it only 70 percent of the way in), there is a lengthy appendix where she goes, chapter-by-chapter, over the “how” of each event. So if you are a stickler like me, don’t throw the book out after the first couple of chapters: stick with it, and you will be rewarded!Indeed, one of my first thoughts as I was reading the book and ran across phrases like “lush verdue” was, “Oh, Riley Black can *write.*” I say this because there is a difference between a competent science communicator and a writer, and Black is both of these things. So that, in turn, makes the choice to split the narrative from the scientific explication even more palatable: as I said above, reading the first part of this book is very much like watching a recreation documentary. It’s compelling in a way that perhaps mixing the two wouldn’t have been. So while the choice irked me at first, I not only have come around, but I’m fully in favour of it simply because Black has the writing skills to back it up.I learned a lot from this book too. Paleontology has come a long way since I was a kid. I had heard the news that even non-avian dinoasurs probably had feathers, or at least a fuzz approaching feathers. I’ve followed some cool announcements about estimates of T-rex populations, etc. But they never really come back to dinosaurs in school after that initial fascination as a kid, so there was a lot I didn’t know. For example, I was under the impression that the death of most non-avian dinosaurs was a gradual, drawn-out process following the impact event itself. Black marshals evidence that disagrees: according to some studies, it’s more likely that the infrared pulse from the impact fried pretty much all organic life on the surface of the planet within minutes. That is to say, the dinosaurs died very quickly, with only a few holdouts under the water or the ground to represent their species for the remainder of their lives. So that was new to me. Similarly, Black’s telescoping orders-of-magnitude approach to chapters—a minute after, a day after, a month after, a year after, a hundred years after, etc.—helped me wrap my head around the time frame of the recovery of life.Beyond informing us about the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, this book has a lot to teach us about the ways in which ecosystems interact. Black spends a great deal of time focusing on the complex interconnections among creatures, from the relationship between pollinators and flowers or seedcones and birds to the roles played by apex predators like T-rex, brought low more often through the smallest micro-organisms than through a challenge from another dinosaur. I think we humans often have this tendency to think very discretely, and Black’s writing really encourages us to see the dinosaurs in a holistic way, as part of this vast tapestry of life, rather than as an entirely different type of life form.As a final aside, I had the pleasure when reading the conclusion of learning that Black is, like me, a trans woman (and, like me, transitioned in adulthood). I’m not saying I like the book more for that, but it was really like a cherry on top of this reading experience, seeing more of us out there, thriving, writing about our passions. That’s the future I want.So, if like me you are having one of those random urges to learn a particular topic, and that topic happens to be dino-related, I recommend this book!Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I’ve pre-ordered this book but was delighted to receive an eARC on NetGalley because I could not wait. Shout out to the Sam Miller I knew when I taught in England (aside from being a blonde white woman, she was nothing like this Sam Miller).Sam Miller is a wildly popular, successful influencer. Founder of a wellness brand, Shakti, Sam is riding high on the publication of her latest book. After she publishes a tell-all essay about her sexual experience with her female best friend in high school, however, that friend emails her manager, angry and accusing Sam of sexual assault. So Sam must venture back to her small New England hometown to reconnect with this friend. In so doing, she opens the floodgates of her memory for a deluge of disturbing propositions. Idol asks us to confront whether we really remember the past accurately—and what happens if we aren’t the person we remember being?Pretty much from the first chapter, I did not like Sam. This is by design—O’Neill has a talent for creating unlikable protagonists, and I think they have their place. We so often label women “unlikable” (or even less polite terms) simply for being strident, forthright, assertive, etc. Sam is these things, yes, but that isn’t why she is unlikable—I don’t like her because she is self-absorbed and perhaps even narcissistic. However, she isn’t a shallow character. Based on the limited third-person narrator’s perspective, Sam seems to truly believe in much of her grift—she meditates, etc. (Note that I am not suggesting meditation itself is always a grift—rather, I’m pointing out that many wellness gurus do not practise what they preach.) Sam doesn’t have a public and a private persona: she generally believes in her reality, and that is fascinating.One of the best moments in the book comes early on. Sam is having an emergency call with her therapist, who asks her, “What would it mean to you if this accusation were true?” The therapist does not let Sam dodge the question, despite much bluster from Sam that it isn’t and can’t be true, and I really liked the dynamic in this scene. It’s a great, albeit harrowing question: what if it were true that you did something awful to someone, even if you can’t believe it of yourself?The whole theme of Idol revolves around this question: is Sam Miller a “good” person? Can any of us be good people? O’Neill leaves many of the details of the past up for interpretation. The book strongly hints that Sam’s version of events is unreliable. On the other hand, it seems clear that her former bestie, Lisa, has her own issues, has made her own mistakes, has her own traumas. There’s another character who is nominally the primary antagonist of the book—I won’t reveal their name, for spoiler reasons, though it’s pretty easy to figure out who they are given all the breadcrumbs. This character has it out for Sam. And I get why, even though I don’t condone their actions.I think this is what makes Idol work so well for me: O’Neill spends time exploring the different angles of what it means to be a flawed social media influencer, encompassing the perspectives of Sam herself, her manager, this antagonist, Lisa, her mother, etc. There is a compelling scene later in the book where Sam is meeting with Shakti’s board of directors, mostly old, white guys. One of them is adorably “woke” because of his younger daughter’s influence. They are discussing how Sam can distance herself from Shakti, given the allegations against her, so Shakti can go public. Sam, of course, balks at the idea of stepping away from her baby when men who have similarly been accused of sexual assault haven’t fallen from grace.It takes guts, I think, for O’Neill to examine these double standards in this way. It’s one thing to write books about women crusading against male abusers—and these books should be written. It’s another to write a book about a powerful woman who might be one of those abusers, to discuss how white women like Sam and myself are often complicit in propping up these abusive systems because we think we will be rewarded and think we will be safe as a result. At the same time, we can admit that when we as a society do hold women to account, we do so with a vociferousness and viciousness seldom seen for men.But I keep coming back to the portrayal of Sam as an influencer and what the role of influencer culture plays in our society. We have a lot of conversations about cancel culture: whether it exists, whether it has gone too far, whether it only works on marginalized people. I think we need to reverse that. We need to talk more about promotion culture. We need to ask ourselves why it is that certain people keep being given a platform, only for them to be revealed as frauds, criminals, or abusers. O’Neill is asking us, gently but persistently: “are people like Sam Miller rotten from the start, and that is what draws them to influencing, or does the influencing rot them from within?” Has Sam’s entire life since living her hometown just been her running away from memories she doesn’t want to admit?There are no easy answers to be found in this book. The climax and denouement are raw and jumbled and bitter; I had to go back and re-read to make sure I wasn’t missing something. The ending is a testament to O’Neill’s refusal to reassure us that everything will be OK. It won’t be. We’ve constructed this abusive society that loves to build up women only to tear them down and pits women against each other, generationally, sexually, and competitively. Whether or not we root out the Sam Millers of the game is immaterial so long as the game itself continues to exist. She may or may not be a product of the culture, but her power and privilege are a symptom of it. Idols fall from grace because we demand it—yet we are always willing to replace them with someone fresh, someone new, so the cycle can begin again.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

How time flies in this pandemic.I was in a minor reading slump the week following Untamed, so when I went back to reading I wanted something I knew I could get through, something unchallenging. Kingdoms of the Night fits these criteria. As I have remarked in my previous s of this series, these are not exactly your most original or thought-provoking fantasy novels. In his introductions, Allan Cole makes it clear that he and Chris Bunch set out to replicate their science-fiction success in the fantasy genre in a practical, nearly formulaic way. It’s very similar to how David Eddings has approached writing fantasy, starting with his Belgariad series—and since the Belgariad was my gateway into fantasy, I suppose I have a soft spot for these kinds of books. Indeed, my vague memory of The Warrior’s Return, the next and final book of this quartet, is what motivated me to go back and re-read these.In this installment, Amalric Antero returns as the narrator. He’s an old guy and definitely no longer interested in sex unless you magically rejuvenate him and dangle the sexy granddaughter of his one-time protégé, Janos Greycloak, in front of him … and what are the odds … what’s that? That’s exactly what happens? Oh. OK then.Amalric and the new Greycloak set off on an adventure to find the real Far Kingdoms, because the one that he and the old Greycloak found in the first novel were but a poor reflection, much like what C.S. Lewis pulled with Narnia. What ensues is very much your typical hero’s journey adventure narrative, complete with a series of obstacles to overcome, a literal demonic villain, and heroism aplenty for all our major and minor characters alike.I want to say this is better than either of the first two books, that Cole and Bunch have improved, but honestly … it’s more of the same. If anything, The Far Kingdoms had more heft to it because Amalric faced more internal conflict and character development. In this book, as a fully formed adventurer, he is much more confident in himself—but he doesn’t really have to struggle with his inner demons, just the outer ones, and they aren’t as scary. As much as Cole and Bunch try to add depth to their world through spiritual aspects of the study of magic, the characters don’t live up to these aspirations. Most of them are flat, one dimensional, and even the main characters like Amalric are two dimensional at best.Now, there are some redeeming qualities. Once again, this book features at least a whiff of queerness (though, sadly, the explicitly gay character is killed off page before we even meet him). I say this only to remark on it as a book from the late 1990s including such views.Also, while the plot is formulaic and predictable, I would hardly call it plodding or pedestrian. I like to think of books like this as B-movies. I’m not going to heap praise on it, but if it’s on TV one afternoon I would watch it (or stream it if I’m in the mood for something mindless). That’s what Kingdoms of the Night provides, exactly what I was looking for: a simple fantasy story with a happy ending that I didn’t have to think too much about.I’m not mad about it.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

There is an acceptance of the reader here that I found quite powerful. It isn’t just that Doyle is sharing a lot about her past, her traumas, her hopes, her mistakes, her triumphs. It’s that she is willing to take the time to make us feel welcome in these pages.Also, props to her and her publisher for the one-word title with no subtitle. That’s a power move.I first heard of Doyle when she was a guest on Justin Baldoni’s Man Enough podcast. She shared a story, also in this essay collection, about a time that her kids had friends over. She asked if anyone wanted something to eat: all the boys said yes, right away; the girls looked at each other as if trying to figure out a collective answer, and then one of them responded in the negative. Doyle claims this demonstrates a difference between how we socialize boys and girls—the former look within, the latter look to each other when making decisions. It’s an interesting idea vaguely reminiscent of Eugenia Cheng’s ideas of ingressive and congressive behaviours. Anyway, I was intrigued enough by what Doyle had to say that I bought Untamed, bolstered by my bestie’s positive words about it as well.I was not let down.There’s a lot about Doyle’s life that I can’t identify with. She was raised in a relatively conservative Christian upbringing, which led to her marrying her boyfriend when she discovered she was pregnant, having three kids with him, before finally divorcing him at forty and falling in love and marrying a woman. This story unfolds in bits and pieces, not always in order, in Untamed. But as the title of the book implies, Doyle’s thesis is far more general than these specific experiences might imply: often, in our lives, we feel like we have to follow a script. We have to do what is expected of us. We are, Doyle says, tamed. Her journey, then, was one of untaming herself, or as she puts it:I decided that if I kept doing the “right” thing, I would spend my life following someone else’s directions instead of my own. I didn’t want to live my life without living my life. I wanted to make my own decisions as a free woman, from my soul, not my training. But the problem was, I didn’t know how.A few weeks later, I opened a card from a friend that said, in bold, capital, thick black lettering: “Be still and know.”OK, that got me.I’ve told this story before on my blog, but basically, when I was wrestling two years ago with the prospect I might be transgender, I was awake in bed one Sunday night, turning it over in my head. “Ok, if I’m a girl, what would my name be?” I asked myself. Then I did what Doyle describes in this essay: I went deep into myself and knew. The name Kara just felt right to me in a way that was indisputable.But beyond that, Doyle’s idea of being caged by her life until she decided to start living it on her own terms resonated so much with my experience of transition. I spent the first thirty years of my life being told at every turn by our society that I was male—and that this came with certain expectations. To be transgender—and to transition—is ultimately an act of untaming oneself. It’s a declaration that you will not let society dictate your identity any more. It certainly would have been easier for everyone if I hadn’t come out. That’s the message our transphobic society, sometimes with the help of hefty legal sanctions, is trying to foist upon trans people, particularly trans youth. Yet, as I said last year, I have never been happier than I have been since deciding to transition. Because now I am living my life on my terms.So even though Doyle and I don’t share many experiences, her words felt true for me. Even though I’m not a parent, her thoughts on raising kids made me think a lot about how I interact with young people and the impressions I want to leave. Even though I’m not in a romantic partnership, her thoughts on how to love her partner—while also loving herself—made me think a lot about the friendships in my life that provide me the support and succour we often associate with romantic relationships. At every turn, Doyle’s writing had something in it for me to discover, muse about, and ultimately take into my heart.I read this book in a Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago—and then I had a bad week, during which I read nothing, before finally picking up a crappy fantasy novel (on purpose) the week after that. But I’m glad that if I had to enter a brief reading pause, Untamed was the book the preceded it. Even now I can feel the fire in my belly that Doyle’s words lit as I read it. If, like me, you are a white woman, you will probably come away feeling like you want to push back against cisheteropatriarchy—at least I hope so. I won’t claim to speak about how women of colour might read this book—Doyle acknowledges she has made missteps when it comes to being antiracist, and since I don’t know much about her public platform beyond this book, I’m not sure I can comment.So even though I greatly enjoyed this book and, four months into 2022, it’s the best non-fiction book of the year for me so far, I won’t say this is universal. But there is power here. Perhaps the best moment in the book is when Doyle reminds us to “feel it all.” She’s referring to all our emotions, even the ones we usually consider negative. She’s reminding us it’s OK not to be OK, that we can’t be happy all the time, even if that’s the grift society pushes on to us. It’s a sentiment I have long tried to express to my ride or die as she navigates difficult and emotionally tumultuous changes in her life.In a world where women are so often told we are not enough in so many ways, Untamed unapologetically calls out this bullshit and reminds us that we are enough—but we have to start playing by our rules instead of the rigged playbook we grew up with.Oh, and she’s funny too.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Perhaps it was Something about the description of this book made me give it a chance even though I’ve been turned off generation ship stories lately. Perhaps it was the fact that the story is confined to a single generation, rather than attempting to span the multiple generations of the ship’s journey. Adam Oyebanji uses the setting to tell an interesting story of political intrigue and cover-ups, mystery, and some intense action. While there are parts that don’t quite cohere into the whole, overall, it’s a pretty good yarn.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the eARC.Braking Day takes place just as the Archimedes and its two sister ships near their destination of Tau Ceti. Ravinder (Ravi) Macleod is training to be an engineering officer, but his family name is already a strike against him. While dealing with this prejudice, Ravi also starts to notice that not all is right with the Archimedes. Certain things don’t add up—but why? Is this sabotage by the BonVoyers—a protest group that doesn’t want the fleet to colonize an alien world, extirpating its indigenous life? Or is there something even more sinister afoot, something that has perhaps been hidden from Ravi and the rest of his generation?I can’t go into too many details here without immediately getting into spoiler territory. Suffice it to say, I predicted the twist that happens halfway through the novel, and the final reveal was a little disappointing. Nevertheless, I appreciate how Oyebanji takes the time to construct credible, competing belief systems stemming from the history on Earth—namely, how some people embraced implants (hence becoming cyborgs) while rejecting artificial intelligences, and others did the opposite. Everything that happens, and the cold war situation that drives the largest conflict of this story, makes sense from a narrative perspective, and I appreciate that.I also liked that Oyebanji took the time to discuss the ethics around humanity spreading out among the stars. Do we have the right to displace indigenous life on another world simply so we can colonize it and make our mark? The fact that there are different perspectives on this from characters in the novel allows the reader to grapple with the complexity. While there is a twinge of dystopia here—Ravi is often struggling to afford the water rations to do things like shower, and it’s clear that the closed-loop system of the fleet is nearing its end of life—this novel is ultimately optimistic about the chances of a generation ship succeeding in its journey. I love how Oyebanji portrays the society that has sprung up on these three vessels, along with Ravi’s critiques of it.Despite my disappointment with some parts of the reveal, I don’t want to be too harsh, because Braking Day kept me reading. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that I couldn’t put it down. Nevertheless, I really wanted to find out the solutions to the various mysteries that Ravi had started to unravel.On that note, without spoiling, let me praise this book for wrapping up those mysteries by the end. This could easily be the start of a series, but if it is not, it works fine as a standalone novel as well. There are enough dangling plot threads to start a new story—either with the same characters or perhaps their descendants—but the questions raised in this book get answered. This is a delicate balance to achieve, and Oyebanji nails it.Overall, I would characterize this novel as fun, fraught with danger, and fulfilling in its promises to the reader.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Barnard’s young adult novels are inevitably, heartbreakingly poignant. Her most recent that I had read, Fierce Fragile Hearts, left an indelible mark upon my soul for the way that I, as an aromantic and asexual person, felt seen by Barnard’s careful, honest portrayal of friendship as equal to romantic love. Even now just reading that  from 2019 makes me ache thinking about how much of a revelation that book felt like for me.So naturally, I was excited to read Destination Anywhere. While it didn’t grab me the same as Fierce Fragile Hearts did, I also didn’t have that expectation. I just wanted a good story with some meaning behind it, and that’s exactly what I got.Peyton King has no friends. For a brief, shining year in sixth form, she thought she might have found some. That didn’t work out. So now this seventeen-year-old has bought a plane ticket with her dad’s credit card and flown across the world to Vancouver, Canada, where she plans to see the whole country (lol). With no plan and very little concept of how big Canada is, Peyton sets out on her grand adventures, interrupted only by flashback chapters here and there that tell us the story of how we got to now.In case you all don’t know this about me, my most relevant identity for this  is that I am Canadian. So it was a lot of fun to see Barnard portray my country to her primarily British audience. According to her acknowledgements, she lived in Canada (in British Columbia) for a time, and I’m not surprised. Now, I actually have never been to BC—I live in a big but small town called Thunder Bay, Ontario, which Peyton bypasses on her journey east. But based on my lived experience as a Canadian, I can say that Barnard does a pretty good job at capturing what parts of our country she portrays!Of course, Peyton isn’t running to Canada so much as away from the mess she perceives to be her life. I love the flashback story structure Barnard uses here. Each chapter unfolds a vignette from Peyton’s past yet leaves us wanting more before pulling us back to the present. Unlike some novels, however, the present-day chapters are just as compelling. Peyton falls in with a good group of older people who shepherd her and act as faithful friends—and maybe a love interest, I’m not telling. It’s sweet and could be saccharine were it not for the realistic way Barnard portrays Peyton’s social anxiety. This trip is not a panacea; the book does not end with everything in Peyton’s life OK again (or perhaps for the first time). And certainly Peyton gets lucky with her group of travelling companions; I wouldn’t recommend this book for another seventeen-year-old with wanderlust because I’m not sure they would be so lucky as Peyton is.But quite a bit of this book spoke to me despite my adolescence differing greatly from Peyton’s. I had friends in high school and university. That being said, I can identify with Peyton’s disconnection from her friend group and anxiety, later, about making new friends. There is a universality to Barnard’s characterization that means, I suspect, many readers will resonate with at least parts of Peyton’s story, whether it’s the reactions of her parents (and brother) to her sudden trip or Peyton’s subsequent interactions with her former friends. In any event, I was reminded of what I adore so much about Barnard’s novels: the easy pacing, the way that even the more static characters are sketched with such care, and the gentle heartache that emanates from our protagonist.Destination Anywhere is a book about the pain of growing up, the pain of not being understood, and the fear of not finding your people. It is loud and bold but also subtle and sensitive. I devoured it in two days not just because it’s an easy read but because it kept my attention (and maybe even made me want to see more of my own country). Though far from my favourite of Barnard’s work, I’m happy I took the time to catch up, and I’m very excited for her upcoming novel, Something Certain, Maybe!Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Consequently, Hawking chose to include only Einstein’s equation from special relativity, E=mc^2. The book was beyond successful for any book about theoretical physics in its day (and I quite liked it when I read it, especially the special illustrated edition). Michael Dine has gone a similar route. This Way to the Universe bills itself as “comprehensible to anyone with a high-school level education, with almost no equations.” It mostly lives up to this expectation, though there are a few moments in the weeds. It’s not so much that this book really got me thinking about physics knowledge, but as a teacher I really started thinking about physics education, as well as physics as a discipline.Thanks to NetGalley and Dutton Books for the eARC.Dine eschews the chronological development of physics that is par for the course in these types of books. Though his treatment of the subject is loosely chronological, as it should be, he has chosen to focus more topically—he starts off, for example, talking about relativity before jumping back to provide some context with Newton. But as he dives into the world of quantum mechanics, he is never afraid to bring us forward a little bit to talk about new developments before taking us back to an earlier time as we move along to the next mystery. That might sound confusing, the way I explained it, but I assure you that it helps the reader understand connections between ideas that were developed decades apart and, when presented chronologically, feel disconnected.As Dine explains how our thinking about the universe has changed, I pondered the audience for this book. This Way to the Universe is not a textbook per se—it’s not teaching physics. But it is also not quite a popular science book in the way I am used to; as the title aptly captures, Dine is taking us on a tour, as if he has invited us into a physics department for the day and we’re meeting all the principal players. It made me think about the fact that (from my limited recollection of high school physics at least—I never took it in university) it would be nice if we made physics students (perhaps all science students) read more narrative accounts of their discipline. Fewer textbooks and more contexts.I particularly enjoyed that Dine was carefully aware of the legacy of sexism and colonialism in physics. He lauds Marie Curie and Emmy Noether while also pointing out how structural misogyny made their lives and careers more difficult, and he doesn’t hesitate to mention ongoing experiences of sexism with more recent women who have contributed to the field.On a broader note, Dine does an excellent job of emphasizing the collaborative nature of science. This goes back to the topical approach he takes, which allows him to show how future theorists and experimenters built upon the theories and experiments of previous scientists. Though the usual suspects show up, Dine mentions more obscure people who nonetheless made significant contributions to the field. He helps paint the picture of physics as a discipline that advances more often through small contributions from a large number of people rather than brilliant theories spun by a couple of geniuses—those exist, but they are not the heartbeat of the field.Finally, I respect that while Dine has certain biases and favourites when it comes to the frontrunners for a grand unified theory, he does his best to present an unbiased take on those candidates. Too often I read books where a physicist’s opinion is basically “my theory is the best and the other theories suck,” and I understand the need to be confident in one’s horse to get grant funding, but that’s not what I need as a layperson reading your book. I don’t want you to tell me that string theory is “almost there” and we just need another decade. Dine is honest about the limitations of our current theories and experiments, describes what is happening right now at the bleeding edge of physics, and makes it clear that there is still a lot we don’t know—but, excitingly, we have some inklings of how we might find out.I come to this book steeped in general knowledge of physics from countless such books before this one. The more I learn, the more I am convinced I do not understand modern physics and possible cannot, not because I am not smart enough, but because I am too lazy to devote the time. Nevertheless, I appreciate Dine and others who take the time to try to explain their work as simply as possible to interested people like me, because it is valuable and important, and I might never understand it, but I am glad there are people out there who do. Or, as Dine puts it, understand parts of it.I don’t think this is the best book to start your modern physics journey with. It is comprehensible to someone with a high-school education, yes, but if it has been a while since you learned about electromagnetism and atoms, you might want a more basic refresher before you dive into this book. Make it your second or third popular physics book, and you might be on the right track. But this is definitely a contender worth considering for its even writing, great treatment of the discipline as a whole, and careful explanations of what we know and what we don’t.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I get that humanity is facing yet another existential crisis, this time thanks to climate change, and that this makes authors eager to write about us evacuating the planet and whatnot. But I just find it so bleak, and I yearn for hope. So when I first heard about Arkhangelsk by Elizabeth H. Bonesteel, I was very apprehensive. Nevertheless, I received an eARC from House Panther Publishing and NetGalley, and I gave it a shot. I’m really glad I kept an open mind, because Arkhangelsk pleasantly surprised me. This is not a book about bleakness. Much like Tchaikovsky’s novel, this is a book about hope.An isolated outpost of humanity subsists, barely, on an icy world. The survivors of the great ship Arkhangelsk, these people have largely forgotten their past, clinging only to the knowledge that they fled an Earth ravaged by war and conflicting politics. Life is hardscrabble, but it is a life. Nevertheless, Anya is the Chief Peace Officer, and she is determined to get to the bottom of the latest in a long string of disappearances of women from the town. Then her world is torn asunder when another ship from Earth arrives in orbit. Suddenly, they are no longer alone.This book starts as a murder mystery before taking a hard left turn and then slowly wending back into mystery territory and I am here for it. Bonesteel’s writing style honestly doesn’t do a lot for me, but her plotting is so careful and compelling that it was easy for me to read this book in big gulps.The relationship between Anya and Maddie, the captain of the starship that arrives, is probably the most significant aspect of the book for me. The ups and downs feel very realistic considering the stresses that occur throughout the story, and I appreciate how Bonesteel plays the attraction between these characters as ambiguous. One can read it as romantic if one wants, but of course, your resident aromantic book er always prefers to headcanon that it is platonic or queerplatonic instead. Anya and Maddie nevertheless have some kind of bond, yet the friction between them becomes an interesting and useful part of the story.Some aspects of the plot, and the characters behind them, are fairly despicable. I like that Bonesteel is able to make these characters’ motivations very clear and understandable to us—they aren’t moustache-twirling villains even if that is how I feel about what they are up to. But the main enemy, in almost all senses, is time. The antagonists are working against the depredations of time on their genomes and bodies, and the arrival of new people from Earth heralds a new race against the clock, as it is only a matter of time before more ships arrive.I also appreciate how the book highlights the irreplaceable importance of community and interdependence. This outpost cannot ultimately survive on its own, as much as many of its members would like to think so. Neither can the exiles. Nor can Maddie’s ship. The reconnection with Earth is terrifying in a cultural sense, for these people are rightly worried about what might happen to their fragile society as more and more people with strange ideas arrive. Yet the message is clear: we are stronger together. I, for one, find that heartening.Arkhangelsk is what I might call a medley of a novel. It has several plots tightly curled together, mysteries and friendships and betrayals and a wistful admission that space travel is ultimately lonely yet perhaps … necessary. Bonesteel surpasses my expectations in a subgenre that often disappoints me with its unimaginative nihilistic view on humanity’s prospects. Instead, she elevates the challenges of this setting into a story that persuades me of its worthiness, and I don’t mind that one bit.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Rather, as beautiful and perhaps comprehensive a  of this subject as it is, I found Paul Jepson and Cain Blythe’s writing style incompatible with how I like my popular science books.I first came upon the concept of rewilding when I read How to Clone a Mammoth last year. Beth Shapiro provided a great overview of the state of the ancient DNA field, and she mentioned many of the rewilding experiments that this book covers in more detail. I think it’s a fascinating and perhaps worthwhile enterprise; I want to be clear that I’m not objecting to this book based on its authors’ ideas (so far as I got through reading them). Instead, I didn’t appreciate their voice here.When I read a science book, I’m happy for the authors to inject their own thoughts, opinions, and personality into their writing. However, I want them to be able to separate those biases from how they present the science itself. Jepson and Blythe don’t do that here.Here’s an early example that raised my hackles: they present the overkill hypothesis as a settled fact within the scientific community. They laud Paul Martin as a visionary, a “time traveller” who has “the imagination and command of facts to think across eras and continents.” When they touch on “resistance to the overkill theory” they say, “In retrospect, it is interesting to ask why there was so much resistance to the overkill hypothesis” and then go on to say it was inexorably logical and blame conservation movements in the 1980s. Ok.Look, I am not a scientist. I don’t even have a particularly deep knowledge of this subject as a layperson. But I can use Google, and I do have some sweet critical thinking skills, and literally the first result when I google “overkill hypothesis” is this meta-analysis from 2018. It concludes that the overkill hypothesis enjoys excellent support among ecologists, like Jepson and Blythe, but remains controversial among archaeologists, and it points to a breakdown in communication between these disciplines as a result for the discrepancy. Note that I’m not saying Jepson and Blythe are wrong to champion the overkill hypothesis—I just take issue with how they present it as more settled than it is, and how their anemic attempt at presenting “both sides” criticism makes it seem like critics are unreasonable or biased while they are not.As I continued reading, I encountered more writing that left me on edge. Chapter 4 begins to talk about the rewilding experiments of past decades and says, “A few of these scientists had the combination of vision, boldness, powers of persuasion, and opportunity to try out new approaches….” When Jepson and Blythe describe the Oostvaardersplassen experiment, they say, “Frans Vera is someone with a genius for looking at things differently and assembling disparate forms of evidence to develop, test, and articulate new ideas. He is also fearless when it comes to challenging mainstream thinking….” I cannot stand this level of aggrandizement in a popular science book!It is one thing to laud the accomplishments of scientists. Praise Marie Curie all you want for her contributions to theories of radioactivity in the face of institutional sexism. By all means, tell me that Vera did some good ecological research into rewilding. But stop trying to paint individual scientists as mavericks who challenge a system that is somehow otherwise going to hold back scientific progress. Sure, I am open to critiquing the conservatism within science—but that’s not the same thing as saying, “this person is a visionary!!1111.”So I stopped reading after that. Your mileage may vary. As I said at the beginning, the illustrations and layout of this book are great—props to whatever designers worked on it. There is bound to be a lot of good, accurate, useful information to be learned here when it comes to environmental history, ecology, and the subject of rewilding in particular. Nevertheless, I personally could not stomach the biased writing any longer, and rather than trudge through the remaining seventy pages or so, I decided to call it a day.I’m not panning the book to the point of saying don’t read it, but I hope that my  provides some perspective as you go into it.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I read it while on a plane to visit her in Montréal, and we had some great conversations about Oona Out of Order. There are some obvious comparisons here, particularly to Slaughterhouse-Five. It also reminded me quite a bit of one of the most affecting novels I have ever read, My Real Children. Yet I also think Margarita Montimore has written a book that stands on its own.Oona, much like Billy Pilgrim from the aforementioned Vonnegut, has become unstuck in time. But her parade through her personal timeline is a bit more orderly than Billy’s: Oona reliably hops at midnight on New Year’s, which also happens to be her birthday. This happens first when she is turning 19, on New Year’s 1982. Oona usually arrives in her new year to a note that the previous year’s self—who, more often than not, is a future self—has left for her. One of the challenges Oona’s selves struggle with is how much to divulge about each upcoming year. Say too little and acclimating can be awkward; say too much and spoilers make it difficult to enjoy the year ahead. Throughout, Oona wrestles with whether or not her fate is fixed, along with a host of other questions that arise when one lives life non-linearly.For me, I think the central philosophical question raised by this book is simply this: would I choose to live my life out of order? Oona, of course, doesn’t get a choice, nor do we learn why this happens to her. At times she laments her non-linear life; at other times she admits there are advantages. I think we can all see why. This book came out in February 2020, so of course Montimore had no idea about the pandemic that would soon flip upside down all our lives. Would I want to be able to skip those two years, knowing eventually I would have to come back to them later?Similarly, I have a friend who is going through a very tough time in her personal life, and her professional aspirations have taken her far away from me. I know that in the years to come we will be closer, or at least travelling to spend time together will become easier, and that she will have healed. It’s tempting, the possibility of fast-forwarding to that future, even if this present must come round again.Nevertheless, the more I mulled over this question, the more my answer became no.My conclusion, I told Rebecca, was that experiencing linear time is a gift. While I don’t believe in a deity who created us, if such an entity or force exists, I credit it with the wisdom to fix us in time as well as space. I don’t envy the sense of fate that accompanies four-dimensional existence. Even if my future is pre-determined and my free will illusory, as some theories of modern physics suggest, I like that I don’t know what will happen, that I can at least act as if I have free will.Montimore seems to agree with me. Oona is a willful and impulsive protagonist; she frequently reads her past year’s letter with impatience and disbelief before vociferously swearing not to follow her own advice. I’ll let you guess how that works out. While this aspect of Oona’s personality can be a frustrating quality to a main character, it also makes her a very interesting one. After all, how boring would the book be if Oona simply accepted her mode of living, settled down, made a lot of money from knowing parts of the future, and nothing bad happened to her?Probably the most interesting sequence in the book occurs when Oona’s jump brings her to the year immediately prior the one she had just lived. She knows, therefore, that the man she meets this year she will marry—and subsequently divorce. Should she try to avoid meeting him, then? Is that even possible? Is it desirable? Imagine going into a deeply committed relationship knowing it is doomed to fail.I like how Montimore reminds us that we can find happiness in the moment, and that we can find happiness in extended periods prior to a dark time. That is, essentially, what life is—for there is no getting out of it alive, and yes, the end always comes for everyone eventually, even Oona.Now, scrutinizing the themes of Oona Out of Order is harder than it looks, for the book is almost fiendishly reluctant to lead us towards concrete conclusions. This is most evident in the ending. I was curious to see how many years Montimore would recount before inevitably having to wrap things up in a bow because of the linear limitations of a novel’s page count. Although I’m dissatisfied with the ending, let me offer up a disclaimer as well: I’m not sure there is a satisfactory way to end this book. I don’t think there is a neat bow that can be placed upon this story without ultimately making it too trite or contrived. This is one of those stories where the telling is far more interesting than the resolution. Still, there is a part of me out there that wonders what an older, more lived Oona must feel as she discovers that she never hops past a certain year. If she lives the year of her death, is that it? Or does she die, only to wake up on New Year’s of another year of her past? As you can see, there are many questions this book poses yet does not answer.In the end, it’s tempting to judge Montimore for distilling down Oona’s life to a love story, as she jumps back to the wonderful year in Europe she will have with the soon-to-be-deceased father of her child. Yet I think that’s a shallow reading of a very deep statement. For the book, up until that point, makes it clear that Oona lives and loves again beyond Dale. For her return to him to be the culmination of the story is not a return to her OTP, then, but a reward, in a way—to Oona, yes, but to the reader, who has long known that this moment must come yet never got to experience it. Montimore ends the book for us on the happiest of notes, for as I expressed above, there are darker questions lurking within this fantastical setup.Oona Out of Order is therefore a rich and complex piece of storytelling. It is science fiction that will doubtless masquerade as chick lit, which I am fine with, because chick lit is actually a damn good and complex genre in its own right—but for those of you who come to this book disdaining SF, I would urge you to stop and reconsider, for these are the books that truly power this genre. Beyond rocket ships and blasters, it’s the stories that ask us to consider the uniqueness of the human condition that truly propel us forward.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Disclaimer: I don’t think I read beyond Leviathan Wakes in The Expanse series, but maybe I’ll go back one day. For now, though, let’s talk about Age of Ash. Abraham sets us up to expect heists, recrimination, and plenty of intrigue. I would say that this book mostly delivers, though I could see how there is room for disappointment depending on the type of expectations one goes in with.Thanks to NetGalley and Orbit for the eARC!Kithamar is a city on the river. It was a meeting place, though now the two major ethnicities live mostly peaceably side by side. Ruled by a prince (the term is gender neutral in Kithamar), the city has its share of the poor and disadvantaged. Alys and Sammish both fall into this category. They grew up in Longhill, the poorest district. After Alys’s brother Darro dies mysteriously, Alys vows to discover who killed him and why. This leads her down a dangerous path, putting her in the employ of a man and a woman from Green Hill—the richest district—and stretching her morals to their limits. Meanwhile, Sammish’s unrequited love for Alys forces her to confront the dark currents that threaten to sweep up Alys in their wake. And the city of Kithamar does not slumber—it is completely, personally awake.It took me a while to get into Age of Ash (and a while longer to finish it, but for once that was entirely scheduling and nothing to do with the book!). The plot is a rather slow burn, and Abraham’s writing style is heavy on description. As a result, I was well over a fifth of the way into the book before I started seeing the bigger picture—but what a picture it is.The main plot might be the least interesting part, and it is still very good. I won’t go into much detail so as to avoid spoilers. Suffice it to say, there is a dark secret at the heart of the city and its leadership. But the people who maintain this secret have enemies who want to see them fall. Abraham implies that these people aren’t very good, but it’s also unclear if their fall would really be all that better than the system that currently exists.To be honest, though, I cared way more about what was happening to Alys and Sammish. The book starts off with Alys as the viewpoint protagonist. But she becomes an increasingly unsympathetic character, and Sammish more sympathetic, as the story goes on. This is a brilliant piece of storytelling on Abraham’s part. Alys’s obsession with holding on to the memory of her brother at first threatens to mould her into her brother—yet as Sammish points out later in the book, Alys actually goes much further. The changes are subtle and gradual enough that we can see Alys leaving behind her Longhill roots. We can also see her relationship with Sammish faltering.Never even friends, more colleagues, Alys and Sammish’s relationship is strained for most of this book. Again, I find myself praising Abraham’s decisions here. What could have been a very simple unrequited love story turns into something more nuanced. As Alys grows distant and more cutthroat, Sammish at first tries to convince herself that she doesn’t care. In reality, she cares quite a bit. And so their relationship goes through ups and downs as each learns more about the secret of Kithamar in their own time and own ways. I like that these two are at odds more than they are aligned, and that the book gradually pivots from being wholly Alys’s story to including Sammish too—I think a good argument might be made that Sammish is more the protagonist than Alys even.So much epic fantasy focuses on the princes of realms. He is present here, kind of, but the book is actually about the most invisible members of Kithamar society. That, too, is not new to fantasy at all—yet Abraham writes it in a way that feels very refreshing. Having read Age of Ash, I feel satiated, like I just had a full and delicious meal. I’m not exactly hungry for the next book, but I would read it just to see where Abraham goes with this world next.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Did you know that I host a Buffy rewatch podcast, Prophecy GThis year is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the premiere of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Did you know that I host a Buffy rewatch podcast, Prophecy Girls? So when this book came up on NetGalley, I jumped at getting an eARC—and I was also fortunate enough that Hachette sent  copies to myself and my podcast co-host for us to promote on our show. And what an easy book to promote: Evan Ross Katz’s writing is at turns informative, funny, and poignant. He combines his obvious love for Buffy with the interview access he has as a celebrity columnist to cover the show’s cultural impact and legacy—kind of like what Stephanie and I try to do on our podcast, but in book form!The book loosely follows a chronological structure, discussing first the movie and the genesis of the TV series, before moving swiftly through each season. There is also a chapter dedicated specifically to Joss Whedon and the allegations of abuse against him from Buffy cast members and others he has worked with since, along with a chapter about the musical episode, one that focuses on Sarah Michelle Gellar and her approach to playing Buffy, etc. The chapters are all fairly long and very comprehensive. The book as a whole never really coheres into a single message (beyond, perhaps, “I love Buffy”). Yet that doesn’t matter—I just took the book as a series of loosely connected essays, and it works well that way.Katz’s writing is on the extreme end of conversational. There’s a plethora of parentheticals, lots of personal connections to his own gay love of Buffy, and puns and jokes galore. This is probably my least favourite aspect of the book, but that might be a result of my personal bias towards more academic analysis anyway. Which is all to say that, unlike a lot of the “Buffy studies” books out there, this one is not one of those. It does have some serious thought behind it; it isn’t all light and fluffy. But the style and tone throughout are that of a gossip columnist, to good effect.Skeptical fans might question whether this book is necessary, whether it’s really just a money grab—and I would say no. Yes, there’s so much Buffy lore out there on the Internet from two and a half decades of interviews, message board posts, convention chats, etc. Many of the stories you hear Katz repeat here will be familiar to you, from the famous origin of Buffy as the subverted cheerleader trope to the show’s network move from WB to UPN for its final two seasons. But there was plenty that was new to me—and I will admit I’m not particularly plugged into the behind-the-scenes lore, but there are also plenty of new interviews that Katz did with the cast and crew. For example, there’s an uncomfortable and hilarious moment where Katz presses Nicholas Brendon to say one nice thing about David Boreanaz.Similarly, I know many are struggling to re-evaluate Buffy in light of the allegations around Joss Whedon. Steph and I plan to add our thoughts to this conversation in a bonus episode in the coming months. I really like how Katz handles it here. First, of course, he foregrounds what people like Charisma Carpenter and Ray Fisher actually said about Whedon’s behaviour—he prints Carpenter’s statement in full. Second, he covers multiple perspectives, quoting both fans who are more willing to separate Whedon from the show as well as others who feel like that isn’t possible. Indeed, perhaps one of the strongest arguments for the necessity of this book is that it clearly lays out what has been happening with Whedon and these allegations over the past five years—unless you’ve been paying close attention, especially on Instagram, you have probably missed some of it. Buffy fans who want to get caught up on these troubling allegations will benefit from how Katz explains it all here.At the end of the day, it shouldn’t come as a surprise though that this book wishes to firmly enshrine Buffy as one of the all-time great television series—and why shouldn’t it? I doubt that people who have never watched the series will enjoy Into Every Generation a Slayer Is Born. New viewers, if they don’t mind some spoilers, might find that this book helps them love the series even more as they start their journey. Nevertheless, the audience here is obviously the legion of Buffy fans hungry for new content twenty-five years later. That includes me.Informative? Yes. Makes you cry at certain points? Yes—bring tissues. Thoughtful? Also yes. It’s tempting to call this a “love letter to Buffy,” but that description of a book so clichéd these days, and it doesn’t really capture what Katz is doing here. Yes, he loves Buffy, but he’s really trying to understand why we love Buffy, and why we still love it twenty-five years and an entire wave of feminism later. If you’re wondering that … well, you’ll have to read the book to find out.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

She is also Kashrini, a species whose homeworld and culture have been nearly annihilated by her former faction—Pyrite—and now Rig does all she can to preserve any Kashrini artifacts she can get her hands on. Alas, Pyrite Intelligence has decided it needs to retrieve the schematics for nanotech weapons that Rig designed for them once upon a time. And they are not the only ones who would be interested in that power.The first thing you’re going to notice about Bluebird is the frequency of action sequences. Seriously, this book is jam-packed with them. We go barely a scene before someone picks a fight. That might be annoying in less-deft hands, but Pierlot makes it work. I’m not huge on action sequences because I don’t visualize as I read, yet I still enjoyed the majority of this novel simply because Pierlot is very good at describing what’s happening and why we should care. For that same reason, if you do visualize cinematic sequences, you are in luck.This novel reminds me of that genre of plucky science fiction I might associate with something like Titan A.E.. Rig just does not care about interstellar politics. She wants to do good, make some money, and be left alone to her own devices—and of course, spend time with the love of her life. You can almost feel her rolling her eyes at all the people who are trying to convince her of the importance of the faction conflict.Although Pierlot provides us with a general backstory for the origins of the factions, there is no continuity with our human history, aside from certain idioms that seem to have survived into this far future. The legends seem to imply that humans came to this galaxy from another (the Milky Way?), but their method of arrival resulted in their fracture into the three factions that have since messed it up for everyone else. Typical humanity, amirite? Again, some people might feel disappointed that this mythos is unexplained—and again, I say, it works well here. It’s the point, actually, because as Rig tries to explain to Ginka, no faction has the full story—not even the Nightbirds. It’s pointless to fight about something you can’t be certain about because you weren’t there.The third element that I really enjoyed was the relationship between Rig and June. I liked that there is clearly a lot of love and respect between them, but there is also some unresolved tension as a result of the vast differences in their lifestyles. There is an important conversation between June and Ginka early in the book, followed by a recapitulation between Rig and Ginka, that finally manifests as a tearful, heartfelt resolution between Rig and June. It feels organic, healthy, and it’s generally the type of lovely romance my aromantic self can really enjoy.If Bluebird has any flaws, it’s that some of the characters feel larger than life and a little cartoonish in their villainery. This is the case with Lord Umbra—I mean, the whole “Lord” thing is just the start of the problem, and let’s not even talk about how he wields a sword. The whole throwback imperial vibe of Ossuary didn’t work for me, but then again, neither did the nihilistic technophilia of Pyrite. Indeed, for all that I loved the protagonists and deuteragonists of this book, there isn’t really a formidable or compelling antagonist. As a result, Bluebird’s overarching plot suffers and sputters its way into its final act.Would I read another book in this universe? Yes, absolutely. Pierlot’s writing blends action seamlessly with careful character development, and the result is a type of compassionate science fiction I want more of in my library.But do you really want to know what I’d like to see? A Bluebird video game. I would love to be able to play as Rig, fly the Bluebird, chat with June and Ginka, and generally be cool while inadvertently saving the galaxy. This is a universe I would play in, because even when the stakes are high, what really matters is the human connection.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

On one hand, the description didn’t do a lot for me: it read like your fairly standard fantasy novel This book crossed my radar and I was ambivalent. On one hand, the description didn’t do a lot for me: it read like your fairly standard fantasy novel with the twist that the society is matriarchal rather than the mostly patriarchal ones we see. On the other hand, I was feeling some epic fantasy, and I wanted to see if Scorpica might pleasantly surprise me. You might say I am an optimist. Well, G.R. Macallister’s story has some intriguing parts to it, and her characters definitely very dynamic. Overall, though, the writing, characterization, and a lot of the worldbuilding choices just didn’t work for me.Thanks to Saga Press and NetGalley for the eARC.There are five queendoms: Paxim, Bastion, Sestia, Arca, and the eponymous Scorpica. Each queendom is known for certain traits and jobs; the Scorpicans are warriors. Each queendom is also matriarchal: there are matriclans, each one is ruled by a queen, and men in general have a lower standing in all five societies—for example, in Scorpica, only women can be warriors, and indeed, the nation actually sells their boy children to other kingdoms for a profit. Ok….I’m rather torn by Macallister’s depiction of a matriarchy here. Look, I get that it is important to show that women in positions of power can be just as awful as men—and that’s what’s on display here. The gender swap in this story is basically, “what if women were in charge and were just as awful and oppressive as men are in our world?” That doesn’t interest me, though—the whole deal with patriarchy is that it is a form of structural oppression that exists beyond any individual person; if you gender swap it into an oppressive matriarchy, you’re not making any specific comment on our society beyond maybe that power corrupts. I am far more interested in depictions of matriarchy that push the boundaries of our understanding of power, etc. And we have those in fantasy already—fantasy has arguably long had traditions of strong female characters, warriors or otherwise, breaking the mould of what it means to be a hero. Scorpica feels very disconnected from those traditions, however, very much like it thinks it is different and edgy and cool when in reality it’s a couple of decades too late.Similarly, the whole idea of nations that are so incredibly specialized just feels tapped out. We’ve done this before, over and over, and sometimes it leads down interesting avenues but it doesn’t seem to in this case. Even the title of the book is questionable given that a great deal of the action takes place in Paxim and Arca, and four or five of the main POV characters are Arcans. Beyond that, however, lies the main problem with this world: it’s boring.The cookiecutter nations are actually a symptom of a larger problem, which is a lack of depth to the entire world. This is evident in the way that Macallister has structured the story: every five years, the queens meet to perform ritual child sacrifices to the gods. In between, we get precious few details about what these queens do or indeed what’s going on in any of these nations. When we are with Jehenit and Eminel and the Rovers, we’re told they are travelling bandits in the otherwise generic land of Paxim. Tamura and her warriors train and fight and hunt and fuck, I guess. We’re told Arca is a nation of magic, that pretty much every woman has some kind of categorized gift—but we never really see what this means, never really understand what kind of culture this has created among the Arcans, aside from the small glimpse we get into Mirriam’s bloodthirsty games of palace intrigue.And then we come to the main plot: the Drought of Girls. The book starts with the last girl being born in a long time. Over a decade passes, and various nations start to get desperate, Scorpica most of all. I will give Macallister this: it’s a great setup to sow conflict among five peaceful countries, to be sure. Deprive them of a valuable resource, set them at each other’s throats. It’s not a bad plan by the Big Bad (and she would have gotten away with it too if it weren’t for those kids…). Again, though, despite the vast number of perspectives and the epic timescale of the novel, we see precious few examples of how the Drought affects day-to-day life in the queendoms aside from the existential worries it creates for some of the queens.Plus, of course, as a trans woman, this kind of gender-essentialist plotting and worldbuilding always makes me uncomfortable. To be fair, Macallister does explicitly signal the existence of genderqueer people in this world—there is an agender priest who uses they/them pronouns, and at one point the book acknowledges that some people are “neither man nor woman.” Nevertheless, that is pretty much “the bar is on the floor” kind of territory these days; acknowledgement doesn’t do much to fix the larger issue, which is that for the purposes of the story you’ve created, it’s just more convenient if we largely ignore and erase trans, non-binary, and genderqueer people. I can’t get behind that. If your story relies on us existing only in the margins, you are actively marginalizing us, and you should find a better story.My final critique is just that the writing itself didn’t work for me. This book is so heavily weighted towards tell over show. The omniscient narrator spends a lot of time explaining this world to us, instead of stepping back and letting the characters do so through dialogue and action. I suspect that’s what makes my observation earlier about the shallowness of the worldbuilding all the more poignant for me: it didn’t have to be that way. The writing style practically begs for a much deeper world to explain to the reader. Instead, it remains all surface-level stuff, and the dialogue between characters is … lacklustre at best.Now if you have read up until this point, you might think I hated Scorpica. Understandable. Truthfully, though, all these complaints aside … I still kind of liked it? There’s charm to it and a strange kind of appeal to the journeys of some of these characters. Macallister has some kind of interesting story here; it’s just never fully realized. Queen Mirriam of Arca, for example, has a fantastic journey that sees her verging into straight villain territory—yet it is squandered in a confrontation with the main antagonist, who herself feels defeated too easily at the climax of the book.I guess my verdict, then, is that Scorpica is kind of a hot mess of epic fantasy—but I respect that, because as I have said in the past, I prefer big swings and misses over books that don’t swing at all. I think there are a lot of problematic elements here, from the uncritical replication of oppressive power structures in a gender-swapped world to the erasure of trans people to the casual way children are sacrificed and sexualized (there’s a scene late in the novel where a girl who is maybe sixteen or seventeen years old has sex with a woman in her twenties—the timelines and ages of people are a little hard to follow, but it’s the kind of thing where if you start to think about it too much you’re like … oh). For these reasons, I find it difficult to recommend this book. At the same time, I can see what others might see in it. It was a pleasant diversion for a couple of days—but it didn’t get me excited, and in some ways, it left me cold.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Treasured: How Tutankhamun Shaped a Century promiseTo say that I windmill-slammed the request button on NetGalley for this book is an understatement. Treasured: How Tutankhamun Shaped a Century promised something very tantalizing: a look into a cultural phenomenon that took the world by storm a hundred years ago. Christina Riggs does not exaggerate when she talks about the “Tut-mania” that swept the world over and over throughout the twentieth century, literally inspiring so many people like her to become Egyptologists. Though it had no such enduring impact on me, I remember the requisite ancient Egypt unit in elementary school, the making of a papier-mâché mummy entombed in a shoebox sarcophagus painted like Tutankhamun’s famous funerary mask. So when I saw Public Affairs offering eARCs, yeah, it touched something deep within my psyche. “Let’s dive into this,” I thought, “and see what more I can learn.”Riggs weaves her own personal backstory throughout the book as she examines the discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb, the subsequent analyses of his tomb and body, and the way the objects of his tomb became an important part of Egypt’s export of its culture on tour for political and economic benefits. Much to my satisfaction, Riggs explicitly calls out the colonialist and imperialist forces that shaped everything about Tutankhamun’s treatment, from his discovery up to the present day. That was my main concern going in—that the book would be a little shallow and not engage with the colonial elephant in the room—and Riggs allayed it immediately.These are the science history books I truly appreciate: the ones that grapple with the darkness at the root of Western science’s often harmful history. We like to hold up science as a neutral process, but that is true only in the most abstract sense of the scientific method. The truth is that for the vast majority of the history of science, the scientists, the people involved, have often resorted to callous, careless, cruel experiments and methodology to get answers. In the case of Tutankhamun, the subject is millennia dead—but I don’t really see that making much of a difference. At the end of the day, this is the story of British archaeologists digging up the dead bodies of an ancient culture because they wanted to and had the power to make it happen. It’s gross.Riggs highlights this while also, quite appropriately I think, stressing that her discipline of Egyptology is not all mummies all the time. Indeed, while Tutankhamun might have been an inciting incident in her childhood that nudged her on this path, she recounts that it was a long time into her studies before she came face-to-face with an actual mummy. This is a good reminder that it is possible to study history in a less invasive way.So the chapters (which come later in the book) that focus on the physical examinations of Tutankhamun and the two fetal mummies found in his tomb were difficult but necessary to read. What of the earlier and later chapters, focusing on the tomb’s discovery and then Tutankhamun’s legacy for modern Egypt?The discovery chapters are fun to read because Riggs is helpful at unravelling the sensationalism and mythology that has built up over the years. She digs into the personalities of Howard Carter and Lord Carnavon, talking about Carter’s early life, his career in Egypt, and how he wasn’t quite the dashing archaeologist that his hometown back in England might like to portray him as being. It’s worth remembering, Riggs tells us, that archaeology in the early twentieth century was still very much crystallizing as a science, and many people saw it as much as a business opportunity as a scientific one. Again, the blatant, wholesale extraction of objects from Egyptian tombs to Britain, the United States, and other destinations feels so wrong—but as Riggs pointed out, it was seen as perfectly normal back then, a kind of salvage right built into the contracts between those digging and the fledgling antiquities ministry in Egypt.The legacy chapters, similarly, point to a complicated history of political tension between newly independent Egypt, its former colonizer, and the rest of the world. Tutankhamun at times becomes an olive branch and a rallying cry. He is Egypt; Egypt is him. (I really liked Riggs talking a little smack, carefully but ever so critically, of Zahi Hawass—if you have ever watched an ancient Egypt special on Discovery Channel, you know this guy. I don’t know much about him and have no skin in this game, but his absolute ubiquity as the go-to expert for all these shows made me skeptical, and it seems with good reason.) The detail that Riggs goes into helps us understand the monumental scale of undertaking an international tour of these artifacts.In a similar way, I appreciated how much time Riggs spends discussing the photography and archiving of photographs of Tutankhamun’s tomb and artifacts. She lingers on this to a point where some people might be critical of it, but I think it’s important. So much of what we see as young people is visual—is not Tutankhamun’s mask one of the most recognizable visual icons in our culture today? That is so because of the decades of photography that happened, from the discovery of the tomb all the way through its tours. Riggs explains how this was achieved with the technology of the time, as well as how two very determined women mounted an effort to catalogue and preserve the original negatives in a way that would prove useful for future generations. Science is not just the dramatic discovery: it is also the decades of hard work that follow by people, often who do not have fancy degrees, who spend their days organizing, administrating, and believing in the importance of what they do.Treasured is an intense, lively, and interesting read about this young king, the discovery of his tomb, and the sensation he sparked off a hundred years ago. It was satisfying, critical in the way I wanted but also inspiring. Would read more from Christina Riggs, and very well might.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Aside from that, A Brief History of Timekeeping: The Science of Marking Time, from Stonehenge to AtomiNot so sure about the brief part of this title. Aside from that, A Brief History of Timekeeping: The Science of Marking Time, from Stonehenge to Atomic Clocks indeed covers quite the range of timekeeping science and history—and you all know how much I love science books, and how much I love history books, so in case it isn’t clear, science history books are absolutely some of my favourite non-fiction. Applying to read this eARC from NetGalley and BenBella books was a no-brainer for me.Chad Orzel, physicist and science writer, leads us through the progressive history of timekeeping technology and the accompanying social constructions of time. This is the thesis of the book, namely that our socially constructed temporal needs drove the search for increasingly precise timekeeping, which in turn influenced our conception of time. This feedback loop led us from Neolithic tracking of the changing seasons to marine chronometers, quartz watches, and atomic clocks that keep time down to the picosecond. Orzel both explicates the physical qualities of timekeeping methods and explores the people and processes involved in inventing or discovering these methods.Some of the scientific explanations here can get quite intense. The book tries to separate the most intense and detailed parts of these explanations into sidebars (not that sidebars really … work … in an ebook). Nevertheless, even in the main part of the text, Orzel is assuming a fair amount of high school physics knowledge. I don’t think this is a downside, and even if, like me, a lot of that knowledge has atrophied for you, you will still be able to understand the gist of what Orzel is saying. Nevertheless, his explanations overall have reminded me of the sheer brilliance of the scientific method. The world we inhabit today exists not from the brilliance of individuals making profound leaps but rather from the persistence of experimenters, of craftspeople, of engineers and designers. The history of timekeeping is an iterative history, and when you think of it, so much of our technology is like that.As far as the history goes, I think there’s something in here that will be new for almost everyone. You might be familiar with a couple of the events Orzel mentions—for example, he covers John Harrison’s efforts to win the Admiralty Board’s Longitude Prize (and comes for my girl Dava Sobel’s version of the story in the process!), and this was something I’ve read about before. But I really liked his exploration of the intricate mathematical efforts of first-millennium CE monks to line up and fix the calendars. Again, I keep thinking about our modern society’s dependence on computers for speedy, complex calculations. In actuality, up until recently, any kind of complex calculation would take someone hours or even days, let alone the time needed for double-checking.This is part of the charm and power of A Brief History of Timekeeping. Like many a good science history, it helps me marvel in the wondrous nature of human innovation and inquiry. We went from hunting and gathering to agricultural revolutions all the way up to harnessing the power of the atom in order to measure our ever-changing definition of time … that’s just … wow. Yeah, this is a bit of a long read for something brief, but Orzel tells it well and in a way that makes every page worth it.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

It was such an original, interesting fantasy novel! So Duo M.A. Carrick’s The Mask of Mirrors was far-and-away one of my favourite books of 2021. It was such an original, interesting fantasy novel! So I pre-ordered The Liar’s Knot with much anticipation, though as usual I didn’t actually get to reading it until now! That delay did not dampen my excitement, nor did Carrick disappoint me. There is no second book syndrome here, folx.The Liar’s Knot picks up shortly after the end of the first book. Even so, the book provides a “the story so far” synopsis, and can I say that I want to see this more in fantasy series?? Bradley P. Beaulieu’s A Song of Shattered Sands series had a similar feature in its later books, and it is so helpful for forgetful readers like myself.Spoilers for the first book but not this one.We return to the cosmopolitan city of Nadežra. Ren, aka Renata, aka a couple of other aliases because she is a scammer (shock, gasp), has officially been adopted into House Traementis. Her nobility secured, Ren’s original plan to swindle the House has been sidetracked by inconvenient things like feelings and that whole “accidentally saving the city from devastation” that happened in the first book. At odds with recently-elevated noble and longtime crook Derossi Vargo, Ren finds herself growing uncomfortable close—in multiple personae—to Captain Grey Serrado. As much as she would like to reveal her true self to him and take comfort in another ethnically Vraszenian struggling to walk the line between loyalty to his people and preserving the peace of the city, Ren has other needs. For instance, she needs to understand why Azeraïs has apparently granted her the identity of the Black Rose in the form of the mask that she emerged with from Azeraïs’s Dream. She also knows that the enemies of House Traementis are still out there: a sickness suffuses Nadežra, and some will stop at nothing to seize power.So much of my praise for The Mask of Mirrors stands for this book as well. The characters are so rich, diverse in their identities and attitudes but also so well developed. I love how much change the main characters undergo in this book. In particular, Ren has to walk a fine line in how she presents her various personae to people like Grey, who himself has his own secrets. Carrick makes a very smart choice in this book by choosing to reveal some of Ren’s secrets sooner rather than later (but I won’t say to whom or how!). I say this is smart because I think the easier but less interesting choice would be to try to have Ren walk that tightrope far too long, at which point the reveal becomes anticlimactic. The way that Ren’s relationships with Vargo, Grey, Giuna, and Tanaquis evolve as events unfold is so dynamic. Carrick keeps the reader guessing but also delivers the drama we want and deserve.Likewise, the plot thickens. The Mask of Mirrors felt very much like a political fantasy novel. While The Liar’s Knot has elements of that, this story is more about personal connections to magic and to the city and its history. Unimportant events and remarks from the first book are revealed to be careful foreshadowing for the payoff in this book, once more confirming Carrick’s consummate skill. I also enjoy how all of the protagonists of the book ultimately want similar things, but their motivations are of course very different, and their methods are often at odds. This creates an excellent amount of conflict (and no small amount of humour as well) without throwing Ren into direct opposition with an antagonist too often.If I had to make any criticism—and I am loath to do so, I loved this book so much—it would be that the antagonists are ill-defined and vague for most of the book. Oh, their motives are clear enough, albeit a little pedestrian. The magical nature of the mystery is a lot of fun, but the desire for power and political gain isn’t much of a surprise. In the end, the bad guys are not what makes this book.Where The Liar’s Knot truly comes into its own, however, is the nature of Ren’s split identities. We see this through her own chapters but also through commentary from Grey, Vargo, and even Tess. Ren is no longer the street thief she grew up as. She has inhabited the persona of Renata so thoroughly that this is her life now—and unlike the first book, where that felt tenuous and short term, neither she nor Tess sees an endgame now. Is she going to be a noblewoman of House Traementis for the rest of her life, wearing imbued makeups to disguise her ethnicity, talking with an assumed accent, her sister forever her maid? Truly it’s a moving and moral dilemma that consumes Ren as much as the magical mystery of the plot consumes her, and it’s what kept me turning the page.The end of my edition contains a tantalizing sample from the next book. I usually don’t bother, but I snuck a peek and wow can I not wait!Kara love. Kara love a lot.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

It’s actually several concepts stacked on top of one another wearing a trenchcoat. In One Verse Multi, Sander Santiago plays with some of those concepts to create a universe-hopping mystery involving polyamorous love interests, evil corporate aspirations, and dramatic confrontations. I wasn’t sure what to expect when I started this book, and I don’t think I could have predicted what I got. I wish I had loved this book more, because it has so much to recommend it!Thanks to NetGalley and Bold Strokes Books for the eARC!Martin Logan King works for the Multi-verse Protection Corporation (MVP). Formerly a rift-closure tech, Martin has now joined a new research team formed by MVP to investigate a unique event. The team discovers in the course of their investigation that not all is as it seems at MVP, that the founders are up to some shady shit, and Martin in particular takes it upon himself to investigate further and take action. The fate of the entire multiverse hangs in the balance, but can Martin save it without sacrificing the two men he loves?Let’s talk about representation! One reason I wanted to love this book more than I did is because of how cleverly Santiago works in diverse representation. Santiago himself is a queer, trans BIPOC writer, and so he writes Martin’s character with a very authentic voice: Martin is a Black, gay trans man, and a significant part of the book is his self-discovery of polyamorous attraction as well. To be clear, I’m not praising One Verse Multi for the way it checks a lot of boxes—that’s not what matters to me when it comes to representation. It’s the quality that matters here, but I also wanted to remark upon the quantity of identities in play because intersections matter too. It matters that Martin is Black and trans, that he’s gay and polyamorous, etc. We can’t separate any one of these identities from the others.In general, I really liked Martin. I liked his straightforward attitude and bravery. He’s heroic but not in a bombastic sense; occasionally he overreaches (and regrets it), but in general he has a combination of charisma and cunning that gets him through. I like that he took the fight to the enemy, for reasons I will discuss below. This, combined with all his identities, is why we need more protagonists like this!In addition to Martin, there’s a non-binary characters and several other queer characters of various ethnicities. But perhaps even better than that is the supportive nature of the worldbuilding. Martin’s colleagues (aside from the bad guys) are endlessly supportive. Even when they disagree with him and argue, they always give him a chance to explain. Even the bad guys respect his identities; his queerness is never a source of jokes, slurs, insults, etc. It’s never up for comment. In this respect, One Verse Multi feels a lot like Star Trek: The Next Generation: the team is just vibing, and they don’t always see eye-to-eye, but they will trust each other’s judgment and listen.It’s so fucking wholesome and I love it.As you might know, I’m not a huge fan of romance, so I tend not to enjoy or comment on those subplots. For what it’s worth, I didn’t mind the romantic subplot here. I liked that it was polyamorous instead of a love triangle, and that it develops in a slow-burn-to-sudden-simmer kind of way. Santiago carefully hangs a lampshade on the stalker-like nature of Martin’s initial observations of Titus. Honestly, Titus and Lucas both seem like great guys, and I wish everyone all the best.So the characters in this books are fantastic and a lot of fun. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the plot. This was where One Verse Multi nearly lost me: it drags. A lot. I kept looking at the percentage read in my Kindle, wondering why the story was advancing so slowly. There is no sense of urgency to the pacing for the first part of the book. Once we get a better sense of who the antagonists are, that does change—and to be fair, there are certainly some dramatic and tense moments. Once Santiago gets to the action, he’s great at writing it. It just takes forever to get there!Similarly, the actual nature of the mystery was ho-hum to me. It boils down to predictable corporate greed, just enhanced with access to a multiverse. I don’t require that a mystery be totally unpredictable to me, but I do like to be a little surprised by the outcomes, and I didn’t get that here.So my overall verdict? One Verse Multi is one of the most wholesome and satisfying books I have read in a long time when it comes to the characters and romance. On this strength alone I would recommend it if that is what you are after. On the other hand, if you’re coming to this for an intense mystery, I’m less certain you’ll be satisfied.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Hairstyles can signal status—gender, affluence, class, or cultures. As Emma DHair is so personal to ourselves, yet in many ways it is also political. Hairstyles can signal status—gender, affluence, class, or cultures. As Emma Dabiri explores in Don’t Touch My Hair, this is particularly true for Black women. This book goes far deeper than I expected given its length; Dabiri fuses her personal experience growing up Black in Ireland and the United States with meticulous research. The latter takes us from enslaved people in the Americas to Yoruban culture and mathematics to the sprawling, technologically sophisticated cities of African empires. This book is about far more than hair; it is a story of culture and history as it is written on people’s bodies.As a white person who grew up in a city with a very small number of Black people, Black hair has never been something I have had much familiarity with or call to think about. Somewhere along the way, I learned about the controversial idea of Black people rocking “natural hair” instead of relaxed or straightened hair—but again, my racialization and upbringing meant that I really didn’t understand the internal politics of such decisions. Dabiri is really doing white people a favour when she discusses the history and weight of Black hairstyles, for she helps us understand how colonialism extended its control over Black bodies long past the formal end of slavery. In so doing, we go far beyond the simple eponymous admonishment and actually get to the root (pun intended) of our society’s misogynoir attitude towards Black women’s natural hair.Dabiri’s grounds her connections between colonialism and hairstyling in her Yoruba heritage, but I suspect similar stories exist from other African cultures. She relates what she has discovered about the role that hairstyling played in Yoruban life, from the status of travelling hairstylists to the way that one’s hairstyle could signal one’s social position, such as a messenger. Dabiri admits that taking care of natural Black hair is time-consuming, then goes on to say:The time it takes to do Afro hair is, quite frankly, the time it takes to do it. And it is in this fact that a very powerful truth is revealed. Our hair continues to be a space in which the fault lines between an imposed European system and black bodies’ resistance to that system are exposed and played out in real time. Our very bodies are positioned as seemingly at odds with the “British values” imposed by colonialism. As such they are subject to regulatory procedures.Truly in this paragraph Dabiri demonstrates why it is so necessary for white people like myself to continue, always, to read books about racism by Black people. It isn’t enough to stop at “ok, don’t touch Black people’s hair without asking, and don’t ask to touch a Black person’s hair.” That’s merely being not racist. If one wants to be antiracist, one needs to go deeper than mere behaviours and actually understand the connection between Black hair and the forces that maintain racist oppression. That’s what Dabiri does in the above paragraph and throughout this book, and it is why no white person will ever be an expert on anti-Black racism no matter how many of these books we read.But one of the benefits of reading to learn more about being antiracist is that it also encourages me to think about how white supremacy, while not oppressing me, also forces me into certain patterns of behaviour. Reading this book inspired me to reflect on how my relationship with my own hair has changed over the past few years, mostly as a result of my transition. Since that isn’t relevant to my thoughts on this book, I turned that reflection into a companion blog post that you can read if you are interested in my thoughts.Beyond the antiracist education made available in Don’t Touch My Hair, there is just a wealth of cultural and personal knowledge that Dabiri shares. I was not expecting the final chapter to be all about mathematics! It was with such delight that I read Dabiri’s account of research done by white ethnomathematician Ron Eglash. In this way she summarizes how, historically, Yoruban and other African cultures have used hair as a way to describe mathematical knowledge, such as fractals, long before these concepts were laid out in writing by European mathematicians. We often give a tip of our hat in mathematics to the contributions of “Islamic mathematicians” while forgetting that a large portion of Muslims were, indeed, Black Africans. This erasure is, in and of itself, a form of racist revisionist history wherein even as we re-admit Islamic contributions into science and mathematics, we whitewash Islamic scientists and mathematicians just enough that they become palatable to Eurocentric stories of these disciplines.Dabiri’s point? African people have always participated in scientific and mathematical discovery and innovation long before Europeans showed up in Africa, looked around, and promised to deliver “civilization” by railway at gunpoint. Moreover, African people did this through complex, three-dimensional ways of storytelling, from the construction of their cities and weaving of their clothes to the styling of their hair.Highly recommend this book to a wide audience, particularly for white people like myself. It isn’t too long, it is rigorously cited, and it is packed full of important ideas and information. Dabiri’s writing challenges you, pushes you to consider your own complicity in these systems, and exposes wide without recourse the ways in which white supremacy continue to oppress Black bodies despite supposedly centuries of freedom. It’s time to change that.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

The poem “they’re your real family” really stuck out for me, reading it as I did on my ride or die’s birthday and thinking about all that both of us have been through in recent years:sharing the same family tree doesn’t often make people stay. find family in the ones who make you laugh uncontrollably. find family in the ones who take your side but also talk you through your wrongdoings. find family in the ones who would hop on a plane & fly across countries the moment you needed them. find family in the ones who rejoice in you. especially when you’re unsure of yourself. find the ones who will face the fire with you.This is how I feel about my two best friends. This is what I love about lovelace’s poetry—even when the majority of the topics are not things I have direct experience with, there are always a few poems that hit me right in the heart. to drink coffee with a ghost is no exception in this regard.I guess what I have learned, then, from the last few years of reading lovelace’s poems is the kind of poetry that works for me. As I often reflect upon in these s, poetry in general doesn’t appeal. But maybe for me a poem needs a few things: deceptive simplicity, emotional connection, and topics that deal with matters of the human heart—but not just romance. I think I am finally starting to understand why poetry can help someone heal.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

I definitely need to read more books about disability. Sitting Pretty is part memoir, parThis book was recommended to me by my French friend Emeline! I definitely need to read more books about disability. Sitting Pretty is part memoir, part educational polemic about the need for our society to shift how we view and act upon disability. It is heartfelt, humorous, but also really affecting. Rebekah Taussig makes so many good points through both her personal experiences and her research into the academic study of disability. While she cannot speak for all disabled people—and she acknowledges the privilege that her other identities and social position provides her—Taussig ultimately provides a very necessary reminder that if we are going to treat disabled people as human, we have so much further to go.Very early in the book, Taussig rightly identifies that disability is a very contextual identity located in one’s time and place in society. She uses an example I am very familiar with: glasses. I need glasses to see anything that is farther away than about 15 cm with anything approaching fidelity. Yet I don’t consider myself disabled, because there is an unremarkable and fairly accessible prosthesis (prescription glasses) that compensate for my impairment. A couple of centuries ago, it would be hard-to-impossible for me to do many of my current jobs or hobbies. So our idea of disability shifts over time. Similarly, Taussig points out that each of us as individuals will experience disability in various ways—two years ago, I broke my elbow. I was in a cast for weeks, physiotherapy for months, and to this day I cannot fully rotate my left wrist the way I could prior to the break. Yet because this results in fairly minor impairment, I don’t call myself disabled, and it’s doubtful others would see this as a disability either. But I and everyone who lives long enough will eventually enter the category of disabled person, simply because bodies wear out, even as our society’s expectations of our bodies do not.Taussig discusses how disability affects various aspects of her life, from employment to her relationships. I wasn’t surprised to hear about her struggles with getting housing and employment while on Medicare—I knew that a lot of disabled people have to avoid getting married or taking a higher-paid job because they will lose health benefits they depend on. In Taussig’s case, she ended up marrying her high school sweetheart more because it was convenient, and he had health benefits that would extend to her, than because of love or mutual respect. It’s both saddening and maddening that these structures in our society put disabled people (particularly disabled women) into situations where they might have to choose between marrying (or not marrying) someone or keeping their benefits. But there was plenty in this book that I didn’t know, and in general, ameliorating such ignorance is an important reason that abled people need to read this book: we need to stop assuming we know what is best for disability advocacy. “Install a ramp” is not going to fix every problem (or even many), and banning plastic straws is not going to save the environment but it does present a problem for a lot of disabled people.The chapter where Taussig discusses teaching a high school class about disability studies resonated so much with me as a teacher. Taussig describes her discomfort over referencing herself in discussions (something I feel when discussing trans issues with my class). Moreover, she describes the resistance she encountered in the likes of “Adam”:“If we were reading stories about the experiences of Indigenous people in this country, would you feel more invested?”“No, not really,” he says. Wow, this kid has no shame.“The experiences of women?” I ask.“Well, yeah. I’d care about that.”“Why?”“Women are a part of my life,” he says.Okay, is this kid messing with me now? Or is he doing these gymnastics in his own brain? He’s working so hard to pretend that disabled people aren’t a part of his world—could never be a part of his world—while he literally has a disabled woman for a teacher making direct eye contact with him at this very moment. I’ve never seen anyone work so hard to not care.This exchange reminded me of the famous Huffington Post article “I Don't Know How To Explain To You That You Should Care About Other People”. Adam is refusing to open his mind to the experiences of disabled people because he thinks it isn’t relevant to his life. Not only is this incorrect in several ways, as Taussig points out, but it’s a disturbing level of apathy that we see repeating across social issues. We see rich people not caring about the poor, people who live outside areas affected by wildfires or rising sea levels not caring as much about the effects of climate change, etc. The neoliberal promotion of a rugged, individualistic lifestyle has eroded our sense of community, and it hurts disabled people and other marginalized groups.Indeed, what I appreciated most about Sitting Pretty is the fact that Taussig locates disability as a social problem (rather than a medical one) and points out that accommodations are not enough:The very notion of “special accommodations” relies on the belief that really, there are only a few who don’t slip easily into the narrow mold of a nine-to-five schedule, five days a week (clock in! clock out!), getting “sick” only a specific number of times each year, recovering from giving birth and being ready to separate from a newborn baby in a predetermined set of days.Instead, Taussig says, we need to rethink how we design our society—not just accessible spaces, but go beyond that to think about the social conventions we currently take as normal. (There are connections to be made here to colonialism that Taussig doesn’t have the space or scope for, but I want to point out that part of the origin of the “nine-to-five” lies in the British state’s need to transform farmers into factory workers as part of its far-reaching imperial project. People from non-white cultures are often judged more harshly for not conforming to our society’s ideas about rigorous timekeeping and punctuality.)She goes on to say:But I believe this Full-Time Working Adult system punishes many more bodies than just mine—bodies in pain, bodies swaddled in depression and anxiety, bodies that get pregnant, need to breastfeed, have periods, get cramps and headaches, bodies that move and process slower than others, have different eating rhythms, need naps, breaks, longer toilet times, more inclusive toilet spaces—and so the list unfurls.This is why disability activism cannot be successful unless it is anti-capitalist. Accommodations are not enough. Accessibility is not enough. We need to challenge the unsustainable system that is capitalism. I am so on board with this.Finally, I want to make a connection between some of Taussig’s commentary and my experience as a trans woman. Now, I’m not saying that being trans is the same, in any way, as being disabled (and there are plenty of disabled trans women out there, of course, who can speak more to the intersections of their experiences than I can). Nevertheless, in her chapter on feminism, Taussig remarks:But when it comes to fitting in with the group? Sharing the memories and feelings and quintessential plights that are said to belong to all women? The fears and joys that bind “us women” together? I often don’t relate.Mmm, I feel that. As a trans woman, I do not always share the experiences we stereotypically associate with womanhood (or even white womanhood). So what I take away from this is that, just as cis women need to really look hard their internalized cissexism and cis privilege, it behoves us abled women to look hard at our ableism and how our internalized ideas of disability/ability affect how we include or exclude disabled women from spaces.Sitting Pretty is careful and caring, and I really, really think that abled people need to read this (and more books like this) so that we challenge ourselves. As Taussig makes very clear, this is not just about changing how we behave towards individual disabled people, nor is it about making better accommodations that allow disabled people to participate more fully in the rat race that is our capitalist life. Instead, we need to rethink our perspective on ability and disability entirely and build systems and expectations that work for all types of bodies and minds.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.

Fortunately, A Closed and Common Orbit is advertised as a “standalone sequel” and definitely fits that bill. You can read this without having read The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (though why would you want to skip that?). Indeed, I had largely forgotten the events in that book that resulted in Lovelace’s embodiment and departure from her ship. So I kind of came to this book with fresh eyes. Nevertheless, Becky Chambers remains a delightful writer who embraces using science fiction to tell very human stories, even when her characters are alien.The Lovelace AI that now has a stealth android body chooses the name Sidra. She accompanies Pepper to Port Coriol, a cosmopolitan planet where Pepper lives with an artist named Blue. The three of them form a kind of family unit, with Sidra living with Pepper and Blue and working, at least for now, with Pepper at her tech mod shop. Meanwhile, Sidra struggles to deal with the limitations and expectations of embodiment, from not being constantly connected to the linkings to making new friends. The story alternates chapters between Sidra’s new life and telling the backstory of Pepper, who was born Jane 23 on a planet that used genetically-engineered children for menial labour.Almost immediately what I noticed about this book is the care Chambers puts into how she describes Sidra’s embodiment. When describing how Sidra moves, it’s never “I moved my arm.” It’s “I moved the kit’s arm.” Sidra sees her body as the kit, as something separate from her identity. This is an entirely understandable reaction, and I love how Chambers manifests it on the page for us. In the same way, some of the moments where Sidra tries embodied experiences—like eating or drinking—for the first time are gratifyingly amusing, but they are also always portrayed with a kind of sympathy as well. Sidra’s embodiment has humorous aspects to it, but she is never intended to be the butt of the story’s jokes.The parallel story of Pepper’s past is equally as fascinating to me. Imagine growing up so completely isolated—when Jane 23 escapes from the factory where she works and lives, she is utterly alone except for the companionship of a somewhat limited shuttle AI. I love how Chambers describes their relationship and how it changes as Jane grows into a moody adolescent. The inclusion of the children’s sim that Jane can access (albeit only a single episode) is a really nice touch that helps define this world even more.I know some readers are going to be disappointed that this book departs so cleanly from the characters of the first book. That’s valid. Nevertheless, I admire Chambers’s decision to do this. Sometimes the story you need to tell is disconnected from the story you were first telling. I honestly didn’t get too attached to any of the characters from the first book or to the overall story that was being told—as I described it in my , it was like talking to a bunch of video game NPCs. If anything, the way this book focuses slightly more on Sidra (and then to some extent on Pepper) is an improvement.Above all else, what I enjoyed about this book was the primacy of friendship. Chambers has created a world that is open and fluid in its embrace of sexuality and gender overall, and that is wonderful. This book, in turn, adds a layer to that with the friendships among Pepper, Blue, Sidra, and Tak. Chambers highlights the importance of consent even within a friendship, along with the importance of boundaries and the value of forgiveness. As an aromantic person, I truly appreciate adult books that focus on friendship and treat it with the same respect and importance that romance plays in some people’s lives.I’ll finish with a note of frustration regarding the brevity of each chapter. Combined with the switch back and forth from Sidra to Jane 23’s stories, this made it very difficult to put down the book and go to bed! Each time the chapter finished, I would want to know what happens next, so I would have to read a chapter from the other narrative and then get into the next chapter from this one, only for it to be far too short … well, I guess this is a good problem to have.Will I read the next book? Sure. But much like the name of this series, I find myself not in a rush—in the best possible way. I will come to the next book when I am ready for it, when I need it, not out of a sense of obligation or completeness. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here, from Chambers’s storytelling style, for readers like myself—to accept our wayfaring habits, to enjoy the journey of reading series haphazardly, rather than to push back and impose a sense of completionism that doesn’t end up serving us in any way.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my s and subscribe to my newsletter.
