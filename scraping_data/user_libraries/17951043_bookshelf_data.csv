At first I wasn’t sure where this story was going, but glad I stuck with it. It seemed like Jill was making a lot of excuses for her family and mis-assigning blame for some family problems. But I was glad:1. Jill found a man like Derick to marry who has been bedrock for her and helped her navigate her complicated family life. He seems so grounded and unafraid to be an advocate for his wife. 2. They found a therapist who was able to help them grow as individuals, a couple, as a family. I think there’s still an unfortunate stigma about reaching out to ask help from a professional and with Jill’s background not to talk outside the family, it took a lot of courage and I applaud her for that. Jill wants to maintain a family connection which seems a good idea since that is such an important value for her, (with the caveat of creating clear boundaries).

Books and plants seem to combine so naturally for so many people. Maybe it’s because they are somewhat solitary activities which encourage introversion and self-reflection? Anyway, there’s a fabulous new book at the library: The Writer’s Garden, since apparently, there’s a connection between authors and gardening as well. A chapter is devoted to more than twenty authors, such as Roald Dahl, Agatha Christie, Ernest Hemingway, and Virginia Wolfe. We learn about their gardens and grounds, and gain an understanding how it may have influenced their thinking and inspired their writing.  Sometimes there’s a direct link between the author and the book. Jane Austin’s time in brother’s elegant Park Estate surely influenced garden themes in Pride and Prejudice and Mansfield Park. Other garden influences are more oblique. For example, Karen Blixen shares her passion for the beauty of nature in her book Out of Africa, based on her time spent in Kenya. So, it’s not surprising that her gardens in her native Denmark reflected an understanding of the importance of creating natural habitats and biodiversity remarkably advanced for her time. I was thrilled with the chapter on Frances Hodgson Burnett. I can’t be the only one who felt The Secret Garden was written just for her. Burnett spent nearly a decade at Great Matham Hall gardening and writing. She planted more than 300 rose bushes, some which meandered up fruit trees she insisted be reclaimed. We read, “She set up a table and a chair under the trees and wrote every morning-accompanied by a tame robin that would later make an appearance in The Secret Garden”. Be still my swelling heart! Visiting and website information for all the author’s gardens are noted in the appendix which are often located in the UK. (What is it about English gardeners and writers?!)
