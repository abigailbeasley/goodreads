The author argues that ""the difference betAlthough a pretty good memoir, for me, What My Bones Know didn’t add anything to the understanding of PTSD. The author argues that ""the difference between regular PTSD and complex PTSD is that traditional PTSD is often associated with a moment of trauma. Sufferers of complex PTSD have undergone continual abuse—trauma that has occurred over a long period of time, over the course of years. Child abuse is a common cause of cPTSD."" #1 PTSD is complex. Period. No added c needed. #2 Child abuse is also a common cause of “regular” PTSD. #3 Although it can happen—depending on the severity of the event, a brief “moment” of trauma doesn’t usually result in PTSD. So the author’s distinction is lost on me. It’s kinda’ like how the title of this book What My Bones Know seems eerily similar to The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk—the pioneering researcher into how overwhelming experiences affect the brain and the body, i.e., PTSD—and who the author cites frequently even after criticizing him. Despite my criticisms, there were definitely insights by Foo that I appreciated. For example, one-size-fits-all treatments for PTSD (with the c or without) are BS. When it comes to PTSD, there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach. Yet! [Fingers crossed that the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy trial by MAPS will give the world a cure.] In the meantime, the available treatments—which do work for some, but not others—can be quite expensive, therefore not accessible to many. When it comes to mental health, insurance sucks! Also, some of her thoughts resonated deeply:""Hatred, I learned quickly, was the antidote to sadness. It was the only safe feeling. Hatred does not make you cry at school. It isn’t vulnerable. Hatred is efficient. It does not grovel. It is pure power.""

I’ve frequently pondered this idea and concluded there is probably some truth to it. After reading Lucy by the Sea, I’m sincerely hoping that it is not true, because I did not like Lucy Barton very much. I found her to be sanctimonious and judgmental and tedious.
