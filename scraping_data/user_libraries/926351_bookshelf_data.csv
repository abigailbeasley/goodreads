I have read a lot of con artist novels over the years, but this 2018 backlist selection is my new favorite. Published in 2018, Book Gang Podcast guest Julia Whelan was the audiobook narrator for this novel and praised it as a fantastic under-the-radar selection that she wishes more people would read. The concept is such a clever one. Magician Natalie Webb, once a rising star in the world of card tricks, is now a washed-up has-been at twenty-seven. After a gig goes horribly wrong, she finds herself in financial debt due to an impending lawsuit. She takes on a freelance writing assignment to give an insider look at the art of cheating at cards to make ends meet. But when she becomes enveloped in the world of a mesmerizing cardshark, her journalistic endeavor becomes a personal test. She makes a dangerous proposition with the player to execute a $1.5 million magic trick that could change her fate forever.I selected this book not only to discuss Kardos's research on card tricks but also because it delivered some of the best plot twists I've read this year. Each time I thought I had gotten to the bottom of the story, Kardos threw in one more wrench. The characters aren't the only ones with a well-thought sleight of hand; the author delivers, too. Equal parts thriller and mystery, I recommend that you listen to this on audiobook! While the paper copy offers some fun handwritten notes, Whelan's performance is captivating and enhances this selection greatly. I will be surprised if it doesn't become one of your favorites of the year. I'm so grateful to Julia Whelan for this recommendation, which has been an enormous hit with our readers. Michael Kardos is so genuine and enthusiastic about his storytelling that I can't recommend his appearance enough if you choose his thriller for your book club. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Jan 19, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36452743-bluff

A former NASA engineer, Nina Simon, wrote this debut mystery with her mom while undergoing cancer treatment to pass their time together. When Nina's mother battled stage 4 cancer in late 2020, it prompted her to leave her CEO position and care for her. Amidst the challenges, Nina and her mother found solace in their shared love for murder mysteries, leading them to write a mystery book of their own to keep them busy during their long days in the hospital room. I loved hearing about the therapeutic power of creativity, courage, and resilience that emerged through the act of storytelling that bonded Nina and her mother during this challenging period.  This heartwarming family drama within a mystery introduces readers to an unlikely trio of amateur sleuths—a spirited grandmother, a determined single mother, and a curious teenage girl—bonding together to unravel a perplexing murder. Lana Rubicon, a powerful real estate magnate accustomed to the bustling life of Los Angeles, finds her world shattered by a cancer diagnosis. She must move to a sleepy coastal town with her estranged daughter Beth and granddaughter Jack as she finds her life at a standstill.However, their life takes a sharp turn when Jack stumbles upon a lifeless body during a kayaking excursion. Suddenly entangled in a murder investigation, the three generations of Rubicon women embark on a little amateur sleuthing as they discover Jack is the main suspect in the investigation. This novel will satisfy slow-burn mystery readers who appreciate the setting as much as they do their characters. She writes the characters distinctly and depicts a beautiful ending for these three women. I can admit, though, that what really enhanced this book was hearing about Nina's publishing journey and how this project gave her and her mother something to do in their darkest moments. Nina's joy is infectious, and I can't wait to see what she writes next. Patrons can enjoy a spoiler-filled episode with Nina to discuss the revealed killer and what Nina wanted to achieve with her ending.

A teen girl in a stretched-out swimsuit is working her shift as a lifeguard at her community pool. As the strap to her swimsuit falls, it catches the eye of a father who has forgotten to keep an eye on his child. At this moment, his daughter begins to drown in the middle of the pool, and the fearless lifeguard, Lorraine, dives in to save her. It is as though Church is setting the scene for her reader that girls must protect themselves. If you haven't heard of The Baby Scoop Era, this period, roughly from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, is when many unmarried pregnant women were often coerced, pressured, or forced to relinquish their babies for adoption. As widespread social stigma was attached to unwed mothers, many saw adoption as a more socially acceptable outcome than single motherhood. This page-turner story, set in the 1960s, examines this era with fresh eyes as Lorraine, a gifted teen girl, navigates an unexpected pregnancy during her senior year of high school. Curious and bright, she has aspirations to be an astronaut one day. We are reminded in evocative detail of these dreams for her future as she looks to the sky and imagines a different life for herself as a very different story unfolds on the page. When Lorraine discovers the pregnancy, she receives little information about what is happening in her body or the process. Instead, sent to a maternity home for teen girls, the parents pray that no one will ever know of her shameful secret. Lorraine's shame is palatable, but for the boy involved, this is barely a blip in his promising future. As societal expectations and familial pressures ground Lorraine, Church examines the underbelly of perfect picket fences and suburban dreams. We then realize everyone has a shameful secret that could have grounded them at some point. While these women's experiences varied widely during this time, many throughout this era faced isolation, shame, and psychological distress as they navigated the process of pregnancy, childbirth, and relinquishment. Church deeply humanizes this experience like few books have, with a raw and unfiltered lens through the eyes of a teen girl with few choices. Well-crafted plot twists and shifting narration add to well-timed tension on every page. This historical fiction novel is another tour de force that showcases the author's magnificent lens at, once again, showcasing the harrowing and untold stories of girls that we need to read.

I'm so thankful for the podcast preparation that brought me to this incredible book discovery. While Molly Fader may be a new writer to me, she is well-known as the award-winning author of more than 40 romance novels under the pennames Molly O'Keefe and M. O'Keefe.Inspired by Fader's mother's career in nursing, this novel delves into the layers of tender and enduring bonds of friendship set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, with rich dual timelines that offer glimpses into magnificent Hollywood settings.The story begins in Greensboro, Iowa, with the funeral of BettyKay Beecher, a beloved nurse, and mother. Her daughters, Clara and Abby, are reunited for the somber occasion, but tensions arise as the two sisters could not be more different in their lives and approach to wrapping up their mother's estate. However, things take an unexpected turn when Kitty Deveraux, a famous Hollywood actress, appears at the funeral and places an unusual pink button in the coffin. Intrigued, Clara and Abby, invite Kitty to their mother's home, where she reveals that she knew BettyKay and their ""Aunt Jenny"" from their time as nursing students. The two odd-couple roommates had formed a fast comradery with Jenny, one of the few Black women in their nursing school program, a friendship that endured for many years. The thing is, her daughters have never known of their friendship with Kitty or of her secret past life, and Jenny does not seem pleased by Kitty's sudden appearance. So as Kitty regales them with stories from the three friends' past, Clara and Abby learn surprising things about their mother that they never knew. The flashback sequences are told partially through their mother's journal entries and partially through Kitty's rich memories. Fader's writing shines as she vividly portrays the bond between BettyKay, Jenny, and Kitty during their nursing school years, depicting the challenges they faced and the unwavering support they provided to each other.I have learned some of my best history lessons through books like these, and exploring what it would be like to be a frontline nurse and how women were treated in the early days of these nursing programs was eye-opening.Fader's own inspiration from her mother's stories about nursing school in Iowa in the 1960s is palpable, adding depth and authenticity to the characters and their relationships. In addition, the pink button laid within the coffin has a hilariously rich history that brings charm and warmth to the story, shared in her author's note.The Sunshine Girls is a fast page-turner recommended for fans of The Seven Lives of Evelyn Hugo or Did You Hear About Kitty Karr?. It is the kind of book you can read in a day and immediately begin recommending it to your friends and family if you are anything like me.

This book is my first novel from Wendy Heard, but it won't be my last. In this popcorn thriller, best friends Summer and Leo have each other's backs through thick and thin but face one of their greatest challenges together. Summer, an expert pickpocketer, takes Leo, a young woman living on the streets, under her wing, and together they plan a con that quickly spirals out of control. These two skilled grifters set their skilled sights on a billionaire named Michael but find themselves in danger when they discover their mark isn't who he seems to be. When Leo disappears, Summer takes matters into her own hands and infiltrates Michael's private island to find her friend. But with no sign of Leo and no way off the island, Summer begins to suspect that she may have met her match in this page-turning story.The story, told from alternating perspectives, also builds smart backstories and motives for both Summer and Leo as the two try to find one another again. Heard weaves in these flashback sequences seamlessly, helping to build tension, suspense, and connection through these timelines.Her writing shines in her grifting sequences, and many passages seem borrowed from Epstein's island, and the horrifying ways women were lured and held there.

If you ever wondered what it might feel like to be in a body like this, you only have to look at the detailed account in this fantasy novel to realize just how challenging life would be. To any reader that has left negative feedback on how these situations would never happen, I encourage you to learn more about the condition. Violet's condition affects her bones and ligaments, causing chronic pain, subluxation, and dislocation throughout her training and battles. Yarros is, essentially, giving us a peek at what she and four of her children deal with daily with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. I immediately recognized it as she used scenarios from my daily life and my children's daily life in her story. It was a bewildering and fantastic experience to read about myself on a page and then imagine a world where I'm strong enough to fight in battle. The modifications made for Violet's life in battle, from her coat of armor that holds her together to the unusual saddle that helps support her body when she can't stay upright on the dragon, were perfectly crafted. Those helpers are examples of things that people with EDS have to search for every day, from binding your body to keep ribs in place to having bones reset back in place weekly (sometimes daily) to simply the challenge of sitting upright- essentially preparing for war every day of our lives in our bodies. Representation matters, and anyone who has ever seen themselves described in a book can only say that it is surreal, validating, and fully immersive. I hope this begins many conversations and awareness around Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. I also hope readers will be compassionately curious to learn more and empathetic to the challenges people with EDS face daily....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Jun 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61431922-fourth-wing

Thank you to Sourcebooks for this  copy for our show.*******Adele Griffin's adult fiction debut showcases her seasoned expertise as a two-time National Book Award finalist, compellingly exploring the intricate dynamics of surrogacy within the contrasting lives of two women on very different wealth spectrums. Nora is one of the best in the business for curating vintage fashion finds for her clients. Despite her personally rewarding job, she is battling a hidden struggle of overwhelming debt and infertility. However, her life turns unexpectedly when a Manhattan socialite, Evelyn Elliot, enters the picture. When Evelyn enters her shop, she quickly escalates her as her personal assistant for curating the perfect tablescapes and party looks for the mysterious world of Manhattan's elite. Guided through the journey by Evelyn’s charismatic yet unpredictable ways, she is shocked when the woman offers her the ultimate favor- be her surrogate. It’s an unusual transaction, especially given Evelyn’s socialite status. As Evelyn's pregnancy progresses, she offers her own hashtag ( #compassionatesurrogate), giving her followers every detail of her pregnancy. With no actual contract between the two women, Nora makes a decision that could ultimately threaten their shaky relationship as she navigates a world she doesn’t understand.With its fashion-forward backdrop and nuanced exploration of the path to modern motherhood, this novel held me captive from beginning to end.Griffin's care for this mother’s story was beautifully crafted, solidifying this as a potential contender for next year's book club. Readers, please exercise caution if you have struggled with infertility, but know that you may also find a kindred spirit in Nora’s journey.As I've just wrapped up recording the interview for this podcast, I can assure you this story is both profoundly personal AND that she shared that she wanted it to be packaged as ""light as meringue"" for the reader.

Rounded up from 4.25! ****Fiona Davis is best known for her historical fiction novels, which explore the history (and mystery) behind some of New York City's most well-known landmarks. I’ve read many of her books and can confidently say this is her best book yet.In this dual timeline story, we meet Marion, a nineteen-year-old whose thrilled when she lands a spot in the Rockettes, even if her father isn’t. Davis takes us on a journey not just behind-the-scenes of the grueling dance life but imagines a dancer that is such a showstopper that she fails to blend into the dance ensemble. However, amidst the glamour and grueling routines, the “Big Apple Bomber” is on the loose, and Marion tragically becomes entangled. The bomber has been relentlessly planting explosives all over New York, even where Marion performs.As the police turn to psychological profiling for the first time, Marion finds herself drawn into the investigation with an unlikely man tied to the case, and she must decide if catching the bomber is worth risking everything she holds dear, including her hard-earned dreams and the safety of her loved ones.Most people are unfamiliar with the true story of this bomber. Davis was surprised to uncover the details herself, bringing an astounding amount of research to this story along with beautiful historical elements to those beginning days of the Rockettes. What she does well is making this easy-to-digest so the reader is never too bogged down with the details.Davis also excels at writing captivating dance sequences with perfectly captured frenetic energy. The true showstopper to this story isn't just Marion's earlier life; it is how she weaves a surprisingly personal and profound ending for her life that beautifully connects these two timelines. It was so satisfying and moving that I encourage readers to have a box of tissues accessible for a good cry after you finish it. I'm thrilled that Fiona will join us to discuss this book in our summer author series. I plan to request a short spoiler-filled conversation for our Patreon to discuss the ending of this book.

However, you may not know he is also a gifted memoir writer with four memoirs.I selected this for the summer season because it is the kind of book you can read in a single day and set around the game of baseball. What a perfect summer selection!Wade's story begins as a queer kid who grew up in a conservative Ozarks community. He and his father could not be more different, and his father is both brutally unaccepting and disapproving of Wade. It isn't just his sexual identity that baffles his father. His creative endeavors, writing career, and political leanings also confuse him.Despite their differences, they do find common ground in one thing: baseball! Rouse shares the most moving portrait of father and son as they use this sport as glue to bind them when they can never see eye-to-eye.Rouse also tackles the complex terrain of parenting an older parent when you have grown up in a challenging relationship. His grace for his dad and ability to find commonality in polarizing times make this an essential read for ANY reader. How do we find common ground when we feel so differently?I can't recall a more moving memoir of father and son than this one. It left me in a puddle, and I marveled how Rouse could pull in a reader like me who couldn't care a bit about the game of baseball to be wholly enveloped in their shared love of the sport.Spending an hour with Wade in our Patreon Book Club Author Series was an honor- it has been my favorite interview so far this year.

We discuss The Best Debuts of 2023 (So Far) on our show this week.***I have followed Thao Thai's essays for years, and how she captures motherhood on a page, speaking to the complicated journey of ""good mothers,"" gives the nod to our secret selves that we hold at a distance through that season.Set against the stunning backdrop of Vietnam and Florida, Banyan Moon will be one of your favorite reads this year- it left me breathless and highlighting passages throughout the story.This emotional debut novel follows three generations of Vietnamese American women grappling with the death of their matriarch, Minh.As Minh's granddaughter, Ann faces a crossroads in her seemingly perfect life, she returns home to Florida to help her estranged mother clean out the estate. As the two begin this daunting process, they also start to unravel their own long-buried secrets in Minh's old manor, the Banyan House.The house and its belongings are just as intriguing as the story. But, more importantly, readers are given a cinematic snapshot into the everyday life of people surrounded by the harrowing hardships of war but reminded that there is still vivid beauty and normalcy in the strange ways we adapt to adversities. Minh’s story, most of all, shines. Fans of Panchinko's multigenerational legacy story will be captivated by this richly imaginative mother-daughter story spanning decades, generations and the unique bonds of motherhood.Thank you to Mariner for the advanced copy for our show!

It starts with loneliness and the need for belonging. As a new mother, she is thrilled when an old friend invites her out for a glass of wine but realizes that this evening of friendship also includes a display table of products and a promised sisterhood. So, after going through the high-pressure sales routine (where she only needs to buy the starter pack), she joins the #girlboss community for an MLM beauty brand. But, before she has even made it home to tell her husband she’s made a purchase, it has been blasted all over Facebook that she has joined the official team, a job entry that is both bewildering and aggressive.It’s no secret that Paulson is lonely, and statistical data shows that this is just the kind of person an MLM targets. She shares that studies show that 90 percent of new moms consider themselves lonely, and 54 percent consider themselves friendless. These companies promise not only a paycheck where you can work from home but also promise friendship, travel, and nights out. What could be better than that? What Emily needs to know, and what few women know, though, is that over 90 percent of them will not make a dime, and only five-hundredths of a percent of the women will achieve the degree of success advertised by these companies. For Paulson, it requires her never to take no for an answer and to do anything she can to rise to the top of the pyramid. It's the start of many cringe-worthy moments for the reader, but by paycheck standards, it ultimately works. She does, indeed, become a success.While this success initially feels hard-won, she later must acknowledge that collecting a check is incredibly easy when you recruit enough people to do the work for you. As a result, Paulson achieves millionaire status, but it costs her the expense of loved ones, her sobriety, her health, and her moral compass. Ultimately, Paulson's memoir serves as a warning to others about the dangers of MLMs and the importance of compassion for those caught up in them. With biting commentary, Paulson expertly lays out the role of MLMs in the cultural epidemic of isolation and the cult-like ideologies that course through their training, marketing, and one-on-one interactions. More importantly, Paulson's sobriety awakened her because she thought less about the consequences or the manipulative things she did when she was drunk. Still, you can't turn a blind eye when you are sober. The way that all comes to a head is in a spectacular blaze you must read to believe. Using a fictitious company name and pointing to the company's cult-like philosophies humanizes anyone attracted to these pyramid schemes. The women involved aren't villains; they are victims. It also provides incredible insight into these companies' troubling and predatory history, acknowledging her own troubled involvement in the manipulation and financial harm inflicted upon countless women. Her courage in sharing her story is admirable, and she acknowledges that publishing this story was difficult. However, it raises questions about why the world still seems afraid to address the continued predatory nature of these companies and the women who become entrapped in them. What will be gained by our silence, and who, ultimately, profits from it? Fans of The Dream podcast will devour this juicy tell-all story!

Big Gay Wedding is on store shelves now- thank you to the publisher for the  copy for our show.****Byron Lane, the author of A Star is Bored, is back with a charming rom-com perfect for your summer book stacks. Chrissy runs the Polite Society Ranch, a small Louisiana farm that offers school tours teaching lessons on manners through the joy of rescued animal encounters. All is well as long as things remain polite and disciplined. But when Barnett, her son, returns home, she finds her disciplined world rocked. Not only is he gay, but he plans to marry his partner Ezra. As Chrissy controls her response with good manners, she uncomfortably weathers this blow to her son's imagined life with a wife, and in these moments, Lane's writing shines.In one memorable scene, Chrissy observes, ""Is it crazy that we can live with the mystery of God?"" Or the mystery of Wi-Fi or something? But the first time we don't understand another human being, the mystery of another human being, it's just too much to overcome?""These shifts in thought are charmingly written when Chrissy scribbles all the things Ezra isn't ""politely"" into a notebook and then realizes how much she later delights in them. It's also more significant, like navigating small-town feedback and how her priest views Barnett's life.Chrissy doesn’t have to weather these challenges alone, though. Among the most supportive is Barnett's Paw-Paw, a memorable and delightful character for a reader. His surprising acceptance borderlines on comical as he admits how many gay grandkids come to visit at his assisted living facility and how the Glee marathons reinforce these lessons of acceptance in his community lounge.As the rest of the town tries to grapple with gay marriage, Lane isn't afraid to let the nuptials get over the top through a cast of quirky side characters as they throw a ""big gay wedding"" at Chrissy's ranch.It would be hard to replicate the charm of Lane's debut simply because it was based so much upon his personal experience as Carrie Fisher's assistant. However, you can see Lane's confident writing in the relationship he knows best- the one between Ezra & Barnett. In many ways, the romance sections reminded me of Katherine Center's writing as we catch glimmers of these private and meaningful moments that still leave a lot to our imaginations. The ""countdown to damnation"" for the wedding timeline and interspersing advice from a polite society guide on Southern Nuptials in the early 1900s reinforce the story well.I'm so excited to share the microphone with Byron and hear more about how his love story and his characters intertwine....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Apr 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61796679-big-gay-wedding

Eighty-one-year-old Kitty Karr Tate has died, and her death has dominated the week's news. She was an American icon, an Academy Award winner, a writer, a television star, and a philanthropist. But, along with praise for her career, there are also wild conspiracy theories about her mysterious life and the circumstances of her demise.  In one final mysterious plot twist, Kitty has bequeathed her entire fortune- approximately six million dollars to the Black daughters of her co-star in a sitcom aired almost fifty years ago. As these women are thrust further into the spotlight, they are left to grapple with why they received these funds. After all, they are daughters who had been multimillionaires by birth. Why do they receive this unexpected windfall? We get to solve this mystery along with the St. Johns family in this dual-timeline story, beginning in the 1930s and shifting to 2017. This ambitious novel is over four hundred pages long and an outstanding saga.

Thank you to Penguin Random House for the advanced copy for our show! ****I fell in love with Colleen Oakley's writing last summer with the release of THE INVISIBLE HUSBAND OF FRICK ISLAND. This year’s book takes a dramatically different direction with an unexpected road trip between a devilish older woman and her twenty-something caretaker. Tanner Quimby's life isn't working out the way she expected it. After a devastating accident halts her promising ambitions as an athlete, she feels relatively friendless and without purpose. So, without a place to live, after dropping out of college, she jumps at the chance to work as a live-in caregiver for Louise Wilt, an eighty-four-year-old woman.Louise isn't thrilled with the idea of having a caretaker, but her daughter remains insistent after Louise slipped on a rug. For Tanner to work out, though, she has to memorize her wall calendar and make space for her daily appointments, trips to ALDI, and long days at the beautician's. As Tanner gets to know Louise, though, she begins to observe many strange things, like a locked garden shed and local news reports about a jewelry heist suspect who happens to look like her. So when Louise suddenly appears in Tanner's room at 1 a.m. with a packed bag, insisting they leave town immediately, Tanner begins to suspect that Louise has more of a past than she is letting on. But, with the promise of $10K, if she drives her, Tanner must accept her offer. Louise teaches her along the way lessons that we all can learn a little from. This book is one of those stories you won't be able to put down, filled with zingy one-liners and rich observations from Louise's older perspective. In addition, it is peppered with text threads from Louise's children that will make you laugh out loud as we learn and discover more about Louise's life and her missing person case. I loved acknowledging their differences while celebrating the commonality these characters found in one other, especially as Tanner struggles with chronic pain and Louise faces what we all do as our bodies age. It also contains a refreshing bedroom scene with beautiful nuances about finding companionship as a widow and how different this world looks after your partner is gone. Louise is also a widow with her sex drive still intact! While appearing light, this book has layers and depth, making it a strong contender for our 2024 book club year. I can't wait to discuss this book with Colleen next month on the podcast and hear more about what inspired this road trip story.

Meg is on the Book Gang podcast this week to discuss.******Are you looking for a heartwarming read that combines magical realism with a touch of Willy Wonka-style adventure? Look no further than Meg Shaffer's The Wishing Game, a novel described as ""a love letter to reading, and the power childhood stories have over us long after we've grown up"" by V.E. Schwab. Follow the story of Lucy Hart, a 26-year-old teacher's aide who has always found solace in the pages of the Clock Island series by Jack Masterson. Lucy's financial life is problematic, but mostly because it has become a hurdle to adoption. You see, a student in her class, Christopher, has tragically lost his parents, and Lucy is the only one who understands his journey. So the two collaborate to save money for his adoption through alternative means, including knitting one or two scarves a week on Etsy and packaging these wares together after school, where Christopher sits as Co-President of her knitting company. It's not just the current years of Lucy's life that have been difficult. Lucy's younger years were just as challenging with her parents and estranged sister. When she was young, she even ran away from home to head to Clock Island, where her favorite author lived to escape the realities of her life. The prolific children's author, Jack Masterson, made Lucy return home, but he has never forgotten her. Admittedly, Jack Masterson’s life and writing also have taken a turn. In one sarcastic statement, his illustrator describes him as Dumbledore, Wonka, and Christ all rolled into one...with a side of depression and if they drank too much. He has not written a story in years, or that is what the world has thought. In truth, he's been scheming a brand new contest and book that will shock the world. A public letter begins to go viral sharing that a new book- A Wish for Clock Island- has been written and only one copy exists. Jack has plans to give it away to someone courageous, clever, and who knows how to make wishes. This invitation also says that you should check your mailbox if you know the answer to the riddle ""Why is a raven like a writing desk?"". And Lucy just so happens to know that answer, as do a few other longtime readers that have had beautiful interceptions throughout their lives with Jack. But the competition is fierce for these loyal readers, and Lucy must battle ruthless book collectors and wily opponents to claim her prize through clever riddles that only the most seasoned readers can solve. And with Jack Masterson himself pulling the strings and plotting a twist to the ending that could change everything, Lucy will be served up a few life plot twists that she could never expect. Peppered throughout the story are chapters from the Clock Island series. The author has even invented a title for 66 books in the series (added to the end) and some nonfiction and poetry selections crafted for his writing history. If a fiction writer could be real, Meg Schaffer has put in the work. Inspired by the real-life story of Andy, who ran away and showed up on the doorstep of his favorite fantasy author in Episode 470 of This American Life- ""Just South of the Unicorns,"" the author shares that this book is dedicated to kids who, in dark times, find a light shining from the pages of books. This will, likely, transport you back to the days of secretly reading books with a flashlight to escape those hard times when you were a kid too. Full of heart, adventure, and just a touch of magic, The Wishing Game is a novel that will captivate and delight readers of all ages.

Kristen Mei Chase is a guest on the Book Gang podcast this week as we discussed AAPI voices and why it is vital to see mixed-race characters in our stories. Kristen discloses in her author interview that it took her ten years to publish this fictionalized road trip story that celebrates the complexities of mother-daughter bonds and the surprising way Elvis binds their story together. You'll want to hear about this author's unique road trip to publishing. Grace is an accountant in Boston who feels trapped in a failing marriage and guilty for distancing herself from her mother and hometown in Texas. So when her mother, Loralynn, an over-the-top Elvis fan, invites her on a road trip to Graceland for her 70th birthday, Grace reluctantly agrees. As they visit places important to Elvis, from El Paso to Memphis, Grace starts to comprehend her mother's obsession with Elvis and the brokenness of their relationship.While the concept may feel light, Chase doesn't shy away from discussing big topics like identity and addressing mental health challenges. These are some of the brightest spots in Chase's storytelling and where we get depth and vulnerability in her storytelling. And, while we know that representation matters in literature, Kristen discussed in her interview (airing on 2/17) why seeing characters of mixed race is so crucial for her in her stories and her reading life. As a Chinese American, this emphasis is notable for this story and future books that Kristen writes. While this is not Kristen & her mother's story, this book also helped facilitate a meaningful conversation with her mother. She described it as a ""really deep therapeutic exchange about our own existence that allowed them to talk about some of the things that they needed to talk about in a safe space.""With that in mind, I think this could lead to a fruitful conversation for a mother-daughter book club of your own.

I received an advanced copy of this book from Sourcebooks Landmark. In addition, Meagan Church is a future guest on the Book Gang Podcast as we discuss the best book club books to spark conversation (including her own). Meagan Church bursts onto the historical fiction scene with a captivating coming-of-age story page-turner that will be difficult to put down and that any Diane Chamberlain fan will devour. In 1935 beachy North Carolina, readers discover Leah, a character who delivers Ramona Quimby's mischievous energy. She lives in a cozy coastal shack where money is tight, but love from her father is abundant. While Leah is creative and happy on the beach, her academic life leads much to be desired by her teachers. She also struggles with troubling seizure spells that affect her ability to concentrate and cause her to lose portions of time.Her life takes an unfortunate twist when her father tragically dies in a logging-related accident that leaves her both orphaned and penniless.With nowhere to turn, she is sent to the wealthy Griffin family, who live in a beautiful home and have agreed to take in Leah. She barely has time to settle before discovering that her room and board come with a new set of duties, working full-time as the family helpmate instead of attending school and the freedoms she had before.As the other children in the home live their everyday wealthy lives, Leah is constantly corrected and thrown into situations meant to humiliate her and remind her of her poverty by the lady of the house, Mrs. Griffin. Although letters from her childhood friend only come through sporadically, they offer her the only comforts of home and sustain her through these moments. As Leah blossoms into a young woman, Mrs. Griffin becomes vengeful, especially when she worries that Leah is catching the eye of her only son. Leah does not know that there will be a dramatic retaliation to punish her for a lifetime of secrets.It is only possible to write this  by saying what has also been included in the official book blurb and that this story is set against the backdrop of North Carolina's newly formed eugenics board. At that time, girls deemed ""feebleminded"" could be forcibly sterilized without consent for the ""betterment of society."" While this is a big part of the inspiration for her story, there are other surprising fictionalized mysteries that many readers will appreciate that are just as beautifully done as this element. As Church often foreshadows what Leah's fate might hold, readers will be waiting for this scene to take place, but there are many well-crafted elements that any historical fiction reader will appreciate. Church's scene-setting is where her writing, indeed, shines. She paints the landscape of North Carolina with breathtaking strokes that make readers feel as though they are on the beach with Leah exploring the sand. In addition, the historical details and well-thought dialogue are well-researched and meticulous. In the Author's Note at the end, we truly grasp how close to home this story was for Church as she uncovered the story of her great-aunt and then began researching North Carolina's sordid past with forced sterilizations in women who were deemed ""feebleminded,"" criminals, the promiscuous, and those in poverty. If you find this read impactful, Take My Hand (the 2023 MomAdvice Book Club selection for August) & Necessary Lies would be a phenomenal book flight that will both inform and infuriate you on the troubling past of the government involvement in women's reproductive issues and the fight for body autonomy. As Church thoughtfully quotes from Mark Twain, ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes."" Church is not afraid to grasp the rhythm as she completes her second book on women's issues and explores the Baby Scoop Era of the 1960s. In this planned next book, we learn more about ""wayward girls"" who were sent away to maternity homes, forcing them to give their children up for adoption and returning them to society as though nothing had happened.

In this poignant and heartfelt debut, this life examination is precisely the thread that ties these versions of our protagonist's life together in this Groundhog Day story that rocked my world. In this novel, Emma is trapped in a never-ending Monday, reliving the same day repeatedly as she tries to save her husband and keep her family and work life from falling apart. On the first Monday of our story, Emma is wrapping up another harried day of obligations and comes home to an angry husband. Dan has lovingly prepared an anniversary dinner and wrote the annual letter they will give each other on this special day. The problem is that Emma has entirely forgotten the day's celebration and many previous celebration days, along with this symbolic letter of their year together. After this fight, Dan takes the dog for a walk and gets hit by a car. When Emma goes to bed, Dan is dead and gone. But when she wakes up, he is alive. This cycle repeats as Emma tries to keep Dan alive or tune into what the Universe is trying to tell her on this never-ending Monday. Major weaves in relatable text message threads that become increasingly funnier as Emma stops caring about the nonsense and becomes singularly focused on her family. We can follow along on the silly bureaucratic demands of her volunteer position, the endless requests from the family, the missed calls from school, and the texts from Dan as she decides how to approach each day with him.We are acquainted with Dan & Emma's love story through this series of letters Dan writes to her that showcase the highs and lows of their relationship. What I appreciated the most about these letter sequences is Major's ability for Dan to marvel at certain qualities that Emma possesses that he finds, initially, quite endearing. But, as the years go by, those things that he finds beautiful, like Emma's ability to make friends wherever she goes, start to lose their sparkle when she doesn't have enough time for her family. For readers that love a bookish theme, Major weaves in intelligent and insightful commentary on Emma's demanding role as a literary agent and the authors she is juggling. As new authors make increasing demands on her time, tiny bits of the literary world spill onto pages. These sections were quite juicy about the experience with writers, ers, and agents.This book genre is among the trickiest to keep a reader engaged. With these repetitive sequences, how do you prevent a lag in your story or keep a reader from skimming the pages? While the middle falls into those familiar waters that start to create a lull, Major keeps the story moving with Emma's reactions, significant side character development, and a well-developed mystery with Dan's death sequences. I am keeping this  spoiler-free, but I audibly gasped at the ending as the author weaves in a solid plot twist that shifts the book's story entirely. Since the pandemic, there is something about a book that reminds us how valuable our lives are and how precious time is with our loved ones. This selection will resonate with any reader that needs therapeutic reinforcement on these principles. I will count this among some of my favorite time travel stories and recommend this to anyone who loved This Time Tomorrow....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,Nov 2023,"Feb 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61281769-maybe-next-time

Sadie's sister is receiving treatment for cancer, and Sam is recovering from a series of surgeries after a tragic car accident. They bond over their shared love of video games in the gaming room of the hospital. However, when Sam discovers that Sadie has been tallying her visits to fulfill her bat mitzvah service, he feels like her charity project instead of a friend. It ends the fast friendship abruptly, but they find one another again in college when Sadie shares another computer game she has been developing.The two decide to develop a game together, which follows their success in the gaming industry with their first game. It also follows the consequences of virtual world-building when they build a world where all are welcome that ends in violence and the dissolution of their formed partnership.Sam's chronic pain from his foot injury are written so beautifully and help us understand the daily challenges of chronic pain and learning to find peace with our disabilities when we face them.This experience is unlike any other that a reader could imagine because Zevin writes each of the games for this company in beautiful and intricate ways that each feels fully fleshed from idea to execution. I shared these scenes with my software developer husband, who was equally astounded by this remarkable execution. One world she built, in particular, left me in a puddle on the ground. It is a journey within a journey within a journey. Publishers Weekly put it best when they said this book is a ""one-of-a-kind achievement.It's hard to write a blurb on Instagram that will do this book justice. So I'll save the more significant thoughts for our Patreon community.

However, she knows she was framed for this murder, and one of her friends at the teen killers club believes her and wants to help her uncover who the real killer is. The reader gets to go on this fun journey as Signal Deere uncovers the real murderer, and, boy, does this have some clever twists.As a seasoned thriller reader, it's hard to pull a fast one on me, but I had NO idea where this story was going, and it was so much fun.This has all the necessary ingredients for a great YA read- a misfit cast of characters that bond together, a great romance, a fun mystery, and (for me) lots of outstanding horror movie elements.I can see this one becoming a movie or series because it was just so fun.The author has written pilots for MTV, FX & Amazon, and CW's Reign and Paramount's Heathers. I think her background really adds a cinematic quality to this book that is guaranteed to pull you out of any book slump.If you have a reluctant teen reader, this would also be a great one to share with them!

This highly original and profoundly imagined world is just what you need to escape with this month. I happened to snag this as my Book of the Month for December, and I'm SO GLAD because this is one of my favorite reads this year. Our story opens with a new assignment for Travis Wren, who has a unique talent for finding missing people. He's been hired by a family who has been missing their daughter. This woman, Maggie St. James, is a well-known author of dark children's books. But, unfortunately, it has to lead him to a place where many people believe to be only a legend. Years later, Theo, a member of the Pastoral commune, stumbles upon Travis's abandoned vehicle beyond the borders of their community. It's notable for several reasons, but one of those reasons is that the commune members are unable to go past the border because it could bring disease to their community. They believe that there is a disease that people can get and spread if they leave their community, and Theo has been testing this theory for some time. When Theo admits what he's been doing, it threatens the world of his wife and her sister. But, they don't know that this forest holds many secrets, including the ones that unlock their very own pasts. This story just blew me away, and I could see this one becoming a movie due to the cinematic qualities of the writing and the beautifully written twists. I wish I could say more about those twists, but the absolute joy is in discovering those for yourself.Add this one to your stack IMMEDIATELY.Looking for your next great read?

Slaughter chose to set this story during pandemic times, and it is laced with all the daily dilemmas we are finding ourselves in with our current pandemic and why she felt it was important for this story.This story is very darkly disturbing, and every kind of trigger warning should be listed on this. Fans of Pretty Girls, though, will love this story, and I found it captivating.A thriller with 448 pages should have dragged and had lulled, but this held my attention from the first page until the last one, a true testament to her solid standing as a dynamic thriller writer.Leigh has recently separated from her husband and juggles co-parenting a teenager and her job as a defense attorney.One night, while attending her daughter's play, she is contacted by one of her firm's partners that a high-profile client has requested that she represent his case. The name is unfamiliar to her, but when she meets him, she is reminded immediately of the secret she has been keeping and what could be compromised if she doesn't represent him.Leigh has been running from her past for twenty years, and the only one who knows the truth is her estranged sister.Callie hasn't been a part of Leigh's life for quite some time as she battles a lifetime of addiction. The two sisters must come together, though, because time is running out, and life as they both know it could end.This book is so gripping and has so many layers to it. The dynamics between how these two sisters weather the pandemic, the sympathy you find for Callie and her life's journey, and the big moral dilemmas these two faces make this an incredibly captivating read.The bits about the pandemic, at times, did distract from the plot and would be my only complaint with this book. That might be, though, because I didn't want to be reminded so often of our current predicament and less a testament to Slaughter's writing.Make sure you clear your calendar if you plan to start this one.

It's a home that is always tidy, where the President is admired and loved, and where going to church is your top priority. Mary Jane's first exposure to a world unlike her own is when she gets a summer nanny job for a neighbor. The neighbor is a psychiatrist specializing in addiction and has decided to do an intensive treatment program for one of his patients who happens to be a rock star, and the care extends to his actress wife. Mary Jane becomes the person who brings order to a cluttered and chaotic home. The people under this roof, though teach Mary Jane about a world where people disagree with the politics of their leader, where wardrobe can be a little scandalous, and where boundaries look so much more different than her own home. This book just made my heart so damn happy and reminded me of my own coming-of-age story.

Although they all carry this label, some have more potent psychopathic behaviors than others. Chloe, for example, exhibits low impulse control and has credible reasons for playing cat-and-mouse with a boy on campus.

It opens with this line that immediately grabs you, “I started collecting my sister Eunice’s suicide notes when I was seven years old.”Although categorically Horror, this is what some might describe as ""gentle horror,"" and the book has also been described as ""If John Irving ever wrote a horror novel, it would be something like this,"" by the gifted Stephen King.You get the picture.This rich story is about a family that all see monsters but deal with them in decidedly different ways.The mother ignores them and pretends they don't exist.The father chooses to build a shrine in an immersive horror exhibit that he hopes to open to their community.No one has co-existed in the way Noah decides to though when he meets the monster and lets the monster in.It's this relationship that spans Noah's life that the reader gets to go on a journey with, and it is wildly unusual, beautiful, and strange.This book will hit all the right notes, particularly with The Shape of Water fans.Hamill's novel was a GoodReads Choice nominee for Horror in 2019, but it isn't one that I've heard anything about until it was chosen for Fables Books October Book Club.

When she begins to develop feelings for a classmate, Kathleen, she realizes why that is.Their relationship blossoms when Katheleen takes her to a lesbian bar called The Telegraph Club, where she finds a secret world where people live more freely in who they are.This isn't an era where any acceptance is given though, in fact, you can be arrested for indecency and male impersonation.Lo's research, in particular, really shines in this story because clubs like this existed back then, and she utilizes tricky political dynamics, particularly with the risk of deportation for this family and the challenges that women faced that didn't fit the mold.Imagine if your father could be deported for your ""infractions"" and what that would mean for your family.It's these big moral dilemmas layered on a coming-of-age story of finding your first love that makes this such a rich story.Looking for your next great read?

You will find, in the beginning, that Kimmerly creates a cast of physician characters gathered from this novel and The Queen of Hearts.You do not need to read these to understand the story, but some backstories are referenced (on occasion) where that might be helpful to understand the backgrounds of these relationships.If you are unfamiliar with Kimmery Martin's work, the author uses her background as an emergency physician in these stories, and she's using her medical background, again, in this story.I want to lead with that Martin was writing this story before the pandemic, which makes it even eerier and ambitious because this is Martin's interpretation about what would happen if a pandemic hit our world. She also notes, in the end, that she tried to avoid making a lot of edits based on COVID but only added in some more minor details like our reliance on Zoom for meetings. She also shares that she ended up battling COVID herself and plans to write about ""world peace"" next since this ended up overlapping too much with reality.In this story, three friends from medical school reunite in Spain for a much-needed vacation. Unfortunately, just as they arrive for their vacation, a fast-spreading virus starts to throw the world into chaos. Martin builds thoughtful hints of what is to come as they go on a tour of the town and then the excruciating dilemma if they should wait it out or travel back home, potentially exposing others to the virus.The characters each are in different medical specialties, so it impacts each of their practices in different ways. Although they are all challenging, the scenes in the E.R. are, in particular, brutal to read about.Martin also builds in a Sophie's Choice type of scenario with one of the doctors and her children. This scene, in particular, caused me to step away from the story and was so hard to read, especially since we are still in the thick of the mess of this pandemic.There was, honestly, a lot of thought and research that went into this book and if you are the type of person immersing yourself in pandemic reads as a coping strategy, add this one to your stack.This fictional virus does give it some distance with some of the symptoms she has crafted around it. That said, it did hit a little too close to home at times, and some of the scenarios prepared are extremely difficult to read.This novel is powerful and a tribute to Martin's extensive research and background that it felt so challenging to read.Looking for your next great read?

It's unfair and cruel, but what if Camille could do something about it?Camille has openly bashed this guy to the point that she attracts the attention of a secret group of women who have all been involved in situations where the guilty get away with a crime.They have formed a dark web community that makes these people pay for their crimes.When Camille is invited into the fold, she is offered the exact resolution to her daughter's case, but she also has to participate in helping others pay for their crimes.As you can imagine, this story goes into really dark places as Camille learns more truths about the collective organization she has joined. What happens when innocent people are involved and at what point is making someone pay too much?This kept me up way past my bedtime and came with some enormous trigger warnings, particularly for anyone who has experienced sexual assault or is the highly sensitive reader.In this month's stack is also False Witness and I did see some strong overlapping themes in these two.

This news has a ripple effect through this small town, and the reader gets to know many of the residents through each chapter. The story circles back to Greg's family in the end, but this is a short story exploration through chapter-form as the stories weave together through this unique narration.The way that this narration is set up reminded me a lot of Bill Clegg's, Did You Ever Have a Family, which is equally stunning and heart wrenching (P.S.- read my interview with Bill and read about the astounding process for creating these characters in his story).

But, using her scientific mind, she wants to convince her best friend just how accurate her hypothesis is, so she decides to kiss the first man she sees to prove she won't feel anything.It turns out, though, that the man that she randomly selected for her experiment is one of the top professors and known, in general, as an absolute jerk.

This coveted spot holds notoriety in their school and puts them in the running for its valedictorian. After this announcement, the two start to receive threatening messages from someone who identifies themselves only as Aces. What begins as a harmless prank evolves into dangerous threats that lead the two to realize that these pranks are rooted in a dark history at their school that they could have never expected. The first half, for me, took some time to build into our plot, but once this story picks up steam, it delivers on the meaty social commentary that is so reflective of the Jordan Peele film that it had promised the reader. This is a thought-provoking debut that has me looking forward to the author's next book. Looking for your next great read?

Overall, I found this book to be gorgeous, and this journey after a near-death experience has layers that speak to Carter's personal history with this scenario.Looking for your next great read?

The book was inspired   by the life of E.M. Forester and his relationship with a police officer named Bob Buckingham. Set in 1950s Brighton, this love triangle is about two people who love one policeman- his wife and his secret lover. This tragic story explores the quiet love shared between these two men and what it would be like if speaking your truth resulted in your arrest and the destruction of your life.The story utilizes journal entries (from his lover) and a manuscript (from his wife) that outline confession, allowing the reader to explore this story from different points of view and to varying timelines in this love story. Overall, this was a good read and led me to read more about E.M.

Unfortunately, her presence isn't welcomed, particularly in the programming department, where Eliza becomes a source of ridicule and is harassed. When the incident is reported, her boss doesn't take the necessary next steps and goes along with the ""boys will be boys"" toxic dialogue instead of addressing the issue correctly. When Eliza takes the incident to a journalist, all hell breaks loose as people begin to demonize, target, and dangerously harass her. One user, in particular, has made it his mission to destroy Eliza for her actions.The narration is told through users of 4chan & Reddit, which is highly original and can be agonizingly brutal as they discuss Eliza's motives and destroy her character. Osworth uniquely explores this story through speculation and the viewpoint of tainted lenses. It's masterful and darkly entertaining. This one won't be for the highly sensitive reader, but I would recommend it if you like darker themes that aren't afraid to go into the awful corners of the internet.Looking for your next great read?

McConaghy imagines a dystopian world where the oceans have been emptied of most life by climate change, acidic water, and overfishing. The Artic terns will soon be extinct in this novel, and Franny Stone is determined to follow their final migration to Antarctica. Getting there is a hurdle, but she manages to talk her way onto a fishing boat that happens to be sailing out that way. However, Franny doesn't want to board these birds because she is running from many things. Franny's tragic life spills out in haunting memories that leave the reader breathless and let us know that Franny is boarding this boat for some profound reasons we will soon get to discover through her flashbacks. I found this story to be uniquely told, enthralling, and disturbing. The themes of a world left behind by the devastation of climate change feel altogether too close, and that might be why this storyline was so compelling.Looking for your next great read?

In this layer, Jane was a student who had an affair with her professor, and he murdered her because she threatened to go public about this relationship. Unfortunately, that professor still works for Harvard, and Cooper wants to know more about Jane's story and devotes a decade of her life to uncovering the truth. Cooper feels discomfort with the true-crime world, and the true victims yet are consumed by this true crime case.

However, at over 500 pages, this one could have greatly benefited from editing because the story felt disjointed in many moments. The DNA evidence that has now been found, and added at the end, certainly could be challenging to that bookending you had been working towards. Had Cooper not led us down so many rabbit trails and had more substantial editing, this had the potential to be a 5-star read.

I found it worThis captivating read comes with many trigger warnings, especially if you are a highly sensitive reader (rape, incest, sexual assault). I found it worth the journey, though, and finished this haunting book in a single day. This fast page-turner opens with Elle and her oldest friend Jona sneaking out the back door and having sex with each other while their spouses chat away in the kitchen. They are on vacation at the summer home, nicknamed the Paper Palace, where she has spent every summer of her life. Over the next twenty-four hours, Elle is faced with deciding to stay with her husband or leave him for the boy she has always loved. But, unfortunately, that boy also happens to hold the biggest secret of her life.If Elle's affair makes you immediately dislike her, your reaction will be a lot like mine. However, what makes it compelling is Elle's backstory and the trauma she had endured to get to where she is. As I described, it's a lot of trauma, and the reader gets to go through each devastating moment with Elle. I found myself unable to stop listening to this audiobook, though, because you wanted to see how Elle would escape her tragic circumstances. If you prefer likable characters, this book might not be for you. I don't think they evolved significantly, but I felt like this mesmerizing read delivered on the book hype. Again, I did this one on audiobook and thought the narration was fantastic on this too. Looking for your next great read?

So when Delaney receives a scholarship offer to an elite school, she accepts only because she can bring Cash with her on the same scholarship acceptance. Cash should be thrilled to get this offer but feels conflicted because his grandfather is raising him and battling emphysema. With their encouragement, though, he takes the coveted spot at the school. It's through the support of one teacher; Cash begins to find his voice, people, and someone to call his own. The audiobook narration is just gorgeous and brings Zentner's story to life even more. I would highly recommend doing it in this format if you can make the space for it. Zentner does coming-of-age stories SO WELL, and the storytelling in this one is superb.

This story was inspired by those who assisted with forged documents that helped children escape from Nazi concentration camps. Told from alternating timelines, we are introduced to Eva, a librarian, shelving books when she locks eyes with a story and photograph of a book she has not seen in more than sixty years. This book holds the names and secrets of Eva's time assisting children to safety through the documents she fabricated for them. Eva must travel to claim the book and explain the story, but that's not all that might be hidden in the book. She's been waiting for many years for a correspondence that could give her closure and peace to her own love story. This book is one of those universal book recommendations that I think any reader could appreciate and share as a gift. It incorporates all the necessary ingredients for a solid historical fiction read- a well-researched backstory, a great love interest, innovative twists, and some clever creative liberties crafted by the author for this book. This lent itself well to our book club discussion and, overall, seemed to be liked by all our book club members. After you finish this one, be sure to go back to our MomAdvice Book Club Events to see the discussion with links to the story of Adolfo Kaminsky and the work he did to bring these children to safety. Once you read it, you won't ever forget the incredible bravery and sacrifice that was made to ensure the safety of these kids. Looking for your next great read?

Check out all my book s on MomAdvice and join our Patreon community for loads of bookish fun.West's second novel will appeal to parents navigating the tween and teen years in the thick of the dumpster fire of social media. This novel is told from alternate perspectives as the drama unfolds in a middle school. Alice Sullivan thought she had hit her pace with her career and family. That's why it is so devastating to find out that her son has been bullying another boy at school. This is just the tip of the iceberg, though, as she uncovers his fake Instagram account and his mean commentary to other students. Her son's behavior isn't just destroying him and his classmates, though, because these difficulties begin to have a ripple effect on her own career and relationships. Then, to top it off, her mom unleashes a bomb that changes Alice's life forever. West does an excellent job sharing the trials and tribulations of parenting teens, especially the challenges of constant monitoring and the exhaustion that comes with protecting your children online. I can honestly say that I loved this one just as much as her debut novel....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jul 2021,"Aug 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54326393-are-we-there-yet

In this coming-of-age story, Zauner returns home to care for her mother as she battles an arduous journey with cancer.As with all mother and daughter relationships, it seems this relationship has a lot of complexity, and Zauner struggles with not meeting her mother's expectations. It becomes quite the role reversal when Michelle must care for her mother's most basic needs, including feeding her. To bring comfort to her mother, she longs to recreate all of the Korean dishes she grew up with to comfort her mother (and herself) through this time. Zauner brings much humor to the beginning of this book, as she shares her childhood memories of her mother's younger days. Later in the book, she writes of her grief with raw and heartbreaking honesty that left a lump in my throat. I am so glad I read this one this month and would definitely add this to my list of all-time favorite memoirs....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jul 2021,"Aug 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54814676-crying-in-h-mart

Check out all my book s on MomAdvice and join our Patreon community for loads of bookish fun.I always like to offer up one solid audiobook for your stack each month, and I cannot recommend enough ""One, Two Three"" as your choice for next month.  (Curious to learn more about this author- check out my exclusive interview over here about her novel, ""This is How It Always Is"").Frankel decided to write this story after reading about the real-life consequences of a small town's polluted water by a local factory. She wanted to explore this concept with a fictional city dealing with these health consequences decades later and tells this story through the eyes of three sisters. Triplets (Mirabel, Monday, and Mab) have faced numerous challenges due to the town's water crisis. Unfortunately, they are just three of many residents who have faced health and personal difficulties due to this tragedy. Their town's story, in fact, made national news when the water turned green, was declared unfit for use, and caused detrimental harm to the residents. That's why it is so surprising when a moving truck arrives with a new family to take up residence there. The town's residents discover that there is quite a history with this particular family and a shocking reason they have decided to return. Their presence could change everything and stirs up the past in significant ways that affect all three sisters. As an audiobook, this is a magnificent treat that really sucks you into the story. The producer utilized three narrators to tell the story, and, notably, one of these sisters uses voice software that adds such a unique element to this story that I'll be surprised if we don't see this one winning an Audie this year. In addition, Frankel has such strong writing chops that this would be an outstanding selection for any book club. I can't say enough good things about this story and know that it will be making my ""best reads of 2021,"" for sure! ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,2,not setnot set,Jul 2021not set,"Aug 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42346406-one-two-three

Check out all my book s on MomAdvice and join our Patreon community for loads of bookish fun.I have only read a handful of science fiction novels, but I attribute part of my openness to this genre to incredible writers like Andy Weir. I was even lucky enough to get to interview him about his first novel ""The Martian."" His latest book, ""Project Hail Mary,"" is another epic space adventure that builds in a seemingly impossible mission to save Earth from certain destruction. Our unlikely hero that's been tasked with this mission is a middle school science teacher, but he can't remember that in the opening pages of our story. The only thing he knows is that he is far from home and his two crewmates are now corpses. As Ryland Grace pieces together what has to lead him to this moment, the reader gets to go back and forth through the beginning of this mission and witness Grace's discoveries right along with him. What holds this all together is an unlikely bond and friendship Ryland could have never expected in this interstellar adventure. It is this relationship that adds warmth and heart to a profoundly intense science fiction read. Weir's genius shines as he crafts up so much science that it did slow my pace down a bit. I was told by many that the first 200 pages might not grab me because the story was so rooted in these elements, but that it would be worth the wait. I completely agree with this statement and found myself enchanted, once again, by Weir's storytelling.

All thoughts and opinions are my own.I could gush about my love for Stephen Rowley all day, and his latest novel continues to embrace the sweet themes of love and family that I've grown to love about his work. Gay Uncle Patrick loves his niece and nephew, but he has never desired to be their caretaker. When they lose their mother to cancer, Patrick's brother is left in charge but unable to manage things due to his own health crisis. He calls upon Patrick to step up while he is away at rehab and care for Maisie & Grant in his absence. Patrick's single lifestyle is not conducive to children, and he is deeply overwhelmed with the commitment.  Rowley's humor shines on every page in the hilarious miscommunications and dialogue between Patrick and these children. The first half, in particular, offers big belly laughs, and then it evolves into the sweetest story as their relationship grows. The good news is that all three of Rowley's beautiful books are being written for the screen, and this one should translate beautifully cinematically. Definitely add this book to your summer bucket list, and now I'll have to impatiently wait for my next Rowley fix....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Jul 2021,"Aug 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54508798-the-guncle

Check out all my book s on MomAdvice and join our Patreon community for loads of bookish fun.I haven't met a book by Choi that I haven't liked, and Yolk is another solid YA story from this author. Of course, it only helps that the book's exterior is beautiful, including one of the most creative uses on the edge of pages that I've seen. But, seriously, try to read this one in hardback format, if you can. This story is about two sisters (Jayne & June) that have a very complicated and challenging relationship. The two do not want anything to do with each other until June gets a cancer diagnosis and finds herself at the mercy of her sister because of her lack of health insurance. Using her sister's identification, she can get the care she needs, but her reliance complicates their dynamic, especially as Jayne battles her own issues with an eating disorder. ""Emergency Contact"" still remains my favorite by Choi and is one that I would highly recommend. For me, this one lagged a bit in the second half, and it may have been too bogged down by trying to weave in so many big themes. If you struggle with disordered eating, I would avoid this one because it is filled with triggers. I remain committed to reading anything this author writes and look forward to more of her books in the future. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jul 2021,"Aug 09, 2021",,,view (with text),/book/show/43562313-yolk

While there, he realizes a much bigger story happening that is just the kind of material he needs to be a breakout success in the podcast world.You see, the entire town has been pretending that a resident's husband, who died at sea, is still alive and that they all can see him.

Check out all my book s on MomAdvice and join our Patreon community for loads of bookish fun.Midwestern food, a blossoming romance, and a little magical realism are just a few of the great themes you will find in this fun summer novel that deserves a little space in your beach tote this year. Sabrina is forced to move back home and struggles with the same anxieties we all have about returning to our hometowns. The thing is, Sabrina's fears are multiplied because of her family's curse and the ability to see spirits who come to them to deal with their unfinished business. Ray is a new local restaurateur that is determined to revive a retro supper club where he can perfect foods inspired by the flavors of Wisconsin and bring back the nostalgia of old-fashioned cocktails and bites. As soon as he meets Sabrina, there is an immediate attraction, and the two find their paths crossing repeatedly. Sabrina's paranoia about the spirits that follow her, though, could prevent her from a lifetime of happiness, and Ray might be the one to help her get to that place of joy. This is the sweetest little read and requires the reader to indulge in a cheese tray and an old-fashioned while reading about all these delicious dishes and watch this blossoming romance unfold....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2021,"Jul 07, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54802068-the-kindred-spirits-supper-club

Check out all my book s on MomAdvice and join our Patreon community for loads of bookish fun.I devoured Emily Henry's ""Beach Read"" last summer and could not wait to dive into another summer read from this author. This fun novel is about two best friends, ten summer trips together, and how their relationship evolves over these getaways. Poppy and Alex are unlikely friends, and this banter and differences bring so much charm and laugh-out-loud humor to the story. The two live in different towns, but every summer, for a decade, they take a vacation together. They vacationed together every year until about two years ago when they ruined everything and have not spoken since. Poppy decides, though, that enough time has passed and that she wants to reach out to Alex to see if he will join her for one last trip where they can, hopefully, repair the damage that's been done. This novel is such a perfect summer read, and I loved the relationship that Henry built between these two. I read many a passage aloud to my husband, who cracked up just as much as me. I enjoyed seeing the evolution of this relationship and how Henry utilizes these flashback trips to help build deeper connections with these characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jun 2021,"Jul 07, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54985743-people-we-meet-on-vacation

Alex accepts a dream offer to work for a prestigious Manhattan law firm and can't wait to make her mark on the company. What she discovers, though, is that this job requires entertaining clients at all hours of the night, that workdays never really end, and that she is expected to be available at the drop of a hat for just about anything. She doesn't believe she will have to compromise anything to have it all, but she soon discovers that it isn't that easy, and the speed required to keep pace also requires drugs, alcohol, and turning a blind eye to bad behavior. The spiral is swift, but Alex realizes just how high the cost is when she uncovers a very darkly kept secret held by her firm that compromises women's safety. This story is a train wreck journey watching Alex spiral as she tries to keep her head above water, and it asks the reader to consider just how far they might go for their success and what they would do when faced with these cringe-worthy situations. I found this book difficult to put down and a fascinating glimpse into this world. It's the kind of book that could lead to a great book club discussion as it explores the double standards of women and men working their way up that corporate ladder. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2021,"Jul 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48716980-the-boys-club

All thoughts and opinions are my own.When I was growing up, Freaky Friday was definitely one of my absolute favorite movies.Well, imagine that body switching theme, but with the mom next door that couldn’t be more your opposite.In this story, one mom is a highly successful productivity expert that is motivated by her work, while the other mom is the perfect Pinterest mom that has mastered the art of being a stay-at-home mom at an expert level.After a fundraising party where they drink a sangria that seems to contain a magical secret ingredient, they wake up in each other’s bodies and are forced to live each other’s life for one week.This one is absolutely FILLED with the best kind of belly laughs.They, of course, have judged each other harshly and the opportunity to walk in each other’s shoes and try to “improve their lives,” unfolds in some really fun ways.This book was an absolute delight and was enjoyed as much as, “The Overdue Life of Amy Byler.”I doubt you will be able to put this one down once you start it and I appreciated this fun twist on the mommy wars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Apr 2021,"May 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55355951-the-seven-day-switch

The scenes are very triggering, heartbreaking, and all too familiar to the R. Kelly story.Jackson is a phenomenal writer and writes some of the most compelling YA fiction.

Women who can’t reproduce are banished from society, disowned by their families, and are often accused of witchcraft.Ada has been married for a year and is unable to get pregnant.As the daughter of an expert midwife, Ada knows that achieving this if often more complex than just that and her curious nature leads her to want to learn more.She’s determined to find out all she can about this topic and the search for the best medical books ends up leading her on an adventure that she would have never been able to discover alone.What better place to find community than other women who are facing the same fate?This unlikely sisterhood is found in the, “Hole in the Wall Gang,” a group of women that have banded together to use their talents to create their own community.These outlaws have to be very creative to survive and the reader gets to go on their adventures with them from robbing banks to surviving those long winters.This took me right out of my reading rut and I ended up absolutely loving it. The characters are endearing, the message was beautiful, and I loved the author’s focus on women supporting women. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Mar 2021,"Apr 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50997696-outlawed

Charlie becomes intent on becoming Kathi’s most relied upon person and has to learn to anticipate all of her needs before she even speaks them.As Charlie finds his own self, he must make harder decisions about how far he is willing to go to keep Kathi happy. This journey to self-discovery is what makes this story so beautiful and sweet.Readers can also appreciate taking a bit of time to visit the acknowledgements in this one as Lane proposes to Steven Rowley (one of my favorite writers) in the acknowledgements at the end of this book. This book was an absolute delight and I, truly, did not want it to end.

The book has a lot of food for thought about how we compromise Black people for our own success, as a society. The best part is that weaved within all the satire are some really incredibly layered lessons about achieving success in business and sales. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Mar 2021,"Apr 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53091994-black-buck

Unfortunately, her father is broke and decides to sell her as a third wife to an old man.Adunni’s life is hard and a difficult one to read about. What is more difficult is knowing that so many girls are like Adunni STILL and that many find themselves in these marriages and working as house girls, with no pay or even adequate food or shelter.That’s why it’s such a joy when a local woman decides to take Adunni under her wing, helping her apply for a scholarship that could be pivotal to her future.This was a beautiful read and many readers recommended doing the audiobook since the narration was so gorgeous on this.

The big theme in this family drama is that our coming-of-age can happen at any point in our life and this pivotal moment seems to be happening throughout all the generations, of one family, at the same time.The family matriarch has fallen in love with a woman and wants to no longer keep her love story secret, her daughter has decided to start a family via a sperm donor instead of waiting for marriage, and her son is struggling because of the impossible standards he has created for himself.The story is told through each of the family’s viewpoints as they discover more about themselves through each of their revelations.This was the kind of enjoyable story that didn’t really have one big lesson, but just explored the quiet dysfunction that seems to happen in all families and how these roles don’t *really* change even when we become adults. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Mar 2021,"Apr 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51907346-all-adults-here

The magic that happens on screen feels largely, in part, to how well she is cared for by her director. The two continue to make film magic for years until one day Grace disappears for a year. When she returns, she is a shell of the media starlet she was. Her battle with drug and alcohol addiction have taken their toll, but the real toll is the internal struggle she has been dealt from being a victim of sexual abuse by this director. When his wife takes an interest in taking her under her wing, Grace now must make a decision if she will take this private battle publicly and what will happen to her reputation if she does.

All thoughts and opinions are my own.NPR and podcast lovers are going to DEVOUR this adorable rom-com that had me grinning from ear-to-ear in this fun concept for a modern day romance novel.When a local NPR station hits the struggle bus with listeners, a concept is crafted to start a fresh talk show that focuses on breaking up. The thing is, these two colleagues have never been in a relationship, but they are willing to fabricate that to lure in new listeners.To really bring the concept home, they must get to know each other to create those perfect relationship quirks and problems that make listening so fun.When the two really get to know each other, they realize that maybe they might like to be in a real relationship after all.What is a couple to do though when the entire show relies on their break-up for its success?Fans of The Hating Game and other similar romance novels are going to LOVE this clever concept. The included scripts for the show make this such an enjoyable and laugh-out-loud read that I couldn't put it down. I hope you guys love it as much as I did!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,not setnot set,Jan 2021not set,"Feb 17, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53415121-the-ex-talk

This thriller is one of those books that comes up in conversation, with much surprise, that I have not read.

No one really knows the motive behind the murder and interventions have been less than successful.When a new therapist joins the team, he believes that he can get the story out of her and considers it his duty to explore every angle from allowing her to paint again to interviewing anyone who might have any knowledge about why this happened.When he finally makes some progress with her, she allows him to read her journal where she has shared the story in her own words. Get ready for the twist because it just might be hidden in those journal pages.This was not as good as I had hoped, but I did finish it in a day.

This book, of course, did not disappoint.A Philadelphia neighborhood is rocked by an opioid crisis and Mickey is no stranger to it, both personally (as the sister of an addict) and professionally (as a cop).Although the sisters have lost touch, a series of murders begins to concern Mickey when she discovers her sister has been missing from her regular haunts.In alternating chapters, Moore lays out the challenges that these sisters have faced since the very beginning, including Kacey's drug abuse and Mickey's role in how she has stepped in for her sister.Moore writes about addiction with compassion and empathy, both for those that use and for those that suffer the consequences of these addictions.I would not categorize this one as a thriller, but more in the vein of a well-developed mystery, as Mickey tries to find her sister. At almost 500 pages, Moore takes her time telling the story of their complicated past and the redemptive nature of family.Moore proves, once again, that she has storytelling chops and I can't wait to read what she writes next!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,not setnot set,Jan 2021not set,"Feb 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43834909-long-bright-river

Unfortunately, her decision to do this leads to her being blackballed by every restaurant in town.Mack happens to be a local nightclub owner and would love to assist Liv with this assignment, along with a few other ones...I didn't connect with this story as much as the first book, which is why I am such a fizzler on series books.

It’s a beautiful friendship that blossoms on these pages.If you have ever wanted a guide to midwifery in these days, you will be astounded at how well Donoghue writes on these complicated procedures.It also showcases the same issues we are struggling with today which begs us to realize just how little we have learned.Just like today, they are short-staffed, struggling with supplies, having difficulties convincing others to take the necessary steps to reduce transmission, have distrust in their government, and how this disease impacts the lower income communities, at a disproportionate rate.I found this book to be very hard to put down!Trigger warnings: not recommended for pregnant women or those who want to avoid books on pandemics right now. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Oct 2020,"Nov 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52722079-the-pull-of-the-stars

Although Ashley feels distant from the tragedy, her sister is completely enveloped in the protests.It’s as she is observing the ripple effects of these riots that she begins to learn about her family’s own history, recognize the racism that she had failed to acknowledge before, and finds her place in a community she didn’t feel she belonged.If you have an older teen, I encourage you to pass this book on to them.

All thoughts and opinions are my own.Emily Giffin's books have become my go-to, over the years, for a great escape, and her latest novel was such a treat. Cecily & Grant meet at a local pub and immediately hit it off.  As Cecily is just rebounding from a prior relationship, she dismisses her instincts to not fall head over heels for this new relationship. Grant is charming, seems to have life figured out, and is easy to love.Although Cecily feels like she knows Grant, she realizes just how little she knows about him after 9/11 happens and Grant goes missing.As she tries to piece together the clues from their relationship, she starts to recognize that the Grant she knew might not be the real Grant after all.Emily's love stories are real and relatable and that is why they are so dang enjoyable. This one is just as enjoyable as her prior books and I couldn't put it down.If you are looking for a good mystery, with a romance weaved in, you will definitely want in your summer stack....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jun 2020,"Sep 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52909027-the-lies-that-bind

All thoughts and opinions are my own.A Riley Sager novel is one of my favorite summer pastimes so I couldn't wait to dig into this latest release. This one is VERY different than the usual Sager thriller and, personally, it felt more like the horror genre than a thriller. If you liked the Netflix series, The Haunting of Hill House, then this book is for you!! It works off of a pretty similar premise. Maggie's family owned an estate called Baneberry Hill that inspired her father to write a book detailing the horrors within the house.When Maggie inherits the home, she isn't worried because she was too young to remember the true stories and, frankly,  she's not a big believer in ghosts. Too bad the ghosts don't care what you believe in because her presence has secured her ride on another round of horrible hauntings and has reminded Maggie that maybe she *does* remember a few things.This was as satisfying as any horror film although I did feel like the ending was a bit of a fizzle.If you go into it knowing that though, I think you will really enjoy this one....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jun 2020,"Sep 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50833559-home-before-dark

Diagnosed with AIDS, he now has to return to his hometown, in Appalachia where he had to hide who he was.Set in the '80's, at the height of the AIDS epidemic, there is so much fear with this disease and Brian is finding very few are welcoming. Living his life out loud also has fractured and strained his family, but this is the only place he has to go. This haunting story is told in shifting viewpoints and each of them add their own element of process towards acceptance and understanding of Brian's life.From the opening sentence, I was moved by this thoughtful novel that addresses the cruelty of this era, the misunderstanding that comes with living in a small town, and the hope that one can change their viewpoints and come to welcome their family members again. I do think it also humanizes the struggles of these parents in a way that I thought was thoughtful and done with a lot of care. I did this one on audiobook and the narration was exquisite. If you can do it in this format, I highly recommend it.Along with the shifting viewpoints, it is also narrated by different voices, which really added to the experience and made each character really stand out.Make sure you put this one at the top of your stack.

I really am not sure why more people aren't talking about this stunning novel because it will be on my top ten this year, for sure.With vivid storytelling, that is written so beautifully that it reads like a classic. It is a Southern historical fiction novel, spanning generations of women, before and after the war.The story is of three women- May Belle (a midwife and healer in their community), Rue (who discovers she has some of her mother's gifts for healing), and Varina (the master's daughter). Being the town healers means that May Belle & Rue know many of the secrets, both of the slaves and their owners. Knowing this information has life-altering consequences, especially when it comes to their unforgiving master. Afia Atakora’s historical novel moves forward and backward in time in episodes labeled Slaverytime, Wartime, Freedomtime, or the Ravaging. While shifting timelines can feel confusing, in the beginning, you soon start to fall into the rhythm and crave each section in this phenomenal book. The writing is masterful, evocative, and beautifully researched. I just know you will fall in love with this one from the first page. 5 out of 5 Stars  If you like Conjure Women  you might like these titles: KindredThe Kitchen HouseThe Book of HarlanHEAD to MomAdvice for ALL my book s and feel free to join our FREE Book Club for some virtual reading fun!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,May 2020,"Jun 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51220325-conjure-women

I just want to make sure that I put that out there first. Russell's novel is one that has had everyone talking this year and I, honestly, could not put this brutal read down. I polished this one off in a single day and will be thinking about this for years. This story alternates between the years of 2000 and 2017, examining Vanessa's complicated abusive relationship with Jacob Strane.At just fifteen, she is groomed by her forty-two-year-old English teacher and finds herself entangled in her first sexual relationship. Although she is confused by Jacob's advances, she is flattered that he finds her to be both smart and pretty.Seventeen years later, the #metoo allegations are flying and female students began coming forward and make allegations about their teacher. They accuse him of unwanted advances and that he is a sexual predator. Vanessa is blindsided because Jacob has always acted as though she is the only student that he has ever had a relationship Alternating between Vanessa's past and present really showcases the complications of sexual abuse as Vanessa has to come to terms with the fact that her story wasn't a love story and that she is also a sexual abuse survivor.It is astounding to me that this is Russell's first book because the emotions she layered in these characters was so beautifully and believably done. The scenes in this are devastating, horrifying, and unapologetically written.Although Vanessa interprets their time together as a love story, it is not a love story.It is important to know that this does not glamorize pedophilia, but showcases the confusion of an adolescent who has never experienced a truly loving relationship. This haunting novel will, definitely, be in my top ten this year. If you can handle the plot, I encourage you to read it. 5 out of 5 Stars  If you like My Dark Vanessa you might like these titles: Rust & StardustA Little LifeAll the Ugly & Wonderful ThingsHEAD to MomAdvice for ALL my book s and feel free to join our FREE Book Club for some virtual reading fun!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,May 2020,"Jun 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44890081-my-dark-vanessa

I am such a sucker for a coming-of-age story and couldn't wait to dig into this one. This book is dark and felt very different than Thorpe's previous novels. I don't think is going to be the kind of story for everyone, as it ventures into explorations of sexuality and has a very Mean Girls feel to it. Bunny & Michael are next door neighbors that lead very different lives. Michael lives with his aunt in a cramped cottage and struggles to make ends meet, while Bunny is leading a very princess-like existence next door. The pair make unlikely friends, but they both are facing struggles. While Michael is pretending to be straight, Bunny struggles with her body and height. More than anything, they both want to be loved and to fit in. When Michael falls in love, his sexuality secrets are leaked and he becomes the victim of brutal gossip at school. Bunny is by his side though and commits a shocking act, in his defense, that alters her life permanently.This was so wildly different than I had expected and went into much darker terrain than I would have imagined. At its heart though, this is an unflinching portrait of adolescence that reminded me what a talented writer Thorpe is. 4 out of 5 Stars  If you like The Knockout Queen you might like these titles: Exit, Pursued by a BearIndecentI'll Give You the Sun...more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,not setnot set,May 2020not set,"Jun 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50852136-the-knockout-queen

Jessica is looking forward to bonding with her daughter, but Emily is less focused on the bonding experience and more on getting a p of freedom. As the college tour bus takes them from campus to campus, both begin to discover new details about each other. Emily's surprised to discover that her single mom might be attractive to men (for example) and Jessica begins to discover that her daughter's idea of the future might look a heck of a lot different than what she expected. Waxman rounds out the story with a bus full of well-written characters and fun side plots that make this a great little summer adventure story. This story is sure to hit the right notes for parents of teens, in particular.  4 out of 5 Stars  If you like I Was Told It Would Get Easier you might like these titles: Class MomStandard DeviationDear Fang With LoveMosquitolandHEAD to MomAdvice for ALL my book s and feel free to join our FREE Book Club for some virtual reading fun!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,May 2020not set,"Jun 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49348458-i-was-told-it-would-get-easier

Brown is such a gifted thriller writer and I had heard a lot of early buzz on this being the next thriller must-read.The story is told from alternating perspectives of two women whose lives are intertwined in ways that they would never expect.Nina's mom is a con artist who does the best she can to keep Nina in a good school and has given her the best childhood she can, despite her profession.When Nina finds friendship with a wealthy boy at school, they find comfort in being outcasts together. They spend afternoons hanging out, smoking weed, and feeling a deep freindship with one another.As their friendship blossoms into something more, they get busted by his father and Nina is removed from the school and taken away from the one boy who loves her.Now Nina works as a high-end con artist herself, in partnership with her boyfriend, Lachlan. She scopes social media accounts for the fabulously wealthy, drugs them up, and then takes all she can from their home.It's okay though- she's doing it to pay for her mom's cancer treatment.When the two hit a rough financial patch, she remembers the boy she fell in love with...oh, and the passcode to the family safe that holds millions.They discover there is a cottage they can rent, on the old family property, and try to become fast friends with Vanessa (the sister) who now owns the place.Vanessa is a bit of a ""con"" herself because she has been leading a fake heiress Instagram life online. The question is, who is going to con who?This is SO TWISTY and SO DELICIOUS that I stayed up hours and hours past by bedtime to finish it. The best part?A GOOD ENDING!The endings in thrillers often are disappointing, but this one does not disappoint in a single way.I was captivated from start to finish, loved the intricacy that Brown was weaved, and her dialogue is smart and addictive.Move this one ot the top of your stack and I can't wait to hear how much you loved it too!  5 out of 5 Stars  If you liked Pretty Things, you might like these titles: The Other Mrs.Necessary PeopleThe Turn of the KeyDid you know you can join the MomAdvice Book Club for FREE?

What makes her story so compelling though is that her boyfriend was a Deputy Sheriff and unaware that she had been buying and selling drugs while they were living together. No addict's story is as straightforward as that though, is it?Although Jenkins was struggling with addiction, lying, and stealing from those around her, she never intended to sell drugs.She ended up being blackmailed and forced into selling drugs because someone had threatened to tell her boyfriend. As we all know, being an addict isn't ideal if you are trying to sell drugs and she ends up getting high on her own supply. When she gets caught, her experience in jail is far different than anyone else because everyone works with her boyfriend and is angry about what she has done to him. She becomes the target of abuse and mistreatment until she is able to enter a recovery program, trying to begin the next chapter of her life.Tiffany's story reads like fiction and is as good as any movie that I've watched. She owns up to her mistakes, even when they are are embarassing and hurtful to those around her. She does not gloss over a single moment of what it would be like to be an addict or the journey towards her new start. Who knew that the lady's ads that made me LOL (and stopped me in my scroll) were connected to someone who lived such an incredibly difficult life story?I guarantee that you won't be able to put this one down!

His red pupils are the subject of ridicule, at his Catholic school, and his classmates refer to him as the, ""Devil Boy."" Although his last name is Hill, the bullies at school refer to him as, ""Sam Hell,"" instead.Despite his differences, his mother believes that this is God's will and that this difference is what makes Sam so extraordinary. She will stop at nothing to help Sam pave his path in the world and is thrilled when Sam finds his first friend in Ernie, the only African American kid at his school. The two form a fast friendship and both find the same magnificent friendship in a little girl, named Mickie, who his willing to stand up for Sam more than anyone. The book is told from Sam's adult perspective, now working as an opthamologist, and his boyhood journey towards acceptance. Dugoni, masterfully, brings this coming-of-age story together so beautifully that I was enchanted from the very first page.In fact, I found myself NOT wanting to finish this because I didn't want it to be over. Dugoni's inspiration came from his own brother, who had Down Syndrome, and his mother's tireless fight to make sure he was always cared for. He paired this inspiration with a newspaper story he read about a little boy who couldn't get into a Catholic school because of a condition called, ocular albinism. I can't rave enough about this beautiful read and how much it touched my heart.

She was not prepared to give advice, but she could share the challenges within her own story.Within these pages is the power struggle with her parents, the tragic death in her family, the sexual abuse she endured, her struggles with healthy body acceptance, the toxic relationships she gravitated towards, her struggles with addiction, and her continued body dysmorphic disorder after having kids.I think many people will come to hear Jessica Simpson spill the tea, but I was surprised to find so much more within this story than I had expected.While often thought of as a dumb blonde, she now runs a successful billion-dollar global fashion brand that proves she has more brains than Hollywood had ever expected. I really enjoyed this one for its refreshing honesty and smartly layered truth bombs within its pages.  5 out of 5 Stars  If you like Open Book you might like these titles: Wild GameHigh AchieverMaybe You Should Talk to SomeoneDid you know you can join the MomAdvice Book Club for FREE?

In this fun Groundhog Day novel, the reader is asked to explore just how far you would be willing to go to save the life of someone you love.When Dom bumps into Mia, his ex-fiancée whom he hasn’t seen in almost a decade, he believes that he has been gifted a second chance to ask her out.Sadly, the evening ends when Mia tragically dies on their date.More than anything, Dom wishes that they could give this second chance...well, a second chance. Lucky for him (or unlucky for him), when he wakes up the next day he realizes that he is reliving the day again and will get that opportunity.Over and over and over, Dom tries to change the fate of Mia by changing their date and what happens that day.Helplessly, the scenario keeps repeating itself, but he just can't seem to escape her fate or reliving the day again. It is only when Dom starts to confront his own truth that he realizes that he finds that he really can change his own fate.Done wrong, this type of story can feel tedious because so many elements have to be repeated and I worried that this novel was going to fall into that trap.Fortunately, Fenton & Steinke find a way to deliver a repeated day in such beautiful ways that you can't help but root for Mia & Dom to be able to have a different kind of day together.This has all the right ingredients for the perfect summer read- a great romance, a dash of magic, and truth bombs that are easy to devour.Priced at just $3.99, you can't go wrong with this one for a great summer escape...even if you might feel like you are trapped in a Groundhog Day plot yourself in quarantine. 4 out of 5 Stars  If you like How to Save a Life you might like these titles: The Life IntendedTime of My LifeI Liked My LifeDid you know you can join the MomAdvice Book Club for FREE?

All thoughts and opinions are my own.Ally's young daughter is struggling with some health problems that her doctors just can't seem to identify. Typically, in cases like these, an exploration in her genetics would provide the clues, but Ally happens to be adopted and doesn't have any information for her.Since Ally grew up in a happy home, she has never felt the need to look for her birth mother or had the desire to learn more about her family tree.To better understand Kylie's health issues though, she's encouraged to take a DNA test to find out more so that they can fill in the holes on her medical case.It is when she receives the results that she finds she has a biological aunt that she has never known. Since Ally's adopted mom seems hurt that Ally is curious about her family roots, she decides to keep her out of the loop and see if she can learn more about her mom, on her own.What she doesn't realize though is that opening this box helps them discover information that can help her daughter AND can help her in ways that she never knew she needed. This is a quick and adorable read that I ended up really enjoying. Nyhan's exploration of what it means to be family and how complicated families can come together was a fun escape that would be great for your summer stack. 3 out of 5 Stars  If you like The Other Family  you might like these titles: The Overdue Life of Amy BylerMatchmaking for BeginnersWhere the Forest Meets the StarsDid you know you can join the MomAdvice Book Club for FREE?

Battina's passion for photography and flightiness are things that anger Werner and he becomes more unhappy and controlling through the years.This is when Battina finds love, with a pastor's son, and discovers what being truly happy looks like. This affair is dangerous though because Werner holds the power in town and isn't afraid to use it.As the two fall more and more in love, they know that they have to do everything they can to escape Werner.Not only do we get to see what Battina's life is like then, we also see her as celebrated photographer now living in Chicago. Despite her success, she can' stop thinking about what (and who) she wants to reclaim back in Germany.This was such a beautiful read with all the right elements mixed in.Usually my historical fiction reading is centered around World War II books so it was incredibly fascinating to read about the time following the war and the realities of what it was like in Germany.Since this one is just $4.99, it is a no brainer to pick it up for your stack.  I hope you love it as much as me! 5 out of 5 Stars  If you liked This Terrible Beauty,  you might like these titles: Those Who Save UsThe Things We Cannot SayAll the Lights We Cannot See...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Feb 2020,"Apr 23, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51208769-this-terrible-beauty

As you know, that can be a hit or (often) a miss.Thursday is married, but only really married for one day out of the week. The rest of her husband's week is spent commuting back and forth to visit his two other wives. Thursday is curious about the other women, but Scott thinks it is important to keep these worlds separate. In her head, she is the sexy adventure-seeking wife that he needs to visit to get away from his boring wives. She begins to wonder though, what if that isn't actually the case?When Thursday stumbles upon a scrap of information, about one of his other wives, she can't help but try to find out more information about them on social media. She, in fact, becomes obsessed with finding these women and hearing more of their stories.As her curiosity grows, she decides to schedule some in-person meetings so she can learn more about why Scott insists on keeping them in his life.It is when she travels down this rabbit hole that the stories frayed ends really begin displaying and Thursday realizes that Scott might not be who he says he is.This started with tons of promise and I flipped through the first half rapidly. The ending promised a ""bumpy, twisty, exhilarating ride,"" but I found it more of a fizzle. Honestly, this might not be a reflection on the writer and just the tired theme of the unreliable narrator.  When executed well, it can be so fun.  When it doesn't though, it can be a bit chaotic and confusing.For me, this felt a tad too disjointed, although the first half was a blast.  3 out of 5 Stars  If you are looking for an unreliable narrator story that really delivers,  you might like these titles: The Other Mrs.My Lovely WifeThe Wife Between Us...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Feb 2020,"Apr 23, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/43262893-the-wives

In this sleeping world, she is still preparing for her wedding and savoring every continued moment with Freddie. It is everything she could ever hope for.Lydia's life begins to fracture into two quickly- her awake life and her sleeping life. It is in the fissures of these cracks that Silver builds such a beautiful love story.After all, we do have the ability to immortalize people and erase faults when they pass away.As Lydia heals, her time in her sleeping life really begins to separate and Lydia discovers that her waking life might be just as beautiful.I really enjoyed this one and it ended up being a perfect Valentine's Day read this year. 4 out of 5 Stars  If you like The Two Lives of Lydia Bird,  you might like these titles: The Life IntendedI Liked My LifeTime of My Life...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Feb 2020,"Apr 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46225061-the-two-lives-of-lydia-bird

As she muddles her way through the piece, she begins uncovering a mural that has some very disturbing elements within it. The artist that made it has quite a story too and the reader discovers just why these elements are added. As the reader learns more about this story, Chamberlain expertly weaves these stories together in some really beautiful ways.She's quite the master at pulling narratives together, in a way that only a seasoned writer could achieve. This was another beautiful read from one of my favorite writers. 4 out of 5 Stars  If you like Big Lies in a Small Town you might like these titles: Recipe for a Perfect WifeThe Lying WoodsLittle Fires Everywhere...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jan 2020,"Apr 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046808-big-lies-in-a-small-town

Whitehead's first book was so inventive and thought provoking that I could not wait to dig into this one.This novel is based on the true story of a reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and robbed children of their childhood innocence. Elwood is sent to, The Nickel Academy,  after he has allegedly stolen a car.  He is sent to this reform school to help him become more disciplined and to pay for his crimes.Unfortunately, Elwood quickly realizes that the punishments given don't fit the crimes and Whitehead takes us along on the brutal journey with him. I listened to this one on audiobook and found myself needing to detach from the story because of the disturbing violence inflicted on these boys. It may have been a mistaken to rely on an audiobook for this one.Whitehead's novel jumps to different timelines and most of the second half left me confused because of the disjointed timeline. I will continue to read anything Whitehead writes. He is a powerful storyteller and I can't wait to see what he teaches me next.Want to learn more about the school this book was inspired by?

By the time the fire was extinguished, it had consumed over four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more.For thirty years, investigators have been baffled by how this fire started and the mysterious reason why it happened.Orlean is, clearly, a big fan of the library and she weaves in a lot of fun facts and a bigger story about the role that the library plays in our lives. There is a wide cast of characters as she shares the stories of people from libraries past and present.Overall, this should have been a really enthralling read. The fire and how the community rallied together was, definitely, the most fascinating part.No one can understand the aftermath of what that looked like or, frankly, how it would impact the people who worked there. This is one of those cases though where I felt like the author could have benefited from an editor. I listened to this one on audiobook and found myself zoning in and out as Orlean tried to pack in every detail about libraries past.While well-researched, it was a little dry and I found myself wanting to fast forward to the bits about the the Los Angeles Public Library....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Nov 2019,"Dec 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39507318-the-library-book

This role soon shifts though when the two fall in love.What happens when your work and your love collide? Well, it's complicated and Man Ray, for sure, doesn't like being showed up in his own field.Lee's life in photography (and as Man Ray's partner) end up taking her from the cabarets of bohemian Paris to the battlefields of war-torn Europe during WWI. As a war correspondent, she begins documenting the liberation of the concentration camps as one of the first female war correspondents, utilizing radical new photography techniques to document the liberation of the concentration camps as one of the first female war correspondents. Overall, Lee's life was fascinating and Scharer builds a believable strength and curiosity in Lee. This was a strong debut from Scharer, although the story would have benefited from some trimming (at 485 pages!). I am so glad to have learned about Lee Miller's life and am thankful historical fiction has been a great avenue for learning about stories like these.Want to see some of Lee's war photos?

The only reason this wasn't selected for our book club is because there is already SO much buzz around it that I had a feeling that many of you may have already read it. In this story, Libby returns home from work to find a letter written to her on her 25th birthday. Truth be told, it is the letter that she has been waiting for all her life.Within the note, she learns the identity of her birth parents and that she is the sole inheritor of an abandoned mansion, in one of London's most fashionable neighborhoods, that is worth millions.Twenty-five years ago, the police were called to this very house because there were reports of a baby crying. This baby, healthy and happy, was found in her crib- safe and sound.Downstairs though were three dead bodies, all dressed in black and the other four children all had mysteriously disappeared.I am, admittedly, fascinated by cults and the power of charismatic leaders to manipulate people to do to unthinkable things.The man that lives with this family ends up taking complete control over their lives requiring strict exercise, changing their attire, restricting food, manipulating people, abusing them, and alienating them from everyone in their lives.It is especially impactful on the children who are witnessing all of this in their house and we get to see this story through their eyes too. I was sucked into the story from the very first page and finished it in a single day. If you were a fan of, ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" I have a feeling you will love this one too. This was another Lisa Jewell home run for me!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Nov 2019,"Dec 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43822820-the-family-upstairs

All thoughts and opinions are my own.I fell in love with Jess Kidd's writing after listen to, ""Himself,"" on audiobook (full  here) last year. There was something so unique about her storytelling that blended a great Irish ghost story with an incredible amount of heart and humor.  This is why I knew that I was in for something good when I snagged an advanced reader of, ""Things in Jars.""Kidd takes a darker turn with a female detective, Bridie Devine, who is trying to solve the kidnapping of Christabel Berwick, the secret daughter of Sir Edmund Athelstan Berwick. The child has been kept away in secret from society because of her peculiarities and supernatural powers. At this time, in Victorian London, peculiarities are displayed as marvels in traveling circuses (or worse) children are killed to display these oddities in jars for collectors and for profit. Bridie is determined to find this girl even if it means putting her own past at risk. She isn't alone though, she is aided through this story by a tattooed ghost who doesn't leave her side as she investigates. Kidd does a great job adding her signature humor into this dark story and weaves in history and folklore that anyone can appreciate. Fans of magical realism will love this Dickensesque story that finds great beauty in the oddities.This is much darker than her previous work and is a very macabre telling of our curiosities with collecting and displaying the peculiarities of others for profit.For me, this one leaned a little too heavy into the magical elements that made the story feel a lot less grounded toward the end.Overall, I was still completely swept away and would still recommend this one for your stack!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Nov 2019,"Dec 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49649443-things-in-jars

Diana is determined to forge the same path and her new business just might be the glue needed to bring these two sisters back together again.Stradal's storytelling is exquisite and the different viewpoints really bring it all together. This book would also make a fun book club discussion (at a brewery, perhaps?) because it has so many great themes about what it means to be family.It has heart, humor, and beautifully written characters.I enjoyed it start to finish....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Sep 2019,"Oct 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42203363-the-lager-queen-of-minnesota

This is the kind of novel that could be shared with anyone in your life and, I just know, they would love it too. Although this story deals a lot with faith in God, I don't think you need to be religious (or even believe) to appreciate the themes. In 1963, two men are jointly hired to steward at a Presbyterian congregation.Unfortunately, they happen to be taking the reigns during a challenging and turbulent time, when the world is thick with racism and limiting women's rights. One of the men, Charles, is a devout believer whose faith seems unwavering. In a weird twist of fate, he falls in love with a woman (Lily) who has no faith in God at all.The other man, Charles, had a difficult childhood and grew up with a lot of instability. He feels passionately about social issues and sees injustice all around him.  He falls in love with a woman though who has had a, ""silver platter kind of life,""  and is the daughter of a minister. The contrast in these homes and between these men is what feeds the story. Imagine being an atheist feminist who is tasked with being a minister's wife?Imagine being the ""perfect minister's wife,"" yet your husband is intent on shaking up the church with sermons on social injustice and racial inequality?This story follows these two couples, over decades, as they must learn to love and respect one another. The themes on faith, what the role is of the church through turbulent political times, women's roles (as wives and as mothers), are all phenomenally done.If you asked me which book I think you should share with your book clubs this year, this is what I would recommend.I, truly, did not want this story to end....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Sep 2019,"Oct 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43822731-the-dearly-beloved

David is completely astounded that they have saved this much because the couple seemed like the typical middle-class family who didn't seem like they had a lot to save.Their story, he reflects, is the template we all need to achieve the same financial freedoms.The idea of automating things is an easy one to implement, especially in this era of technology.

I was so caught up in this beautiful book and the story of these family members that I couldn't put it down. The story opens with Fiona Skinner, a well-known poet, sharing her own story on one of her most recognized pieces of work.  Fiona's work happened to be inspired by her own family and a betrayal that had lasting consequences for them all. Fiona is one of four siblings (three girls and one boy) and their family has suffered the tragic loss of their father, after he had suffered an early heart attack. As a result, their mother goes into a deep depression and almost exits their life altogether by no longer caring for their most basic needs. In her grief, she takes to her bed and refuses to care for herself or for her children. The death has also come with some devastating financial consequences and force the children to be resourceful and learn to lean on one another to survive.This difficult season shapes the rest of their lives as they enter adulthood. It is here where Conklin really pulls together the tragic repercussions of feeling abandoned by both parents.I could not put this book down and felt fully vested in each of their stories. I did feel the first half was the strongest half because their survival story kept me on the edge of my seat.

She is everything he is not- wild, carefree, and lighthearted.When Sarah betrays him though, Klee finds himself in a psychiatric hospital for teens where he is forced to deal with the emotions of his father's death, his anger with his mother, and losing the one person who brought him joy again. Luckily, this boy is surrounded by a staff of helpers who help Klee come to terms with ALL OF IT and his role in these stories.Polisner really opens this story in a way that makes it confusing to the reader and she does so purposefully.

When you learn more about Sabine's story, you know you would have to leave too.Now known as Beth Murphy, she has cut off her hair, dyed it in a new shade, and is doing everything she can to escape the cycle of abuse she was part of.  ""Beth"" has to keep moving though, and keep an emotional distance from everyone, because the last thing that can happen is being found by her husband.One detective is unwilling to end this case until these answers are found and he will stop at nothing to figure out where Sabine is hiding or who could have murdered her. This game of cat-and-mouse is on!I loved, loved, loved this thriller and highly recommend this one if you are looking for a solid plot to really sink your teeth into. The twists were so well-played that it took me, even as a seasoned thriller reader, by surprise....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Jul 2019,"Aug 06, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/41587116-dear-wife

All thoughts and opinions are my own! If you gravitate towards the darker thrillers, I have a feeling that you will enjoy this new novel, The Chain.The plot revolves around a mother, named Rachel, who is on her way to an oncology appointment, when she receives a panicked message from a woman who tells her that the caller's child has been kidnapped.She is desperate for Rachel to help her get her child back.The only way the caller could get her child back though is to kidnap ANOTHER child...and Rachel's daughter has been chosen.This crazy woman has her child.Say what?To release Kylie, Rachel's kidnapped daughter, she is required to send a ridiculous amount of money and KIDNAP ANOTHER CHILD to complete the chain.What is the consequence of breaking this chain? If she breaks the link, her child will be killed.Rachel is down on her luck financially, is divorced, and has been beaten down with cancer. She would do or sacrifice anything though to get her child back... including taking someone else's kid. With the help of her ex-brother-in-law (a Special Forces veteran), she goes against everything she is to get her daughter back.McKinty adds a lot of layers to Rachel that include both her difficult life and her background as a professor of philosophy. He also adds layers to her accomplice that make him unreliable and put the reader on edge. This is another book that I polished off in a single day and ended up being a fantastic little summer escape....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,Jul 2019not set,"Aug 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42779092-the-chain

The author, in fact, had many people bail on her, midway through this project, because people began to worry about the anonymity factor.As the title suggests, this profiles three different women and what is happening behind closed doors.One Midwest woman is struggling to get her husband to even kiss her, let alone be intimate with her. It is because of this rejection that she rekindles an old flame and begins having an affair.Another woman starts a relationship with her English teacher, at the tender age of seventeen. What begins as something innocent begins to slowly evolve into an inappropriate relationship. Just as she begins to be fully vested into this relationship, her teacher completely cuts her off from his life.To her surprise, now as an adult, he is nominated as, ""Teacher of the Year,"" and no one in her town believes her story of her affair.The third is the raciest of the storylines and features a woman who is happily married and her husband is also happily open to them having other people in the bedroom (*ahem*).The book reads like fiction, but Taddeo has spent years on this book to make sure that she tells their story as truthfully and honestly as possible. It has seemed to struck a chord with many and now has been picked up for a Showtime television series too.My inability to put this one down makes it a winner, at least in my book....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jul 2019,"Aug 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42201100-three-women

Set in the 1970's, the two wives (Lena and Anne) should be close friends, but they are both battling their own demons at home.  Lena is very lonely and could use a friend, but Anne is emotionally unstable and not the kind of person that can support Anne through this chapter in her life.

In 1990, seventeen-year-old Isra is growing in up in Palestine and is already facing the prospector of her father selecting a suitor for her. In just the course of a week, Isra finds herself to be betrothed, married, and facing a move to Brooklyn with her husband. The husband (and family) are looking forward to a son in their family, to take over the family name. As Isra births daughter after daughter though, she finds that her family and husband's reception to her become colder and abusive.In 2008, eighteen-year-old Deya is supposed to meeting with potential husbands and is preparing to be married. Deya really wants to go to college though and is hoping to convince her grandmother to go along with her decision. In a shocking twist though, Deya discovers truths about her family, the past and her future. It is through an unlikely source, but she is the one person that can help Deya make sense of the death of her parents.I have to admit that I am feeling a bit conflicted with this one because I was hoping that it would be a bit more layered.  Within these two timelines, everything felt identical which, I believe, Rum may have wanted to use to drive home how little has changed.  With the two identical stories, though it created times where I felt like I may have read the same section twice and I found a struggle connecting with these characters, except through their shared love of reading.I had to look up the ending because I found it caught me off guard, confusing the timeline a bit again.

I read this in a weekend and loved the way Holsinger challenges us to exam our role as parents of gifted children as well as the difficulties of being a gifted child.This read also couldn't be more appropriately timed to the current admissions scandal that is making headline news.When an exclusive new charter school is introduced to a fictional suburban Colorado town, all the parents want to give their gifted child a chance to test into this school. With very limited spots available though, parents begin putting pressure on their children to succeed and begin to go to unnecessary lengths to secure these coveted positions in the charter school.This highly addictive story, examines how this competition begins to interfere, in particular, with four couples and their decade-long friendships. We begin to see these friendships in a new light and how these behaviors contribute to the way kids feel about and present themselves to their peers.The book is told from multiple perspectives so it took me awhile to remember how these characters were linked to one another. Pretty soon though, I started to hit my pace and could not wait to see how this was all going to play out for these families. This is one of those can't-put-down reads of parents behaving badly that I didn't want to end.I highly recommend this one for a great summer book club discussion about privilege, standardized testing, and the challenges with raising a gifted child....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jun 2019,"Jul 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42207168-the-gifted-school

Rowley's first novel, in fact, is one that I recommend so much that I added it to my top ten favorites in my Summer Reading Guide.To say he had a lot of hype to live up to, it would be an absolute understatement.Guess what? He managed to do it again!Set in the 1990's, James Smale sells his first book to a major publishing house and is assigned his first editor. He could have never guessed that his editor would be Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, when he walked into that office, but who could ever prepare a writer for that?Mrs. Onassis had fallen in love with this autobiographical novel that tells the stories of his own dysfunctional family. Many notes of his story end up falling short and his editor knows it is because Smale hasn't truly owned his family story. She encourages him to make his way back home again and make the necessary resolutions needed to his real story to give it the conclusion his readers deserve.As James returns home, he begins to realize that sometimes the way we interpret our own stories are, simply, the stories we tell about ourselves. His strained relationship with his mother challenges James to look at her in a new light...changing the entire scope of the book.I really can't believe that I never knew that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had ever really been an editor so I was surprised to read that this was absolutely true (although not as a well-documented portion of her life).Rowley treats her legacy with the kindness and beauty it deserves without speculation, but with stunning observation. As she mothers this writer, to get conclusions for his own life, you can't help to fall in love with her even more.It's a beautiful fictional friendship that I didn't want to end.I loved this one start to finish!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jun 2019,"Jul 03, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40879757-the-editor

Not only does she find out that she had a father, but she also finds out she has MULTIPLE siblings from his different marriages. For someone who is introverted, the overwhelm is huge.Not only that, her trivia nemesis is turning out to be the guy of her dreams.Unfortunately, her life is just too busy to squeeze him in.Waxman cleverly leads chapters with Nina's handwritten daily agendas and to-do list, which gives you a little snapshot into how much these major life events are sending her world into a spin.  Nina's struggle to evolve and open up to others is addressed with so much heart and humor that you will find yourself smiling a lot through these pages.I am a bit of a Nina and, truly, have never felt more understood.This one will definitely be making my top ten list of 2019 and is worthy of a little book splurge for your summer!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Jun 2019,"Jul 03, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42379022-the-bookish-life-of-nina-hill

What they don't know though is that Andrew fabricated this family during his job interview and has felt compelled to carry on this fictional family.When Andrew meets Peggy, a new hire that will be helping him handle these cases, he could never imagine how wonderful it would be to have a friend in his life.

Andrew must acknowledge that if he doesn't branch out more, he could be just like these lonely people that didn't have anyone to love them at the end of their life.I fell in love with this sweet character as he branches out into the world and learns how beautiful life is when you find friends and someone to love....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jun 2019,"Jul 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42584179-how-not-to-die-alone

I think it is important to know that I would categorize this one as more in the horror realm than as a typical Ware thriller novel. Fans of The Haunting of Hill House will love how this home has a dark past, filled with terrible secrets.The book opens with a prisoner writing to her lawyer, as she attempts to explain how she has been set up for her crimes. She takes her reader down the twisted path of applying for a too-good-to-be-believed nanny job and the horrors that unfold in this infamous Heatherbrae House.The house has had a lot of revamping under the new owners and is outfitted with all the latest smart home technology. Just as soon as the complicated house has been explained, the parents decide to head off for weeks, leaving their new nanny in charge of three little girls (and a bonus teenager), two wild dogs, and a couple of weird people working for the family.Of course, everything with the smart technology starts backfiring on Rowan and she becomes increasingly paranoid that something is going to happen to her or these children. Not only that, but she hears someone above her room walking back and forth and keeping her up throughout the night. As Rowan becomes more and more unhinged, the naughty daughters get naughtier and encourage pushing their nanny right on over the edge.I was on the EDGE OF MY SEAT through this whole book. Ware beautifully develops misleading clues, a sense of distrust with everyone, and a plausible reason for Rowan's sudden career shift to nanny.I loved it all the way through...until the last few pages.Ware's cleverly crafted twists unfold, but the last sections feels jumbled and rushed. The big reveal is shared in letter format with an abrupt conclusion that begs to have an epilogue. It doesn't have an epilogue though so it left me feeling dissatisfied, knowing how incredibly satisfying the rest of the novel was.I still loved it, but wish the ending was less rushed and as supported as much as the development of the story....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Jun 2019,"Jul 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42080142-the-turn-of-the-key

What begins as a fake friendship evolves into deep attraction for each other.The thing is, this relationship threatens both of their worlds.This journey requires bravery and it also requires Alex to address his own sexuality in the process.I went into this one as a bit of a fairy tale because McQuiston requires us to suspend our own reality about how these two can go to places without being recognized or photographed. Much of these moments don't seem plausible, but you can't help but wish for a world that looks just like that.The romance and connection between these two characters though seems to outweigh some of the less grounded parts in our story. While many novels tend to fade-to-black with bedroom scenes, this one leaves the light on for you.Fans of The Royal We and What If It's Us will DEFINITELY love this one!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jun 2019,"Jul 02, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41150487-red-white-royal-blue

This one was selected because it won the 2018 National Book Award and I was really excited to read something that had garnered this award.The story is about a woman who unexpectedly loses her friend and finds herself burdened with the unwanted elderly dog he has left behind. Although she initially doesn't want to connect with this animal, they both find companionship with one another as each of them deal with the grief and loss. Unfortunately, she is threatened with her own potential eviction because dogs are prohibited in her apartment building.The story of this narrator and the dog was what I connected most with and I think that is where the story, truly, shined. There were gorgeous passages and the idea of these two finding one another through this grief was really beautiful.Where it didn't shine, for me, was the rambling rants that the story would trail into that felt as though you were reading someone's stream of thought. It felt more like a memoir of Nunez and how frustrated she is with the craft of writing and literature. At just 212 pages, I had a hard time concentrating amidst her stream of consciousness and it pulled me away from the story I really wanted to hear.Our book club seemed pretty divided on this one- they either REALLY loved it or they REALLY hated it.This was definitely not my favorite in the stack, but I do think it can connect with people who crave a meatier piece of literature....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,May 2019,"Jun 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40164365-the-friend

Although I am not a big nonfiction reader (and maybe you aren't too?), I found this book to read as easy as fiction while being incredibly compelling and thought-provoking. It is the type of book that you read and then immediately hand off to someone who might need the sage advice and wisdom of a good therapist too.What makes this story unique is that the therapist, Lori, is now in a difficult break-up with a boyfriend and finds herself needing a therapist of her own. With the blurred boundaries of working in the very profession you need, Lori finds herself seated in Wendell's office. Wendell is a therapist she discovered through a colleague by pitching to her an imaginary client that she was searching for the right person for him to talk to. Everything in his office is different than Lori's, including some of his tactics to understand her better, and Lori is both equally bewildered and admiring of Wendell's abilities to get to her own hidden truths.Weaved in, Lori shares about some of her most compelling clients and a bit of the psychology of our own actions and how we can learn to understand the motives of others.  Honestly, the insights are worthy of a good highlighter and a revisit through the tougher times in our lives. I found myself to be quite teary-eyed, particularly through a difficult case of a woman facing cancer. Lori shares her most difficult cases and how to love people even when they seem unworthy of it.I doubt you could read this and not take away something that would make your life a little better. We also can look forward to this one coming to television, telling Lori's stories through an ABC series.  I would definitely encourage you to read this one and to also pass it on to someone who could benefit from these lessons too....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,May 2019,"Jun 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37570546-maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone

Ami seems to always have the absolute best luck and Olive is her poor unlucky sister. When the entire wedding party gets food poisoning, at Ami's wedding, Ami decides to forfeit her honeymoon to Olive and Ethan (the brother-of-the-groom) to both go in their place.

This isn't your typical shallow thriller, it has a deep and compelling storyline that really builds believable twists and is filled with rich character development.Abi Knight receives a call in the middle of the night that her daughter, Olivia, has fallen off a bridge. Upon her arrival, she is informed that Olivia is brain dead and, as an enormous surprise to her mother, she is also pregnant. The doctor believes that they *may* be able to keep her baby alive if they keep Olivia on life support and want to do their best to give her child a fighting chance by keeping the baby in her womb as long as possible.The police rule her death as an accident, but Abi is troubled by the bruising around Olivia's wrists and begins to stumble upon a web of secrets that Olivia has been keeping from her. With the help of a detective, she has to confront her own troubled past, find out who the father of Olivia's baby is, and figure out who would have a motive to kill her daughter.McDonald writes Abi's journey with such raw honesty that it brought tears to my eyes.

It's why Amy decides to escape her suburban life to head to New York for a conference and to visit an old friend in New York City.Her old friend is impossibly stylish and working for a magazine and thinks Amy's getaway would make for an excellent piece. Nicknamed her Momspringa, to mimic the Amish teenage passage of Rumspringa, Amy receives a makeover and is encouraged to try dating again. Amy finds herself quite at home in the city and grapples with the blissful absence of responsibility and the welcome joy of having New York City all to herself.Do I want to leave my family?Absolutely not!I will say though that Amy's fictional escape was just what this Amy needed.

Told in alternating points of view, through past and present, you realize just how many people had a motive in Diana's death and how many layers she really did have to her own personal story.I couldn't put this one down and would recommend it for a strong thriller that genuinely delivers on those complex thriller plot twists.

The story centers around a family who have immigrated to the states and decided to open an experimental medical treatment facility that utilizes a pressurized oxygen chamber as a therapeutic device to treat complex medical cases like autism and infertility.When the device, known as the Miracle Submarine, explodes, killing two people, everyone becomes a suspect and each have their own motives that could throw their innocence into question.Told from alternating perspectives, Kim really builds layered characters that are real and relatable. I found the mother, who comes under scrutiny, to be among the most compelling because she is dealing with the heaviness of the day-to-day grind of appointments and struggles with her son and her need to escape from these burdens.If you are a fan of Celeste Ng or loved Defending Jacob, I have a feeling you will love this book as much as I did.

This was a big buzz book for Spring and has gotten a lot of positive press, in particular, about it's exploration of the #metoo movement, told through these reflective stories.I am having a hard time ing this one because the concept was brilliant, but I felt like the entire plot could have been tightened up entirely. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. The writing, while excellent, didn't always have a story that I felt entirely connected to.This novel is set in the 1980's at a highly competitive arts high school. Along with the talent and greed to get ahead, hormones are raging and relationships between students began to splinter and friendships are tested.In a spiral of events, Choi begins to flip the plot on its head that makes everything flip upside down for the reader. What you think may be happening, isn't happening, and a new perspective on the story changes the plot entirely.It is these new glimmers of truth that allow the reader to see that everything is not as it seems and the power that comes to play in the arts world.I can see this leading to heated discussions in book clubs about our own past experiences with adults and teachers, in particular, in the arts community. The changing narrative, in itself, becomes a trust exercise into itself.Not only are the kids doing these trust exercise in their classroom, but Choi is giving us an exercise in who to believe.Had the plot been tighter, I could see this being a 5-star read, simply for the value of the discussion and the smart twists Choi uses. I struggled to connect though as the chapters felt a bit clunky at times and I found myself having difficulty to keep attention through it.For reference though, I listened to this one on audiobook!

The author is now back with another beautiful love story, perfectly named, Things You Save in a Fire. Center's uses her husband's firefighter background to craft the story of Cassie Hanwell. In this fictional story, she is the only female firefighters in her Texas firehouse and is respected by her colleagues and boss. After a public incident though, that taints Hanwell's image, she finds the timing of her estranged and ailing mother's request to move to Boston lines up with when she needs to step down.She joins the Boston firehouse and finds the environment to be a bit of a ""boy's club."" Her ability to separate her work from her personal life has never been an issue, but Cassie has never seen a guy like the rookie that she must train with on her new job. Cassie has built up walls for a reason and the rookie seems to be disregarding them, no matter how hard she tries.This is a later coming-of-age story where Cassie must resolve her old hurts with her mother, confront the issue of aging parents, and admit why she has been unable to be close to anyone because of a traumatic incident in her past.That's not all though...she also must fight off someone who is stalking her and doesn't want to see her succeed at the fire station.These characters are deeply flawed, just like we are, and Center's does an incredible job making them feel real and relatable.The love story, I have to say, is FIRE and you can't help but root for these two brokenly beautiful people to love each other.Definitely, pre-order this one for your summer stack!I'm recommending this beautiful read for anyone who is a Taylor Jenkins Reid fan!

Her past columns were filled with liberal ideas and her column was nicknamed the ""Chronicles of a Radical Hag,"" by conservative readers.  She lived without censorship and would reply to her naysayers with tongue-in-cheek recipes to help them melt away their misdirected anger, unafraid to speak her mind about anything and everything.Haze is unexpectedly hospitalized though and unable to write her column. This is when Susan, who works for the paper, has her son (Sam) help work at the paper for the summer and Sam begins discovering that this older lady's stories are brave, hilarious, and her political struggles are not too different than today. He finds these columns so fascinating, in fact, that he begins sharing them in class and other kids begin to look forward to Haze's storytelling AND the hilarious and heartfelt replies from people who read her column.I am recommending this one for fans of Dear Mrs. Bird or anyone who needs a little bit of humor mixed in with the heaviness of the political world.Landviks' trademark humor really shines in this book and you can't help reading these columns and responses with a smile, especially when a younger generation is discovering how history is repeating itself today....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Apr 2019,"May 07, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/41757634-chronicles-of-a-radical-hag

All thoughts and opinions are my own! Dark Matter is one of my favorite science fiction book recommendations to give and ended up making my top ten books list in 2016. To say that I had HIGH expectations for the next Blake Crouch novel would be putting it mildly.I am so happy to say that this book DID NOT disappoint!In this story, Barry Sutton is an NYC cop who has been investigating the phenomenon the media has called, ""False Memory Syndrome."" It is a mysterious affliction that makes its victims mad with memories of a life that they never lived.Helena Smith is also trying to understand memory and wants to find a way that it can be captured, through her work as a neuroscientist. Inspired by her mother's struggles with dementia, she has decided to study memory and focus on a piece of technology that will allow people to preserve their most precious memories.As Barry begins searching for the truth, he discovers what happens when we play God with memory and how Helena's technology has helped to create this False Memory Syndrome. While sheltering ourselves from our most devastating memories, by rewriting our history, Barry & Helena begin to realize how altering memories can change our identity, our relationships, and how altering circumstances doesn't always yield the results we are after.When the technology gets into the wrong hands, they realize how it can destroy the world, as they know it, and they will stop at nothing to get it back, forced to repeat their lives over and over again, to try to change their circumstance.Once again, Crouch blends science fiction with a thriller pace and a beautiful love story.  His storytelling is masterful and the suspense is so incredibly good in this one.I immediately passed this book on to my husband who loved it just as much as me. I am so glad I got to screen this and feel confident recommending this one to our Dark Matter fans.If you haven't dipped your toes yet into the science fiction world, I have a feeling you will find this to be a compelling read that will pull you right out of your literary comfort zone.What are you waiting for?Be sure to pre-order this for June!...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Apr 2019,"May 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42046112-recursion

We will only let you escape once you tell us the name of the killer.  Agatha Christie fun meets Groundhog Day in this wildly inventive debut that will keep the reader guessing from start to finish. The reader knows that Evelyn Hardcastle will die. In fact, she will die every day until Aiden Bishop can identify her killer and break the cycle. Aiden finds himself waking up in a different body and repeating the day over and over again, armed with new information when he wakes.  Some of his hosts help him while others make his job very hard. Leaving clues for himself to find, he must win the game in order to leave the property...but that's just what everyone else wants to do to. It will be a fight to the surprising finish.Turton crafts some unlikable characters and creates beautiful tension when Aiden has to fight the impulses of the body he inhabits. His confusion though is the reader's confusion too so that is why the story keeps the reader on their toes throughout.Read on Kindle, I missed one of the most important elements to the story...the map and cast of characters to flip to.

I had high expectations after devouring The On the Come Up was a fantastic audiobook treat this month and powerfully narrated by Bahni Turpin. I had high expectations after devouring The Hate U Give, and Thomas delivers once again with this beautiful coming-of-age story.Bri's family is always desperately struggling to make ends meet, but they seem to face one hurdle after another, especially after the loss of her mother's job. Bri decides to pour her frustrations into songwriting and writes a powerful anthem about her struggle called On the Come Up. The lyrics are a lot harder than the way she actually lives her life and when her song goes viral, she is encouraged to be the things she is not to keep riding the success.With an eviction notice on their door, Bri has no choice but to lean into the image people have of her.  She also feels an additional pressure to be legendary because of her father and his rap career legacy. This mounting pressure is a major theme in Bri's life and in this story's pages.While I don't think the lessons were as hard hitting as the ones in her first book, Thomas still gives us a true coming-of-age story that will really make you root for Bri.I just have to say, once again, Turpin as a narrator is just GENIUS because the girl can RAP. The rap battles that Thomas writes are unreal good and Turpin handles them like a pro. They were so good, in fact, that I had my husband grab an earbud to listen to a few of these with me.Fans of old school rap will really dig this ode to hip hop that Thomas has crafted.  The author proves that she is no one-hit-wonder and I can't wait to read what she comes up with next!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,not setnot set,Mar 2019not set,"Apr 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35887567-on-the-come-up

All thoughts and opinions are my own! Once in a blue moon I run across a book that I think I could put in just about anyone's hands and they would love it. The book this year is, FOR SURE, Finding Dorothy. I did musical theatre for years and one of my favorites is The Wizard of Oz. That said, I didn't know a lot about the history of the book it was based upon or the behind-the-scenes events that had happened during the filming of the movie. I think that is why this book was such a treat because of the meticulous research by Letts to create this story.The book shares the true story of Maud & Frank Baum. Frank wrote the story of Oz, but the journey to success was a long one. His wife, far ahead of her time as a feminist, leaves behind her education to marry this magical man and start a life together. Their life is what shapes the story of Oz and it is incredibly beautiful.Later in life, Maud learns that M-G-M is adapting her late husband’s masterpiece for the screen. Somehow this seventy-seven-year-old firecracker finds a way to make it into the studio for the filming, something she really feels tasked to do. It is of the utmost importance that Frank's story is held in the same spirit that it was written. As Maud hears Judy Garland rehearsing, she recognizes the yearning that was her own yearnings as a girl. This yearning is why Maud decides she must protect Dorothy at all costs, just like she did so many years ago.I can assure you that this book will be in my top ten of 2019. It is magical and is recommended, in particular, for fans of The Greatest Showman.

Lucky readers were able to score I'm Fine and Neither Are You for free this past month. Since I really loved the author's last book so much, I was excited to dig into this next read.Penelope Ruiz-Kar is a relatable character as she is constantly treading water at her job and with all of her duties in the family.  Meanwhile, her best friend, Jenny Sweet, seems to have everything together. She writes a popular lifestyle blog, keeps a tidy home, has a child with impeccable manners, and a perfect marriage.It is why Penelope is genuinely floored when a shocking tragedy reveals that Jenny's life is far from what Penelope believed. In light of this turn of events, Penelope and her husband (Sanjay) agree to each write a list of changes they want each other to make and then commit them with honestly. The plan quickly begins to backfire though as secrets and resentment are revealed and the couple must deal with them.  This experiment changes the landscape of their relationship entirely, making Penelope question if honesty really IS the best policy.I won't reveal the tragedy that happens, but the narcissist in me wishes that the story was focused more on Jenny and her struggles because I think it could have been a deeper discussion to be shared in a book club than what it was. The tragedy, to me, was the most compelling part of the story, despite it being a bit controversial. The truth is, Jenny's life is where many of our Pinterest-filled heads are and it is important people see that online life a little differently.The marriage challenges though and Penelope's ""just keeping swimming,"" life are equally relatable for many. I found a lot of vulnerability in these characters and this experiment to be one that all marriages could benefit from, in some way.

All thoughts and opinions are my own! It has been a long time since I have read a historical fiction book that I was this swept away in, but The Things We Cannot Say, was incredible from start to finish. If you like your historical fiction to jump from past to present, told through alternating viewpoints, I have a feeling you will appreciate the format of this beautiful story.Since Alina Dziak was nine, she knew that she would marry her best friend, Tomaz. At fifteen she is engaged and unconcerned about the reports of Nazi soldiers at the Polish border, believing that they are her neighbors and not a threat.  She instead fills her head with dreams of the day that Tomasz will return from college so they can be married. Alina could never know though how the Nazi occupation would take over her rural village and how it had the power to destroy her relationship with her one true love.Presently, Alice is struggling with the challenges of her special needs child, a husband who doesn't get the work that goes into keeping their family floating, and her grandmother who is hospitalized. When her grandmother begs her to return to her childhood hometown, Alice begins to realize there is more to her grandmother's story than meets the eye. Leaving is never easy, especially with her juggle, but she makes the promise and heads to find out more about her grandmother and the secrets she has been keeping.This is a beautiful love story weaved in with the all-too-relatable struggle of being a modern day woman. Rimmel finds ways to weave this story very creatively that allows the slow unveiling of secrets to the reader.  This time in history is a heavy one and the shifting viewpoints really benefit in helping create a story that you can connect with in a myriad of ways. You can help but root for Alina and Tomaz through this haunting read.

I'm a big fan of Greer Macallister (you can read an interview we did with her over here) and found the premise for her new novel to be so intriguing.Charlotte's wealthy parents commit her beloved sister Phoebe to the infamous Goldengrove Asylum, and Charlotte just knows that there is more to the story than what her parents have revealed to her. In an effort to save her sister, she fakes an attempted suicide and surrenders her real identity, as a privileged young woman, to become a nameless inmate. Within the asylum Charlotte is now known only as Woman 99.The majority of our story is Charlotte trying to befriend people who can get her a step closer to her sister and to try to figure out a way that she can actually get to her within this asylum. She discovers that many of these women aren't insane, but merely inconvenient- and they are able to become some of her most powerful allies as she discovers just why Phoebe has been locked away.Macallister weaves a rich historical tapestry, but this is a slow burn at 368 pages. The first half felt very slow, but if you can hang with it, Macallister weaves a great mystery and has definitely done her research on what women would have been committed for, in this time period.Overall, she weaves a believable and satisfying ending that I think any reader would appreciate. Once you read through the Q&A with Greer, you really discover what an undertaking the research was to really bring this fictional asylum to life. While pacing was an issue for me, I appreciate the work that went into creating this beautiful sister story....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Feb 2019,"Mar 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38728901-woman-99

I selected it because it was a book that could be read in a day (a modest page count of just 240 pages) and because the plot was so intriguing. Lucky for us, this one will be coming to the big screen and I will be excited to see how they interpret this interesting story into film.Korede and Ayoola are two sisters that could not be more different from each other. Korede is the eldest and is a hard worker and disciplined. Ayoola, on the other hand, is gorgeous and a serial killer.As I said, these two couldn't be more different except that Korede is getting tired of cleaning up after her sister's messes. Each time she kills someone, Korede must help Ayoola dispose of the body and help with clean-up on the case.The plot thickens though when Ayoola sets her eyes on the wrong guy. At the hospital, where Korede works, she has been harboring a secret crush on a doctor that she works with. When Ayoola comes to visit Korede at work though, the doctor can't help but be completely captivated by Ayoola's beauty and falls head over heels for her.The problem?Well, Korede's broken heart, for one.More importantly though, his life is now at risk because Ayoola is a sociopath and he just might be her next victim.It's hard to pinpoint what genre this unique book falls under, but I read it as dark satire. If you were worried about the title or weren't on board for the gruesome world of serial killing, I think you will find that this doesn't lean too darkly into that element and more into the complex relationships of sisters.Overall, people seemed to enjoy this one a lot, especially for such a sparse book. She tells the story effectively without putting the reader through numerous killings or making them wade through filler to get to the meat of the story. Braithwaite also builds enough of a backstory for Ayoola that you understand where she's coming from, even if you don't always know where she's going....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Feb 2019,"Mar 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38819868-my-sister-the-serial-killer

On a rare kid-free evening, the wine flows and the women begin to loosen their guards and share more intimately about their lives.By Monday morning though, one of the women has disappeared.Despite feeling like they all know each other well, none of them can make sense of this disappearance. Kristin has always seemed happy, sociable, career-driven, and has weathered her impending divorce well. When the police come to investigate though, they find her soon-to-be ex-husband at the center of this case and have questions about what was really happening in their home.Frankly, no one REALLY knows what goes on behind closed doors and, as a reader, you don't know if Paul warrants sympathy or more scrutiny.I don't want to say anymore about the plot on this because half of the fun is finding out just what happened to this neighborhood mom.

All thoughts and opinions are my own! If you love lyrical writing, The Girls at 17 Swann Street is one you will not want to miss.This debut novel shares the haunting story of a young woman's struggle with anorexia and her struggle to reclaim her life.Anne Roux was a professional dancer that followed the man of her dreams from Paris to Missouri. Upon relocating she faces her own glaring imperfections, failures, and loneliness, and she must find a way to cope. Her disordered eating habits and depression bring her down to a mere eighty-eight pounds and she is forced to seek treatment.She is admitted to 17 Swann Street, a location where women with life-threatening eating disorders live. This unlikely community of women all must tackle their own individual demons and offer a surprising amount of support to one another as they recognize those demons in each other. Zgheib writes with raw honesty about what it is like to be consumed by this disease. Never glamorized, this really gives an eye-opening account of what it is like when each day is a struggle and when each bite feels like an affliction and loss of control.People who have never struggled with disordered eating may be able to better understand how hard it is to overcome an eating disorder. If you have ever struggled, you will find pieces of yourself in this story.  One can't help but root for Anne as she struggles to find her way to back to herself and to the man she loves.

All thoughts and opinions are my own! I have to say that, The Forgotten Hours, was this month's surprise debut that I just could not put down. We all know that I'm a sucker for a good coming-of-age story and this was a compelling mystery that was perfectly timed for the #metoo movement.At twenty-four, Katie feels like her life is really looking up. She has a great job, a supportive partner, and she is finally in a place where she can put her traumatic past to rest.You see, a decade earlier, her idyllic summer days with friends came to a shocking conclusion when her best friend accused her father of sexual assault. Katie stood by her father throughout the entire ordeal and his imprisonment. With his release in sight, reporters have been opening up this case, once again, for reinvestigation and Katie is forced to relive this difficult portion of her past.Told beautifully through reflection of on her friendship during that summer as well as the current state of affairs, Katie must grapple with her own conviction that her father was not guilty of the crime, as she sees her dad now through adult eyes. She also must acknowledge the glaring truth as she reexamines this adolescent summer.This would be an EXCELLENT book for a book club discussion because it is so beautifully told and because Schumann really builds mystery around this case. I think the biggest takeaway, for me, was how we all begin to see parents are human and flawed, as we get older, and how this new viewpoint can make us question the things in our past.This story is timely and a promising debut of good things to come from Schumann....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Feb 2019,"Mar 11, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41574593-the-forgotten-hours

All thoughts and opinions are my own! Queenie is one of the year's most anticipated novels and I have to say that I enjoyed this story immensely. Described as Bridget Jones's Diary meets Americanah, I felt it really delivered in sharing about what it would be like to be a Jamaican British woman who is navigating the world of dating today.Queenie is a 25-year-old woman living in London and straddling two cultures while fitting into neither. After breaking up with her white boyfriend, she begins to seek comfort in all the wrong places and puts herself into terrible situations that don't, ultimately, validate her self-worth.Queenie is surrounded by women who do their best to help Queenie overcome her breakup, but she can't seem to stop chasing after the wrong things. The reader is lead down each cringe-worthy scenario from unexpectedly awful sexual encounters,  to discovering that a man who seemed like he was Mr. Right was actually married,  to even the embarrassment of having to live with your grandparents because you can't pay your rent .Queenie begins the long journey towards healing when she begins to see a counselor and must learn to love herself, even in her brokenness.I loved this story for a couple of reasons.One, I think that Carty-Williams really showcases the difficulties of dating today and how many people treat dating sites like meaningless hookups instead of striving to find one's match. As someone out of the game, I really felt for Queenie and these terrible scenarios she found herself in.Secondly, I love seeing characters evolve and I think Queenie really grew through this experience and it helped propel our story as she finds love within and through surrounding herself with the right people.Carty-Williams writes with heartfelt honesty, humor, and with vulnerability. I hope we can follow more of Queenie's adventures in the future.  I highly recommend this one for fans of Insecure.

When Alice's grandmother, a reclusive author of cult-classic dark fairytales, dies alone in her Hazel Wood estate, Alice realizes just how bad her luck really can get. Her mother is stolen from her by someone from the Hinterland, a cruel supernatural world where Alice's grandmother's stories are set. The only message her mother has left behind is that she is to stay away from the Hazel Wood.It is then that she is forced to hit the road to try to find this magical Hazel Wood (who really listens to their mother, especially when she has been kidnapped?)  and she has the perfect guide...a classmate named Ellery Finch who has been a superfan of her grandmother's work for years. Alice quickly begins to realize though that Ellery may have his own agendas for wanting to find Hazel Wood and they just might not be noble ones.This is a rolicking adventure and so much fun to create a world around the dark fairytales.

Due to her ability to bring in the riches, she soon becomes known as the girl that spins silver into gold.When her boasting leads to the attention of the king of the Staryk- grim fey creatures who seem more ice than flesh- she unwittingly spins a web that draws in a pasant girl whose father plans to wed her to the tsar.But the Tsar isn't who he seems and the secret he has threatens to consume them all. Torn between these choices, Miryem, along with two unlikely allies, embark on a quest to save the world.Initially, I loved the story, but I found the story was very choppy and the switching of narrators pulled in so many different voices that I was confused whose point of view I was hearing the story from.

Audra is a hilarious chatty busybody that keeps Graham on his toes and seems to know what is happening around town at all times. For Graham, a private introvert, this can be quite exhausting. Audra throws him into situations where he is forced to be social with the oddest group of characters, like the strange members of his son's origami club,  leading to one awkward moment to the next.When Audra decides it is time to be friends with his ex-wife, Elspeth, she throws Graham's world into a tailspin as he begins to acknowledge the contrasts between these two women and wonder why he let Elspeth go. It is in these moments when he must face his own choices and if he made the right ones.I laughed out loud through soooo much of this book and found Audra to be wildly relatable (for the record, my husband found Graham to be- hahaha!).

After Poornima's mother dies, she is left to care for her siblings until her father can find another suitable match to raise them. Savitha ends up coming to work for their family and she and Poornima fall into a fast and beautiful friendship. Poornima finds herself inspired by Savitha's bravery and independence and the two begin to imagine a life that is beyond arranged marriages.Unfortunately, something terrible happens to Savitha that suddenly drives her away, leaving behind a heartbroken Poornima. Poornima will stop at nothing to find her friend and her journey leads her on one heartbreaking turn after another, living in the underbelly of India's darkest corners.This book is not for the highly sensitive reader as it explores human trafficking in the most brutal of ways. Rao is unflinching in her storyline and doesn't give her reader a single moment of glossed over happiness within this heartbreaking world of sex trafficking.I can read just about anything without reservations, but I had to step away from this novel at points and even had nightmares regarding this storyline.That said, my belief system is that we should know and talk about this stuff, perhaps, not to the brutal lengths this story went, but it lead me to really read more into human trafficking and try to understand this issue more. This novel gave me a deeper understanding of how easy it is to get into and how impossible it is to get out.My main complaint with this novel wasn't the horrific story, but the unsatisfying ending that Rao chose to end the story with.  As a reader, I felt owed a simple two sentence conclusion that would have brought me more peace of mind with these characters.

She is a smart girl who falls in love with the wrong guy and ends up pregnant. Rather than going to college and pursuing her dream as a writer, Stephanie finds herself in an impossible situation where she can never get ahead financially and now must find a way to feed herself and her child while keep a roof over their heads.Land takes a job working for a cleaning service as a maid and really spells out what it is like to hold this position and not feel seen by others.Bigger problems arise as she needs a vehicle to get back and forth, childcare that won't put her in the negative, and to also do what she can to keep her abusive partner happy.Have you ever had to drink coffee all day to stave off your own hunger so you can feed your child? Have you ever lived in a home that was infested with mold that continuously made it difficult for your child to breathe? Have you ever had to stay with someone who hurt you just a little longer so you wouldn't have to worry about having a home?Most of us have not.Land tells her story through her own journal entries of this time and it is heart wrenching. The story does hit a lag towards the last portion, but simply because being part of the working poor is a never ending saga of just trying to get ahead. It is a cycle that few can break out of and we see how broken our system is from cashing in government-funded food credit to the lack of support in the healthcare system.I am so happy that her story was published and it made me think about my own feelings about these issues and how I could do better in my own interactions and kindness towards others in our community.

I think it is a real tribute to Boyne's clever writing that he can craft someone so darn unlikable that you just have to keep reading. This novel achieves this by telling this story through different narrators that can, at times, be confusing and keep the reader on their toes.Maurice has always wanted to be a writer, but he just can't come up with a good story. He will do all he can though to achieve his fame and fortune by stealing the stories of others, by any means necessary, and calling them his own.Maurice has zero remorse for any of his actions and the reader gets to witness how he manipulates and coerces stories out of others and receives the fame he has always been dreaming of.Adding to the shifting viewpoints, we can also see Maurice age and lose his charm over others. It is when he gets older that the truth really begins to unfold to a student who wants to write a piece on him for college. No longer feeling the need to tell any lies anymore, he reveals his truth in all its glory, leading to some really smart plot twists that lean heavily into the realms of good dark satire.I loved this story for its unique viewpoint and also found it fascinating that Boyne did craft Maurice from someone he encountered in his own life.

These consequences loom while the reader wishes for a miracle themselves that will pull them all together.The cover compares this to The Snow Child, which I can see in this story's themes, but it doesn't have that storybook quality that I think you can find in that story.

Desperate to relieve her anguish, she goes to India to uncover the answers of her family's past.When she arrives, she is greeted by Ravi, a trusted former servant of her family, and he has been waiting for Jaya to share the beautiful stories of her grandmother's life. Growing up in the traditional Indian culture, her grandmother is a gifted storyteller with a big heart and strong spirit. Her husband dislikes these glimmers of independence, but also gives her the space she so desperately craves.When a school is opened in the village, she is given the generous offer of being a teacher at the school and in exchange Amisha will be gifted English lessons. This generous offer is gifted to her by a handsome soldier who is stationed there during the British occupation. He can never know what a joyful gift it is and the heartache that will, in turn, come from that gift.Badani writes again with kindness and wisdom for Indian customs and the religious beliefs they have built upon. I always learn so much from her writing and she does a phenomenal job of showing the beauty of India while also acknowledging the harder to swallow truths of the caste system and superstitious punishments that have been gifted within the family.More importantly, given tasked to write the poetic stories of Amisha AND the task of telling Amisha's story...well, that would take a talented storyteller to pull off.

All thoughts and opinions are my own.The Gown is going to be one of those buzz books this winter that everyone will be talking about, I guarantee it.Instead of exploring the story of the royal family and all of its mystery, Robson decides to explore a royal wedding through a different set of eyes. These eyes she chooses to tell her story through are those of the women that made and embroidered the dress of Princess Elizabeth when she wedded Lieutenant Philip.Set in 1947, Ann Hughes & Miriam Dassin are talented embroiderers that have been tasked with the intricate stitching that will adorn the royal bride's priceless wedding gown. Following the royal wedding though, Ann moves and never tells her family of her life in London and the work she did for this famous gown.It is only in 2016, when Ann's granddaughter stumbles upon a box of her late grandmother's belongings that she finds a set of hand-stitched flowers with no background information on them. What she discovers though is that these motifs are the same that decorated the Queen Elizabeth II's gown and she begins to wonder if there was more to her grandmother's story than she realizes.Heather travels to London to unravel the past that Ann never shared with her family and her secret friendship with Miriam Dassin, a celebrated artist and Holocaust survivor.Robson discusses, rather frankly, her struggles with finding information on the real women behind the real gown. It was through a chance meeting that she got in touch with Betty Foster, a woman who aided in the actual embroidery of the dress, that she was able to use this interview to flesh out these characters, along with her own independent research at another embroidery house.An excerpt of the interview with Betty appears at the end of the book and showcases how much her voice shaped Robson's writing and these gorgeous characters that she has crafted.Fans of, Secrets of a Charmed Life and the show, The Crown, will DEFINITELY be swept away in this gorgeous book.I absolutely loved it!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Dec 2018,"Dec 29, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39893613-the-gown

All thoughts and opinions are my own.Veronica has been struggling with postpartum depression ever since the death of her husband collided with the birth of her daughter. Her depression is so deeply rooted that she is unable to even touch her beautiful baby girl and knows that her daughter would be so much better without her.That is why she is horrified when her home is broken into, while her mother is caring for her daughter, and she discovers that her daughter has gone missing. Due to her fragile mental state though, she soon realizes that she is the primary suspect in this disappearance and she will now stop at nothing to be reunited with her baby girl and finally be the mother she has always known she could be.Ah, but nothing is ever as it seems when it comes to unreliable narrators, is it? Veronica is a mentally unstable guide in our story and there is soooo much more than the reader could ever guess.I loved the smart plot twists that Bleeker has woven into this story and found it to be a quick page turner that delivered on an ending that I could have never guessed.Anyone who has ever struggled with postpartum depression or the guilt of not measuring up as a mom will find Veronica to be very relatable character with flaws that seem fitting for her circumstance....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Dec 2018,"Dec 29, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/38121937-the-waiting-room

Despite my thriller burnout, I couldn't have loved, Jane Doe more! If you are having Joe withdrawal, this thriller gave me all the same sociopathic fun feelings as I got with my addiction to the Caroline Kepnes series.Jane is probably the most unremarkable woman ever. She secures a day job at a mid level insurance company, has zero fashion sense, and has a cheap apartment filled with cheap furniture. A girl like this might not catch everyone's eye, but it does catch the eye of the middle manager, at her insurance agency, and Steven Hepsworth won't take no for an answer.Jane is hiding something though. The only person that her sociopathic heart has ever loved was her best friend, Meg. Meg commits suicide though, all because of her relationship with Steven.Now it is time for Steven to pay.If you love a good game of cat & mouse in your thrillers, this one is wickedly sadistic and, at times, laugh-out-loud hilarious. Steven is a character you will love to hate and Stone builds a great complexity and layering to Jane that makes her highly intriguing.If you need a quick page-turner with a sadistic spin (come on, I know I'm not alone!!), snag this fantastic thriller today....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Dec 2018,"Dec 29, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36531070-jane-doe

Kang uses her own background in medicine, working as a practicing physician on the side, and crafts the incredible story of a girl born with two hearts in 1850.Cora, born out of wedlock to a wealthy socialite and nameless immigrant, is the stuff that legends are made of. At a time in history where grave robbers would dig up freshly buried bodies for profit, she knows that her own body would garner a fine wage for a resurrectionist and builds her own business as a trusted resurrectionist to protect her identity and her own phenomenal medical miracle.Acting as herself and posing as a brother, she is able to both administer the deals and help with the digging.She isn't the only one though looking for bodies that can serve as specimens for dissection and display. A series of murders has begun, beating Cora to her profits and worrying her that she could be the next victim.Well-written and beautifully researched, I devoured this book and can't wait to dig into Kang's debut novel next.If you are a fan of Fingersmith (please say you are!!), you are going to flip for this incredible read!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Dec 2018,"Dec 29, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39344110-the-impossible-girl

He comes from a privileged family and seems to have the right connections. Tatum, however, is a struggling actress who is working as a bartender at an NYC dive bar. When the two meet, they fall in love and get married.The thing is, Tatum's career takes off and Ben finds his own career is fading.This touching love story is told from two perspectives with one rewinding history and one moving their story forward, both laced with their own bias and regret.Told from their unique perspectives and with this shifting timeline, the raw honesty in each of their stories really pulls through in a really unique way.Usually, I find I gravitate toward one perspective, but this wasn't the case with this one. I loved seeing each of these viewpoints and Scotch does an incredible job fleshing these out.I must admit, I have read all of Scotch's books and her debut has always been my favorite...That is, until I read this one.This is a love story that really delivers and will definitely be on my top ten this year!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Dec 2018,"Dec 29, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30964544-between-me-and-you

All thoughts and opinions are my own.I was a huge fan of Loigman's debut novel, The Two-Family House, and so excited to see that she was continuing down the path of historical fiction with her second novel.Loigman shines when exploring complicated family relationships, and one of the most complicated is the love of two sisters. In this story, two estranged sisters find themselves reunited at the Springfield Armory in the early days of WWII.Ruth & Millie could not be more different and their contrasts are often brought front and center by their mother who seems to find favor with Millie. Her need to pit them against each other causes them each to carry secrets from one another and to grow apart.When Millie loses her husband and finds herself penniless though, she comes to stay with Ruth to find a job and shelter. Ruth's bitterness has not gone away, especially as Millie seems to attract attention, just as she did when they were young.Secrets can't stay buried forever though and the reader is taken along the very strained journey to the twisted conclusion where each sister must own their part in the story.Loigman weaves the chapters together flawlessly and utilizes many voices to help round out the story. It is evident that she has done a lot of research on the Springfield Armory and the types of jobs the women would have held while their husbands were at war.Just like her first book, the story seems straightforward, but Loigman is so gifted with building a character-driven story that would give a book club a lot to chat about.Be sure to add this one to your stack this month, it does not disappoint!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Dec 2018,"Dec 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39863502-the-wartime-sisters

You see, this sculpture didn't just end up in NYC.  It ended up in cities all over the world and no one knows how they got there.The story builds out from there as April tries to be the first to discover the mystery of these metal fixtures (nicknamed Carl). She isn't the only one looking for the answers though and this becomes a contest that the whole world seems to be participating in.My husband loved all the geeky fun in this one, but I loved the more complex moral exploration of how social media can change us and our relationships with others.Although this one is supposed to be in the adult category of literature, it read more like a YA read to me.This was a strong debut (what else could we ever expect from John Green's brother?) and the ending to this one screams sequel.Fans of Ready Player One will LOVE this fun read! 5 out of 5 Stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Nov 2018,"Dec 17, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24233708-an-absolutely-remarkable-thing

All thoughts and opinions are my own.Taylor Jenkins Reid is one of my favorite authors and I was so psyched when I won a copy of her next novel, Daisy Jones & the Six (releasing March 5th, available for pre-order). I have to say, timing this book with catching, A Star is Born, this week really could not have been more perfect. Reid has crafted a fictional band story set in the 1970's that was so beautifully rendered that you can't believe it is even fiction.Daisy is the girl that every girl wants to be. She is stunning and has the ability to capture any man's attention, sneaking out to clubs when she is just a kid, and capturing the heart of anyone her heart desires. She finds she has a knack for singing, a knack that people spend years trying to train their voices to achieve.The Six is lead by Billy Dunne and is also getting noticed in the music world. Billy is an addict who has just discovered that he is going to be a father and he feels he needs to sow his wild oats before settling down.When Billy & Daisy cross paths, a producer realizes that putting these two voices together could be just the ticket to make them all successful.Told in interview format, the reader uncovers the story of Daisy Jones & the Six from their humble beginnings to their explosive endings. It's the stuff of legends, as all good rock and roll stories are.As a reader, don't be surprised if you don't find yourself thinking of these people as real people. Reid is such a wildly talented writer that it should come as no surprise that this book is just as wildy fabulous as she is.Be sure to pre-order and read this one before you see it!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Oct 2018,"Nov 12, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40554142-daisy-jones-the-six

Resourcefully, Kya finds ways to secure food and clothing, with help from a shop owner who takes mercy on her. Thanks to her love of nature, Kya never feels entirely abandoned because the animals and world around her make her feel like she is surrounded by friends.As she grows up, her beauty and the mystery around her intrigues two local boys, that both make a way into her heart.Years later though, one of those boys is found dead and the locals immediately suspect that Kya is the suspect. Known as the, ""Marsh Girl,"" no one in town likes or trusts her. How could they possibly trust her though because they don't even know her?The story goes back and forth through time as Kya goes from a frightened young girl to a more confident author to becoming the main suspect in a murder investigation. This story begs the question, can we ever escape our past?If you are looking for an audiobook to enjoy this month, this one is BEAUTIFULLY narrated and should be savored.

When Boss discovers she is pregnant with his first son, he sends her away to America where she can be cared for by the top doctors and kept on the right diet and regime to insure he will have the healthy son he has always wanted.Oh, and he needs her to leave too because he is already married with three daughters of his own.Unfortunately, this place that Boss has sent her to is nothing like it had been described in the brochures. The conditions are horrible, the caretaker is evil, and Scarlett would do anything to escape.In the end, that is exactly what she does, with a surprise stowaway in the back of the stolen van she hijacked.What Scarlett doesn't know is that Boss needs her baby in his life to fight a battle of his own. He will stop at nothing to find Scarlett and his child, because it means life or death for him. His unrelenting hunt for her terrifies Scarlett because she knows she will be punished for running away.Scarlett will stop at nothing to keep them both safe and Boss will stop at nothing to make sure they are found.This book is just INCREDIBLE and, again, you will see this one on my top ten list, FOR SURE. Hua's writing has the rich qualities of Lisa See where she is able to see a story through with these characters from beginning to end.She also told a story that I just did not want to end.I really hope there is a sequel in the works because it is that good.This novel is gripping and perfectly timed for understanding more of what it is like to be an immigrant.

They are well-cared for, adored by their mother, and given everything they need.While Chula & Cassandra are carefree and curious, Petrona (who is around their same age) is folding under the burden of being the breadwinner for her family. She ends up finding a job, working as a live-in maid for Chula & Cassandra's mother.  Living in their home is a true blessing since she has grown up in the guerrilla-occupied slums.When Petrona meets her first love though, she finds herself in the middle of a horrible situation that threatens her safety, the safety of her family, and the safety of the family she is working for. This relationship really sets the plot in motion as you worry for each of these girls and their safety.I am not sure why I'm not hearing more about this novel because it is a powerful and devastating read.

Yale Tishman is a development director for an art gallery in Chicago and, as his career begins to really flourish, his friends are dying around him, one by one.Meanwhile, thirty years later, Nico's younger sister is in Paris desperately trying to reconnect with her daughter who has joined a cult.

The friendships that are weaved are beautiful and believable. I loved these characters and the gorgeous writing that Makkai brings to the table.

All thoughts and opinions are my own.Picoult's latest is definitely one of those buzz books that many people have been looking forward to, including myself. I wanted to be sure to read this one early so I could share my thoughts with you on it!In this novel, patients and staff are held hostage in an abortion clinic by a distraught gunman. As a hostage negotiator struggles to negotiate with this man, he later discovers that his daughter also happens to be one of the hostages. This situation becomes all-too-personal, but he refuses to allow anyone else to take the case over, especially after building trust and dialogue with the shooter.As is her signature, the story is told through all the different viewpoints from someone who is protesting the clinic, someone who has just undergone an abortion, a doctor who performs the abortions, and a girl who just picked the wrong day to get birth control. With eight different viewpoints, the topic of pro-life and pro-choice is addressed from all different angles.Picoult decides to tell this story in reverse chronological order which sometimes works (like this book, for example), but  can also sometimes create a bit of confusion and disconnection to characters for their readers. Since we open with the conclusion, I felt less vested in this story than I had hoped to be.I  have no problem with the topics of pro-life or pro-choice, but in order to create a less biased slant on the topic, I felt a bit preached to, in certain sections, for Picoult to drive home that both sides have reasons for their viewpoints.As we have come to expect with Picoult, she does weave a trademark twist, but it wasn't enough to redeem the confusion and disconnection I had with these characters.Even though this book was a miss, for me, I will still read anything Picoult serves up and hope to connect more with her next novel. Regardless, I appreciate and am always intrigued by her research when writing her novels and she did a lot of research, on both sides of the table, to create this story.I can see how this one might spark a lively book club discussion though, but with such a hot button topic, you probably want to reserve it for a group that you can engage in that kind of dialogue with and still do life with later.Curious who Picoult wishes would read this novel? You might appreciate her answer, especially after this month.Although I find this topic a tired one, if you are looking for a fresh take on this controversial topic, I found this documentary a bit more compelling than this novel this month....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Sep 2018,"Oct 02, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/39072210-a-spark-of-light

Quinn has been hoping for a child of her own, but not like this. Strangely, Lucy looks an awful lot like her sister and she must question if Nora's had a secret child that she's been hiding from their family all these years.While she struggles to honor her sister's wishes, she worries just what Nora could have gotten them into and if they are all now at danger.Baart is a gifted storyteller and shared, through our discussion, that she was able to flesh out a lot of Lucy's character through her own adoption of her daughter.

No one would have ever suspected that Georgiana Shaw, a wealthy executive rising in a pharmaceutical company, could have been involved in any way back then. The truth is though that Georgiana (nicknamed Geo) has known all along where Angela has been buried.You see, the love of her high school life is now known as a serial killer. The two of them were the only ones that ever knew what happened to Angela and now Geo must pay for withholding evidence in the case.Geo has learned the hard way what it takes to get ahead in life and she isn't afraid to do that while serving time. Now the reader gets a taste of the new Geo and the sharp contrast of her teenage innocence and the boy who had captured her heart.This book goes to some dark places and is one of those stories that keeps you up until the wee hours of the night so you can uncover all of Geo's secrets.

After a strained night and a near-miss car crash, they receive a visitor who calls himself, ""The Keeper.""

Although I had also known the general premise of Lolita, I had no point of reference that this novel had been based on a true life kidnapping crime. In Rust & Stardust, Greenwood pulls back the curtain on this horrific case and chillingly illuminates what all this girl had been through.In 1948, Sally Horner is desperate to get into the cool club with a group of girls from school. As part of her initiation process, she has to steal a notebook at a local drugstore.  When a man with the F.B.I.  sees her take this notebook, he tells her that she must pay for her crime and that he won't rat her out to her parents, as long as she follows all of his instructions.He poses as a father from a friend from school and says that they are going on a beautiful beach vacation and would like to take Sally along with them. Sally's mother, struggling with debilitating arthritis and pain, knows that Sally will have a wonderful adventure and begrudgingly allows her to accept the invitation. Sally knows that she must go on this trip for her court hearing and punishment for the stolen notebook.The thing is, this guy is actually a dangerous child predator who has just been released from prison and Sally is his latest conquest.This book wrecked me in the same ways that, A Little Life, ripped a little of my heart out. Nabbing criminals back then is a frustrating process to witness, let alone be a victim too. It takes a strong reader to read this one and I have a feeling Sally's story is going to be imprinted on my heart for a very long time.

Khakpour narrates her own story of struggling with a chronic illness and her difficulties with getting answers on her failing body while fighting the racism of others during our tumultuous political years.The author is an Iranian-American, a writer, and a lifelong sufferer of undiagnosed health problems. After spending over $100,000 on medical bills, she finally receives her answer that she has Lyme disease. In this tell-all, she shares about her own physical illness as well as her mental illness that is uncovered as she struggles with getting the answers and treatment she needs to move forward.Unflinchingly, Porochista writes honestly about her addiction to prescribed benzodiazepines and how her illness strips her of  her own identity as a writer as well as her difficulties in maintaining relationships with others when she is so sick.If you struggle with a chronic illness (or have someone in your life who does), you will nod your head through large portions of this book and how your struggles often don't feel validated by others and the encouragements to, ""just get over,"" your illness. Khakpour self-destructs through large portions of this book, which can be frustrating to hear as a reader, but those times of self-destruction are often warranted when you hear her raw and difficult journey to diagnosis....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jul 2018,"Aug 05, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/33026961-sick

This month's selection, ""Salt Houses,"" was an excellent example of another book that pushed me out of my normal reading comfort zones.On the eve of her daughter Alia’s wedding, Salma reads the girl’s future in a cup of coffee dregs. She sees an unsettled life for Alia and her children, along with much travel and luck.  She decides not to share these predictions with her daughter, but finds that this all comes to pass when their family is uprooted in the wake of the Six-Day War of 1967.Alyan ambitiously writes the story of three generations, within one Palestinian family, and how each of them views different times in history, their own displacement, and what home means to them. Her background as a poet really brings a lyrical quality to this story and challenges the reader to think about these different times in history through the eyes of this Palestinian family.I had never even heard of the Six-Day War before, and it is stories like these that make me thankful that historical fiction exists. These stories challenge my viewpoints on many times in history and also allow the reader to see the story differently as it is told through the generations.While I enjoyed this one, the constant shifting in narrative made it difficult to follow this story. Alyan provides a family tree at the beginning of the book and you will need it to constantly reference who each of these characters are. The story would have been more effective, for me, if it had been told through just a couple of viewpoints so I could better get into the rhythm of what was happening....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jul 2018,"Aug 05, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30971664-salt-houses

All thoughts and opinions are my own.I am going to guess that, ""Vox,"" is going to be a book that a lot of people are going to be talking about this month. Hot off the heels of the success of the Handmaid's Hulu series, Dalcher explores this same topic with a bit of a dystopian slant.Imagine you live in a world where women are only allowed 100 words per day.  Dr. Jean Mcclellan could have never imagined that the political officials would have ever been able to pass such a law, but she now finds herself wearing an electronic bracelet where each word is counted and each word overage is punished. When the president needs her expertise to help his brother recover from an accident, where his brain speech center has suffered from disruption, she decides to leverage this to have her word count bracelet removed and utilize this opportunity to help herself and her family.Dalcher uses her background as a linguist in a really clever way through this story. This story is a really uncomfortable one and questions our own role as women and our silence during political times.

Lucia plows ahead and marries an incredible man, only to leave him and have a baby with a young Latino immigrant.Once she has her child though, she finds that the voices are beginning again, impacting her ability to care for her child. She moves her new family to Ecuador and back again, but no matter where she is, her mental illness follows her.If you are on the hunt for a great book to discuss with your own book club, this is such a good one. It really explores what our roles are when someone we love has a mental illness and the blurred lines of caring for them while still allowing them the freedom to make their own decisions about their health.If you are a fan of Celeste Ng's work, I have a feeling that this book will resonate with you.

As always, they were right and this was a wonderful thriller to listen to this summer.The May Mothers are a local mom's group that meet twice a week at the park to share their challenges with new motherhood. The ladies have yet to socialize outside of this though so they decide to meet at a hip bar in town for drinks to get to know each other better and get a break from their babies.Winnie, a single mother, is reluctant to leave her child for the outing, but is convinced that this will be a good move to get away for a bit and relax. Her child is kidnapped though and Winnie, an extremely private person, finds that her whole life has been opened up for the whole world to see.Though none of the moms are close, they all go to risky lengths to try to help find her son. Told from alternating perspectives, each mother is carrying a few secrets of her own and as the police begin to uncover them, they began to wonder if one of these ladies just might be involved.I am picky about my thrillers and this one delivered for a light summer thriller that had me guessing the whodunit through a good portion of this story.

All thoughts and opinions are my own.I have come to rely upon Emily Giffin as a great summer escape and was surprised by the meat and depth that I found in her latest novel, All We Ever Wanted. Hot off the trails of the #metoo movement, Giffin explores a fictional story of an inappropriate image that is passed around a prep school of a teen girl, passed out and scantily dressed, captioned with a racist caption below the image. At the center of the controversy is one of the most prominent families and their well-respected son who took the picture that could cost him his coveted college acceptance to Princeton. The case must be brought to trial at the school and there are more twists and turns than either of them could ever expect.This book is EXCELLENT and I finished it in just a day. It would lend itself so well to a book club discussion as we grapple with social media and the sexualization of teen girls. Giffin crafts characters that are believable and layered. She also creates a smart and unexpected ending for this story that I think you will really appreciate.Although I've appreciated Giffin's books in the past, I have to say that this one is, by far, my favorite!Reading Challenge Completed- A book you can read in a day...more",Notes are private!,-1,2,1,not set,May 2018,"Jun 05, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36344555-all-we-ever-wanted

She gives birth to her daughter in an institution for unwed mothers and will stop at nothing to keep her.In order to provide for her daughter, she must work as a wet nurse, nursing a child that is not her own, to pay her bills.Told in diary format, it is an achingly beautiful read about the unbelievable challenges of motherhood and the sacrifices that must be made to keep your child safe.I learned so much about what the role of a wet nurse really looked like and what these institutions really looked like for children during this time.

This dynamic is quite toxic as Richard and Karina must learn to live together again and face the horrific and heartbreaking decline of Richard's health.Richard is an unlikable character from beginning to end and I do think that this makes Karina's sacrifice even greater because he is so ungrateful. Some readers may struggle with a connection to him, but you definitely won't struggle to sympathize as you see the gravity of this illness and how quickly it takes over the body.I cry about once a year over a book, thanks to a hardened soul and reading so much.This book WRECKED ME.I was crying reading it and then two days later I was still crying about it. It moved me emotionally, in ways that books rarely do.Once I came to the end and saw all of the people that Genova lovingly mentions that shared their journey with ALS with her, you see how much thought and research went into this project. Genova's compassion in telling this story is, truly, a gift.Be sure to add this one to the top of your book stack this month!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2018","Jun 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36082326-every-note-played

Do you engage in risky behaviors because you know you know when you will die anyway?

I snagged it through Book of the Month, but I ended up listening to this one instead.This book tells the story of a man who is wrongfully incarcerated and how this couple does their best to continue to keep their marriage alive. A love triangle ensues, between the husband, wife and her childhood friend. It all comes to a shattering halt when Roy, the husband, gets out early from his twelve year sentence and their marriage is completely in question.You do sympathize with the characters and wonder what you would do if put in this place. Roy feels like he has to pay for something he didn't do and then pay for it again. Celestial, the wife, also grows up and evolves into a different person. It's a difficult circumstance that would be a great one to discuss in your book club.I will say, I was looking for a bit more depth on this one, particularly with the wrongful arrest and I can't say that I actually had a deep connection with any of the characters.I would say if you plan to read this one, the narration was beautifully done through the audiobook and it helped me to connect more with the letters that are written back and forth from the prison.As with all buzz books, I'm not sure I embraced the hype, but I certainly enjoyed the story....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Feb 2018,"Mar 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33590210-an-american-marriage

It reminded me that there were many that felt that way and still had to serve. His decision to not participate in the war and heading to Canada, only later to return and serve, made his storytelling even more real for me.O’Brien shares the soldier’s stories, but points out that no story about the Vietnam War should be a beautiful one with a good ending. The stories are gritty, raw, and real. You can’t help but connect to these men and feel compassion for them. I can see why so many say that this should be required reading.

Kellan provides the things she and her brother need like food, and helping her with school, and making sure she has shoes…You know, the stuff your parents are supposed to do.Lines become quickly blurred though when Wavy develops a crush on Kellan and the two become inseparable.

I expected a lot of predictability with this book and Dunn surprised me with some really witty dialogue, twists I didn’t see coming and a town of characters that rivaled the infamous folks in Big Little Lies.Owen & Lucy have a dinner party where friends share with them about an “arrangement,” a couple they know is having in an open marriage (no questions, no guilt) where they can explore having relationships with other people while keeping their marriage happy and healthy.They feel inspired to devise their own six-month arrangement where they can explore relationships with other people, but it must end after six months. What follows is anything but predictable for either of them and the reader gets to go on one tryst to another,  then concluding their days by coming home to raise their autistic son together.There are loads of laugh-out-loud moments and some heartfelt ones that resonated with me since we experienced many similar parenting moments to this couple. It also solidified that open marriage, while fun reading in a book, is definitely not for me! I do admit, the husband getting “chored” by his mistress was a treat that brought all the LOL’s.Seriously, I really enjoyed the wild ride with these two and the book ended up being a lot less fluff and more satisfying than I expected....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jul 2017,"Aug 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30841908-the-arrangement

This story reads like Brooklyn had a baby with The Two-Family House so if you enjoyed those, don’t miss this one!This story explores the lives of two sisters who come to America in the late fifties. One sister is wildly enjoying her newfound freedom while the other is promised to marry a boy she doesn’t love, but finds the responsible sister role to be an easier one. When Theresa, the “fun” sister, ends up pregnant, her sister comes up with a plan to save her reputation while making sure her son is loved and safe.The book explores the past and present as each sister makes life-altering decisions that lead them down very different paths.  When Nora’s son dies, it brings the two sisters back together again while unleashing a load of family secrets in the process.As far as criticism goes, I did think it went on just a tad too long in the building of the story, while the ending felt abrupt to me. I wanted more of the conclusion fleshed out, after the long journey, but I understand Sullivan had to end it at some point.

Mullen's book builds upon the true story of the first eight African American police officers that served in the late 1940's in Atlanta. I was completely oblivious to their stories and trials that they faced in these roles and Mullen's tells an unflinching portrait of the daily challenges that these men faced, racially and in their roles at work.When a black woman is murdered in their town, the white officers start covering up their involvement while the black officers are limited in how they are able to investigate the case. The book is told from alternating perspectives from the officers on each racial side as the book builds a story of corruption and racism that will leave the reader guessing until the final pages.Thomas Mullen happens to be a white male author and, apparently, submitted this manuscript without his name or picture attached. When it crossed the desk of one of the top black editors in publishing history, it was selected for publication. The acclaim has been so great that it has now been optioned for a television series.

Radium was one of those things that we discovered that had been an additive to many household products because people thought radium had health benefits. In this book, Kate Moore does an incredible exploration of the women who were most affected by the use of radium in a radium-dial factory and how corporate greed became more important than the safety of its employees.Women often had to start working in their teen years, since educating women wasn't a worthy investment in the 1920's, and many soon discovered that the job that was paying the most was working in a radium-dial factory. These women were in charge of painting the faces of watches with this glow-in-the-dark paint and the quicker and more they could produce the work, the more valued they were as an employee. They found by licking the tips of the paintbrushes (as was even encouraged by their supervisors) they could paint much quicker and do a better job in the details of these watches. Since radium was heralded as being healthy, the girls had no problems ingesting it and even were known to paint their teeth, lips, and eyes with it for a fun night on the town.When the girls began becoming ill and dying, doctors could not figure out why their patients were dying in such horrific and painful ways. When they began to suspect that their factory jobs may have something to do with it, the corporations continued to ignore their concerns and did not change their safety standards, putting more women at risk every single day.This story documents these girls and their stories as well as the court battle that they endured after they were convinced that radium was to blame. It is a heartbreaking read that I had a difficult time with, but am so thankful I read. These women were true heroes and Moore's writing is captivating and compassionate as she tells their stories.If you are planning on reading just one nonfiction book this year, let it be this one!Reading Challenge Category Completed- A nonfiction book...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,May 2017,"Jun 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31409135-the-radium-girls

Beartown is one of the most anticipated books this year from Fredrik Backman. If you are looking for another Ove novel, this one is not it and is very different than anything Backman has written before. I love it when a novelist take risks and Backman does just that with this new novel.Beartown is set in a small forest town obsessed with hockey.  The Bears of Beartown win and they have their strongest team yet and a true possibility of winning the national semi—finals. Just as they approach their biggest game of the season, a violent act occurs that threatens the reputation of the strongest player on the team. To make matters worse, the family involved in this act also happens to be in charge of the hockey team. A father is then placed in a position he could have never conceived especially when an entire town is ready to demonize anyone who would ever speak against their star player.Much like Into the Water, Backman has taken on a large cast of characters and the first half of the book feels mostly like introductions to each person to set the stage for the turning point in the plot. Although I love Backman’s writing, the first half felt sluggish. As so many other readers had promised, when reading other s, the second half was much better once the plot actually got moving.This is still a solid read, but you have to have the patience to power through the first half to get to the meat of the plot....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2017,"Jun 17, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/33413128-beartown

Here is what I will say. The mystery does get solved, but Hawkins lost me in the process.  I plowed through hoping that the plot would pick up, that there might be a dramatic twist and big reveal…yeah, nope.  Police procedural books aren’t usually my favorite, but I had hopes she could weave a compelling story that would hook me.I will still give Hawkins another try on her next book, but this one just didn’t do it for me.

Sharon is steady and reliable while Mel brings a chaotic wildness to her work.

It is that kind of twisted, dirty, and weird familial experiences that you are going to have if you decide to crack open this thriller.This book is about a dirty family secret that has had great power over the wealthy Roanoke Girls and the power is so strong that many of them die. When one of the girls goes missing, her cousin returns to face the demons that have always haunted her.Do a little research if you have issues with triggers because this one might not be for you.  I found the audiobook to be a great escape this week and would recommend it for people who like their thrillers dark and dirty.Oh, you know who you are!

Christopher Knight, at the mere age of 20, decided to leave his home in Massachusetts, drive to Maine, and disappear into a forest to not return for almost three decades.Yup, I said TRUE story.Knight relied upon the neighboring homes for stealing the items he needed to survive and upon his capture, Finkel reached out to write him and to learn more of his own personal story.  Through those initial letters, Finkel formed as much of a friendship as one could with a hermit, and learned of Knight’s survival skills through brutal Maine winters and why he preferred the isolation.With commentary from many experts, it’s a fascinating read on why some people flourish better in isolation and why humans crave relationships in the way that we do. The amount of effort Finkel goes through to carve an accurate story of Knight is admirable, but at times uncomfortable because a hermit doesn’t necessarily want to share his life story with the world. That's kind of why he disappeared...Reading Challenge Category Completed- A book you can read in a day...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Mar 2017,"Apr 02, 2017",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/30687200-the-stranger-in-the-woods

Although I have been a big fan of his work on The Daily Show, I have an entirely new respect for this man and the survival skills he used during his youth in apartheid South Africa.Noah is truly, “born a crime,” because his birth is seen as a criminal act since he was born to a white father and black mother. To keep him from not being rounded up for an orphanage, he often was sidelined indoors instead of playing outside with his peers. His mother also employed survival techniques, like pretending to be his maid instead of his mother, to just be able to play at the park with her son.The reader is taken through the story of his childhood that, even in its darker moments,  Noah manages to add heart and humor to each and every story. This brave little mischievous boy’s story will pull at every heartstring and illustrates why he is now so passionate about politics and the world.DO get this one on audiobook to appreciate every nuance and accent that Noah can bring to the table.

I was really excited to read this one because it was a coming-of-age story and is a science fiction/fantasy novel so it was a bit out of my usual comfort zone for reading. This is a highly quirky story of two kids that both have unusual special abilities. Patricia is magically gifted and Laurence is a scientific genius. They lean upon each other through the early years of not fitting in and then. Later, they go their separate ways when Patricia is selected to attend an academy for magic while Laurence focuses on inventing things like a machine for a billionaire that will allow for intergalactic travel to save humans after they have destroyed their own world. When technology brings them back together they think it is forever except for the whole world coming to an end thing.This was quirky and had some laugh-out-loud moments, but I wasn’t in love with this one. The first half of the book was highly enjoyable and the second half hit a bit of a lull for me. This is one of those books that you have to truly appreciate quirk and fantasy to enjoy it.

Even something as monotonous as swinging becomes a thing of beauty when told by Fridlund.“Later, I could get that drizzle feeling just about any time I saw a kid on a swing. The hopelessness of it—the forward excitement, the midflight return. The futile belief that the next time around, the next flight forward, you wouldn’t get dragged back again. You wouldn’t have to start over, and over.” Coming-of-age stories are often my favorite each year, but can feel predictable at times. Fridlund’s book, however, is anything BUT predictable and that is why I enjoyed it so much. Without giving too much away, a teenager begins babysitting for a local family and a mystery builds around this child and these parents that the narrator reflects upon from her youth. Her need to belong to someone is so strong that it overrides, perhaps, how one might normally respond to a situation.If you like neat and tidy stories, skip it! There is nothing tidy about this tale and the ending feels as confused as the narrator probably feels at the end.If you like depth, meat, and uniquely told stories though, this book is for you!...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Jan 2017,"Jan 31, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30183198-history-of-wolves

If you are looking for a compelling nonfiction read that explores an issue that is not talked about enough, this is the one for you.Desmond threw himself wholeheartedly into learning more about the eviction process and follows eight families struggling with the basic necessity of home. He sheds light on a very broken system from poor wages to the ramifications of eviction on a family’s life to living in neighborhoods filled with crime and drugs. There are so many survival tactics needed to just keep a roof over one’s head that you find yourself, as the reader, hoping and praying for a better outcome for so many in this book and marveling at the tricks of the trade to just get by.As an ethnographer, Desmond pulls himself completely out of the equation until he shares how he built his book at the very end. It’s an incredible testament to his great writing and documentation that he is able to build the story in a way that you feel like you are with these people as they struggle with basic needs and necessities. He, in fact, lived in a trailer park to fully immerse himself into the daily life, even struggling with issues in his own home while writing.I doubt you could read this and not feel a new sense of compassion and gratefulness or to not feel compelled to explore how our country could develop a better system for those in need.

Once again, I find myself oblivious to those who suffered as Konar unfolds the story of twins, Sasha & Pearl, who became a part of the experimental population of twins that were known as Mengle’s Zoo, based in Auschwitz.Many begged and falsely claimed that their children were twins to be part of Mengle’s Zoo because they believed they had been saved from certain death. Unfortunately, these children were far from safe and became a part of tests to separate the twins from one another, both physically and psychologically.

The tale swings from past to present as Smith builds layer upon layer in this friendship and, ultimately, if leaving home really does help to define our success.There are profound moments in this book. An observation on race that had went unnoticed as a child, in her very opening chapter, moved me. There were moments where the writing was just brilliant and I wanted to read more. Yet, there was a lot of lag in this story where I felt if the novel had been trimmed in half, it would have been a more solid read for me. The swinging between decades, at times, also felt confusing and did not flow. I may be in the minority on those observations, but thought I would share that anyway!I am still glad I read it and I want to read White Teeth next month since that seems to be the book that everyone loved from her. For me, the brilliant moments made it worth the read, but I am not sure if this would be a good book for everyone....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Nov 2016,"Dec 02, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28390369-swing-time

Luckily for me, this onArrowood was this month’s MomAdvice Book Club selection and since I was leading it, I had high hopes this would be a good one. Luckily for me, this one turned out to be a solid gothic mystery about twin girls who go missing and their sister who is haunted and filled with guilt because their disappearance happened when she was supposed to be watching them.When a true crime writer decides he wants to figure out the answer to this unsolved case for a book, we begin to realize that Arden’s memories of that fateful day may not be entirely accurate. McHugh then takes the reader down a winding path of suspects to answer where these children could have gone in a classic mystery format.I will say, the ending was not as conclusive as I would have liked and if you prefer a clearly defined ending, this might be an unsatisfactory ending for you. It did serve as an excellent book for discussion as you think about your own childhood memories and what it would be like as a family to have old wounds reopened for the sake of true crime writing.I really enjoyed this one and would recommend it for our mystery reader fans!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Nov 2016,"Dec 02, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28007948-arrowood

To the Bright Edge of the World could not be more different than her first book and is told uniquely through letters, photographs, and excerpts of other books to build a unique telling of an Alaskan expedition in the late 18oo’s. When a family member comes across journals and letters from his great-uncle and great-aunt from this time, he feels compelled to submit them to an Alaskan museum. The reader then gets to read the story of Colonel Allen as he leads a group through Alaska and the story of his wife, Sophie, who is newly pregnant and left behind while her husband makes this harrowing expedition.The amount of research that Ivey would have to do to establish this story, I am sure, would astound us. The dialect and nailing down a historically accurate account of that era alone would be insane, but she also carves a hobby for Sophie that involves photography of birds that is incredibly detailed and astoundingly well told as well.If you are into historical fiction, definitely pick this one up.

Behind Closed Doors will go down as my top thriller this year because of this tightly woven and finely crafted story. I read this one in almost a single sitting and the author does not waste a single page from start to finish while building a plot that will send chills down your spine. This twisted tale is so vividly told that it is as though you are reading a movie with characters that are incredibly well-developed they practically lift off the pages.I don’t want to give very much away because half of the fun is the discovery of what is actually going on behind these closed doors. A perfect marriage though is rarely what it seems and Jack & Grace are the perfect example of a marriage that looks beautiful on the outside, but is far different on the inside.

What I would like to say about it is that she carves such incredible dynamics between the sisters and the fear that she creates in Lucy, as she worries for her safety during the Manson murders, is so poignant as she is being held captive herself by the man she thought she was in love with.

Set in California during the recession, the couple finds themselves in foreclosure alley when no one can afford to stay in their houses. Nick, the husband, works to help clean out the houses when the bank kicks them out of their home. Witnessing all these homes that have remained dormant, he takes advantage of this shaky ground and begins operating a month-to-month leasing company on properties he doesn’t own, using the funds to try to financially recover his own family.

She hasn’t gotten married, but witnesses her fiancée in a moment on the street that rocks her world. Returning home to figure things out, she is shocked to discover that, not only did her fiancée have a big secret, but her entire family has been keeping secrets from her. Her parent’s marriage is failing, her mother is dating, her brothers are involved in a love triangle, and their family winery is in the process of being sold.

Just the discussion alone of whether or not the couple should have left their baby would make a great one for book club discussions.This one brings all the twists and builds great tension.

Sleeping Giants sounded like an interesting premise for a book and had comparisons to, The Martian, which I had really enjoyed. Unfortunately, I think this one lacked the charm that The Martian had, making the comparison a little bit of a stretch for me. This book opens with a girl riding her new bike and happens to fall into a hole on her ride. When the firemen come to rescue her, she is being held in the palm of a steel hand in a square-shaped hole. Seventeen years later, the mystery of where this artifact is from is still unknown. A doctor decides to pull together a team to figure out the mystery and what it could potentially mean for humanity. Told mostly in interview format, with an unnamed interrogator, it is a quick novel to breeze through for a sci-fi escape. I have to say this was not a captivating read for me. I didn’t enjoy reading the story through interviews and the writing felt a little cheesy at times. I was hoping for an action-packed book with this robot, but it seemed to focus more on the political angle than the fact that these people possessed a killer robot that could wipe out humanity. Some of the motives of these characters felt forced (I won’t give anything away), but didn’t make sense for me as a reader.That said, it is the first book that my husband, son, and I ALL read (appropriate for a 14 year-old boy, for sure!) and so it gave us something fun to talk about.

Carey’s latest book since The Girl With All the Gifts is one of my favorite reads. This book was interesting, but very different than his last one. I don’t know how to explain it except by saying that it is Orange is the New Black meets The Sixth Sense. Jess Moulson finds herself in a maximum security prison, called Fellside, after a tragic fire that not only deforms her, but kills the little boy in her apartment complex. As she deals with the grief of the crime she has committed, she is visited by the ghost of the little boy who helps her to make peace with the tragedy, but also allows her to exit her mind and body, giving her the chance to jump into the minds of the other prisoner’s and see what they are dreaming of. Killing a child makes her a target at the prison, but even with the little boy’s help, it can’t protect her from the crooked system. At almost 500 pages, the story dragged for me in the beginning and then I finally hit my pace about halfway through. It was worth reading just for the court scene and the creative twist at the end, but it requires a lot of commitment to power through the first half of this one.

A Murder in Time is the firstI am not big into series books, but I have heard from many of that you really love to sink your teeth into a new series. A Murder in Time is the first in the Kendra Donovan mysteries series and is a promising start for time travel and historical fiction lovers. It was this month’s selection for the Global Book Club (check to see if your library is participating in the Global Read to snag a free download of it). The story follows an FBI agent, Kendra Donovan, that is involved in a case that goes horribly wrong and claims the life of her colleagues. When she finds out that they are using the murderer as an informant, she decides to take revenge at a period piece party he is attending at a castle. Hiding from him when her revenge takes an unexpected turn, she goes into a corridor and then comes out in the same castle, but in an entirely different era- the 1800’s. Her ability to sleuth out cases comes in handy though when a serial killer is on the loose and no one else can solve it. Without her modern day tools though, this case isn’t an easy one. Oh, and she’s a woman and a low level employee at the castle so she’s not respected either.Although far-fetched, as most time travel books are, this is a fun escape. I actually learned a lot about that era that I had never known before. Twist in a fun love story, and you have a great escape that fans of The Outlander series will enjoy with this fun modern spin! ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jun 2016,"Jul 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25790952-a-murder-in-time

She was one of my absolute favorite writers and then many years have passed with no books from her. Eternal sadness. I was so thrilled to see a book from her back on the bookshelves and with a surprise…it’s her first YA book! This is the story of a teenager named Jessie, the loss of her incredible mom, and the abrupt new marriage of her father that relocates them to Los Angeles. When her father meets a woman from his support group, he elopes and moves them into the wealthy woman’s home, switching Jessie into the wealthy prep school that her new stepbrother attends. Of course, Jessie doesn’t fit in at all.When she starts receiving emails from SN (shortened from Somebody Nobody) offering her help and support in these uncharted waters, a relationship blooms and becomes a huge support for Jessie. The reader gets to read this beautiful, hilarious, and always sweet exchange. When Jessie wants to meet SN in person though, the reader is led on the journey with Jessie. Is SN her soulmate? Is SN even real? I guess you will have to read to find out! This is a great one to pack in your beach bag this summer. Delightfully sweet and everything I love about Buxbaum’s writing!

I think it is important to set expectations with this one. Do you remember Everything I Never Told You (I interviewed the author too- (http://www.momadvice.com/post/sundays...!)? Well, I felt like the set-up was similar. We are opening with someone being accused of murdering their wife and then working our way out from there. Some people get disappointed when things work in this direction (maybe thinking it takes away from the mystery of it all?), but I really loved that it opened this way and then the reader discovers more and more of the motive as the story unfolds.The book opens with the murder of Catherine as the police began questioning the most obvious of suspects… her husband. The book builds out the story of this couple from the purchase of this farmhouse filled with secrets, the failing marriage, and Paul’s strange double life.This book is a really deep character study into a sociopath. Brundage writes this book so well that things like the home in it become a character onto itself. This is slow, but worthy of the pacing with rich characters. I couldn’t put it down.That said, I think readers may be unhappy with how the story works out. I know I was a little too. That is not to discredit Brundage or her incredible writing, it’s just not the big bang ending I had hoped for. She also does not use quotations around the words people are speaking. It took awhile for me to get the hang of that and you don’t want to space out when you are reading it when there is a lot of dialogue because you will forget who is talking.If you are looking for a book with strong characters and a good ghost story, you’ll love it. Bonus!! Elizabeth will be joining me for a Sundays With Writers this month! She has a crazy real ghost story and a house that inspired this book. Don’t miss it!

As a debut novelist, Cynthia signed a one million dollar contract for this book and it has already been optioned for film. Do you love dysfunctional family stories? I know I do! This book reminded me a lot of Jonathan Tropper’s, This is Where I Leave You. This book centers around four grown children and the inheritance (AKA- The Nest!) that they are supposed to be inheriting. Leo, the unreliable alcoholic sibling in the story, ends up getting in a terrible car accident and has to pay the accompanying passenger a large sum to keep the story quiet. His mother gives him the majority of the inheritance as hush money for the car accident, unbeknownst to his siblings.The story then really unfolds with all of the siblings and what this inheritance would have meant to them is uncovered. As a reader you see what life looks like without the money they always planned on. No spoilers, but imagine that you had made financial mistakes, but always knew you would have a large sum to bail you out and find out that the money doesn’t exist. Awful, isn’t it?I think some people will find the ending a little dissatisfying, but I also know that most dysfunctional family stories don’t have tidy endings. I loved it- laughed a lot and sympathized with many characters. This was a great escape!

Travis is obsessed with a book series called Bloodfall that helps him escape into another reality away from his abusive father.

Alex is an alcoholic who has watched her career dwindle away due to her inability to stop drinking. She is assigned a story and comes to research the topic of people in comas and recognizes Amy, a case that she remembers all too well. Amy was assaulted in the 90’s as a teen and has remained in a coma since then. Alex becomes obsessed with uncovering who hurt Amy and wants to try to find who did this to her.

Ryan pulls off a magnificent literary feat by tackling six decades set in Taiwan over the course of the twentieth century. It is horrific what so many endured during this time and begins with the story of the unnamed narrator's father being captured because he is suspected of Communist activities. He is kept for over a decade in brutal and inhumane conditions. It then follows his return home, the unkindness of others, the stress of feeling watched, and the other generations that continue to struggle through the decades with their own issues. It's far too much to go into in a quick , but you will learn a lot along the way! Things I would note with this one. First, I wish I would have educated myself a bit before diving into it. I knew nothing about the Chinese nationalists or the history of Taiwan and the author offers no real introduction into the history of that, assuming the reader can follow along. After a browse through Wikipedia, I was able to understand better, but it was a confusing time in politics and reading that first would have helped me through the book. Secondly, the book does drag in parts, but the good parts in this far outweigh the slow parts. Power through and I hope this time in history is as eye-opening for you as it was me.

All thoughts & opinions are my own.I am a big fan of Suzanne Redfearn and this book does not disappoint. In this quick page-turner, a single mother's daughter is discovered after a YouTube video goes viral of her singing and dancing, at the tender age of four. She is immediately picked up for commercial work and then auditions & wins a lead role in a television show. Going from having nothing to having everything, you follow this mother as she juggles the demands of being a stage mom, the intrusive media, and protecting her children from Hollywood & her ex who just wants the biggest piece of the financial pie. Redfearn effectively utilizes other famous stars and their stories to craft a compelling piece on the many pitfalls of growing up a child star and the rarity of survival in the industry. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 26, 2016","Jan 30, 2016","Jan 26, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25747128-no-ordinary-life

What makes these raw moments even slightly bearable is the incredible company that he keeps, a friendship masterfully told, a circle that never gives up on Jude, even when he is most broken. The writing is exquisite- I have never, ever read writing like this in my life.

From whittling down her closet to seven items, to eating only seven foods, to reducing her waste, to trimming her spending; she documents her daily struggles and triumphs through the lessons learned. What really pulled through for me most was how much we take for granted and how, with a bit of trimming, we have the ability to transform the lives of the poor. If we are to love Jesus, we are to love the poor like He did. Not only are we reminded about our own individual choices, but she really sheds light on the excessive spending of churches, money spent only on themselves when it could be better served for the greater needs of the world. This comes up often in the book as Jen's church has chosen to spend on those in need rather than their own building and selves. It would be impossible to read this book and not feel moved to give more. Although I would consider myself a minimalist, there is ALWAYS room for improvement and this gave me a lot of food for thought. I shed many tears through this one for those in need and unwanted.

Her replacement doesn’t want to tell her about the switch. I mean, how do you break it to your own mother that her replacement is…well, her very own daughter? There is, of course, conflict knowing that the job that Caroline loves and knows so well is being taken from her and there is sadness as Jamie finds the relationship she has with her mom is slipping away from her in this new role. When a traumatic death happens in their family, not only do these two realize that they will have to work together to pick up the pieces of their loss, but their entire life has went into a different direction than either of them expect.Since this book tells the story of Caroline, at the age of 56, and Jamie, in her thirties, it is a book that you could share with your own mother and will appeal to women of all ages. The story of friendship between this mother & daughter duo made for a beautiful read and would be a great beach read escape this summer.

I can tell you right now that this book will be on the list. I have never read a survival story like it and I have thought about this book ever since I shut the pages. It was one of the most difficult reads I have ever read and I will never forget this memoir or how extraordinary Amanda’s journey was.Amanda Lindhout lived in a violent home and escaped her life through her issues of National Geographic that she collected and dreamed of traveling to a life far better than her own. At the age of nineteen, working as a cocktail waitress in Calgary, Alberta, she began saving her tips so she could travel the globe. Aspiring to understand the world and live a significant life, she backpacked through Latin America, Laos, Bangladesh, and India, and emboldened by each adventure, went on to Sudan, Syria, and Pakistan. In war-ridden Afghanistan and Iraq she carved out a fledgling career as a television reporter. And then, in August 2008, she traveled to Somalia—“the most dangerous place on earth.” On her fourth day, she was abducted by a group of masked men along a dusty road.Held hostage for 460 days, Amanda converts to Islam as a survival tactic, receives “wife lessons” from one of her captors, and risks a daring escape. Moved between a series of abandoned houses in the desert, she survives on memory—every lush detail of the world she experienced in her life before captivity—and on strategy, fortitude, and hope. When she is most desperate, she visits a house in the sky, high above the woman kept in chains, in the dark, being tortured.It is impossible to read this book and not be moved by Amanda’s journey. Although it is frustrating to read how naive she is by throwing herself into places that she knows are dangerous to prove the world wrong (which she acknowledges in her story), her ability to transcend the brutality and exit her body is an extraordinary study in survival and her will to live.If you loved (and could endure) survival stories like Unbroken, I think this one brings new perspective on how women are treated in Somalia every single day and you will be moved by Amanda’s story and what she now gives to Somalia since being held hostage.This is graphic, brutally graphic. Amanda glosses over much of what she endured probably to save the reader from the imagery, but what she tells is so horrific that you will be thinking of this story long after you close the final pages....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 26, 2015","Jun 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18039963-a-house-in-the-sky

MI had this book on my reading list for this summer so I was so excited to get an advanced reader from the publishing house the week before our trip. Mental illness books in the YA category seem to be a growing trend and I think it is a good thing. All the Bright Places, read and shared with you last month, tackled the issue of bipolar disorder and this book sheds light on the difficulties of being a teen with OCD. Stone illustrates our common misconceptions of OCD (the main character doesn’t even have a tidy room!) and tackles the harder stuff like what it would be like to be obsessive with something like the number 3 and not being able to drive your friends because your odometer must always have that number on it.Samantha McAllister looks just like the rest of the popular girls in her junior class. But hidden beneath the straightened hair and expertly applied makeup is a secret that her friends would never understand: Sam has Purely-Obsessional OCD and is consumed by a stream of dark thoughts and worries that she can’t turn off.Second-guessing every move, thought, and word makes daily life a struggle, and it doesn’t help that her lifelong friends will turn toxic at the first sign of a wrong outfit, wrong lunch, or wrong crush. Yet Sam knows she’d be truly crazy to leave the protection of the most popular girls in school. So when Sam meets Caroline, she has to keep her new friend with a refreshing sense of humor and no style a secret, right up there with Sam’s weekly visits to her psychiatrist.Caroline introduces Sam to Poet’s Corner, a hidden room and a tight-knit group of misfits who have been ignored by the school at large. Sam is drawn to them immediately, especially a guitar-playing guy with a talent for verse, and starts to discover a whole new side of herself. Slowly, she begins to feel more “normal” than she ever has as part of the popular crowd . . . until she finds a new reason to question her sanity and all she holds dear.The camaraderie of friendship and group therapy through writing reminded me of the beautiful friendships in the The Fault In Our Stars. The story is well-written and age-appropriate for teens (there is one sex scene), but I think it would be a great one to read and then talk about with your teens about the struggles of fitting in, how everyone struggles with something, and how important it is to be your own person. Samantha is a character that really blossoms on the page.

The book has been compared to Water For Elephants and Night Circus, but definitely stands on its own and is an ambitious debut novel from this first-time author. When Simon, a young librarian, receives the gift of a book that is a travel log for a carnival in the 1700's, he discovers a drowning death of a circus mermaid that is coincidental to his own mother's drowning death (a former circus mermaid herself) that happened even on the same day. If their family is cursed, his sister could be the next victim and he will do anything to save her. The chapters alternate between the travel log (complete with unique sketch drawings) and present day as Simon tries to stop the curse on his family. The author manages to bring these stories together in a beautiful way with a satisfying conclusion to these mysterious drownings.This was definitely a slower read for me and the length could have been shortened a bit, as the plot lagged a bit for me. The sketches, however, add a fun interactive element for the reader and help keep you engaged in the story.

Much like other thriller books, I don't want to give away the plot too much so that you have the satisfaction of discovering the twists yourself. Ani is a girl who never has the ability to fit in at her prestigious private school, no matter how many brand name clothes her mother buys her. When Ani intrigues the popular kids, they decide to invite her in and Ani discovers, maybe it was better to have never been a part of the group at all. In a horrible turn of events, she finds solace in another kid at school that will, ultimately, change the destiny of the school and the kids in it forever. The book flashes back to Ani's painful teen years and then alternates chapters as they film a documentary about what happened at their school and how much happier Ani is now that she is working at a high-profile magazine, beautiful, thin, and has the guy of her dreams. Of course, things are never as good as they seem and getting to the root of why Ani is so unlikable helps the reader to connect more as the story progresses despite the excruciating shallowness and weight-obsession of this woman.

This story is uniquely told by a twin sister & brother, alternating chapters, yet one is telling the story three years later while the other is telling the story as it happens. It creates a journey experience for the reader when characters begin to overlap together in these stories. Nelson's words read like watching a painting unravel on a page, as though it all is coming to life, especially when told through artistic Noah's eyes as his words are the most visually vivid. Nelson beautifully paints the portrait of the typical teenage angst of Jude & Noah, while focusing strongly on the difficulties of being a gay teen and the hostility of classmates that force Noah to try to fit in with his peers. I laughed and cried through the pages of this one especially because I have never read a writer like this, making me Nelson's latest fan. It really surprised me in so many ways.

When a birthday party is held in an unnamed South American country, a famous soprano opera singer sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. The party is interrupted when 18 terrorists enter the vice-presidential mansion in hopes to hold the president hostage. Unfortunately, the president never showed up because he was watching his favorite soap opera, defeating the purpose of the terrorist visit. Instead, they hold the people from the party hostage to try to get their demands met and what develops are unexpected relationships between the party guests and even the guests with their captures. The book developed the characters well, but I felt hostage too when the plot did not drive itself forward enough for me.

What unfolds is a beautiful story of the unlikely friendships that pull her from her depths of despair, a mother who refuses to let her give up on her dreams, and finding movement again when confidence has been lost. Beautifully told and rich characters make this novel a fast page-turner that I just could not put down.

Jenna Metcalf’s mother’s death is now a cold case and one that consumes Jenna’s every thought. Alice Metcalf mysteriously disappeared during a tragic accident at the elephant conservatory where she works as a scientist studying the grief among elephants, working alongside her husband. Jenna believes that there is a bigger story to her disappearance and hires Serenity Jones, a disgraced psychic, and Virgil Stanhope, an alcoholic private detective, to help her find out once and for all if Alice is alive or dead. The true question though, is what if Alice has been alive all along and never wanted a relationship with Jenna?In predictable Picoult fashion, this story alternates between the different characters, and it also weaves in the scientific journals and observations of elephant behavior by Alice. As the story builds, more and more layers are added and we are given a host of possible suspects for Alice’s disappearance. As more of puzzle pieces are added, Jenna begins remembering more and more about what happened when she was a child as it all comes together in a shocking twist that readers will never see coming.One element I thought worked really well was the storyline of Serenity and her rise and fall in psychic stardom and her struggle with no longer having the gifts she had before. I also loved the private detective and the demons that he was battling since this case was one he never thought he performed well. Most of all, I really appreciated the ending to this one that makes you want to reread the book again to find all of those hidden clues that Picoult placed in there for you that you might not have noticed before.You can tell that Picoult has thoroughly researched this one, but at points the researched portions dragged on and on for me. Alice’s scientific journals add predictable parallels to her own mothering. At times though, the research was so long that it felt as though you were reading a nonfiction story. If you are a fan of elephants or the struggles of elephant conservation, you will be swimming in all of the facts and have plenty to read. For me, I felt that this created a bit of lag in my reading and I found myself skimming through those portions to get back to the meat of the story.Truth be told, the ending is really what makes this Picoult book shine and worthy of a read- I would recommend this book simply for that reason alone!

It builds on a well-developed premise- what if you were suddenly put in the shoes of someone that you once judged? The difference in this plot is that it is a social worker, who once was the judge of other parents, who makes an honest and life-altering mistake, and is now the one who must be judged as a parent. Told in alternating points of view from an abandoned child who is quite familiar with the social worker setting and the viewpoint of a mother who is about to lose it all in the system that she has worked so hard to uphold.

Chris Bohjalian proves himself as a seasoned writer, taking on the story of a troubled teenage girl whose town experiences a nuclear meltdown. What makes it doubly heartwrenching is due to her father's alcoholic past, he is the chief administrator of the plant and her mother, Mira, also works there as a communications specialist, he is the one that the town blames for the disaster and the death of 19 people. Now orphaned and unwanted, Emily feels like she is not safe in her town and this leads her down a path of destruction that will pull at your heartstrings as a parent and put her in many situations that are brutal in nature. Not only does Bohjalian capture the voice of this teenage girl so perfectly, but the depth of research on the repercussions of this disaster on a town, and an unlikely blending of Emily Dickinson poems woven throughout (the fictional Emily's favorite poet) tie this novel up beautifully. Although heartbreakingly tragic, it is one that I could not put down in the final pages. My only regret was that the epilogue was not expanded more and we could see more of what happened after Emily received treatment. Thank you NetGalley for the advanced reader of this book!

I am particularly honored to have James Markert sharing his own thoughts on his book with us and I hope you will find his answers as fascinating as I have!Tuberculosis and how this illness affects its patients, and those that love them, are often the central focus of this book.  After I finished reading this and then reading the historical notes about Waverly Place, I immediately went in search of more information about the illness and the backdrop for this book. Although the book goes into great detail of symptoms of TB and what the patients experience, it does not delve into why people have it because, in this time period of the book, people do not know how to cure it or why it lies dormant in some, while killing others.Tuberculosis, is a common, and in many cases lethal, infectious disease caused by various strains of mycobacteria, usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It typically attacks the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It is spread through the air when people who have an active TB infection cough, sneeze, or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air. Most infections are asymptomatic and latent, but about one in ten latent infections eventually progresses to active disease which, if left untreated, kills more than 50% of those so infected.As we are able to read in this book, treatment for progressive cases often included removing ribs to help the lungs and all patients were encouraged to get as much fresh air as possible, even in wintery weather conditions, because fresh air was believed to help cure this illness.Delving into the book, we have an unlikely band of friends that have gathered together to create an orchestra who are working together to perform a concert. I love how the author pulls together these unlikely people and then, oftentimes, paints a very different portrait of what we expect them to be like and then tells us the true story of who they are when we dive further into the book.Rose’s death, for example, takes me completely by surprise as I believed it was one way and it was not.  McVain, who begins the novel as an unlikeable bully, later delves into his story of his true wartime injury and the unlikely love he discovered. Herman, when given a little love and attention from Susannah, steals the show with his beautiful voice. And, one of the most pivotal moments for Wolfgang, is when he finds out the death of his father is very different than his childhood interpretation of what really happened.I loved this book from start to finish. Although the book is filled with death and disease, it offered a surprising amount of hopefulness in it. There is so much love and beauty as the patients join forces to complete and perform the requiem and the beauty of these unlikely friendships and loved is solidified because they are all battling this same fight.Read our interview with James Markert here....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Mar 05, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16114336-a-white-wind-blew

Havaa is just eight years old when her neighbor Akhmed finds her hiding in the woods, watching her house burning down. Akhmed knows getting involved means risking his life, but her father is an old friend, and he risks it all deciding to take her to an abandoned hospital where a woman named Sonja Rabina runs a hospital almost single handedly.Sonja does not love kids…at all. Akhmed convinces her to keep Havaa for a trial, and over the course of five extraordinary days, Sonja’s world will change in ways she never imagined. The reader is taken on a journey through each of these character’s past on an extraordinary journey of love, loss, and ultimately what it means to be human.Again, because we are dealing with a wartime topic, there is a lot of graphic violence, gory medical scenes, and violence in this book. One torture scene in particular is difficult to read (but can be skimmed over). It is a necessary part of the book though to truly capture what is happening to the Chechens. For me, it took a little bit to really get into the meat of the story, mainly because of my own lack of education of what had happened in this country. If you struggle in the beginning, I encourage you to keep pushing on. This book is one of the most accomplished books I have ever read. It reads like poetry, the narrative is so unique, you will connect with every character in some way, there are moments of unexpected humor, and there is beauty in the pulling & weaving of these characters together.Join us in our MomAdvice Book Club discussion with Anthony Marra this month and enter to win a free copy of his book today!

The story was told in alternating perspectives from Max himself, to his brother, to his parents, to the doctor that treated him, and from the perspective of his girlfriend. Max is the victim of a sexual assault that made reading difficult in the beginning and the rest of the book is watching the train wreck of family dynamics and how Max works through this as he questions his own sexual identity. If you can't handle books like that, this might not be a pick for you. I wouldn't say this is anything like Middlesex or Annabel, two other books I have read on intersex, although I loved both of those books just as much as this. This is definitely a very contemporary take on what it would be like as an intersex teenager now, with all the scary things that teenagers do in it.

In our last blind book club exchange, I won this book from a friend and decided this would be the perfect month to read it. Admittedly, I wasn't a huge fan of Green's last book, but found his earlier work to be some of my favorite YA reads.In this story, Miles ""Pudge"" Halter heads to the Culver Creek Boarding School where he meets a rather hodge podge group of pals, including a beautifully mysterious girl named, Alaska Young. Alaska & Pudge bond over the holidays, when they are the only two students to roam the halls of the boarding school corridors and dig up dirt on their fellow students.It is through this moment of bonding that Pudge realizes he would do just about anything for Alaska, including being a part of their series of infamous pranks that they are intent on pulling off on each other. What Pudge doesn't know though is how Alaska is going to forever alter his world and separate his life into two sections: the before and the after.If you like quirky characters with a good friendship storyline, I just know you will love this one. I thought it had the sweetness of, The Serpent King with a bit of the Eleanor & Park quirkiness thrown in, for good measure. I really enjoyed this one, mostly for this book's humor and heart.This book proves, once again, just how much I have enjoyed Green's earlier works....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Dec 2018,"Feb 23, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99561.Looking_for_Alaska

This was an anonymous online advice column that Stray answered letters she received online under the name of Sugar. The thing that made it so different is typically advice columnist do not interject their own stories and opinions into their advice, while Strayed wrote honestly about her own struggles in a way that was raw, gritty, and real. Shocking at times were her own struggles that spilled on the pages, but beauty & truth was weaved into these answers too. It would be impossible to not a get a nugget out of each answer, even if the situation didn't relate to you. Her advice to her younger self, a letter written to graduates, and the struggles of when someone should start a family were three of the pieces that really stood out to me.

Love Anthony is a heartbreaking andLisa Genova is an author that does not disappoint and has become one of the authors I rely upon for a great story. Love Anthony is a heartbreaking and also endearing story that will pull upon your heartstrings as a mother and would lend itself well to any book club discussion.Olivia had always dreamed of being a mother, but her idea of what life would be like as a mom is changed when her son Anthony is diagnosed with autism at the age of three. Anthony struggles with sounds and crowds and “normal” childhood experiences and Olivia works hard to make sense of what life is like for Anthony when he cannot speak to her. Just when Olivia begins to make sense of what her new life with Anthony will look like, he unexpectedly dies.She finds herself alone in a cottage on Nantucket, newly separated from her husband, and desperate to understand the meaning of her son’s life when a chance encounter with another woman facing her own loss brings Anthony alive again for Olivia in a most unexpected way.The two stories of these women is beautifully woven and what I truly appreciated about this story, as heartbreaking as it was, is how Genova seems to get inside the head of what it would be like to live as an autistic child and how she seems to really bring light to the difficulties an autistic child would have to endure.Beautiful and a sweetly satisfying ending for a heartbreaking tale, Genova continues to weave beautiful stories that linger in my mind long after I close the book.Read more at http://momadvice.com/blog/2012/12/gre... ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 07, 2012","Nov 07, 2012","Nov 07, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13547381-love-anthony

It’s been a long time since a thriller kept me up all night, but Into the Darkest Corner is just the book for you if you are looking for a book that you just can’t turn the pages fast enough and causes you to be groggy the next day because you just had to finish it!Catherine Bailey is a young, single, and beautiful woman that catches the eye of a guy named Lee who is working at a night club one night that she is at one night with her friends. She is quickly taken in by him and she isn’t the only one. All of her friends seem just as smitten with Lee as she is.While their relationship starts out with a passionate fury and a surprising attentiveness that Catherine has never experience before, she soon realizes that there is also another darker side to Lee that, frankly, scares her. Lee continually is both physically and mentally abusive to Catherine and begins to wedge doubt of her own character by planting seeds in the minds of all of her friends who all begin to question Catherine’s own stability.Four years later, Lee is behind bars and Catherine, who is now going under the name Cathy, has become a shell of her former self, and is riddled with obsessive compulsive disorder as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. Although she has no friends and no one to lean on, an unlikely relationship blossoms between herself and the her upstairs neighbor, Stuart. Just when she begins she thinks she can find happiness, Lee is released from prison and first on his agenda of people to visit….Cathy. What happens though when everyone believes you just have OCD and there really IS someone after you?At several points I realized I was holding my breath because the book was so suspenseful as the character, Lee, is in pursuit of her. For those of you left wondering is there any life after, “Gone Girl,” this book is for you. This book is perfectly timed with a great story build of a woman before and after an abusive relationship came into her life. This is a fantastic read, but not for the faint of heart due to extreme violence and graphic sex scenes. This is just as dark and twisted as Gone Girl, but brings a level of suspense that I have been waiting a long time for in a book.Read more at http://momadvice.com/blog/2012/12/gre... ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 04, 2012","Dec 06, 2012","Nov 04, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9226039-into-the-darkest-corner

ThiFor a long time I have had, “These Is My Words,” in the back of my mind as a great book to tackle this winter and I am so glad that I finally did. This story is inspired by the author’s own family memoirs, and the words belong to Sarah Prine. Sarah is a spunky young woman who finds herself a pioneer as they travel the frontier in search of a place to call home.The story is told in diary format and records her steps beginning from her childhood to a young adult to becoming a mother. What truly makes the book is the beautiful love story between herself and cavalry officer Captain Jack Elliot. It is a love story that rivals great love stories like Gone with the Wind and the Outlander series.Although I am not typically a fan of writing that is written in diary or letter form, I did truly love this book, mostly, for the beautiful love story it offered.

It is a story that leaves you rooting for some of the most unlikely characters and showcases the beauty of unlikely friendships.Eighteen years ago, Arthur had a promising career as a professor, and loved his work. He is now a 58 year-old man who cannot leave his home due to his incredible size of 500 pounds. Since 2001 he has managed to stay within the confines of his home relying on services like grocery and food deliveries that can be ordered from his own computer. He has no friends, no family, and the only bit of human contact he receives are letters occasionally sent to him from his old student, Charlene Turner.When Charlene contacts Arthur, out of the blue, to see if he will help her with her son Kel Keller and offer guidance to him to help him, Arthur hires a cleaning service to help him get his house back in shape. His house is a place that has been grossly neglected because Arthur has lost the will and lacks the energy to clean it, due to his size. When a young 19 year-old Yolanda shows up on his doorstep, he can never know how this will change his life. An unlikely friendship unfolds and brings new purpose to Arthur’s life that he never expects.The author not only takes you through Arthur’s difficulties in his life, but the story of Kel and his mother Chelsea alternate in these chapters as you see the difficulties that this young man has had to overcome and will leave you begging for the happy ending that this boy so deserves.Beautifully written and great stories that are woven together in such a way that you can vividly picture each of these characters and feel their stories resonate in your own heart. You will have a hard time putting this one down and I look forward to reading more from Liz Moore in the future!Read more at http://momadvice.com/blog/2012/12/gre... ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 03, 2012","Oct 07, 2012","Oct 03, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11381910-heft

When my girlfriend gave this one five stars on GoodReads though, I decided to pack it for my trip and devoured it in a single day and can’t wait to see this one developed into a television show.The story follows a reporter with a troubled past who has to return to her hometown when she is assigned a story on the murder of two preteen girls in her small town. Returning home is a challenge as she has a dysfunctional relationship with her mother and is reminded why she left the town in the first place. As the mystery unfolds about the brutal murders of these two girls, she must confront her own twisted past and discover who the killer is just as the reader does, in a wild twist.I will say that this is dark and I think that is why I have struggled with it before. Flynn’s writing makes you feel uncomfortable because her imagery is so raw and graphic. It is disturbing in the way that I felt about Flowers in the Attic when I read it as a kid. Sure, it’s disturbing… but you can’t look away. Kind of like a train wreck. Flynn creates a necessary tension for such a dark tale and the writing creates a vivid picture for the reader of these dark characters and town.A perfect twist at the end, makes this a satisfyingly dark thriller that I really enjoyed.

Amy has carefully wrapped gifts and is making the perfect breakfast for her husband when she suddenly disappears one seemingly ordinary morning. Nick is quickly under suspicion since he appears completely unemotional with the news of his wife’s disappearance and has no real explanation for his whereabouts when Amy has disappeared. Clue after clue points to Nick and the police begin building a case against him. It leaves the entire town and those closest to Amy wondering what Nick has done to Amy.Of course, with all good stories, things aren’t always as they appear and this story will take the reader on great plot twists that they will never suspect coming.

Christian was burned over 40 percent of his body, and Stephanie was near death, with burns on over 80 percent of her body. She would remain in a coma for four months.Stephanie shares her journey from the very beginning of her courtship to her perfect soul mate, the beautiful life they were able to build together, her own struggles with motherhood, the accident, and then the aftermath of recovering from the accident and rebuilding her life again.Stephanie’s faith and the family that she has created through her church and in her own family are what help sustain her through her recovery.

The Good FatheDiane Chamberlain is one of those authors that rarely disappoints and her books are always my go-to books when I am in a reading slump. The Good Father is an amazing emotional novel about what a young father will do in order to provide for his daughter.Travis Brown is a single father in his early twenties on the verge of being homeless and is the sole provider for his beautiful daughter Bella, who is only four years old. He desperately moves to Raleigh in hopes of finding a great job as a contractor, but once he arrives, things turn out very differently. The job that he is to take as a contractor is actually a job that could put him in prison. Sadly, he has no money for food or shelter for his little girl and he decides to take the job to make some quick cash until they can get back on their feet again.Bella has never met her mother, but Robin is leading a life that is in sharp contrast to her own. She is engaged to a wealthy politician and leading a life of luxury, assisting the family with their bed & breakfast. She hasn’t really thought about the daughter she gave up until recently. When the family faces their own controversial teen pregnancy, it is when she begins to reflect on her own and wonder what has happened to her daughter and to Travis.Erin and her husband have recently lost their own four year old daughter in a terrible accident on a pier. Erin spends her life on forums for parents that have suffered the loss of a child and finds herself detached from the real life. As she is chatting on her forum in a coffee shop, she meets Travis & Bella, and immediately becomes drawn to them. She has no idea what an important part she will play in Bella’s future, but their lives will soon collide in an unexpected way.Told in alternating points of view, as is characteristic of Diane’s novels, you get to see the story from many different angles. It is a gripping novel that I read in a mere 24 hours and promptly handed on to my girlfriend so I had someone to discuss it with. I know you will love it too!Read more at http://momadvice.com/blog/2012/06/gre... ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 28, 2012","May 29, 2012","May 28, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13035050-the-good-father

Sister is a combination of a murder mystery, a medical thriller, and the beauty of love between two sisters.Beatrice grew up in London and has made a new life for herself in New York. She has everything that she could ever want- a fiance, her own place, and a promising career. Her life is forever changed when she receives a call and is told that her sister, Tess, has gone missing. She abruptly leaves her New York life behind to assist the police in their missing persons case.Tess has never been the responsible sister and lives her life in a small apartment as an art student. She was pregnant when she went missing and had been having an affair with an art teacher. With her history and the people she has in her life, everyone is a suspect in her murder.With a list of suspects a mile long, the writer takes you on a case that is woven with many layers and possible suspects. The reader learns all the aspects of the case through Beatrice’s eyes as she assists in the murderer’s trial by sharing how she figured out who he/she is.This book has a very slow build which could turn off some readers. The final twist at the end of this book though makes the building of plot worth pursuing. This would be a great book to add to your beach bag this summer!Read more at http://momadvice.com/blog/2012/06/gre... ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 20, 2012","May 28, 2012","May 20, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8196732-sister

She renames the little girl Granada, and begins to parade her around in her daughter’s clothing and allowing her to be part of family dinners, despite her husband and their friends discomfort.Troubled not only by his wife’s mental illness, but by the plague that seems to be sweeping through his slave population, Master Satterfield purchases Polly Shine, a slave who is known to be a healer. When Polly sets eyes upon Granada, she knows that she has the gift and requests that Granada be removed from the home so she can shadow Polly.Seventy-five years later, Granada is now known as Gran Gran and takes in an abandoned girl in her care. To help the girl to come out of her shell, she shares with her the powerful story of learning to let go of the girl that she thought she was to be to the mistress, to the amazing road of being a healer herself.I guarantee that you will love this book if you are fans of The Kitchen House, Dry Grass of August, or The Help.

While Googling the search term, “happy marriage,” she suddenly receives an opportunity in her email to take part in a marriage survey. Since she is struggling in her marriage, she find this to be a fun and anonymous way to share about her marriage without judgement. She takes on the anonymous survey as, “Wife 22,” and finds herself completely engrossed in taking the survey and writing the answers to the questions. As she engages daily in the interaction with the researcher, their playful banter starts to turn into something that Alice never expected.This modern day love story of love lost and love found again is one that you will really love. What adds to the charm of this book is the social media thread of viewing Alice’s friend’s Facebook status updates at the beginning of the chapters, the Facebook chats she engages in, and of course the emails back and forth between herself and the Researcher.A solid ending to this story really pulls all the layers together beautifully. As an aside, there is an Appendix at the very end of the book that provides the questions that were asked of Alice when completing the survey. I wished I would have had those to help me pull the answers together more fully.Read more at http://momadvice.com/blog/2012/08/gre... ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 12, 2012","Jun 24, 2012","May 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12737118-wife-22

I really loved her latest book a lot, but have to say that, “Time of My Life,” still resides as my all-time favorite piece of literature that she has written. She delivers another strong book though that would be perfect beach reading material.In this book the author explores who we are without our memories and how much of our future seems grounded in our past. While many of her books have a magical spin to them, this one offers a more real-life slant while still exploring the, “what if’s,” that I think you will really enjoy.Nell Slattery awakens in a hospital without a single memory of who she is or was after being only one of two survivors in a tragic plane crash. She now must piece together her life with the help of her family and friends. What she doesn’t realize is that each of the people in her life have their own agenda and have found themselves having a fresh start with Nell.Nell is constantly questioning everyone in her life whether it is her mother about where her father is, her sister and the business that they have created together, or her husband who seems overly thrilled at her attention.Nell begins to piece together her past through the bits and pieces she discovers in her home and office.

Kristin Hannah delivers another tear-jerking book sharing a vivid story about two women, Jolene & Tami, two best friends who serve in the millitary flying Black Hawk helicopters.Both women are being deployed to Iraq and Jolene is heartbroken to leave her daughters and husband. She has found that her marriage is failing and her husband, Michael does not understand her military background or why she must serve her country. Tami’s family, on the other hand, is strongly supportive and believe in her missions to serve her country.When Michael tells Jolene, just before she leaves, that he no longer loves her, Jolene leaves heartbroken. Her daughters are confused and are both embarrassed and distraught that their mother would leave them. It is a jumble of emotions for all involved. Through it all though, Jolene knows she will always have Tami and the two friends survive the worst together in Iraq.The story told of war is eye-opening and heartbreaking. It gives you a new appreciation for our military and what they have done to serve our country. The characters, however, are not as likable in the book and can cause the reader to become detached from some of the story line. It was not my favorite Kristin Hannah read, but I still enjoyed it very much.All in all, this is a strong book and a great story of two wonderful friends who loyally serve their country together.Not enough great reads for you?

Alex George offers a book that you will long remember that has been elegantly and eloquently crafted in a way that I have not read in many years. It is a book that I found myself reading paragraphs aloud to my husband, simply because they were written in such a descriptive manner that you felt as though you were watching a movie.“Always there was music.” The book opens with Frederick, an amateur opera singer, serenading an unlikely girl named Jette who is tall in stature and just as equal in her elegance & family upbringing. Frederick quickly woos Jette in a whirlwind love affair and Jette discovers she is pregnant, forcing the couple to leave as quickly as possible from her family’s disapproving eyes. The year is 1904, Jette and Frederick board a ship to New Orleans instead of their originally intended boat to New York when they discover that the boat is full. “What’s the difference? They’re both new,” they say.They end up settling in the tiny town of Beatrice, Missouri where we meet a cast of unlikely characters who all find refuge in this German speaking town. The book chronicles the journey of their family through prohibition, the Great Depression and the Kennedy assassination. Despite the depth of the book and the plots it carries, it moves swiftly and is well-executed, leaving the reader hanging until the final page.I loved this book so much that I emailed the author when I finished it to tell him just how much I enjoyed this book. He immediately replied with heartfelt thanks for the compliments, which makes a reader like me feel even more connected to this amazing story.I can’t recommend this one enough!Not enough great reads for you?

He is well respected and knows how to command the courtroom. When a murder happens at his son’s school, he is among the first on the scene and is ready to help bring vindication to the murderer.What Andy never suspects is that his own son is the one who is charged with the murder. Andy is removed from the case when all clues begin to point towards his son. Andy doesn’t want to believe that his son could commit such a heinous crime, but as mounting evidence points towards Jacob, he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Does he hide the evidence he finds that he knows that the police might be after or let the justice system decide the fate of his child?Part family drama, part thriller, I could not put this book down.

I had picked it up several times over the years, but just could not get into it. After tackling, “Outlander,” and “The Pillars of the Earth,” this year, I knew it was time to pull my dusty copy off of the shelves and indulge.The Red Tent is very loosely based upon the Biblical story of Dinah. It is a character in the Bible that is only briefly hinted at, but the story is told through her eyes, the daughter of Jacob and sister to his twelve sons that we know from our Bible stories.The red tent in the book is the place where the women would gather during their cycles, to give birth, and where they went when they were ill. This little tent is a sorority of sorts where the women sit to share their stories and sing songs. It is a refuge of safety for the women in a life that four mothers and wives (Rachel, Leah, Zilpah, & Bilah) must share together. Dinah tells the story of her four mothers and shares the struggles of being a woman during Biblical times, the passion that the women have for their husband, and the jealousy and rivalry that would exist with sharing a husband.The reader gets to follow the lives of these women through her childlike eyes until she becomes a woman herself and finds herself in a calling towards midwifery and as she journey into a foreign land. It is beautifully told as you, literally, see her dialogue changing and own awareness of her own womanhood. This book is rich with tradition and beautiful storytelling.I liked this story a lot and enjoyed the fictional perspective of Dinah. I wouldn’t say that the book was life changing for me, but it was beautifully written and a fun, fictional way to look at characters in the Bible.For more great s visit our Great Reads for Moms on MomAdvice....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 07, 2012","Feb 18, 2012","Jan 07, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4989.The_Red_Tent

Born in the nineteenth century, most families were encouraged to keep children plagued with genetic abnormalities or disorders hidden away from the public eye. Vinnie always wanted to be in the spotlight though and despite her parent’s longing for her to choose a quiet simple life of being home with them, Vinnie became a school teacher in her town. This wasn’t the path she wanted most in her life though and she felt she was destined for bigger things. When a “cousin” decides to start a traveling show, he reaches out to see if Vinnie might be interested in being a part of it. With Vinnie’s eyes always set on the prize of being on stage, she accepts the job to be in the traveling show, despite her parent’s best judgment.The show isn’t what Vinnie ever had hoped it would be and she finds she is paraded as a freak rather than the life singing and dancing she thought she was going to have. Ever determined to be and make more of her life, she sends a letter to P.T. Barnum that will forever alter the course of her life and create a friendship with a man that she never dreamed she would have in her life.Benjamin writes the story of Vinnie in such an honest and raw way that, in parts, I found myself a little teary-eyed. She perfectly captures the challenges of being small, the ridicule from others, the admiration when she finds her place in society, and the continual challenges of believing in your destiny no matter what. While Vinnie is not always likeable, she is admirable.I can’t recommend this book enough, if I tried. Vinnie’s story is captivating as are the other amazing characters in this story.

Hillary Jordan creates a futuristic spin on how society would look if our skin was colored based on the crime we committed. The story follows Hannah Payne who has recently been, “chromed,” and is red because she has committed murder. Hannah knows that this is the cross that she must bear for her crimes, but she has no idea how horrible her life will be now that society knows the sins she has committed.Hannah was always a good girl and was raised in a very conservative family where it was even frowned up on to wear anything with color or that would draw attention to her natural beauty. The climate of the government also leans towards conservative views and the laws go along with the government views of what is right and wrong in this dystopian society. She has always been a girl that has done the right thing, but she falls in love with a married man who sweeps her off her feet and causes her to make a decision that she will now spend the remainder of her sentence paying for. To protect the future of the prominent man that she has fallen in love with, she must bear the burden alone and is now melachromed for her actions for all the world to see.When an extremist underground group tries to help Hannah and reverse the chroming that has been done to her, the reader is taken on a thrilling journey as Hannah risks her safety and life for the crime she has committed.Hillary Jordan could not have picked a book concept further from her fantastic debut, “Mudbound.” This book would lend itself well to book club discussions as it flips every political debate on its head. From abortion to women’s rights to Christianity to punishment for one’s crimes, no political rock is left unturned. While one might not agree with Hannah’s viewpoint or those of the extremist views of the underground group, the concept of chroming is rich with discussion and a true modern day take on, “The Scarlet Letter.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 13, 2011","Oct 18, 2011","Oct 13, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11045709-when-she-woke

Chip was a pilot whose plane had a double engine failure and thirty-nine of his passengers perished. Chip is weighed down with the burden of all the passengers he has lost and knows that a fresh start is just what they need.When they find a town filled with neighbors who seem to want to include them in their circle, are constantly running food to them, who want to help care for their twin daughters, and all have a love for gardening… well, who wouldn’t they feel like they picked the perfect place to raise their family?In a dusty corner of their old Victorian home though lies a secret that threatens to change their lives forever. A door has seemingly been sealed with thirty-nine carriage bolts. Thirty-nine is a very significant number to their family and the irony of that is not lost on Chip. When he decides to takes his aggression and anguish out on the door and rid it of the carriage bolts, he unlocks a nightmare for their family that they never expected.The build on this book is slow and the descriptions are labor-intensive. The story did not grab me right away, but when I hit about halfway in this one, I really wanted to solve the mysteries in the town and discover just what these helpful neighbors were up to. Regardless of the slow build, it did have a great story that just might give you a nightmare or two....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Nov 2011,"Nov 05, 2011","Oct 11, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10209997-the-night-strangers

After going from foster care home to foster care home, she finally find someone who loves her whole-heartedly and wants to adopt her as her own. Elizabeth is a dream mother to this wounded child. She spends hours teaching Victoria the Victorian names and meanings for flowers and how to care for them. These lessons t later become the tools that she must employ to share her feelings and find work later in her life. Through a traumatic turn of events though, Elizabeth never adopts Victoria and at eighteen she is declared emancipated with no money, nowhere to go, and no one who loves her.Victoria makes her home in the local park, sleeping in the grass at night, and even begins to plant her own garden in the park. When a local florist happens upon Victoria and her talent for flower arranging, she is hired on the spot to help with her small floral shop. Word soon gets around about Victoria’s talent for arrangements, carefully chosen & arranged based on their Victorian flower names and what they mean for their recipients.When Victoria runs into a floral vendor who happens to be someone from her & Elizabeth’s past, she must decide if she can ever move forward from the secret that she is harboring in her heart and if she can ever feel and find love again.The story switches from Victoria’s childhood to her time now as an adult. It never is confusing, but outlines the heartbreaking story of a difficult childhood and why Victoria would have such difficulties as an adult.It is so surprising that this is Diffenbaugh’s first novel as she writes with experience and description that you rarely find in a debut novel.

If you are looking for a psychological thriller that will have you guessing until the very last page what is happening, then I have the book for you. This is the best thriller that I have read this year and can hardly believe that it is the author’s first book.Every single day Christine wakes up not knowing who she is, where she is, and who her husband is. It is the same scenario every day as she makes her way to the bathroom, where pictures are layered upon the mirror that explain who she is and who her husband is. Each day she must go through the heartbreaking discovery that she has had a terrible accident that has caused her to have permanent amnesia. People she thinks are alive have died. She can’t remember if she is a mother. She doesn’t know why she doesn’t have any friends. Some days she wakes up and she believes she is in her twenties and cannot even recognize the woman who looks at her in the mirror.When Christine begins meeting with a doctor, he encourages her to begin journaling each day to help jog her memory of what has been happening in her daily life. As each day opens, Christine opens her journal and begins to read and as she reads, she begins to discover that the life that she is leading might not be all that it seems to be. As Christine becomes more and more aware of her story and begins to challenge the information that her husband is feeding to her about what has happened, the reader is left wondering if Christine is obsessing about details because she can’t really recall them or if the stories she is hearing are even real?If you read one thriller this year, let it be this one. I promise you, it is truly amazing and will leave you stunned when you read the final pages. I can’t wait to read more from this author....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Jul 30, 2011","Jul 12, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9736930-before-i-go-to-sleep

The novel does have a slow build as it shares a bit about the history and the scandal of 2002 when many Boston priests were accused of molestation in the Catholic Church, but the story is worth the plot set up and is a book that you will want to share and discuss with your friends.Art is the apple of his mother’s eye and is wholly committed to dedicating his life to God from the time he is a child and on. He lovingly serves his church and feels great satisfaction in his work as a priest. When suddenly he is thrust into the spotlight and is accused of molesting a child that he has grown close to through his work in the church, he is devastated as his life is under scrutiny by the media, by other church members, by other priests, and by his family.While some in his family side with him, others do not. When shocking discoveries are made into his past and the relationship that he has had with the little boy, the reader must examine which side they might be on and see both sides of the coin as his family comes to terms with these accusations. How would you feel if your son, your brother, or the person you trusted in your church was accused of such an act? Could you stand beside them or would you shun them even if they told you they would never do such a thing?Haigh’s writing is exquisitely rich and the story is told through a fresh set of eyes from the scandal that we witnessed in the media. Haigh brings in an angle that led me to believe that there truly are two sides to every story.This book would lend itself well to any book club discussions you might be having and was truly one of the best books that I read this summer!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 24, 2011",Jul 2011,"May 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9592213-faith

I also admit that I read almost the entire book aloud (thanks to my uncontrollable laughing) to my husband who also loved it as much as I did. I have been a longtime fan of Tina Fey and this book was such a treat to read and a fun light read that really made me giggle.Part memoir, part comedy routine, part story-telling, the book is a little messy and a whole lot of fun. As a mom, you will really relate to the juggling routine that Tina endures while working on 30 Rock and her obligations as a mom. More relatable than that are Tina’s stories of teenage angst and some of the hilarious self-depreciating humor that Tina seems to do so well. Tina also weaves in truths and life lessons from trying to break into the male-dominated sketch comedy world.This book isn’t for everyone, but if you loved her comedy routines on SNL or are a big fan of the show, “30 Rock,” then you will really appreciate the humor in this book.Editor’s Note- This book contains adult language and adult humor.For more book s, recipes, & tips on home management visit MomAdvice.com!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 17, 2011","Apr 21, 2011","Apr 07, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/9418327-bossypants

When Noelle unexpectedly commits suicide, Tara and Emerson are left with trying to figure out the puzzle pieces as to why she would do something like this to herself especially when she loved her job as a midwife so much. Noelle never seemed depressed and it was the last thing that her two best friends would ever expect her to do.When they discover an unfinished letter written to a woman named Anna apologizing to her, they are left wondering just how well they knew their friend Noelle and have to begin pulling together the clues to the secrets that Noelle had been hiding for so long from everyone that she loved. Everything from Noelle’s past to her career to her true relationship with the other characters in the book comes into play as the women learn more about Noelle’s secrets. Tara and Emerson discover that Noelle had more secrets than they could ever imagine… secrets that could threaten the very core of their lives and the lives of others.This book is a fabulous mystery with a great family drama woven throughout and each chapter is told from alternating viewpoints from the women themselves and Tara & Emerson’s daughters, who are dealing with their own emotions surrounding the death of Noelle.The ending will take you by surprise and I guarantee that this is a book that you will not be able to put down until the final pages....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 19, 2011","Jun 24, 2011","Apr 07, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10059498-the-midwife-s-confession

For all of Jubie’s life, Mary has been essential to their family and their household. Mary has been there when her alcoholic father and neglectful mother have not been and Jubie knows that Mary will always be around to love and care for her.As the family heads further south on their trip to Florida, they see many signs of intolerance and signs of anti-integration along the way. Jubie’s mother finds it difficult to even find a place for Mary to go to the restroom, or eat, or sleep for the night, while Jubie wonders if Mary is sensing the hatred and shift towards intolerance as all signs begin to point towards racism. In a twist that no one could have anticipated a tragic string of events turn their lives upside down and Jubie is forced to fully realize the shortcomings of her parents, their marriage, and the essential role that Mary played in her life.This is a surprisingly moving and beautifully narrated story as a debut novel from by Mayhew, but was is even more surprising is that this first novel came at the age of seventy-one. I can only hope that there will be many more novels in the future from her as this book is a truly amazing first piece of work that, Mayhew says, was eighteen years in the making.Visit Momadvice.com for more great book s!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 31, 2011","Apr 16, 2011","Mar 31, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9429531-the-dry-grass-of-august

When Michael decides to start a sports drink company, neither of them could ever expect how quickly his business would takeoff or what it would be like to be millionaires. As money is introduced into their life, their marriage begins to crumble as Michael is increasingly unavailable due to the success of his company and the separation that exists as a couple begins to grow apart.The book opens as Michael has a near-death experience and Julie, a successful party planner, is called to the hospital to be with her husband. Michael begins acting strangely and tells Julia that he has made the decision to give all of his money and company away. Julie is stunned, as she has begun the process of filing for a divorce from her husband, and will lose half of the estate and money if he gives everything away. Michael pleads for Julie to give him just one chance.This book then delves into the complex relationship that they share and how their marriage began to fail as they began to rediscover one another again once their fortune is taken out of the equation.I went into it expecting a simple piece of chick lit, and it developed into one beautiful story! Perhaps it is not life-altering, but sometimes a girl just needs a good love story that renews her feelings about love and what is important in life. It offered everything I love in a book: great characters, a beautiful love story, a fabulous friendship between two women, and great humor interjected throughout the story.

Sisters Rose If you have a sister, are a book lover, or have a love for Shakespeare, you will find, “The Weird Sisters,” is a fun and enjoyable read. Sisters Rose (Rosalind; As You Like It), Bean (Bianca; The Taming of the Shrew), and Cordy (Cordelia; King Lear) are the product of a Shakespearean professor who speaks primarily in…you guessed it, Shakespearean verse.Rose has been caring for their mother as she undergoes treatment for cancer and often plays the martyr since she has been burdened with the responsibility of her care. Under the guise of aiding their mother, both Cordy & Bean make their way home at the same time burdened with their own secrets, and the sisters find themselves together once again. As the children all return home, the sisters find they each are slipping into their old childhood antics and roles, while each trying to figure who they are as adults. Dealing with issues of pregnancy, embezzlement, cancer, and finding love, the book takes you on a journey as each sister strives to solve their own dilemma, ultimately, finding that they really aren’t so different from one another.While certainly quirky and charming, the book fell a little short for me because the sisters do seem to behave rather selfishly while their mother is ill. The Shakespearean quotes also worked at times, while others it seemed forced rather than a natural entry into the plot. Regardless, it was a quick and enjoyable reading about returning home and the bonds of sisterhood.Visit Momadvice.com for more great book s!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 23, 2011","Mar 27, 2011","Mar 04, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8573020-the-weird-sisters

I was hoping to be just as enchanted with Fay’s latest release, but it fell a little short. That being said, I still love her writing and loved this book, just not as much as her first book.Dana Stellgarten is newly divorced and has found herself dealing with issues that she never thought she would have to deal with- a bulimic daughter, a moody son, a Goth teenage niece who has come to live with them, and a very tight money situation thanks to her ex-husband’s lack of sales.As Dana’s world seems to be crashing in on her from all angles, Dana must try to find out who she really is without her husband and learn to solve the families problems on her own. The story builds as Dana finds a job to help support her family and then must learn to juggle the needs of her children with her own needs- for love, for friendship, and the money to keep their family afloat.Dana’s most surprising discovery though is that it is just as hard to make true friends in your middle age as it is when you are a teenager. As her daughter’s eating disorder stems from wanting to fit in with the cool girls at school, Dana finds herself being reeled in by the town’s queen bee and compromising what feels good to her to make friends. Both Dana & her daughter must learn what really will ultimately make them happy, and find that place within themselves.Readers will be in for a bumpy ride as you go on the journey of Dana’s love life after divorce, but the message that we all have to find that “deep down true” place, no matter how old we get, will really resonate with readers. The takeaway message was a beautiful one, but the everyday minutiae to get there might be why the book wasn’t a knockout for me like, “Shelter Me.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 25, 2011","Mar 03, 2011","Feb 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8932520-deep-down-true

Straight A’s, beautiful, and a strong soccer player, she seemed to have everything going for her. In a mistake that would forever alter her existence, and even cause her parents to disown her, Allison Green is accused of murder and spends five years serving a ten year sentence. Her reputation is marred forever, but it isn’t the only reputation to be marred.Allison’s sister, Brynn, was constantly in the shadow of her sister and never got any attention from her parents. Living in a small town and having your sister accused of murder is social suicide for Brynn, who has lost all of her friends because of her sister’s mistake. When Allison is released early for good behavior, she is the first to be called by Allison. Brynn won’t take her calls and finds the new existence she has created at college once again is clouded by her sister’s past.The two sister’s worlds are about to collide as the secret of one little boy threatens three families and the reader will be shocked at the twisted web that Gudenkauf successfully spins, weaving an unlikely set of characters together and a suspenseful satisfying ending that will leave you begging for more!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 17, 2011","Mar 20, 2011","Jan 31, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9166559-these-things-hidden

Fans of Middlesex will really and truly love this debut novel by Kathleen Winter about the difficulties of gender identification and the beauty that can bring the genders together in this lovingly crafted finalist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize.In 1968, in a remote seaside town in Eastern Canada, a child is born in a typical home birth with a midwife present. When the midwife, Thomasina, presents the baby to the parents she notices that the child is neither fully formed as a boy or as a girl. Jacinta and Treadway are disturbed by the news and must make the difficult decision to decide if their child will be a boy or a girl. The mother wishes to identify the child as a girl or to not identify the child, letting the child choose his/her own gender. Despite Jacinta’s wishes, they live in a traditional home where the man is the one in charge and Treadway makes the decision that the child will be a boy. The surgery is performed and hormones are given to the child, whom they name Wayne, and Treadway makes every effort for Wayne to identify with the masculine side of himself.Meanwhile, in secret, Jacinta is quietly nurturing the female side of Wayne and allowing him to indulge in the things that make him happy, as long as Treadway is not privy to what is happening. Wayne has never been told that he was born a hermaphrodite and does not understand why he cannot seem to identify with the masculine side of himself, but finds himself drawn more to the female side.When the shocking secret is discovered after a terrible twist of events, Wayne finally comes to the realization of why he has always felt like two different people. Inspired by the postcards he receives from Thomasina, the midwife who delivered him, from other countries, Wayne decides to leave his small town and see if he can figure out who he is on his own.The story is beautifully woven together as the reader struggles with what they might do as parents and hoping that Wayne can find an identity and a world that will be accepting of him…or her.This is a book that would make a fabulous book club book and would lend itself to really great discussion!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 04, 2011","Mar 09, 2011","Jan 14, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7984373-annabel

If you are looking for a great love story with a whole bunch of laugh-out-loud humor in it, then head to your library and pick up this gem of a book. In full disclosure, I do not read Ree’s blog regularly, do not have her cookbook, and never read the story of how she met Malboro Man before, but I ate this book up with a spoon. My poor husband found me with a stack of tissues as I read about their courtship and marriage to the love of her life.A chance encounter at a bar finds Ree out with her friends enjoying a quick drink when she spots a cowboy across the room that takes her breath away. After a brief meeting and weeks of waiting for him to call her, he finally does and so begins their whirlwind courtship. This city girl, born and bred, finds herself head over heels in love with a cowboy and brings into focus what really matters in life. Embracing the simple life of the quiet evenings spent on the porch rather than out about town and fumbling her way through the kitchen, it is so sweet to see how the two of them fall in love with one another. The book chronicles the story of their courtship all the way through their first year of marriage. As Ree learns the ins and outs of the cowboy life, you will have a hard time not laughing as she weaves that self-depreciating humor that has become her signature style!This tender love story had great elements of humor throughout that made this book a fun and lighthearted read. The book was a bit choppy in the beginning, as the story had been shared through blog entries and did not translate as well into book format, but it evened itself out and offered a sweeping ending that will have you laughing and crying at the same time....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 18, 2011","Jul 21, 2011","Jan 10, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8483233-the-pioneer-woman

It is the type of book that you beg your friends to read just so you have someone to talk to about it, and is a tribute to the beautiful storytelling and Jenna Blum, whose writing I have quickly and wholeheartedly fallen in love with. The author took a great risk by sharing the story of the difficulties that many German people suffered during the Holocaust. As most books take a heartbreaking look at what the Jewish people suffered, this book focused on the survival tactics that many Germans had to employ to survive and stay alive. The book opens with the funeral of Anna’s husband and the father to Trudy. Following the burial, the ladies rush back to their home to prepare the food for the guests to come and pay their respects, as it is their tradition in their small town. As nightfall comes, they realize that no one is coming to visit them and Trudy’s mother heads to bed without a word. Trudy reflects that the town no longer has to be nice to them and so begins the journey for the reader to discover why they would be shunned by their own community.The book follows Anna as a youth who is under the thumb of her demanding and unkind father. Anna’s father is a Nazi lawyer who can’t seem to keep anyone on hand to help with the day-to-day maintenance of the home and makes Anna do all of the chores and care for him & his home. When Anna believes her dog to be dying, she heads to a Jewish doctor for help and an unlikely friendship and love blossoms between the two. When the Jewish doctor must go into hiding, Anna keeps him in a hidden place in their home for as long as she is able. When the doctor is captured, Anna must runaway as she has discovered that she is pregnant. Unfortunately following the birth of her daughter, Anna finds she must go into survival mode and ends up catching the eye of an SS officer who takes advantage of his position and visits her weekly for sexual trysts. When the officer comes, he brings with him gifts for Anna that can help keep herself and her child alive. Anna knows that if she does not give up her body to this officer that she could compromise the safety of both herself and her daughter. She also knows that they would also lose the gifts of food that sustain them. The reader witnesses the spirit of Anna being broken and the effects that this relationship has on her daughter later in her life. The book alternates between the present and the difficulties that Trudy has with her own identity, believing that she is the love child of Anna & the SS officer and being a professor of German History. Trudy can’t seem to sustain a relationship and has a difficult relationship with her mother. In efforts to reconcile the conflict she feels about her mother, Trudy takes on a video project to document the German perspective on the Holocaust and what happened. You see Trudy becoming sucked into their stories, searching for the evidence she needs to be at peace with her mother's relationship with the officer. I can't say more- it truly is a book worth picking up. This book is a true page turner filled with great twists and bends, with characters that you will truly become attached to. The ending may not satisfy everyone, but it seemed a realistic resolution to a difficult story and followed what one would expect from these characters.Editor’s Note: This is extremely sexually graphic and violent. As with all books that share about the Holocaust, it is not an easy read, but a memorable angle for discovering the story of survival from the German perspective....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 16, 2011","Jan 22, 2011","Jan 09, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49465.Those_Who_Save_Us

This book documents the true life story of Kristin Kimball, a typical city girl who loves her shoes, fashion, and a good bubble bath, as she goes out to interview a man for a piece about farming. A city girl through and through, she becomes captivated not only with the farm life, but with the farmer that she interviews. Although she knows nothing about growing vegetables or how to care for farm animals, she decides to move to 500 acres of land and start a cooperative farm with her farmer, whom she quickly falls in love with. The story shares the transformation of Kristin as she finds herself transformed by the land, the animals, the fresh air, and a love like she has never known. She shares the daily quips and struggles of farm life with humor, but in gritty (at times a little too gritty for my taste) details about the circle of life and how the food must arrive to one’s table on the farm. There is a true honesty and warmth in Kristin’s stories whether it be about her family’s struggle with her leaving it all for a dirty life on a farm, the story as they pull together a wedding in the middle of a busy farming season, the animals as they try to escape , and even the difficulties with just keeping up with the menial tasks that are such a part of the grueling farm life. Coming from a lineage of farmers on my mother’s side, I always knew that I would never be cut out for the farm life. This sealed the deal for me that I don’t think I would have the willpower and stamina to keep up with the daily chores of living on a farm, but made me admire the strength of farming families and all they endure to provide food for our tables. Refreshing and written with a splash of humor and a lot of grit, I would highly recommend this book as a fun diversion from your normal reading schedule!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 20, 2010","Jan 04, 2011","Dec 20, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7841677-the-dirty-life

Everything from what she will eat to who she will marry is decided by the Society Officials. When Cassia attends the ceremony to find out who her match for marriage is, she is surprised to discover that it is her childhood best friend. It is almost impossibly rare that one would know who their match is so it is a happy surprise to realize it is someone she has known her life.When Cassia arrives home to find out more information about her match on the microchip she is given, it is another boy’s face that she sees…another boy that she has also known. Cassia quickly spirals down the path of wondering if this really was who she was meant to be with as she discovers the power and consequence of free will.Unlike, “The Hunger Games,” & “Twilight,” the one ingredient missing in this book is action. The element that brings the reader in is Cassia’s choice to love the person she has been chosen to be with, or to rebel against it all and going after the more dangerous choice. Unrequited love stories are always my favorite kind and the ending to this book left me anxious for the next book in the series from Ally Condie.For more book s, recipes, & tips on home management visit MomAdvice.com!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 19, 2011","Apr 22, 2011","Dec 20, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7735333-matched

In this beautifully rendered story, Shoko leaves her home in Japan by marrying a young American GI named Charlie, who has been serving in WWIII. Although Shoko is not madly in love with Charlie, she does find him endearing and also sees him as a way to escape Japan and start a fresh new life. What she doesn’t expect is just how difficult it will be to acclimate herself to the American culture and how hard it will actually be to leave her familiar world behind. Burdened with a secret that she carries with her when leaving Japan, she does her best to raise her daughter and adapt to the American lifestyle. Faced with the prejudice from others and the difficulties of mastering the American language, it proves to be a more difficult life than Shoko had envisioned for herself. Decades later, Shoko decides that she would like to return to Japan and make right her relationship between herself & her brother, as the secret that she has been carrying prevents her from true happiness and peace. She is told by her doctor that her health is deteriorating and that she is no condition to travel. To make things right between herself and her family, Shoko begs her daughter Sue (Suiko) to travel to Japan in her place and ask for forgiveness for her. The second half of the book chronicles Sue’s journey to Japan for her mother, the secrets that are discovered, and the deepening bonds between not only herself and her own mother, but the bond between herself and her own daughter.How to Be an American Housewife is a surprisingly strong debut novel that focuses on the relationship and dynamics of mothers and daughters. Each chapter opens with an excerpt on an old book on how to be an American Housewife, written specifically for Japanese brides to understand what an American man would expect from his wife. The excerpts offer clever openings into what Shoko will be struggling with on her journey towards being the ideal housewife.

This book Mudbound is storytelling at its very best and offers a beautifully rendered portrayal of race and politics in the South during the forties. This book is told from alternating points of view and shares the story of a Memphis-bred Laura McAllan who is struggling to adjust to being a farmer’s wife and living the idyllic dream that her husband Henry has for them to live off their own land. When Henry makes an error by trusting a handshake rather than a contract on the home they are renting, they find themselves living in less than ideal conditions in a shack that Henry had hoped to turn into his dream house. Laura not only must deal with the difficulties of living in this shack, but she has to do it with her racist father-in-law constantly judging and spewing hate at her.As Laura struggles with this, the real story unfolds when Henry’s brother Jamie returns home from the war. Always the favored one, Jamie comes home as a raging alcoholic, struggling with nightmares and post-traumatic stress from the war he left. Ronsel, a son of the sharecroppers who have been hired to work on Henry & Laura’s land, also struggles with leaving the war after being a hero in fighting for his country, he is now seen as just a black boy and treated with only racism and hatred.When a horrible crime is comitted, the four lives of these main characters are woven into one and the reader is taken along on the journey every harrowing step of the way. Twist after twist creates a plot that illustrates racism in a very unique way.This book is a fast-paced read, that will shock and grip you until the final pages. Not for the faint of heart- a great debut novel from Hillary Jordan worthy of the 2006 Bellwether Prize that she won for this.

I Honolulu happened to be recommended by two of my readers last month (thanks Jennifer & Susan!) so I decided to pick this one up and give it a read. I am so glad that I did read it as it was a tiny bit reminiscent of Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, which was one of my favorite books this year.This book chronicles the life of Regret, whose name speaks volumes about how her father felt about having a daughter, in 20th century Korea. Regret has a strong desire to read and learn and through some unlikely assistance from her aunt, she makes friends with a prostitute who offers to give Regret lessons in reading. As Regret learns, she begs her family to allow her to go to school, but her father has no desire to have a learned daughter. When he discovers Regret knows how to read, he raises a hand to her and Regret knows that she cannot stay in their home any longer.When she hears that prosperous Korean men that have moved to Hawaii are looking for mail-order brides, she decides that this will be the best way to get away from her traditional family. She submits her picture and is accepted as a bride, she looks forward to beginning a new chapter in Hawaii.Prosperous does not begin to describe the men that meet these mail order brides though. Many are much older and much poorer than the pictures led these brides to believe and Regret finds herself with a field worker who has very little and expects no less than a traditional bride.The reader gets to go on the journey with Regret as she is in a loveless marriage, as she struggles to make ends meet, as she makes friends with unlikely people, as she finds true love, and as she finds that her best friends and allies just happened to be her fellow mail order brides.is a beautiful tale filled with the politics and history of 20th century Korea, including well-documented research surrounding court battles and politics that were happening during this era. I truly was captivated until the last page- a fabulous read for any historical fiction buff!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 25, 2010",Jan 2011,"Nov 08, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4618728-honolulu

The strange story begins as he stands in a drugstore browsing the aisles, where he is approached by a man who asks if he can catch a ride home with him and his mother. The man appears to be injured, but seems harmless enough to catch a ride back with them. Henry doesn’t know it, but Frank is actually an escaped convict who is wanted for murder and is being searched for. His mother, Adele, is divorced and isolates herself from society, but offers to let Frank stay there for a few days as his injuries heal, in exchange for help around the house. An unlikely relationship blossoms between the three characters and Frank quickly begins to fill the voids of a partner that Adele has always wanted in her life and the father that Henry wishes he had. Whether it is the simple act of dancing with Adele in the kitchen or throwing a ball with Henry, he fills those voids that they both have been missing. All of this would be perfect provided Frank wasn’t an escaped felon, but living in hiding is not a new thing for Adele, and both she & her son become quickly swept away with Frank. The story telling in this is so vivid, despite the idea feeling a bit far-fetched, that I found myself rooting for a happy ending with the family that Adele & Henry have desired. As it seem is customary with Maynard’s books, a thoughtful twist is thrown in at the end that can lead to your own thoughtful reflection on what you would do in this situation.Editor’s Note: Sexuality is in this book, as it is told through the eyes of an adolescent boy....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 20, 2010","Oct 29, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6261961-labor-day

I hate to do a separate  of each of these books, since it would give much of the plot away, but I will say that I was over the moon about the first book, really enjoyed the second one, and the third book was a disappointment to me after experiencing how fantastic the first and second book were. That isn’t to say that the third one is not good, it just is not as strong as the first two books in the series.The story follows an unlikely heroine, named Katniss, who lives in District 12 with her mother and sister. It is not an easy life as Katniss is responsible for the hunting for her family just to make sure their family has food on the table, especially since the death of her father.Even tougher for the family though is the annual reaping day where the government chooses two children from each district to compete in a battle to the death, leaving only one winner of their annual Hunger Games. When Katniss’ sister’s name is drawn, Katniss does the only thing she can think of…she volunteers to take her sister’s place to save her life. Paired with the baker’s son, Peeta, whom she has known since she was a child, she is thrown immediately into the ring to begin a battle to the death.The battle is televised for everyone in the district and it is the stories of those in battle that the audience can find endearing or come to hate. Should they love who is competing, they can gather the proceeds in their district to offer their team’s district team gifts to help sustain them in battle. The coaches for the District 12 team realize that one way that they can make the audience members truly love Peeta & Katniss is by creating a love story between them. It is this story that they must continue to act out throughout the battle as alliances are made, broken, and lives are lost.Lucky for Katniss, she is strong with a bow and arrow and it is her strength that will help carry her through the battle. The series is written for young adults and young girls will definitely find a lot of love for Katniss as a strong female who can measure up to the men in battle.This series is fabulous and was devoured by both my husband and I. We actually fought over the books because we both were reading through them so quickly. I am so glad that we were able to read it together and I can’t wait until my children are old enough that they can enjoy it too....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 07, 2010","Nov 08, 2010","Oct 08, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games

When Lexi Baill moves into their small knit community, Lexi immediately finds a kinship and friendship with Mia, an outsider and introvert who struggles to fit in at school. It is not long after becoming Mia’s friends that Zach finds himself falling in love with Lexi. While both struggle with how their relationship can work, while not taking away their relationship from Mia, they soon all find themselves as inseparable as the three musketeers.Jude’s overprotectiveness of them cannot protect them from a fateful decision that her teenagers make that will alter the course of their lives forever. As their family falls apart and Lexi loses everything, the reader is taken through every excruciating moment of their pain-filled lives. The book takes you down the harrowing journey of the consequences of that fatefull decision and how even when we desire strongly to keep our children safe that the unthinkable can happen.Get out your tissues for this one and know that as a reader, you will be in for a bumpy ride and be haunted by this chilling account of this family’s fate.For more book s, recipes, & tips on home management visit MomAdvice.com!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 22, 2011","Apr 26, 2011","Oct 04, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8949352-night-road

It is these chance meetings where she develops a very unlikely friendship with an elderly woman named Therese Bell. Therese has an amazing collection of clothing that she is getting rid of and asks Phoebe to come to her home to sell her the clothes. Phoebe is instructed that she can only take items before a certain point in the closet, but Phoebe notices an unusual item tucked in Therese’s closet…a sky blue child-sized coat in mint condition. It is through this coat that Phoebe hears a story of friendship and regret that Therese has lived with her entire life. She has never told a single person, but wants to tell Phoebe her story so that she can make peace with her life, as she is dying. What surprises Therese is that she is not alone in her tale of friendship of regret and betrayal because Phoebe has been living with a secret of her own that has caused Phoebe so much pain that her life has taken an entirely different direction than she could ever expect. This book is a breath of fresh air and highly recommended to my fashionista friends because it feels as though you are transported in the shop and can enjoy all of the detail and thought that Phoebe has put into her shop of vintage frocks. Every piece of clothing has a story and the author carefully interweaves those stories of the customers and how the dresses find them in this charming book!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 22, 2010","Sep 27, 2010","Sep 22, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5556595-a-vintage-affair

She is organized and meticulous about the details of the adoptions and does her best to insure that the mothers that are offering their children for adoption are cared for. Chloe is dealing with three very different couples during the adoption process while she is struggling to hold her own life together with her demanding job. These three couples could not be any more different and the author tries to share their story without judgment of who is right or wrong in these cases, allowing the reader to make their own conclusions.The Novas are a very well-off couple who have suffered with fertility for years and are finally blessed with their very own pregnancy, the McAdoos are a well-to-do couple whose marriage is on the rocks after years of failed adoptions and are hoping that this adoption will create the family that they have always wanted, and Jason & Penny who have absolutely nothing except a baby that everybody wants. Their stories are told in alternating points of view and the stories weave together when a child goes missing as the reader discovers how people will do just about anything to get that one thing they want.While a fascinating premise for a book, it did not captivate me the way that I had hoped it would. It was a quick read, but the build-up for the story was a slow one and not one that gripped me the way I had hoped!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 18, 2010","Sep 22, 2010","Sep 18, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8096073-chosen

While the two families could not be more unalike, the Planks seem insistent on keeping up with the Dickerson family and keeping the two “birthday sisters” forever intertwined.The Planks farm their land while the Dickerson family is artsy and lives hand-to-mouth in a nomadic life. The Dickerson’s daughter Dana is obsessed with biology, struggling with her sexuality and feels she is as different as her family as she can be. Ruth, on the other hand, loves art and becomes fascinated with that world while trying to find a love to call her own.The book is told in alternating points of view from Dana and Ruth as they go through Woodstock, love, marriage, divorce, jobs, and what happens when their parents become older.The slow-moving plot and character build leads to a twist at the end of the story that the reader just might be expecting, but adds another little twist that gives the reader some satisfaction in understanding why these two families will forever be intertwined together.A solid read with great character build make it a good read to tackle this winter!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 29, 2010","Nov 02, 2010","Sep 13, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8134469-the-good-daughters

As a white girl, working in the kitchen and serving the master’s family is an unlikely place for her to be, but she is taken in and embraced by Belle, the captain’s illegitimate daughter. As unlikely as it seems, Lavinia is taken in as part of the family and finds that she truly is loved by all who know her. Despite being white, she is treated like the rest of the children with the same amount of love and discipline that their own children are shown.Unfortunately, her white skin sets her apart and she finds herself grappling with difficult situations as she grows older and who she must side with when racial situations arise. At sixteen, under the guidance of the captain’s family, she is sent away to get a proper education and to be among her own race. Through an unlikely turn of events, she finds herself returning to the captain’s home, now in the unique role as the mistress of the home. Lavinia struggles with her new role and being in charge of instructing the staff (her own former adopted family) on the household maintenance and chores that must be done. Her life takes one sad turn after another, as Lavinia struggles to find her place in a world that is so divided.Likewise, Belle’s life is filled with sadness as she loves a man that cannot belong to her and is victim of abuse. Being the illegitimate child of the captain comes with no extra perks, and she works the kitchen as the rest of the staff, struggling to decide if she wants her papers to be set free, especially when her freedom comes with the price of losing the love of her life.This book is a very sad tale told through the eyes of Lavinia & Belle, both offering a unique perspective on what is happening in the home and around them It has so many plot twists and turns that you will be up all night reading this one and sheds light on the true issues that faced slaves and the difficulties of the politics that surrounded race in those days....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 23, 2010","Oct 28, 2010","Aug 22, 2010",,MP3 CD,view (with text),/book/show/8612871-the-kitchen-house

Chelsea Cain fans though will find a new author and psychopath to love-to-hate in this debut novel from Chevy Stevens. Annie O’Sullivan has been trying to put her life together after a year of captivity as she rehashes what has happened to her through her weekly therapy sessions. As the story of her time in captivity unfolds, the reader is taken on a haunting journey and is able to witness the psychological traumas that face Annie as she tries to break the habits that she had to endure and find a new normalcy to her life. Before her abduction, Annie is a realtor who is hosting an open house on a relatively quiet Sunday. When a handsome young man comes to the house, she is thrilled to show him around and hoping for her first big sale. She realizes quickly, when a gun is pushed into her back, that this may be her last open house.After giving her a drug to knock her out, she awakens to find herself in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, held in captivity by a man that she only refers to as, “The Freak.” The Freak has thought of everything to make her stay in the cabin as comfortable and sterile as possible. He has thought of every simple little detail from the childlike dresses he wants her to wear, to her grooming schedule, to her dinner schedule, and even how she is to meticulously care for the cabin. One misstep in this OCD world, calculates into beatings, the loss of food, and the loss of any human connection for days on end. When she is told that she is to have his baby, she knows that she may never see her friends and family again and that her stay may be a permanent one.As the pieces are pulled together, it is shocking how The Freak has found Annie and who ultimately caused her captivity. Through the sessions with the therapist, you discover right along with Annie how she was betrayed and the irreversible damage that she has had to suffer, through this surprising ending.The chapters are short, reminiscent of a James Patterson book, and the writing is not as solid as I would have hoped. I think that the story and the plot really held it together though for me, and ultimately was a book that I managed to read in a day because I just could not put it down.

Julian works a day job, but has high hopes of one day becoming a famous musician. Brooke, his wife, is his number one fan who works two jobs to help support her husband’s struggling career as he tries to break into the record industry. They both hope that he will one day become famous and do what he loves so much. Of course, the old adage, “Be careful what you wish for,” really rings true when Julian finally becomes the rock star he has always wanted. While Julian is whisked off and surrounded by a PR team and record executives looking to boost his image and get him mentioned in tabloids, Brooke is left wondering what this will all mean for her and their marriage. When a scandalous picture is taken of her husband with another woman at Chateau Marmont, Brooke must decide if she can truly believe Julian or if the pressure from fans and the people he surrounds himself with have become too much. As she struggles to continue doing her job while still supporting Julian and being there for all of the events that are happening in his career, Brooke now finds herself, at times, lonely and practically single. With every obstacle placed in front of their marriage, the reader is left wondering if any marriage could survive the fame and scrutiny of the public.A heartbreaking and real look at fame and how it could alter a relationship, this is a little more than your typical chick-lit!

The apes are like family to her and they use sign language and a linguistics chart to communicate what it is they need. Isabel & the staff accommodate to what the apes need from getting them lattes to filming their excursions for the apes to watch later. All that they do is meant to study & research the apes while keeping them in a safe environment, and learn about how they communicate with one another.John Thigpen is a journalist who has been assigned the story of the bonobo apes and comes to document what the research lab is doing with them. He finds he is immediately drawn to Isabel and the apes and is excited to write a piece about them.Shortly after his visit though, the ape lab is bombed and Isabel is injured and hospitalized after the bombing. She is in pain, but concerned more for the apes and their well-being. When news footage shows the apes hanging in the trees because they are so frightened, Isabel becomes increasingly agitated about where they will end up. Where they end up though, no one could have guessed.After the apes are captured, they are thrown into a reality series home called, “Ape House” and documented twenty-four hours a day on television that can be viewed for the price of a membership. A seedy former pornographer producer has decided to exploit the apes as they subject them to ridiculous situations in order to make money off of them. Particular concentration seems to be on making the apes act or do things in sexual ways, in hopes to boost the ratings. When John begins working as a reporter for a tabloid paper, after being let go from his last job, he is assigned coverage of the Ape House series. He is once again trying to find out information about Isabel and what happened at the lab that would have caused the explosion. He ultimately is faced with blowing the cover off of the whole situation and uses his investigative reflexes to find out who would have bombed the lab and how the apes came into the hands of this producer. I was so excited to dive into, “Ape House,” and couldn’t wait to see what Sara Gruen came up with next. Although she spent years researching and spending a great deal of time with the bonobo apes, which was evident throughout the storyline of the bonobos, the story just wasn’t as solid or the characters as endearing as I had hoped. I was hoping for more from this book and there were too many characters and side stories that took away from the research and beauty of the story of the apes. I still breezed through the book and found it to be a quick read, but wished that the storyline didn’t have so many loose ends and unnecessary characters, focusing more on the storyline of the apes themselves....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 17, 2010","Oct 24, 2010","Aug 17, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2458340.Ape_House

She was just a child herself when she was taken and she has done everything she can to make Jack’s life just as rich as can be without being able to leave Room. In fact, she put me to shame as a mother reading all that she was doing with her child. Ma has thought of everything from celebrating Jack on his birthdays, to art time, to gym time…she manages to make it work in this tiny room. The book is written in the language of a child which I thought would be very annoying, but quickly found it to be both endearing and poignant. I am sure it was a true challenge as an author to write in this style and to not make it unbearable to read. Emma Donoghue captures the voice and innocence of Jack perfectly in this stunning book.While I wish I could say more about the book, it would definitely take away from the plot and the beauty of enjoying this one through fresh eyes. As a reader though, know that your heart will ache and root triumphantly for this mother & child to see the outside world!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 11, 2010","Oct 16, 2010","Aug 17, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7937843-room

Becky is now happily married to Luke Brandon, the love of her life, and they have a two-year-old little girl who is Becky’s biggest challenge yet. Minnie is a strong-willed child who has a love and fascination for shopping just like her mother. As she is banned from stores for her bad behavior and tantrums uncontrollably when things don’t go her way, you wonder how Becky will be able to manage their child.As Luke is wrapped up with work and the difficulties of managing his business & they struggle with their badly behaved Minnie, Becky decides to take it upon herself to throw a surprise birthday party for Luke that will include all of his friends and colleagues. The catch is that a financial crisis in London has forced everyone to be on a budget, and this will include Becky and the party of the year that Becky is hoping to throw. Since Becky has rarely had to do anything on a budget before, hilarity ensues as Becky tries to pull off a budget-friendly party and not have Luke catch on to her plan.Readers will be entertained as Becky tries to find jugglers and fire-eaters by bartering through Craigslist with her high fashion wardrobe pieces and as she crafts homemade pom poms for the party décor. As a YouTube, “Happy Birthday to Luke” campaign is underway and newspapers are blasting about the party of the year, you will be giggling to the last page at what lengths Becky will go to as she tries to celebrate Luke’s birthday and extinguish the fires as the word begins to spread about the party.I really enjoyed this quick read although the last two chapters really made the whole book for me. It is the glimpses of the realness of Becky and her everyday struggles with a strong-willed child that made this a great read for moms and her shopaholic ways that add that little bit of escape to every day life....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 29, 2010","Oct 09, 2010","Aug 17, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7415016-mini-shopaholic

She also happens to be pregnant with a Hampton-fling’s baby and quickly discovers that she is alone in the world. For the first time, Darcy is not wanted by any man and now must figure out how she is going to make a life for her child on her own.Instead of focusing on the baby though, she immediately moves into a routine of continuously shopping and then waiting for Ethan, the best friend with whom she is staying with to come home. While Ethan encourages her to think outside of herself for once, Darcy really doesn’t decide to start to change until she has a tift with Ethan and realizes that staying there is really her last hope. She has ostracized all of her friends and family and now must find who Darcy really is.I don’t want to give any of the plot away so you can enjoy this book as much as I did, but will admit that it was a bit predictable in parts. The predictability and the ease that this one is to read makes it perfect to tuck in your bag for a trip.  For a character that will be easy to love to hate though, Giffin puts a spin on Darcy’s story that finds you empathetic towards her as Darcy ultimately learns to love someone other than herself and the series ends with that fairytale ending that you will be craving as you conclude this amazing sequel....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2010","Aug 03, 2010",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8162705-something-blue

Darcy is the beautiful one and is the friend that is always hogging the spotlight, while Rachel has always been content to be in Darcy’s shadow, concentrating on her studies in school. As Rachel is out celebrating her thirtieth birthday with Darcy, her fiancée Dex, and their other friends, she finds that she drinks a tad more than she normally would and finds herself in a predicament that changes the outcome of her life.That night, when Dex graciously offers to see Rachel home, one thing leads to another and they find themselves having an affair that neither one of them bargained for. Writing it off as a one night stand, Rachel decides that she will try to forget that the encounter ever happened. Thinking that Dex likely had too much to drink too, she is stunned when Dex admits that he has had feelings for Rachel for a long time.As the two of them try to resist each other, Rachel is forced to complete the duties as the maid of honor to Darcy, and help her with the decisions for her wedding to Dex. Rachel is consumed with guilt while Darcy continues to be consumed with herself and is oblivious to what is happening.Told from Rachel’s perspective, you begin to sympathize with Rachel and the challenges that she has had to live with to be friends with a person like Darcy. As she reflects on childhood incidents and the way that Darcy has made her feel, you can’t help but to sympathize for her and root for her to be with Dex.The twist is such a good one at the end and while it is more of the chick-lit genre, this book is more about the friendships and the dynamics within a friendship than anything else!

One day as she is photographing her fiancee's daughter on the beach, she is distracted for a moment by an animal that has been injured and washed up on the sand. As she turns her head for that one moment, the unthinkable happens and six year-old Emma seemingly disappears in thin air. Michelle Richmond vividly captures those sheer moments of initial panic as Abby scours the beach for Emma, the call that she must make to Jake to let him know that Emma has disappeared, and the search for Emma as Jake and Abby become consumed by Emma and her disappearance.While Emma’s father, Jake, is willing to go along with the police investigation and only what is considered police protocol, Abby, on the other hand, is living with the guilt of knowing that she is the one who lost Emma and is determined to bring their happy little family back together. She begins trying the unconventional routes of discovery like hypnotism and even putting herself in harm’s way to post Emma’s picture anywhere and everywhere she can over the course of that year of her disappearance. When a clue finally comes through a hypnosis session, Abby travels to a foreign country to try to unearth where Emma may be and ultimately discover who could have kidnapped Emma. Surprising discoveries are made that will leave the reader guessing up to the final pages about who could have taken Emma and what the motives could have been to take her from a family that loves her.It is a book that tugged at my heart as I read it, and the pacing is so slow at times in order to build up that anticipation and ache in your heart that makes you hang on to the last page to figure out what has happened to this little girl.

It is reminiscent of Jodi Picoult’s earlier work with just the right balance of suspense and mystery to keep a reader enchanted until the final page. I must say that I am smitten with Lisa Unger and can’t wait to read some of her older novels now that I have had a taste of her writing style. In the town of The Hollows, a fictional small town just outside of New York City, a young girl goes missing after a fight with her parents. The disappearance reminds the people in this town of another similar disappearance of a girl named Sarah, who had suddenly disappeared in the eighties, and many of the main characters find themselves flashing back to that first disappearance. While the main characters are revisiting the disappearance of Sarah, they are also desperately trying to find the current girl who has disappeared. Charlene is a bit of a rebel-child and born to a family from the wrong side of the tracks. She is the girlfriend of Ricky, who is the child of Jones ( a cop) and Maggie (a psychologist) on the other side of the tracks, yet Ricky has no idea where Charlene has gone even though he loves Charlene.When Charlene posts a status update on her Facebook page that she has left for New York City, Ricky and his friends are suspicious that someone has logged into her account because the status update sounds nothing like something Charlene would write. They began to fear the worst as the clues are uncovered and there are a cast of suspects that could have taken Charlene. With Charlene gone, the clock is ticking to find her and bring her back to her family. Unfortunately, there are many suspects, but few clues as to where she could have gone. The reader is taken along on the journey as they try to uncover what has happened to Charlene as it is told through the eyes of everyone from the cop on the case, the psychologist whose family is battling their own demons, through the eyes of a troubled child, and even an exterminator who happens to have witnessed a few clues of his own to help the case. While there are many characters, the plot somehow flows seamlessly as each person shares their innermost secrets and does not create confusion for the reader. Through these characters, the reader can begin to piece together both disappearances for a surprising twist that will bring the two stories colliding together, reminding us how small the world is and how intertwined our stories can be. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 07, 2010","Sep 09, 2010","Jul 27, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7083584-fragile

Built upon the fascinating true-life home economics programs that were offered in the thirties, Henry House is a test baby for a home economics house to teach women the basic life skills of running a house and caring for a child.Henry House is an abandoned orphan who is taken in by the strict house mother, Martha, as a test baby who is cared for by six house mothers who alternate weeks and routines with him. Martha is of the firm believe to never pick up a child if the child is crying unless it follows her strict scheduled regime and requires that the mothers in the house follow suit. They all are immediately smitten with Harry and Harry lives a strange and enchanted existence where six women are at his beck and call while following the regime that Martha has ordained for all of them. Martha develops an attachment to Harry unlike she has experienced ever before to any other test infant in the house, and decides to keep Harry instead of returning him to the orphanage. Martha soon finds that her ways of child rearing become challenged when she keeps Harry longer and has to deal with him as he grows older, something she has never experienced before. She begins to question if her ways are really right and if she really was as qualified in the role of a house mother when she has never had a real child of her own.When Martha tells Harry that his mother died in a car accident instead of telling Harry the truth that his mother abandoned him because she had the baby out of wedlock, his relationship to Martha is forever altered from that point on and he vows he will pretend to be mute so he does not have to speak to her.You then follow Harry’s life as he lives his life through a mute, as he discovers the healing powers of art, as he discovers his sexuality, as he finds that it really isn’t all about that, as he searches for love through a cast of unlikely characters, as he finds a career in animation, and then as he finds where he thinks he might finally belong. If you are a fan of Forrest Gump, Mad Men, or even The Curious Case of Benjamin Button…this book is for you! While slow paced in some parts and a dissatisfying ending, it still was a fascinating premise of a book that I will long remember!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 19, 2010","Aug 29, 2010","Jul 25, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6706812-the-irresistible-henry-house

The cover and the title madeI have heard many friends talk about this book and I have had it on my list for awhile as a book that I wanted to tackle. The cover and the title made me think that I was diving into a book about a cookbook collector, but this book was so much more than I had expected and unlike anything I had expected.The story follows two sisters who could not be more opposite if they tried. Emily is a CEO of an internet start-up company while Jessamine is a free-spirited philosophy major and participating in environmental activism on the side. Jessamine falls in love with a true tree-hugger who lives a nomadic lifestyle fighting for the rights of trees while Emily finds the love of her life in another CEO of a dot com start up.As Emily tries to make millions with her new start-up, Jessamine is happily working a used bookstore. When a customer comes in with an unusual collection of cookbooks that she would like to have appraised, it sets the stage for Jessamine to find a new passion and question her own identity of who she is and who she loves. Emily meanwhile grapples with how she can cultivate a long distance relationship and still be a success in her company. When she confesses a secret project that her company has been working on to her boyfriend (who also works in his own start-up), it sets the reader up for a suspenseful ride as Emily tries to figure out who she can trust and Jessamine figures out just who who she is.As the two sisters are on two entirely different paths, the reader is taken on a ride along with them as the rise of the dot com happens, the fall of the stock market, the devastation of September 11th, and the realization that the sisters are more alike than they might think.Readers may have difficulty keeping up with the sheer volume of characters in this book and the author does fail to tie up loose ends as neatly as you might hope, but you have to pride the author on the ambition of this book.The true appeal of the book for me was how vividly Allegra was able to capture this time period and the significance of how big the dot com bomb rose and fell. It really brought back so many memories of the start-ups that my husband & I both ventured into when we first were married. Anyone who survived the dot com bomb will have a true appreciation for this read!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 09, 2011","Mar 17, 2011","Jul 24, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7632696-the-cookbook-collector

As she stands at her funeral, she is faced with wondering who at the funeral murdered her. While it sounds like the premise for a deep novel, it actually moves into a lighthearted book of fantastic chick lit as Molly reflects on the past and follows the life that is happening around her.A wretched mother-in-law, a husband whose infidelity begins on their wedding day, a spunky twin sister whose anger over what has happened to her sister has consumed her, and a best friend that would have moved mountains for her, and the determined detective who has been assigned her case to figure out which of these people could want Molly Marx dead are a sampling of the strong characters within this book. Molly is beautifully flawed and is a character that you will enjoy following despite those flaws as she discovers what really and truly makes her happy. Molly is discovering who she is and the decisions she could have made to have prevented her death, but it can’t change the outcome. It can, in the end, identify her killer though. A perfect whodunit mystery with wonderful chick-lit flavor, this is a great book that is perfect for Sophie Kinsella fans or any fans of a great murder-mystery with a surprisingly fun heroine.

The Nobodies Album is an ambitious novel that is almost three novels in one. The concept for this book offers a unique plot unlike any that I have read before.Octavia Frost is the fictional bestselling author who has decided to take on the enormous task of rewriting the previous ending to all of her past books. As she is on the way to deliver this book to her literary agent in New York, a headline captures her attention in Times Square. The reason it captures her attention? The headline claims that her son, a rock star with whom she is estranged, has murdered his girlfriend.Blindly she heads to San Francisco to support her son Milo, knowing that he couldn’t have possibly murdered Bettina, the love of his life. Upon her arrival, she is unsure if she will even be welcomed into his circle because of a mistake that she made many years ago. She is warily enveloped into Milo’s fold, as Milo confesses that he can’t remember what happened the night of the murder.With all evidence pointing to Milo, Octavia takes a writer’s perspective and begins to piece the story together, just as she has done with all of her books in the past. As she tries to figure out who would have murdered Bettina, you are taken on a journey through the chapters and then the revised chapters of the books as the story begins to unfold. You also are taken on a journey as you discover the deep secret that has kept Milo and Octavia apart and the tragedy that has enveloped their lives since Milo was a child.The fact that Parkhurst can grab the reader as each chapter is shared, you almost wish that she would write a book of her own that would build upon the brilliant chapter ideas she has created for Octavia’s book. The chapters are interjected in a suspenseful plot which can be agonizing at times because you want to read the real story so much.It was a great book by a great author and I am looking forward to reading more of her future books. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 19, 2010","Jul 11, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7099280-the-nobodies-album

The reader is taken on a journey through a demise of a relationship and when this happens, how you begin to wonder what-if about other relationships in your life.Novelist Nathan Bennett seems to have it all and he thinks he finally has a success on his hands with his new novel, “Infidelity.” Just before the novel is set to be released, Nathan sits his wife Sarah down to tell her that the novel isn’t a fictional one and is based on his own infidelity with a woman that he met at a writing conference.Sarah is now faced with what she should do with their two kids and begins to consider how different her life would have been if she would have acted on a relationship with a man that she always had feelings for before she got married. When Sarah kicks Nathan out of the house, she decides to see what would happen if she explored that past love opportunity and tries to discover who she is and if she is the person she is because her spouse wanted her to be, or if she is that person because that is who she truly is. She asks the questions and expresses the sentiments of any woman who is in her thirties and looking back on love that has been lost and the new ailments and issues that plague us as we grow older, but I found that was where relating to her really ended.I found this book to be a very depressing one, although it was well-written. I found both of the characters were acting very selfishly and it made me sad for the children that were involved in this relationship. I did love the sense of humor that Leah Stewart inter-weaved through the story, but was ready for this book to end so I could move on to something a little more uplifting.

This story is about two sisters who are both hardworking doctors, but that is where their similarities end. Maya & Rebecca are as different as night and day and both harboring secret about the murder of their parents that have shaped them as adults. Maya is married to a wonderful husband, but suffers from infertility that has caused a strain in her relationship with her spouse. Rebecca, on the other hand, is a free spirited woman who works for a disaster aid program where her job changes from day to day. The sisters are close and Rebecca acts as Maya’s fill-in mother since their mother has passed away.After two hurricanes hit the state of North Carolina, Maya and her husband, Adam, decide to join the relief effort and help the organization care for those who are sick and injured since the devastating hurricanes came through. When Maya is sent to care for a group of patients being airlifted to the hospital, her helicopter crashes and Maya is thought to not have survived the crash.While Rebecca and Adam continue to work for the disaster aid organization, they are both left devastated without Maya. They turn to one another for comfort as they cling to the small piece of hope that Maya may have survived.Maya, meanwhile, awakens to find she is being cared for on an isolated island by a very pregnant Tully and her husband. They work hard to nurse her back to health and care for her until she can be rescued, while her family never knows that she is still alive and is planning her memorial service.I loved this book, but hated the improbable and tidy ending of the book. I wished that the author went a little further after all of the character development. The ending left me shaking my head and wishing that it hadn’t ended the way it did. If you can look past the ending, the book was a good summer read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 21, 2010","Jun 21, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7602266-the-lies-we-told

The book moves at a slThis is my first book by Anna Quindlen, but after reading this haunting book, I doubt it will be my last read from this author. The book moves at a slow build and shares about an altogether typical family suffering from the same everyday life issues that so many families are facing. With three teen children, Mary Beth Latham is trying to play an active role in her children’s lives while still allowing them to become the adult people that they are shaping to be. As her son becomes increasingly depressed, Mary Beth focuses her efforts on her son and trying to help him overcome his emotional issues, often to the detriment of other members in the family. You find that Mary Beth is trying to find that perfect balance in motherhood where she balances her career and loving each of her children equally, and the duties in her role as a wife. As we all know, it is not a balance that is very achievable. In a shocking twist that I will never reveal, something happens that shakes the utter core of this family unit. It was so shocking that it literally took my breath away and caused me to think about how I, as a mother, would react if such a situation happened to me. More importantly though, how would I feel if my community and friends felt that something from my past or a decision I had made had caused harm to my family?Mary Beth’s character really takes shape after the tragedy and we then begin to get small glimpses into her soul and her own struggles as a mother and wife that, I am sure, face many of us. We also see as Mary Beth reflects on her past decisions that cause others to place shadows of doubt upon her. I will say, if you are feeling blue, not a good book to pick up. It is something that has stuck with me since I closed it and I can’t stop thinking about what has unfolded in it.

Her novel, “Ann Brashares, best known for her Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series, is an author that I have not had the pleasure of reading yet. Her novel, “My Name is Memory,” sounded like a promising beach read though and perfect for those of us that are Time Traveler’s Wife fans and missing that “love through the ages” romance that we have been longing for. I expected a lighthearted read and instead found myself reading a fantastically paced novel full of beautiful characters and a cliffhanger of an ending, perfect for this planned trilogy. Daniel has been searching for the love of his life, Sophia, for years. Not just a few years though… for over 1,200 years he has been looking for his one true love and hoping that they will be reunited at the perfect time and find love together again. Daniel has had many souls that transcends centuries from the eighth century in Turkey to WWI. Each time he dies, his soul returns and he spends his entire lifetime looking for Sophia.The stars finally align for them when Lucy, a shy high school student, and Daniel meet. Lucy has an inexplicable connection to Daniel and when Daniel tries to explain to her that she is his Sophia, it pushes Lucy away because she is so scared and confused. After Lucy heads to college, she decides to try to uncover the mystery of this Sophia and find out if Daniel is telling the truth. She admits that she feels a connection to him and a connection to the name Sophia, even though she has no idea why. The need to discover this sends her on a wild goose chase discovering and learning more about their relationship.Daniel gives Lucy the space she needs to discover who he is while trying to protect Lily from imminent danger. You see, Daniel isn’t the only one with an old soul. His brother, and Sophia’s former husband in a past life, also wants Sophia in his life and to punish his brother for taking his wife away from him in a past life. The book is a fast-paced adventure that transports you into different centuries as Daniel is reborn and trying to find the love of his life. His character is endearing and you will find yourself rooting for Daniel and Sophia to find true love again. While this is an adult read, it still has the feel of a young adult book. The ending was also admittedly a little cheesy. That being said, it is a satisfying read that reads a little like Twilight and a little like The Time Traveler’s Wife- a story of unrequited love that transcends the ages. If you are a fan of either of those books, then I have a feeling you will love this book!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 13, 2010","Jun 18, 2010","Jun 13, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7135858-my-name-is-memory

Katie, who has made it her life’s goal to publish documentaries, and her husband Nick, a speech therapist, seem to have the perfect marriage. They begin to work together on a case of a mentally-handicapped young man who becomes like a son to them.One day Jerry, who has the mind of a ten year-old, shoots Nick in cold blood and Katie is forced to stand trial against Jerry and share about Jerry’s intimate past, her own past, and Nick’s. When you begin to feel sad for Katie, you soon realize that they did not have the perfect marriage at all. Nick is verbally abusive to Katie and their marriage felt forced upon him. He had decided to leave Katie one month before the murder and Katie is left to figure out the puzzle pieces of her life without Nick and without Jeremy.The story flashes forward and backward, alternating between chapters, to share more about Katie and how her own insecurities within herself have pushed away family members, friends, and neighbors. She never believes that she is good enough and is always comparing herself to others. Katie must find the love within herself to want to find her own life and continue a life without the center of her focus being Nick.The book was about obsession and Katie wanting to be loved and adored by Nick when he never really loved her. Unfortunately, as you get to know Nick more, it makes you not even care that he had been murdered and it makes you wish for Jeremy, confused and alone, to not have to be put on trial. Perhaps that is what the author really wants here.Unfortunately, the story really did not hold me the way I wanted, the ending was very confusing and I had no idea really what happened in the end, and I just was ready to move on to another read.

Her husband, Phil, is a dentist and they have a beautiful home, a beautiful neighborhood, a church family, and a beautiful daughter. Elyse is not happy though and has not been happy in her (almost) ten years of marriage. A chance meeting an unexpected stranger on a flight throws Elyse’s life in a tailspin that she could never imagine. As she clutches this stranger's business card in her purse, she contemplates if she should risk it all for a stranger and see if a relationship can happen. Elyse has been so unhappy for so long in her marriage, that she believes that she is entitled to a little bit of happiness and decides to see what will happen. As the affair goes on, she attends marital counseling with her husband, and gab sessions with her girlfriends on marriage, sex, love, and freedom. Her best friend and fellow book club members all begin to reflect on their own relationships and what these issues mean to them. As Elyse heads down her own road to self-discovery, they are on their own journeys which add to the plot line of the story.While this may seem like typical chick lit fare, it is actually a really great story with fantastic character development. I wanted Elyse to be committed to her marriage and family, but as the character of Phil is developed, you begin to understand Elyse’s longing to be desired and validated. In the end, of course, Elyse learns that the validation really must come from within.This is a fantastically fun novel that is perfect to throw in your beach bag this summer!

I am not a big fan of the romance genre though so my thoughts on this book come from that place. This book was a cross between The Notebook and Bridges of Madison County… a beautiful story of unrequited love that will leave you a tad frustrated and rooting for true love in the end. I read about it in a magazine and considering the author’s credits (producing shows like The Wonder Years, Dawson’s Creek, & Sisters) thought it would be a great book to add to my beach bag.The story takes place during WWII and Lily Davis is awaiting the return of her husband, Paul, from the war. The two married too soon and had only been together two weeks before Paul was shipped off to war. Lily is left for three years on her own waiting for the man she hardly knows to return so they can begin their life together. During that three years though, Lily has changed so much and her fiery, independent spirit has grown even more fiery and independent. As the town prepares for the soldiers’ return, Italian firework expert, Jake Russo, is hired to put together a welcome home firework show for the town. A chance encounter, brings Lily and Jake together and Lily finds herself falling deeply in love with Jake…a love like she has never experienced before.Within a few short days, Lily begins to question who she is and who she would be if she stayed with her husband Paul. She is left with the tough decision of honoring her soldier husband and family’s wishes or following her heart and leaving with Jake.The author captures their love beautifully in this short book with a surprising twist at the end that will leave your heart aching for Lily and the decisions she had to make.A quick read that is perfect for the romance-loving reader and Nicholas Sparks die-hards.

To me, the book encompassed my favorite scene in the movie Ratatouille when the food critic takes a bite of food and it sends him spiraling back in time. He is a child and his mother made him the dish and remembering the feeling of being young and what that dish symbolized to him. This book is a moment like that, but deeper and more magical as Aimee Bender captures this instance and takes it further into a more magical place.It begins with Rose’s ninth birthday. Her mother has decided to make her favorite lemon cake to celebrate the occasion and Rose is so excited to eat it. As Rose eagerly dives into the cake, hot from the oven, and takes a bite, this bite changes her life forever. For within that bite, she is able to feel an aching sadness and sorrow in her mother that she never knew her mom possessed. It makes the cake taste horrible to her and forces her to realize that her mother is very unhappy.The gift is not much of a gift for her as she struggles to eat foods that she normally liked that are filled with emotions that a nine year-old child is unaware that people experience. Relying heavily on prepackaged foods and one sad woman at her school cafeteria whose foods don’t taste bad to her, Rose has been forced to rethink everything about everyone.Rose isn’t the only one with a secret though and as you read the book, you discover that each member in her family is living with their own complex secrets. To say more than that, would give the surprising plot away, but know that the secrets add much beauty and depth to the story.Not a single word is wasted in this book. The story is beautifully told, magical, and unlike anything I have ever read. I can’t wait to read more from this author.

In the fall of their sixteenth year, Moira Leahy always struggled growing up in the shadows of her wildly talented and fun-loving twin sister, Maeve. In the fall of their sixteenth year, Moira falls in love with a boy named Ian. What she quickly realizes though is that Ian’s love is meant for Maeve,and once again Moira feels as though she is in Maeve's shadow. Thanks to being identical, she can easily pass herself off as Maeve to receive Ian’s affection. They meet secretly at night and Ian falls deeper and deeper in love with Maeve…never knowing that he is actually meeting Moira. Secrets are hard to keep from a twin sister, and Moira has to make a conscious effort to block Maeve from reading her thoughts and discovering her secret. When the lies become too much, a fateful accident occurs that changes Moira and Mave’s lives forever.Now grown, Maeve has become a workaholic and professor of languages at a small college in upstate New York. She dreams often of her twin and is haunted by what happened that fateful night. She is detached from everyone in her life, but one night an auction changes her life.At the auction a keris (a Javenese dagger) is put up for auction and it reminds Maeve of the long lost days of playing pirates with her sister. An uncontrollable urge to win it, whatever the cost, allows her to be the proud owner of the keris. This dagger takes her on a wild adventure to Rome, to discover its origin and ultimately, to find a love that she thought she lost. Her adventure is full of magic, mystery, love lost, and love found. It is a story of self-discovery through an unlikely antique that will take the reader on a lovely little ride.The beginning was a slow build for me, the middle was fast-paced and exciting, the ending a little long, but full of great twists that surpr ised me. It was a fantastically solid read from a brand new author,whom I discovered through GoodReads by author Allison Winn Scotch (a personal favorite of mine). What I love even more though was that Therese is also a tweeter and I received several sweet tweets from her when she saw that I was reading her book. There is something special about an author that engages like that and I am excited to not only get the opportunity to share about her book, but also engage with her personally.

I was anxious to dive into another book by her andAfter reading The Hand that First Held Mine, I immediately became a super fan of Maggie O’ Farrell. I was anxious to dive into another book by her and The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox is perhaps one of the most haunting and twisted family drama stories that I have read since my high school years of devouring V.C. Andrews. Iris Lockhart is a single young woman who spends her days tending to a vintage-clothing shop and trying to sidestep a commitment with her married boyfriend. To her surprise, she receives a call one day letting her know that her great-aunt Esme is going to need to find a new place to stay because the insane asylum that she has been staying at is going to be closing. The clincher is, Iris never knew that her great-aunt existed and that she has been housed in the asylum for over sixty years.The story that unfolds is both dramatic and, at times, very confusing. It is told through the eyes of a young girl whose only true fault is being strong-willed and dedicated to her academics. It is told through the eyes of Iris, as the young woman is trying to discover her family secrets while carrying the burden of knowing she can’t make a commitment to any man until she deals with her own secrets. It is finally told through the eyes of Esme’s sister, Kitty, a nursing home patient who has been struck with Alzheimer’s in a fragmented and disjointed prose that mimics the mind of Kitty.The story is haunting, the betrayal is shocking, and the twisted ending just begs for a sequel. It will leave you wondering what will become of Esme and it made me want to read it all over again once all the pieces have slid into place. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 09, 2010","May 09, 2010","May 09, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/250729.The_Vanishing_Act_of_Esme_Lennox

Her personal life is not going as well as her business though and she finds herself in the middle of a divorce battling for the custody of her children. Her lawyer’s best advice that he can give her is to not get involved in any relationships or engage in any behavior that can upset this custody battle.Just days later following a company dinner, she is seduced by a doctor that she had been flirting with, and decides to risk it all and spend the night with him. After falling asleep on his penthouse terrace, she comes back to the bed and finds Dr. Keaton has been murdered. Not willing to jeopardize her own custody battle for a one-night stand, she can tell no one that she was there that evening. Unfortunately for her, the killer knows that she was there and begins to stalk her and send her messages to let her know that she could be the next victim.Instead of becoming the victim, Lake begins her own investigative case to figure out who the killer is. As she begins to discover more and more clues, she finds shadows are cast on the credibility of the clinic she is working for. As her case builds, she begins to wonder if her stalker is after her because of being witness to the murder or if someone at the clinic is worried that their reputation might be at stake.I read this book in a day and thought it was a fun beach read. It is a typical thriller read, but it still had me guessing until the very end who the killer might have been.

This book did that for me and I could not be more impressed with the author’s beautiful prose, the pacing of the book, or what a gift Maggie O’Farrell has for character development and the art of intertwining two beautiful stories into one.The book opens with the stunning Lexie Sinclair, a rebellious young woman, and a chance meeting for her and a very sophisticated man named Innes Kent. It is in the post-WWII era, a time when such spirited youthfulness is frowned upon, but Lexie is ready to start a new life in London and she begins her new life with Innes. What begins between them starts a very unlikely love story that is vividly captured with O’Farrell’s words. Innes quickly takes her under his wing and not only loves her, but guides her into a journalism career that Lexie had never thought to explore. In the next chapter, you are introduced to Elina and her boyfriend Ted and it is fifty years later. They have just brought home their baby boy, never realizing how different both of their lives will be. Elina, who suffered from a difficult delivery, is learning what a challenging role motherhood can be, while Ted grows more and more distant from Elina and the baby. Ted is suddenly having snippets of memories that he can’t recall and the baby forces to light a shadowed past that he did not know he possessed.It is a book that builds and builds upon these stories and the chapters suddenly twist together and you find out how these stories are interwoven. It took me by surprise how they would weave together and throughout most of the book, you are trying to discover just what it is that brings these two stories together. I hate to say more than that, for fear of giving away the experience of discovery for yourself!The book’s prose is so visual and almost cinematic in the way the story is told. In some scenes, it feels as though you are reading a script as the characters, setting, and mood are described in vivid detail. It is because of the writing style that I look forward to reading more of O’Farrell’s.

I had never read or heard of the book before, but am trying to tackle some literary classics this year and this book was the most beautiful coming-of-age story that I have ever read. I can’t believe that I am 32 years old and just now reading it and discovering what a beautiful book this is.The book is about Mary Frances Nolan (also known as Francie) and shares the story of her life from the tender age of eleven until she turns sixteen. Growing up as a poor girl in Brooklyn, it shares the story of the survival that they must go through to keep food on the table and the difficulties of family life when ends just don’t meet. With a mother who is doing the best she can to keep their family afloat and an unreliable, but loving father who works as a singing waiter and takes to drinking at night to cope with the realities of his life, the family lives in a tiny flat in Brooklyn where they try to make the most on the very least.Francie is forced to be older than she is from the very beginning of her life. Often saddled with the task of bartering at the grocery store, figuring out a way to get into a better school so she can get her education, and made to get jobs to help with the family finances or assist her mother on jobs, you can’t help but admire Francie’s resourcefulness throughout the book.The Christmas scenes, the things that the children treasured the most, the tin can filling with pennies of earnings that would later feed them, the diary entries carefully edited because of her mother who didn’t want Francie writing about her father’s alcoholism, the impractical gifts that the children gave to each other (and their mother let them) only to discover their mother was right, those feelings of first love- all beautifully captured in prose that held me and wouldn’t let me go.While I can’t say that there is a definite plot to the story, the book is told almost in short story format sharing the daily trials and tribulations of growing up in a poor family, it really did not need a focused plot because the writing was so beautiful. I would say that it mainly focused on the self-discovery that Francie makes about herself and about her parents as she becomes more aware of what is happening around her and as the responsibilities later shift to Francie’s shoulders when she struggles with wanting to be an adult and support the family, but also desires to get an education.No words can describe what a treasure this book is to read. Despite being written so long ago, the themes are still so current- the need to keep up with one’s reputation, the importance of hard work and honesty in life, the discovery that money isn’t everything, but that it does make it easier when you don’t have to focus on it, and the importance of loyalty to your family. If you haven’t read this one, add it to your pile today!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 17, 2010","Apr 25, 2010","Apr 13, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14891.A_Tree_Grows_in_Brooklyn

The story centers around Hannah, who is in her thirties, struggling with a drinking problem, an unfaithful spouse (although she is unfaithful herself), and a marriage that is teetering on the edge of divorce. To resolve things once and for all, Hannah attempts to break into her own house, to confront her husband about his cheating ways, and falls three stories and suffers a head injury. Hannah ends up in the hospital and is forced into a journey home to her parents so they can help Hannah get back on track. Hannah knows that the reason she is living like this is because of the mysterious disappearance of her father. At the tender age of eleven, Hannah’s father goes on a fishing trip and never returns again. In her heart, she truly believes that her father is not dead, but simply missing. She is set on discovering what really happened to her father on the night of his boating accident and to know once and for all if her husband is dead or alive.Her gay brother Palmer, on the other hand, has his own demons to deal with and has always secretly believed that he is the cause of their father’s disappearance. He is finally in a great relationship, in a fantastic house that they have created together, and his career is going great. When his partner decides that he wants them to have a baby, Palmer knows that he can’t commit, mainly because of the deep-rooted feelings that he has surrounding their father’s disappearance.While the book was fast paced, the story never really went anywhere for me.

TheFour months after the tragic death of her husband, Janie is greeted at the door by a contractor who has come to make a porch addition on her home. The twist is that Janie did not request the contractor and had no idea that any renovating would even be happening. This porch was a gift that her husband, Robby, had decided to buy for her as a surprise gift.Although Janie is in no mood and has no desire for a new porch, the job has already been paid for and the contractor, Tug, insists that it was definitely something her husband would have wanted.As the construction begins on the house, Janie’s heart and life are under construction as she discovers who she is without her spouse. An unlikely support group forms- the well-intentioned priest who comes even when Janie swears at him and dreads his visits, the busy-body aunt who fills in for her absent mother, her cousin who brings her treats from his bakery with his Barbie-look-alike photographer girlfriend, the bossy neighbor who knows exactly how Janie should handle things, and even the quiet contractor that witnesses the comings and goings of this unlikely cast of characters that help Janie get to a place of healing and acceptance for what has happened.The novel is moving in a way that I can’t describe. It made me laugh out loud because of Janie’s brutal honesty, it made me cry when Janie faced her times of loneliness and the way that the children react to their father’s absence, and it made me wish to see the character to find happiness again, even if it means she must move on from her husband, the love of her life.The book immediately sucked me in, but it was a little longer than probably necessary as some of the character development that didn’t necessarily need to be there, had been developed by the author. Other than a little bit of dragging at the end, it was a flawlessly beautiful novel that will make me hug my husband a little tighter and created an awareness of how fragile our relationships can be. I can’t recommend this one enough!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 12, 2010","Apr 17, 2010","Apr 12, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4701057-shelter-me

Heart of the Matter is a fantastic quick read that would be perfect to tuck in your beach bag for summer. Tessa Russo is a mother of two children and wife to the most successful and renowned pediatric surgeon in town. She is a wife that seems to adore her husband and is able to take his career and the nuances of being a doctor’s wife in stride.One night their anniversary dinner is interrupted with an emergency surgery that must be performed. Six year-old Charlie, is involved in a tragic accident that will forever change his life and the life of single mom, Valerie Anderson. Nick Russo, Tessa’s husband, immediately makes Valerie and Charlie feel at ease with his great bedside manner and his easygoing attitude with Charlie. As Charlie is under his care, they both began to rely more and more on Nick to help them through the tragic situation that has faced them. The comfort that he offers to Valerie quickly eases into a deep friendship and then a relationship that crosses the patient/doctor relationship borders.The book is told in alternating pitches and allows you to glimpse into and sympathize with both women in the story. You began to empathize with both of the characters and find that you can find your heart torn between all of the characters. As a mother, I really hated how Valerie’s relationship with Nick, at times, seemed more of her focus than caring for her son. I also hated how, as the relationship unfolded, it affected Charlie and his own world. I found myself sympathizing a lot more with the wife than I did with Valerie. In the end, the book is about forgiveness, the discovery of love, the loss of love, and the healing that comes from all of those experiences. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 07, 2010","Apr 11, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7114761-heart-of-the-matter

Her books are filled with women who have come to a crossroads at their life and must make a decision on what path to choose.The One That I Want explores another crossroad of a woman who seems to have it all. Tilly is living the life that she has always dreamed of. She loved where she grew up and has a career as a guidance counselor and is married to her high school sweetheart. They live in a tidy little home that was purchased for them with the help of her father and, in her eyes, she has everything that she could ever want. At a local carnival she runs into an old high school friend who has now become a fortune teller. Her old friend, Susie, decides to give Tilly a gift that she think that Tilly has never had…the gift of clarity. With the gift, if Tilly sees any pictures of the people she loves, she immediately passes out and can see visions of the future and what is to come.What Tilly sees shocks her and she soon realizes that the life of perfection she has always thought she lived might not have been perfect. Her father is heading down a road towards alcoholism again, her husband isn’t really happy anymore, and Tilly is forced to decide if this “perfect life” is what she really wanted.You will find yourself rooting for Tilly as the character is learning to rediscover who she really is. Her exploration comes through the help of her friends and family as Tilly rediscovers what a perfect life really is.I love Allison’s magical spin on stories and loved this book a lot. I related much more to the characters in, “Time of My Life,” but still felt this was a strong book from the author. I was, once again, immediately sucked in and now will be drumming my fingers on the table awaiting another fantastic read from her.PS- Allison is also on Twitter and very engaging with her fans! I spoke to her a few times and she is just as lovely as can be. I wish her all the luck in the world with this fantastic new release from her!

I will admit, it was not one of the best books I have read, but in many ways I related to Julie’s commitment to her blog and recreating recipes in her kitchen for her blog audience. That being said, I have heard from many that the movie was much better than the book itself, and that is why I am looking forward to watching the movie soon.Julie Powell is a frustrated secretary living in a small New York loft apartment, with her husband and cats, who decides that the thing that she needs to do to jumpstart her life again is to become passionate about something. When she runs across her mother’s old copy of Julia Child’s, “Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" she remembers how her mother whipped out that particular cookbook for special occasions and created recipes out of it to impress their dinner guests. She decides that she will challenge herself to cook all 523 recipes within a year and chronicle those adventures through a blog, in hopes that the challenge will add something into her life that has been missing. It is a laugh-out-loud funny book that had me giggling from the bottom of my toes as she tries to find rare ingredients, attempts making dishes out of live lobsters, and goes on a journey of self-discovery as she attempts to master the art of a little of her own French cooking. It really isn’t a book about cooking, unless you are looking for a person that is simply struggling to cook, but more about what is discovered about herself through this adventure. As she works her way through this cooking challenge, you see how it brings her closer together with those she loves and how those around her (both in the blogging world and her real life world) come together to eat, share, and become a part of her cooking adventures.The book wasn’t enlightening at all, the language was rough, and Julie was not always a likeable character, but I appreciated her realness and how so many of us find our place and discover ourselves through blogging.

It starts in the bird population and quickly jumps species and becomes a level 5 pandemic among the human population. Now this estranged family must come together to survive the worst scenario of their life- being quarantined together while they must rely on the government and medical system to find a vaccination to stop the virus before it kills them. The portrait of what life would be like if this situation would happen is terrifying. It begins with Ann rushing to the grocery store to stock up on food, where people are hurting and even killing each other fighting over bottled water and food. They lock themselves in their home where the electricity is out for over a month, garbage is no longer being picked up, hospitals are not operating, and everyone must be scared of their neighbor and friends to prevent being struck with the H5N1 themselves. The family is forced to make tough decisions that they never thought they would face and learn to live without the luxuries in life of clean water, how to protect those you love while still caring for others in your community, and how precious life really is. As the situation escalates, the character development builds and you began to root for this family to pull together and to survive this ordeal. This book was amazing, thought-provoking, and made me question what I would do in such a scenario. Could I still stick to my virtues when I have to protect my family or would I become as many of the people become, fighting and stealing to protect what is mine? The book slowed down a little in the middle and I did not really like the narration switching in the last chapter over to the daughter, but overall, it was an excellent book that will make you hold your children a little tighter and make you aware of all of the precious blessings we all take for granted. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 18, 2010","Mar 21, 2010","Mar 18, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6670514-the-things-that-keep-us-here

This true life story is the common thread that ties all of the chapters of Colum McCann’s beautiful fictional novel entitled “Let the Great World Spin,” together. Each chapter is its own short story, yet each story seamlessly weaves into the other as the reader makes the surprising discovery that the characters are not only drawn together by this exciting stunt in some small way, but in many more ways than the read could ever anticipate.The book opens with a kind-hearted priest who has decided to plant himself in the roughest New York neighborhood to act as an aid to the prostitutes that have set up shop. His small and sparse apartment becomes a place of refuge for the prostitutes in his community and he puts his own reputation on the line to care for them and many others in his community. From there the writer takes you on a journey as each chapter segues into the next as you learn about other elements of the story that somehow seem unrelated, but then are pulled together magically in this book. To share what each chapter is about would give away a beautiful plot that is worthy of any reader to discover on their own. I will say it was a difficult read for me at times and a little labor intensive for a summer read. The dialogue was also, at times, a struggle to read as the dialogue and writing mimic the speech of the characters that the chapter is being written about. Just like most books of short stories, some chapters were far more interesting in others, but it was one of the most unique novels I have read in a long time.

Janice is a relatively happy trophy wife who has helped her husband in every way that she knows how to be the roaring success that he is. She reads her Gourmet magazine and replicates the dishes, she is carefully groomed and has maintained her figure over the years, and her family lives in the immaculately tidy home of their dreams.When her husband’s stocks soar, after making an important pharmaceutical drug, she runs out to grab the ingredients for the most perfect celebration dinner. When she arrives at home, she finds a note from her husband letting her know that he is leaving her for her best friend and that he will be filing for a divorce.What happens to a woman when her whole career and existence are based upon caring for her husband? Janice quickly spirals out of control and the reader is taken through Janice’s downward spiral and the downward spiral of her two children who are both trying to find themselves after making bad decisions.One daughter who grew up the valedictorian in her graduating class, now is deeply in debt after her the feminist magazine she started failed to bring in any profits. The other daughter has a desire to be liked by her peers and begins sleeping with her classmates to garner attention and her feelings of self-worth. She later decides that Jesus might be the key to her salvation, but her poor choices have taken her so far off path that you are unclear where her life will really end up. Janice, meanwhile, has decided to take crystal meth because she feels happier and more in control when she is drugged. With their mother drugged out and the two children both choosing their own destructive paths, the reader can only hope that the resolution will be filled with deep discovery and a realization that they have each other and money is not everything. It just did not end the way that the reader might hope.I found the book to be a fun and impressive premise of self-discovery when each of the characters are trying to find who they are without their fortune, but the book was depressingly dark and never went anywhere other than the dark and dreariness that it began with. If you are into dark satires though that is filled with a little bit of dreary, this just might be the ticket for you! ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 30, 2010","Apr 06, 2010","Mar 11, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2134009.All_We_Ever_Wanted_Was_Everything

In some ways it was a huge success in the exploration and research of Aspergers syndrome, in others, the book fell a little short with me.Jacob Hunt is a teenage boy who has Asperger’s syndrome. He is intelligent, can memorize facts and movie quotes better than anyone, and he has a huge love of forensic sciences. He lacks the ability though to connect with people, can only understand literal meanings of words, can easily become overly stimulated, and has never understood the social cues and unwritten rules of personal space or relationships.His true obsession with forensic science is what takes up the majority of his day and research. He has a love for a CSI show and keeps hundreds of journals on the episodes, trying to crack the cases himself and documenting each case dozens of times. His obsession with forensic science and his inability to engage with others makes high school tough for this teenager.Thankfully, he has a great friend, Jess, who has stepped in to offer guidance on learning social behavior and who has been hired by the family to help him survive the tough world of high school. Jess is a college student and an all-around golden girl who has a true devotion towards helping make Jacob’s life easier and help him understand all of this cues that we take for granted.When Jess is murdered, her abusive boyfriend is the first person to taken into custody and seems the most likely suspect. His boot print is found at the scene of the crime and his previous physical abuse towards Jess makes him seem the perfect murderer.When the news shows the victim’s body wrapped in a quilt that could only belong to Jacob, his mother steps forward and says that she is concerned that Jacob may have had something to do with the crime. Jacob is taken into custody and the entire world of the Hunt family is sent into a downward spiral.All of Jacob’s behaviors, due to his Asperger’s, are behaviors that are often exhibited in someone who is guilty. Jacob can’t make eye contact, he can act violently or inappropriately if he is over stimulated, and he seems to have no emotion. His lawyer, Oliver, has a tough case on his hands and must convince a jury that Jacob acted innocently because of his emotional detachment and inability to understand the social cues of others. As a reader, I really enjoying the pacing of Picoult’s books and the usual twist that occurs at the end. Unfortunately, I was able to solve the case on my own within the first twenty pages and then had to read another 500 pages in hopes that the twist was not so obvious.The worst part about this book was that the book seems to be missing a final chapter, as though Picoult was on a writing deadline and just stopped short before bringing the reader into a conclusion of how the case actually ended or where the relationships of this family went. For all of that research and the bulk of this book, it was a disappointment for me.The careful research and beautiful prose were definitely there, but the ending and predictable twist made it not as solid of a read as some of Picoult’s earlier work. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 11, 2010","Mar 13, 2010","Mar 11, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6614960-house-rules

What if Jodi Picoult fans will appreciate this suspenseful book by Lisa Scottoline that gives us a glimpse into an adoptive mother’s worst nightmare. What if you found out that everything you thought about your perfectly legal adoption was wrong?Newspaper reporter Ellen Gleeson became the adoptive mother of her little boy Will after covering a story about the sick little boy who was abandoned by his mother because of numerous health problems. The mother did not feel she could care for him and decides to make the heart wrenching decision to give him up. After his surgery though, the hospital discovers that his health problems were resolved and Ellen finds herself in love with this little boy and decides to adopt him and make him her own.When she picks up the mail one day two years later though, she notices a missing child flier that has a little boy that looks exactly like her son. Even though her adoption is perfectly legal and the mother has signed off on all of the papers, could this little boy be the exact same little boy as the one in the flier?Being an investigate journalist, she can’t shake the feeling that something may have been wrong with her adoption and decides to seek legal counsel to find out if she has any parental rights. When she finds that her adoption lawyer, a happy mother of three, has supposedly committed suicide she begins to wonder if something more sinister is to blame.Ellen is sent spiraling into mysterious deaths, a fascination with the family that has lost their only son, and clues that lead the reader through this mysterious thriller. It makes you wonder as a mother what you would do if you were faced with the moral dilemma of turning the information in to the authorities and giving up what is most precious to you or harboring the secret so you can selfishly keep your little boy as your own.It was a good solid read although, at times, very predictable. It was my first novel by Lisa Scottoline and was chosen because it was a new Target book club pick and I have never been lead astray by their choices.

As someone who was not familiar with the story of Alice or Lewis Carroll, I found the story both intriguing and disturbing. Alice led far from the enchanted life that you might have thought and ultimately, the friendship between her & the author lead to the demise of many relationships in her life. Alice Liddell was the muse for Mr. Dodgson, a professor at Oxford, who later wrote the book of Alice in Wonderland under the pen name of Lewis Carroll. Alice and her sisters spend many days exploring the grounds, going on boat rides, and spending time in the company of Mr. Dodgson. He is fascinated, in particular, with Alice and tells a story to her one night about her adventures in wonderland. Alice begs him to write her story out and he later does, which becomes the book series that he is so known for.As their friendship grows, Mr. Dodgson and Alice began to have a relationship that is both confusing and exciting to Alice. Mr. Dodgson has an interest in photography and tells Alice that he would like to take her on a special outing where he can take special pictures of her. He writes her letters and Alice writes him back in an almost courtship that would be very inappropriate for a child of her age. That day of photography ends the friendship of Mr. Dodgson and the Liddell family, causing difficulties for Alice to find true love later in her life under her clouded reputation.As Alice grows into her own person, she finds and loses loves in her life and increasingly finds the burden of being the Alice in Wonderland that everyone is dying to me very cumbersome. She later decides to use her celebrity status and the sacrifices that she made in her childhood later aid Alice to have a better life than she could have had on her own.If you don’t know anything about the story of Mr. Dodgson or about the real-life Alice, it is a fascinating look into a friendship that was altogether inappropriate and, in this historical fiction perspective, caused a lot of heartache for Alice in finding love later in her life.This is a book that you just want someone else to read so you can talk about it!

In my English classes, we were exposed to only excerpts of the classics, but not the full books. Maybe that is why, as an adult, I have an interest in exploring the classics for the first time. When I spotted an entire table of Harper Lee’s, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” at our local library, I grabbed a copy to attempt to read it!Those that live in the Michiana area can participate in a unique opportunity called, “One Book, One Michiana.” They are encouraging everyone to read this classic and then will have community-centered activities and events surrounding this book. I am excited to participate in this and excited for any opportunity that encourages me to step out of my comfort zone when it comes to literature.To Kill a Mockingbird is set in the 1930’s in the Deep South where race and social standings are of great importance within the Maycomb community. When lawyer, Atticus Finch, is the assigned defense to an African American charged with raping a white woman, he compromises his social standing by defending his case before the court. The entire story is told through the eyes of Atticus’ children as they try to understand what it means to be white during a time of great racism.The story opens with Jem & Scout, Atticus’ two children, spying on their neighbor who is a town recluse and never leaves his home. The story of Boo Radley is how the children keep themselves entertained during those long summer days and Boo’s story is interwoven through the book. They are simple children that just love to fight, to play in the dirt, and who love to play pretend games with their neighbor boy.Their entire world changes when Atticus is assigned the defense of an African American man who is accused of raping Mayella Ewell. While the Ewell family are the lowest in the white class, they are still accepted and believed more than Tom Robinson who has always been an honest and kind family man.Everyone is against Tom even when all of the evidence points somewhere else and Atticus has to defend the toughest case of his career to a jury of white men. The court scenes were riveting, the twists in the plot added depth to the story and characters, and telling the entire story through a child’s eyes was priceless to the story. The characters in this novel are so rich and beautifully written that a piece of yourself can identify with so many of them. Admittedly, I had a hard time with some of the racist language and derogatory terms that were used towards African Americans during that time, but it shapes the story and makes you realize how horrible these times were. I can’t rave enough about this book and wish I could share more in my , but I don’t want to give away the beautiful plot, twists, and turns that you would experience as a reader if you haven’t read it! ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 13, 2010","Feb 19, 2010","Feb 13, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird

Deciding to go against the obvious and form a book club, they decide to challenge each other and start a Wednesday Sisters group, where they would meet each Wednesday morning and share stories they had written with one another. Some take the writing assignment as a fun outlet, while others have ambitious dreams of being published and known for their writing.While starting a writing club in this decade wouldn’t seem like a big deal, it was revolutionary in its own way because women were left with caring for the home, caring for the children, and caring for their man. Women with ambitious dreams and lofty goals were not the norm, yet as the book progresses each of these women finds their own voice and their own purpose in life. It deals with some of the tough topics of the decade- racism, feelings about beauty pageants, women in the workplace, protests against government, and the stand-by-your-man philosophy that so many women were encouraged to do even in the face of adultery from their spouse.As someone who writes, I found their journey through writing endearing and touching. When the women reached specific writing milestones, my heart would leap a bit knowing how each of them discovered themselves and their own potential for their lives.While the beginning started a little slow for me, the beautiful story that developed held me to the beautiful ending and made me want to start a little writing club of my own. More importantly though, it made me so thankful for my girlfriends and the power that women have to encourage one another toward our goals, to celebrate life's great accomplishments, and to hold each other up when we face challenges. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 23, 2010","Feb 13, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2728347-the-wednesday-sisters

If you have not read Kristin Hannah before, this is a standout read that will have you spending a little time with your tissues and even giggling out loud at the dynamics of sisterhood and family.The book is about two sisters who are as different as two sisters can be. The sensible Meredith has taken over the duties of the family business and remains the rock for her family. Her sister Nina, on the other hand, chooses to be a traveling photographer who finds great joy in the travel and the inconsistency of her life. When their father brings the two sisters together on his deathbed, he makes them promise to take care of their seemingly unemotional and detached mother and to listen to one of her Russian fairy tales in its entirety. Neither daughter has a true relationship with their mother and both find spending time with her to be difficult.Meredith is left to care for her mother, Anya, and quickly discovers that the task will not be an easy one. Her mother is becoming frustrated, confused, and her behavior is becoming more and more bizarre. As Meredith’s marriage and job are becoming more demanding, she is forced to put her mother in a nursing home to help her with the duties.When Nina returns home and finds her mother in the nursing home, she insists that she is brought home where she can care for her. Nina forces Anya, a woman that neither daughter really knows, to share about herself each night through the fairytale that their father has requested that she share.This fairytale takes the three women on a journey that none of them expect. What starts as an innocent story about a girl being swept off of her feet by a handsome prince becomes altogether too real as the story begins to unfold. It will leave the reader with her heart in her throat and shows the fragility of life and the heart of the human spirit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 04, 2010","Mar 05, 2010","Feb 13, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6668467-winter-garden

What I did not know was that over a half million people in the United States alone suffer from early-onset Alzheimer's and that it is possible to suffer from this disease at a much earlier stage in your life than I had ever imagined.Alice Howland is a cognitive psychology professor at Harvard and is known for her great intellect. She is admired not only by the other faculty members, but by her students for her amazing ability to captivate an audience when speaking about what it is she is most passionate about. Her husband is a scientist, and together they have collaborated on book projects and have a mutual love for each other and the intelligent and scientific dialogue that they can have together. When Alice starts becoming confused and begins losing her words, forgetting what she is supposed to teach on, and even forgetting where she lives when she goes for a run, she blames it on menopause and decides to contact her doctor about her memory loss.After going through screening, it is determined that Alice, at the age of fifty, is suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. Alice's quick spiral into memory loss is heartbreaking and her story is especially poignant because she is the chosen narrator of the story. At times, as the reader, you can even become confused along with Alice as scenes are repeated and her family member's begin to lose their names, or she believes she is talking to strangers when they are well-known characters throughout the book. The book sheds light on a very real disease in a way that can only be told through the narration of Alice. Although Alice is slipping, she is ""still Alice,"" even when her family feels her mind is very far away.This book pulled at my heartstrings in a way that I can't describe and has made me thankful for the beautiful memories that my mind can retain. It is a wonderful reminder how essential memory is in our daily lives and how important it is to love and respect those who are suffering from Alzheimer's....more",Notes are private!,-1,4,1,"Jan 26, 2010","Jan 30, 2010","Jan 26, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2153405.Still_Alice

These two women pioneered the uncovering of fossilized creatures and lead many of the scientific discoveries of the nineteenth century.Set in the city of Lyme, Mary is a girl who has been unusual her whole life. Her uniqueness begins after being struck by lightening as a baby and she continues to be considered different by her community because of her unusual habit of searching for fossils on the beach that has been passed down to her by her father.Elizabeth, a middle-aged woman who has never been married, and her sisters move to the town and each take to their own hobbies. All of the sisters have the usual hobbies of gardening, keeping home, and baking... all of them except Elizabeth. Elizabeth soon finds her own hobby of fossil discovery, although she lacks the eye of training that Mary possesses.An unlikely friendship between two women of very different social classes form because of their mutual interest in these fossils as they make rare scientific discoveries by gathering these bones.When a man comes between the two women, neither can put their egos aside to apologize and they are left to their discoveries alone. When Mary discovers something that their community thinks cannot be made by God's hands, the only person that can preserve her reputation is Elizabeth, because of her social standing.Will Elizabeth put aside her feelings to defend her friend's honor or will she allow nature to take its course and discredit Mary's standings in the scientific community?I found the book to be a fast read and a very interesting look at a time when talk of fossils challenged the very belief system of people and a time when women were never intended to pioneer anything other than the keeping of their homes.

What you get won’t be the truth; it will be a story. And nothing is more telling than a story.” So begins the beautiful debut novel of Diane Setterfield, a book that took me on an adventure that I did not want to end. It was a book that interweaves two stories together seamlessly with some of the most beautiful writing I have had the pleasure of reading.Margaret Lea has led a quiet little life, working in her father’s bookshop, and being proud of a few small autobiography write ups that she has done. She has a difficult relationship with her own mother and harbors a secret of her birth that has caused her to not be able to be close to the people she loves and has always left her feeling incomplete in her life.When a surprising letter comes from the world-famous and reclusive author, Vida Winter, she is shocked to discover that Vida has requested her presence at her home to write the untold story of her life. She is famed for the surprising volume of books she has written in her life and is well-known the world over for her beautiful prose. Her most famous includes the book of thirteen fairy tales, that only held twelve, a mystery that has never been solved. Even more famous though is Vida’s gift for the storytelling she has weaved for other past reporters about her life story. She has never truly told the real story to anyone, but it is her dying wish to have Margaret write her life story for the first time. She promises to tell Margaret the real story, provided she allows her to tell it in her own way at her own pace. There will be no jumping ahead in this story, but it is a story that she promises will surprise Margaret and that she will tell as truthfully to her as possible. The story is unlike anything ever told and Margaret becomes enchanted with the life of Vida and how, in many ways, it has reflected her own life story and who she is. The story is about her mother, a set of feral twins named Adeline & Emmeline, a beautiful topiary garden that holds deep secrets, and a tragic fire that changes her life forever. To tell the story would take away the gift of reading it, but what I can tell you is that it is every bit of suspense with each shocking and creepy turn. It is written beautifully, has references to so much literature and loveliness, and is the perfect book for any true book lover. Enjoy this book with a big cup of tea on a rainy day and you will be transported on an incredible journey. If I could have given this book ten stars, I would.

She mistakes their history as a relationship that has continued and decides to cut off all contact and her relationship with Blomkvist.Blomkvist, meanwhile, is at the center of the media after cracking the case in the last book and is unsure of how to address being the focus of the media attention when he once was the interviewer. He is also confused by his sudden end of the relationship between him and Lisbeth and seems to be living his life in a state of limbo.When he decides to run a story in his magazine though on a sex trafficking operation between Eastern Europe & Sweden, he opens a can of worms that he never thought he would.The story that will be published will bring to the center of the controversy many of the prominent officials in the Swedish government and endangers many careers and lives with its publishing. As the story is about to go to press, two investigative reporters are murdered and the accused murderer? Lisbeth Salander.Lisbeth goes into hiding and her perspective is missing from the story for a good two hundred pages as Blomkvist firmly believes in Salander's innocence and decides to do his own investigative sleuthing to discover who the true murderer is.Anticipation builds up as more and more evidence points in Salander's direction, but the book takes you on a surprising journey through Salander's past as it comes to the cliffhanger ending.The only fault with this book is that you have to wait for the next one to find out the fate of Salander and Blomkvist. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 12, 2010","Jan 05, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5060378-the-girl-who-played-with-fire

The book was okay, but definitely lacked the character building that the first book had. Even so, it was a fast read that I managed to finish in a day and I am still planning to read Evil at Heart. When the body of a young woman is found in a neighborhood park, Detective Archie Sheridan, is reminded of his first body that he found, the first of many deposited victims of Gretchen Lowell. This body is not one of her victims though since she is locked away in jail. No, the woman's identity is tied to the first book and starts another huge case in the political world for Archie Sheridan and his investigative team.As he is busy trying to uncover the case with newspaper writer and amateur sleuth, Susan Ward, Gretchen escapes prison and a manhunt is in on to capture this serial killer before she kills another.In his heart though, Archie knows that he is the only one that could ever capture her and bring her to justice. Unfortunately, in his twisted mind (and later evidenced in flashbacks of their relationship before he was tortured by her), he is secretly in love with her.That is kind of where the believability factor ended a bit with me. If I was brutally tortured by someone and I was supposed to be serving in the role of criminal justice, I can't imagine having a physical relationship with the person that did it to me or who brutally killed so many in my community.Of course, Archie is on a fast track to nowhere with an addiction to pain killers, a failing marriage, no seeming attachment to his children, and an obsession with someone he can't have.When he decides to kill himself, he knows that he has nothing at risk and he can go to Gretchen willingly. When his team discovers that he has put himself at risk and gone to her, the clock starts ticking to save Archie before he is killed...by himself and by Gretchen.Despite this book being a bit of a disappointment, I have already started delving into Evil at Heart and am looking forward to reading this next installment. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 18, 2010","Jan 19, 2010","Dec 29, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2983654-sweetheart

Since I had a flight this week, I thought this would be the perfect light read for my trip, and I was right.This book is about the three Grey sisters who lost their mother when they were very young and the unfolding of their lives since their mother's death. Their father, Henry Gray, seems to favor only one child and keeps his focus on making sure that their family upholds their ancestral heritage. His only concern is maintaining their appearance and reputation at all times in their town. When Vivi Ann meets the true love of her life, their father is angry with her choice in choosing a rancher who is Native American and not from a ""proper upbringing."" Vivi Ann follows her heart though despite her lover's past and decides to make a commitment to him that will change their lives forever.When a murder takes place in town, the first suspect is Dallas, Vivi Ann's love, and everyone in the family is forced to choose sides and decide whether they believe Dallas to be guilty or not. With his difficult past and quick temper, could Dallas have been the killer? The lives of all three sisters change as each sister decides her stance and the true secrets of each of their feelings. Their story is peppered with constant rivalry, the forgiveness that must be given, and the redemption that they must allow one another because of their sisterly bond.I found the beginning of the book a little slow, the middle to be fast-paced with a fun twist, but the last quarter of the book really slowed down again for me. I really enjoyed the character development of Vivi Ann and her sister Winona, and Noah, but Aurora's voice was never heard in the book which would have definitely improved the story since it was about three sisters and not two.Overall, it was a fast read that would be perfect to take with you when you travel or a fun summer beach read!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 07, 2010","Dec 26, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3975186-true-colors

Well, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is that book for me. The book is an endearing story about Henry Lee, a Chinese American living in Seattle, who has just lost his wife to cancer. After he hears that the belongings of Japanese immigrants were found in the basement of the Panama Hotel, the book begins a journey through his life currently and flashing back to his childhood where an unlikely friendship began with a Japanese girl named Keiko that has carried with him through his adulthood.Henry Lee’s father desires for him to have the “American dream,” and he receives a scholarship to attend an all-white private school where he can get the education he needs to succeed in America. The other students taunt him mercilessly and his only reprieve from the taunting is when he is serving food in the cafeteria. While serving the food, he finds the only other student of minority, a beautiful girl named Keiko, and they develop a fast friendship. Unfortunately, Henry’s father wants nothing to do with the Japanese and his growing love for Keiko has to be kept a secret.When Keiko is shuffled over to a camp, to protect the Japanese from the anti-Japanese sentiments during WWII, Henry knows that he must find a way to go to her and to be with her. Through the help of the lady on staff in the cafeteria, he scores a position working on Saturdays where he can see and be with Keiko. Their friendship and love grow through their letters and Saturdays together and Henry is forced to choose between his family or the girl that he loves.There is so much color in this novel and the twists are beautifully written. I found myself cheering for Henry as he stands up to the bullies in his life and to his parents, and also feeling misty-eyed as this unexpected relationship takes place.I don’t want to give away anymore of the plot than is necessary because this book is so worth reading and experiencing for yourself. While some may argue that it isn’t always historically accurate or that the switching back and forth between present and past is choppy, the story is so beautiful that it will have you overlooking those technicalities and rooting for Henry & Keiko the whole way through! Lisa See fans will love this one and I can’t wait to read another book by this author! ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 06, 2010","Apr 25, 2010","Dec 26, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3367956-hotel-on-the-corner-of-bitter-and-sweet

School Nurse, Kate Cypher, has returned to her home in rural Vermont to care for her mom who has Alzheimer's. The night she arrives, a young girl in town is murdered in a horrific murder that eerily is the same as a murder that took place during Kate's childhood to one of her friends.The book flashes forward and through the past of these two murders, one to a social outcast named Del who is nicknamed the ""potato girl"" and is mistreated by her friends and family. The other murder that has taken place to another young girl in a similar way. The mystery of these two murders ends up colliding together as Kate begins to pull the pieces of these two murders together. It is definitely a ghost story, a mystery, and a coming-of-age story that is pulled all together.

Luckily, he meets a girl who makes him feel somewhat whole again and can look past his scars to the person he is.The plot thickens as Sara's past is told through her eyes, Keith and Maggie finally see each other after her time in jail, Maggie tries to find a way to forgive herself, Keith deals with the abandonment of his mom, and a surprising twist occurs at the end that will take the reader by surprise.I found this to be a really satisfying read especially since I was so disappointed with the abrupt ending of the first book. I was able to read this in just a few nights and would love for the story of the Lockwoods to continue!While some sequels can be read without reading the first book, this is one that you really need to read the first book to really get all of the family drama. It is a twisted family tree and reading the first book will provide reference to just how tangled those branches are!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 14, 2009","Nov 03, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6251052-secrets-she-left-behind

I was not disappointed with “Before the Storm,” which sucked me in and was quickly read within two days. Before The Storm is a complex family drama that is told from each family member’s point of view. Laurel is the mother of two children, but her focus is solely centered upon her son Andy who is her fifteen year old disabled son. When a fire to a church starts at a youth lock-in that Andy is attending, Andy for the first time becomes a hero saving all of the children in the church and an object of the town’s affection instead of being cruelly ridiculed by his classmates.As the investigation as to what started the fire goes underway though, Andy becomes the focus as the arsonist instead of the town hero. Laurel is focused on proving his innocence and as she focuses all of her efforts, she loses sight that she has two children and not one. Her daughter Maggie harbors deep secrets, but goes unnoticed because of all of the effort that is put into her brother and his special needs... and now his defense.The book goes back and forth from the past to the present tense, setting the reader up to discover why Andy is disabled, the family secrets that shadow their life, and the complex relationships between each of the characters.The only disappointment was the build-up to the grand finale, which was finished in a short epilogue and chapter. For over four hundred pages of build-up, I had hoped for a more in-depth ending. It reminded me of Jodi Picoult’s swift endings that take the reader by surprise, but leave you wishing more.Thankfully, “Secrets She Left Behind” should fill that void as the character development continues in this sequel! I look forward to diving into that book next!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 05, 2009","Nov 03, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2589061-before-the-storm

It goes through each decade, the hair, the pop culture references, and the politics that are happening as they are growing up.Kate & Tully are as opposite as friends can be, but they are both outsiders in their own ways. Kate is a bookworm and shy while Tully has been uprooted to a new school and feels unloved by her mother. Regardless of their differences, they become fast friends whose lives become quickly entwined.As they get older, new issues face them. Tully is career-driven and hungry for a job as an anchorwoman. Kate, on the other hand, is more laid back and unsure of her life goals. Kate really just longs to be with someone while Tully ends up with the someone she longs to be with.In some ways the book was predictable, in others, it reminded me of the chick flicks I love to see with my girlfriends.

The story surrounds a self-centered Peony who has always been cared for and had everything provided for her. She has quickly approached the age of marriage and, as is customary, has been betrothed in marriage to a man that she does not know. She knows that it is her daughterly and wifely duty to be a good wife to him and has no trouble with this arrangement until the evening that she meets her true heart’s desire.She meets this handsome poet one night during the performing of her favorite opera, “The Peony Pavilion.” She knows that it is wrong for her to even speak to the man, yet they arrange a meeting each night of the opera and she feels, for the first time, the feelings of true love. At the tender age of sixteen, these meetings are all that can she think about and she knows that she should marry this man.In the days leading up to her wedding day, thinking of this man causes her to become sick, weak, and obsessed knowing that she cannot be with her true love. Much like the ill-fated lovers in The Peony Pavilion, her life takes a turn that the reader will never expect and her life mirrors the story told in this opera.I wish I could say more, but to say more would reveal the twists and turn in the plot that makes this book an unexpectedly different read than what I had anticipated. It is a true look inside the ancient rituals surrounding what happens in the afterlife and how the Chinese view the importance of their ancestral heritage.

In the past, I haven't enjoyed books like these, but within a few short pages, I felt attached to the characters and loved to see how this story unfolded.This book is set both in London and in Guernsey Island and is a series of letters from Juliet, a budding author looking for a new story, and the people of Guernsey Island as she learns about their Literary & Potato Peel Society that is set up as a way to survive the occupation of the Germans set up on a whim to explain why a group of them were out past curfew.Juliet is a hysterically funny and witty character and comes to know The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society when one of the members happens upon a book of hers and inquires if she has anymore books to share with his book group.Juliet asks for more details about this group and the members in it and through the letters comes to know more and more about them.

The story is told through the unique perspective of Death, which adds a certain darkness to this book, as he shares the story of taking souls and the increase in unnecessary and cruel deaths during the terrifying reign of Hitler.While so many books I have read have concentrated on all that the Jewish people had to endure, this book told their story, but also told the story of a poor German girl who is taken in by a foster family enduring poverty and the heartache of the loss of her family members.Her moments of joy come when her adopted father teaches her how to read and she becomes engrossed in learning and reading the written word. In a time of great poverty and where books were scarce, the little girl becomes a ""book thief"" stealing books for these sweet moments of treasure during a time of aching heartbreak in her life.When her adopted parents hide a Jewish young man, by the name of Max, in their basement, they form a fast friendship and this protection of this man becomes of great importance to their family. The book takes you on so many twists and turns and I found myself weeping for all that this little girl has to go through.

I am becoming such a huge fan of Lisa See and now am anxious to read Peony in Love after having read this great book. Snow Flower & the Secret Fan takes place in 19th century China and is centered around the lives of two girls who are paired as laotong (or ""old same"") at the tender age of seven years old. As is customary in their tradition, Snow Flower & Lily are paired together to be lifelong friends and to see each other through their marriages, children, and through the ending of their lives.They write back and forth in a secret unique language called nu shu on a fan to communicate to each other without allowing the prying eyes of men to see their true feelings and discussion about what goes on in their household. The messages written on their fan start in their girlhood and begins as an introduction to one another. It later reveals the true secrets of how they feel about their status and about one another, shared between only them.In the beginning, Lily seems an unworthy match for Snow Flower and does not seem as learned and polished as her old same. Snow Flower appears to be the more polished one coming from a higher upbringing and is happy to share her knowledge on things such as writing, embroidery and sewing. Lily offers advice on cooking, cleaning, and caring for the home. They seem the perfect match.A secret and misunderstanding sends their worlds into a spiral and the reader is taken on the journey where their friendship is threatened to tear apart. It is a friendship that endures through a war, through many pregnancies and miscarriages, through difficult marriages, but can it survive until the end of their lives?

I really enjoyed the beginning and the end of the book, but the middle part was very, very slow for me. The White Queen tells the story of Elizabeth, a woman of exceptional beauty, who catches the eye of the king and even gets him to marry her. Elizabeth falls into her new role easily and secures places in the court for her family. As much as she is ambitious and driven, the king struggles with finding people to surround him that he can trust.

Phillipa Gregory, after much research, shares her hypothesis on what happened those many years ago in a twist that any reader unfamiliar with this story will find shocking.My chief gripes with this read were:1. I had difficulty keeping track of all of the characters. I could have really used a family tree that showed the lineage of the families because I was having difficulties keeping track of all of the people that were in this book. 2. The story of Melusina was overused in this book. While in many ways it was essential (the flooding, the ""curses"" thrown on those who did something against the family) it definitely was a theme that did not need to be mentioned in every chapter.3. The story was very focused on the politics and war instead of the love story and the story of Elizabeth herself. I would have loved more on their relationship and what was going on inside of the kingdom instead of the political climate.All of that being said, I will still read the series in hopes that the next books will be better!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2009","Oct 29, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5971165-the-white-queen

Both girls are living a life of privilege and are unaware of the poor and less fortunate.

Cat suffers through terrible emotional, physical, and sexual abuse at the hands of her father and escapes by sketching a comic book version of herself escaping ""The Hand"" of abuse.She begins a relationship with a boy named Addison who loves her unconditionally. Although Addison cannot protect her from the abuse of her father, he makes her feel beautiful and loved. There love is a secret one as her father's abusive reign will not allow anyone else to love his daughter.She escapes town, leaving with a huge secret, and returns as a grown women after learning of her mother's suicide. She is faced with all of the people from her past and her life is falling apart from alcoholism and the year's of brutal abuse she has endured. She is now faced with discovering a cryptic goodbye note from her mother, the demons of her childhood, and all of the people who could not help her out of that abuse.I don't want to give away any of the plot because what makes this book so great is the many twists and turns that I did not expect. If you are a Jodi Picoult fan, I think you will appreciate the unexpected twists and the descriptive use of language that Coyne uses. Her knack for storytelling will immediately suck you in.I felt like I was on a roller coaster ride, but I had to know how it would all turn out.

Since the election season,  this book has seen resurgence in popularity and Atwood even shared about what her book means during the Trump era with the New York Times,  as it rocks the bestseller list once again.This timeless dystopian novel, written all the way back in 1984, explores what the world looks like when women lose power over their own bodies and a religious totalitarian government dictates how and when they can reproduce. Women are given roles and seen as objects limiting them to roles like wives, Marthas, Handmaids, Aunts and Unwomen and everyone’s main focus is on procreation.This book is disturbing in many ways, but I couldn’t put it down. I’m glad I waited to read this because it hit me at just the right time and gave me a lot to chew on, even if I found the ending to be an unsatisfying one.I highlighted almost the entire book because there are so many beautifully written passages. Atwood certainly has a way with words! One line in particular has stuck with me…“We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories.”I couldn't put this one down- be sure to add it to your stack in preparation for a Hulu-binge session!Reading Challenge Category Completed- A Dystopian novel...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Mar 2017,"Feb 20, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale

I actually have no idea why I waited this long to In anticipation of the movie release, I decided to finally dig into Water for Elephants this month. I actually have no idea why I waited this long to read it, but I think I really just wanted to savor this book and read it right before the movie was released so I would be able to remember all of the characters. This book did not disappoint and was one of the best books that I have read this year!The book opens with Jacob Janowski who is ninety (or ninety-three, a fact he can’t remember) and now living in a nursing home. His days are now spent being shuffled from his room to the dining area, suffering from the everyday minutiae of life in a nursing home. Of course, his life wasn’t always like this, in fact, Jacob’s life was spent with a traveling circus after the untimely death of his parents. Circus life was a hard life for Jacob and one that he jumped to unknowingly when he boarded a train to escape after his parent’s death.Gruen’s writing is as vivid as a movie screen as the reader is swept away into the hard and difficult life of being a part of the traveling circus during the Great Depression. When Jacob is appointed to veterinarian, he has a difficult role under August, a paranoid schizophrenic, who acts as the animal trainer of the circus. The reader is swept into the sad life of the animals and the repeated abuse that August inflicts on the animals.The only sparkle of light in Jacob’s life is Marlena, a beautiful performer in the circus, who Jacob cannot stop thinking about. Sadly, it is August’s wife that he has fallen in love with, and the reader will sit on the edge of their seat as Jacob risks it all to free Marlena from the abusive life that she has been leading with August.More than a love story, it is an unbelievably well-researched look into the life of the circus at this time, and a love story of how Jacob & Marlena fall in love with an elephant named Rosie who makes a reader’s heart melt in her beauty. Equally impressive is how Gruen is able to capture the life of the elderly as Jacob reminisces and longs for his youth. The ending is perhaps a little too neatly woven, but is a satisfying conclusion to it all as a reader!Vivid, descriptive, cinematic, raw, chilling… I felt as though I was on a roller coaster just reading this one! Definitely give this one a read before hitting the movie theater! Let’s hope the movie is half as good as this book!Visit Momadvice.com for more great book s!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 30, 2011","Mar 31, 2011","Feb 20, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43641.Water_for_Elephants

He knows everything about her and what she is going to do to him before she even does it. There is just one twist though... she turns herself in and lets him go. Now Archie must live his life wondering why she let him go and replaying the images of those near death days over and over again.Gretchen, the cunningly beautiful and twisted serial killer, is now in prison serving time for the deaths that she has caused and Archie is unsuccessfully trying to rebuild his life. He is addicted to pain medication, distant from his family and friends, and barely resembles the man that he once was.When another killer begins to snatch teenage girls in the city of Portland, Archie has to pull himself together to lead a new task force to investigate these murders and lead them again through the mind of a serial killer.This time though, his every move is being documented by Susan Ward, a newspaper reporter, anxious to share the real and true story of his time with Gretchen Lowell. All of the characters are brought together in a surprising way as they try to capture the killer and bring him to justice.If you are into suspense, mystery, or are looking for a really good thriller, this series kicks off fantastically with Heartsick and makes me excited to continue this series! ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 18, 2010","Feb 20, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/657034.Heartsick
