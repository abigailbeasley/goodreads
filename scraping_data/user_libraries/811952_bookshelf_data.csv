This isn't because I cannot think of plenty to say about it. But the thing is, I don't want either my written or video  to serve as spoiler. This is not a novel with a surprise, twist ending. Rather, it's a story that reveals secrecy in incremental degrees. Little by little we find out what the protagonist knows and does not yet know about her circumstances and destiny. Incidents that do not seem particularly monumental to us are revealed as she reflects on her memories, with their importance not to be understood by the reader until later on. By the time we've figured out what's going on, we are invested in the lives of the central characters. Once invested, it's human nature to root for some version of a happy ending. Our best wishes are the result of our humanity. I suppose that the nature of humanity is what the beautiful novel Never Let Me Go is ultimately about. Above all else, what we tend to never let go of until it's pulled from our grasp is hope.

It features an ambitious narrative that jumps back and forth in time and is told from multiple points of view. It's a decent sized book that is broken up into many short chapters, hopping from character to character, past to present. It's a story about secrets, and I don't want to give too many of them away because I am anti-spoiler, not that I found most of the them to be especially earth shattering. In the present time, estranged siblings are brought together upon the death of their mother. A few years earlier when their father passed away, it failed to result in a reunion because the sister did not show up. Or rather, she chose not to make her presence known. She is less professionally accomplished than her brother, who is a notable oceanographer with an appreciative fan base. He is the sensible one who seems to know what he wants out of life and typically does what's required to accomplish it. His sister on the other hand can't make up her mind about what to study in school, what to do for a living, whether she is straight or lesbian. She does not blow off her mother's funeral like her dad's, and once back in her childhood home she listens to a tape left behind for her and her brother. In the recording that a lawyer plays for them (mild secret revelation, he was also her boo), their mother reveals a lifetime of family secrets. We readers learn along with Byron and Benny that their mother was not quite who they thought she was. Same applies to their father. Also learned (one more secret I'm giving away in this , but trust me, there is no shortage of them) is that they have a half sibling. I enjoyed that the setting of Eleanor Bennett's youth was a Caribbean island since I happen to be from one myself (St. Thomas, USVI). As someone who grew up in a West Indian household, I've had my fair share (though it's been a little while since my last taste) of black cake - aka rum cake. I think that Charmaine Wilkerson did a solid job of managing so many different storylines and characters in a manner that was not confusing. I wanted to love this novel more than I ended up doing. It somehow felt overly drawn out and yet rushed at the same time. Plenty was revealed, and I'm not saying that I predicted much of it, but I simply didn't find many of the revelations to be especially startling. I just kept on reading until getting to the next one. In the end, regardless of all the mystery and secrecy, Black Cake is a story of family - and our obligation to forgive those who comprise it as much as we can since we only get one. Or so we think. Sometimes it's a bit more complicated than that. There is a TV series adaptation of Black Cake on Hulu. Perhaps I will check it out, if only to see how faithful it is to the source material and to watch a program that no doubt will be filled with a bunch of very attractive Black people. Overall I do recommend this novel, even if only for its strong start that sucks you in immediately but significantly loosened in grip on my attention as the story drew to a close. I suggest pairing Black Cake with a dish of jerk chicken or curry goat from the nearest Jamaican spot. They can't all be 5-star reads, but you may appreciate this book more than I did, and there is only one way to find out for sure....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 07, 2024",Feb 2024,"Dec 13, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57926137-black-cake

Danielewski is by far the strangest book I have ever read. It gets a 5 out of 5 stars rating on sheer audacity alone, which isn't to say that it doesn't also earn high marks because the readable parts are beautifully written. Describing a book as having ""readable parts"" infers that other parts are - something different. Experimental is a genre of fiction, and this may be the only experimental novel I've read, yet I still feel confident that it's probably the best one ever written. There are plenty of different ways to feel upon completion of a great literary work. You may want to go back to page 1 and read it all over again. You may go looking for any and everything else that author has written. You may start an online campaign demanding a sequel. Some will go looking for books on similar topics or that touch upon similar themes. Or perhaps you will choose a very different type of book for your next read to prevent it from suffering in comparison to the masterpiece you just devoured. The thought that occurred to me upon reading House of Leaves is that I would love to meet the author and hang out with him for a bit. Anyone who could think up and then execute such a Frankenstein's monster of a book must surely be a fascinating conversationalist - no matter the topic. Either that or else I wouldn't be able to keep up with his stream of consciousness. House of Leaves features a layering of narrative points of view built upon other narrative points of view, and the reader is repeatedly snatched from one to another with no apparent pattern, rhyme or reason. I'll describe it as best I can but I'm not holding myself accountable for making sense. Why should I do that as er when being comprehensible was of so little concern to the author of the book I'm ing? Most authors strive for readability. Their intent is entertain, doing so by making you feel and think and connect with their characters. Maybe even like at least one of them. Then there's this book. Danielewski's goal with House of Leaves almost seems to be daring us to continue. The reader is never comfortable. House of Leaves is I suppose the exact opposite of a cozy mystery. It sure is mysterious, but it's impossible to feel cozy when getting yanked all over the place. For example, numerous times I found myself having to decide whether to continue reading the page I was on or jumping ahead for continuity and then jumping back to follow a different thread. No matter what I did, there was no right or wrong answer. It's my first time ever using a bookmark to remember where to backtrack to. Are you a fan of fiction with footnotes? I thought that I was. The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz is a book that I felt used them beautifully to provide cultural backstory. In House of Leaves, footnotes comprise a whole other book within the one that you're reading. Except the book actually starts out with what later becomes footnotes, so maybe that's the main book and what lays above is the embedded story. Decide for yourself which one is the core story. The text layout is as fascinating as the stories being told in House of Leaves. Depending on where you're at, you may have to go to a corner of the page to find the text. Or turn the book sideways. Or upside down. Or break a code to learn what's being said by using just the first letter of each word. At one point, perhaps my favorite, I had to use my cell phone camera in selfie mode to flip the text around so I could read it. My least favorite section may have been the one with a bunch of letters X'd out, simulating content being lost to fire, so I had to fill out blanks in my mind to recognize what words were written. There are pages that are dense with text and pages that have just a word on two on them. There are numerous passages in French or Latin, some of it translated, some not. Look it up yourself if you want, which would mean leaving the book entirely and then returning. I was not that patient. Many pages I skipped altogether since at a glance I could tell they were not necessary in the building of plots. They were just content that Mark Z. Danielewski took the time to research and present, or else make up and present. I haven't even gotten into giving a storyline synopsis yet, since far more noteworthy than what House of Leaves is about is how it is presented. At one point fairly early on, I noted on Twitter that this book was either going to end up as a Did Not Finish or a 5 star . I saw no way to a middle ground. Wherever/whenever you stop reading (I made it to end of the Appendix which is followed by a lengthy Index), nobody's reaction is going to be ""Meh"". I understand someone absolutely hating this book as much as I understand someone feeling that it is the greatest thing ever written. In between has no place here. Okay, let me try to summarize now. In House of Leaves there is a man named Will Navidson who is married to a woman named Karen and they have two young kids - a son and a daughter. Navidson is a Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist, expert at wielding a still camera as well as a video camera. They own a house in Virginia, and one day Navidson notices something odd about its dimensions. The interior is a smidgen wider than the exterior. Like Alice in Wonderland, it isn't long before he finds himself going down the rabbit hole. But it's a very different sort of rabbit hole than the one Lewis Carroll gifted us with. No quirky characters are found within, no childlike wonder. Navidson enters a dark space that wasn't there before but now there it is. He brings others along on his expedition. What does he find? Darkness. Absence of light but impossible continuation of space. Down hallways, through doorways, and then down a very long spiral staircase that eventually leads to...more of the same. Is it Infinity? Is it Hell? Is there a difference? Navidson makes a film about his multiple explorations within the impossible inner dimensions of the house. A man named Zampano studies the film and everything about what happened and apparently goes insane in the process. Another man reads what Zampano left behind and loses his mind and will to resume regular life as well. We, the readers of House of Leaves, read about what Johnny Truant experiences by reading what Zampano learned by studying up on Navidson. Does that make us go crazy? Yeah, probably a little bit. Perhaps not as crazy as Johnny's mother who went insane and tried to kill him as a child. The letters she wrote to him from a mental institution showing her deteriorating state of mine bring House of Leaves to a close. Why? Why not? Best as I can tell, Danielewski wanted to write a novel about the experience of going insane, and the only way for us authentically understand is by being driven insane ourselves. Was Danielewski successful in his quest? Abso-friggin-lutely. Do I recommend his book to others? Yep, but only those bold in literary taste need apply. There are all kinds of things that trigger warnings are given for to let someone know what they're about to venture into - if they dare. Maybe it's sexual content, maybe violence, maybe incest or pedophilia or some other horror. With House of Leaves, the trigger warning for anyone who finds my  is go in knowing that reading this book can drive you nuts. Now you know, so it's up to you whether you care to take that trip.

It was a summer reading school assignment for my daughter that I decided to read after she was done with it. She's not I was not ready for this book. It was a summer reading school assignment for my daughter that I decided to read after she was done with it. She's not a big reader, so she lucked out because Persepolis is a graphic novel, meaning that it's a quick read. Turns out that she also lucked out in being assigned a terrific book. I am not the target audience for graphic novels since as much as I love illustrations, words are my jam. This does not mean I'm a fast reader, for the opposite is true. I usually choose to take my time and savor a narrative. Certain page turning thrillers that I can't help but race through are the exception rather than the rule. Persepolis is the second graphic novel I have read to date, the first being Incognegro by Mat Johnson. I really enjoyed that one which also goes into rather intense territory, and I was flat out blown away by Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood. The title and subtitle tell you what it's about, but that doesn't mean I was prepared for the upbringing detailed in this memoir. As with graphic novels, I don't read a lot of memoirs either. Each of the ones I've read have been excellent and fascinating. I don't see the point in writing a memoir if you have not led a super interesting life. I've enjoyed my own autobiography to date, but I wouldn't bore readers by putting it down on paper. Instead I will steer them to books such as Running with Scissors by Augusten Burroughs, Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris, and now Persepolis is added to the list. Its author was born and raised in Iran, which is an exceptionally eventful and combustible place to grow up, and to do so as a girl has its own unique set of complications and barriers. Satrapi writes from first person perspective as a child rather than an adult recounting her younger days. That puts the reader in the here and now, which for this story I thought was more effective than us looking back with her on days gone by. It makes the typical reader older and presumably wiser in ways of the world than the protagonist. There is charming naivete to her outlook and interpretation of events, because she is only in her early teens. Yet what she goes through and survives in fourteen years or so is far more than someone who finds their way to this gem of a book in a place far less unstable and volatile than Iran. The narrator reveals impactful events to us in matter of fact fashion, such as one day being a student in a co-ed, non-religious bilingual school - the next day a student in an all girls schools with the wearing of veils now obligatory. No need to embellish drama when so much of it takes place. The contrast between the stylistically simple black and white illustrations and the brutal inhumanity of what is taking place is startling - like a pre-school children's book and a Rated R horror flick merged into one. The amount of devastating events that transpire throughout the course of about 150 pages is staggering. Loved ones are introduced on one page, killed a page or two afterwards. The tragedy just keeps coming. Yet we also can't help smiling in certain places as this stubborn, resilient girl puts together a punk rock look, or goes shopping for music by acts we old enough readers remember from the 1980's, scoring posters of Iron Maiden and Kim Wilde that her parents sneak into the country for her as contraband, or when she takes a forbidden puff of a cigarette in the basement and declares herself to have reached adulthood. Regime changes are detailed at a dizzying pace. No matter who is in charge of things during any given period, repression in one form or another is present, as is danger. Permanence is a foreign concept to this Middle Eastern world. Her immediate family is the only constancy, but how long can it last when the only reliable guarantees are sudden change and arbitrary violence? Since we are reading her book, we know that Marjane Satrapi made it out alive. Writing this book probably helped her to emerge emotionally intact.

This book came to my attention due to the onslaught of attention being given to a movie adaptation coming out in 2023. It is directed by the legendary Martin Scorcese and features Hollywood heavyweights such as Leonard DiCaprio and Robert De Niro to name just a couple of them. So advance notification that the movie is a superb must-see event was unsurprising. Rather than waiting for the film to drop, since the subject matter piqued my interest in a big way, I decided to first read the book by David Grann that it's based on. Killers of the Flower Moon describes a period which came to be known as the 'Reign of Terror' during which countless members of a Native American tribe named Osage came to be murdered. The word ""countless"" is used literally here because so much covering up took place, so little follow up in pursuit of justice occurred, and so much sweeping lives under the rug that were deemed to be inconsequential happened, that it's impossible to know with full certainty how many people were murdered - who the killers in each instance were - and who else was involved to make certain that killings went unresolved. What led to the murder spree was that the Osage were involuntarily relocated to an area of Oklahoma by American Whites who were greedily gobbling up the country until they owned it in its entirety. Turns out that they pushed the Osage on to land with plenty of oil later discovered beneath its soil. So instead of gentrifying the Osage into a ghetto, the Osage were made wealthy. This turn of events being unacceptable to greedy American whites with insufficient moral compass to curb their willingness to kill for money, and because the American government refused to acknowledge the Osage as citizens who deserved the same rights as everyone else, or to at least view them as fellow human beings who deserved to be treated with humanity, a system was set up in which ownership of oil rich land could easily be transferred from Osage to White hands. Only deaths were required to make this happen, and willingness to kill Osage people was not in short supply. Much of the narrative centers on a particular villain responsible for multiple murders - a man named William Hale. He could only get what he wanted with agreement and participation from another White man, Ernest Burkhart, who had married an Osage woman named Mollie. The FBI was a brand new organization at the time looking to establish a foothold towards permanence as an American institution - headed by J. Edgar Hoover. The man with boots to the ground who investigated the string of murders in Osage country was Tom White. White did not fully fit the profile that Hoover was looking for in an FBI agent. However, this particular case did not require a suit and tie office type, but a frontier Cowboy. Securing criminal convictions, even with abundance of evidence on hand, was no easy feat when operating in a justice system built to protect certain privileged people and view others as disposable. But Ernest Burkhart eventually developed enough of a conscience to confess his crimes, and this enabled successful conviction of William Hale was well. I believe this is the portion of the story that the movie adaptation focuses on. That's understandable because it features clear cut lead characters, heroes as well as villains, to focus on. But David Grann's book does not stop there. He continues to investigate and comes to learn that the Reign of Terror took place over a longer span of time than had been thought, and involved considerably more people than William Hale and those in his orbit. There were many more victims, more killers, more enablers, more conspiracy to defraud, more covering up awful deeds so well that justice could never be served and descendants can never receive full closure. Here in 2023 we live in this strange time when censorship and book banning are having a revival due to the efforts of intolerant people on the political right. That's one name for them anyway. Bigots is another. They are against books which focus on marginalized people and point a finger of accusation at those who oppress, which of course is simply continuation of the oppression by method of suppression. If kids don't grow up learning about the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow and homophobia and various other institutionalized forms of intolerance, then the American past is white washed and everything is hunky dory. Or so they seem to believe. To quote one of my favorite memes taken from a TV commercial - ""That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works"". Yet people keep trying and they have made significant headway in the dumbing down of a nation. With this as backdrop, somehow a story like Killers of the Flower Moon manages to find the spotlight. If you are among those who feel that Columbus Day should be eliminated and replaced outright with Indigenous Peoples Day, wait until the exhaustive research of David Grann comes to your attention. If you thought that the worst White Americans did to Native Americans (after all that initial slaughtering) was confining them to tiny sections of this country to still call their own (and perhaps have a casino on), wait until you find out that the slaughter continued on a less grand scale for many more years. First the land is taken, then what lies beneath. Along with the riches generated by the black gold we call oil, what also lies beneath is stated in the book's final paragraph, words spoken by the descendant of a likely victim whose killer was never brought to justice. Mary Jo Webb says: ""This land is saturated with blood."" Then she repeated what God told Cain after he killed Abel. ""The blood cries out from the ground."" I look forward to watching the movie version, even though I suspect that it will tell only a part of the story. Perhaps it will make awful people seem more redeemable than they were. Maybe too much focus will be placed on bad people who perpetrated horrors at the expense at honoring the innocent who were steamrolled. But even if imperfectly told to conform to Hollywood's parameters, what's more important is that greater exposure of hidden atrocities will result. Some people, like myself, will dig deeper than just watching a star studded movie and read the book. Others will dig deeper still, find additional books and research, learn more and more about the evil that men did and continue to do in the process of building this extremely flawed, hypocrisy rich nation. You know what they say about those who do not learn / ignore / reject the truth of history. They doom us all. There's nothing exclusively American History about taking lives to claim land, of course. Just turn on the news to see what's going on in Ukraine or Israel and thereabouts. As a reading experience, I found myself a little less absorbed in the narrative of Killers of the Flower Moon despite its high body count and other fascinating elements than I have been with other true crime books. That is because Grann keeps a certain distance from the proceedings. He makes minimal effort to mimic the qualities of an engrossing novel, probably because of the broadness of scope. The fewer people and locations involved, the more intimately a story can be told. Dozens of principle players means less of a microscopic lens on anyone in particular. So I was somewhat less invested than was the case when I've read books such as Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, or Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City. But that doesn't prevent me from giving Killers of the Flower Moon an enthusiastic recommendation....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 20, 2023","Oct 20, 2023","Sep 29, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/29496076-killers-of-the-flower-moon

At the time I did not realize that Harlem Shuffle was not intended to be a standalone title, but part 1 in a series of 3. It had a beginning - middle - end story arc that resulted in a satisfying reading experience given to us from a master at the top of his craft. I have read several Colson Whitehead books. The ones I've enjoyed least are compelling and wonderfully written, and the ones I enjoyed most are among my favorite novels. The man has a gift, and if you haven't read his work and choose not to take my word for it, then perhaps the two Pulitzer Prizes he's won will convince you. In general I am a reader of standalone novels rather than books in a series, with exceptions made to this rule as inspiration strikes. I read multiple Harry Potter titles, for example, although that was largely for my daughter's sake, as they were read aloud to her. I read each of the three books in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, or Millennium series, or whatever you want to call those books by Stieg Larsson, because I was compelled to follow the story all the way through to its end.. Currently I am two thirds of the way through Whitehead's Harlem trilogy, not realizing that I had embarked on a series reading adventure until the second book came out. I enjoyed installment #2- Crook Manifesto. However, I would not say I am quite as fond of it as I was of the novel it is a sequel to. I won't be surprised if I end up loving the third book in the series, whenever it comes out and whatever title it gets, most of all. It will have the advantage of being able to provide a grand finale. Or perhaps Harlem Shuffle, which read to me like a story told in full, will retain its spot as my favorite. The middle title in a 3-book series bears the responsibility of being the bridge between the well drawn set up and the dramatic conclusion. A middle title is informed (and to a degree restrained) both by what came before it and what is planned to come after. If you are reader like me who appreciates when a story he has spent weeks reading feels completed as the final page is reached, then something will inevitably feel a little off about a story that wraps up with a ""to be continued"" vibe. That said, Crook Manifesto draws us deeper into the world of a man named Ray Carney who is half upstanding, business owning citizen of Harlem, USA in the not especially distant past - and half steeped in the criminal element. When we first meet him in Harlem Shuffle, he is working industriously at maintaining balance between the two opposing aspects of his existence. The straight life has a stronger pull on him because it is reputable and safer, the latter being crucial as he is a family man with a wife and children to consider. But crooked life pays a whole lot better and the more Ray makes from illegal activity like fencing stolen jewels, the more he can afford to invest in his furniture store business and other straight ventures. At the start of Crook Manifesto, Ray believes that he has left the criminal lifestyle inherited from his father behind. The crooked and straight are no longer an even split vying for his divided attention. He is a full blown pillar of the community. This phase comes to a rough end when he needs a favor, to acquire a pair of tickets to a Jackson 5 concert. There is no honest way that he knows of to come by tickets to the sold out event that his daughter is desperate to attend. Ray's intent is to merely dip a toe back into the crooked world, but that world tends to grab hold of whatever little bit is put in and absorbs a person fully. The only way back out is doing whatever illicit activity needs to be accomplished until the newest batch of acquired enemies have been either satisfied or vanquished. Along the way we see that some bad guys masquerade as cops, others as politicians and businessmen. Only the most honest among them pretend to be nothing other than themselves. Rather than staying with Ray for the entire narrative, Crook Manifesto timeshares between Ray and Pepper. The latter is fully invested in criminal life, thoroughly dedicated to resolving matters through violent means when often necessary, a guy who is useful to have on your side and deadly to be up against. Think of Easy Rawlins' sidekick Mouse in Walter Mosley books like Devil in a Blue Dress as a comp. I enjoyed the portions of Crook Manifesto that focused on Pepper's exploits while leaving Ray behind for a while, but it made the story feel a little disjointed. A book that's about Ray becomes one that's about Pepper until it decides to be about Ray again. Nevertheless, a somewhat disjointed bridge book in a series still makes for a better read than a great many other novels - if such a tale happens to be written by someone as talented as Colson Whitehead. I look forward to the third installment in this series, and to my next book which for sure will be a standalone title, and to whatever Colson Whitehead gifts us with once he's done telling his 3-volume Harlem tale....more",Notes are private!,1,7,1,"Aug 15, 2023","Aug 15, 2023","Jul 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61812836-crook-manifesto

By that I mean that once upon a time, that time being the 1Timeline is a novel about time travel, and for me it was a time travel reading experience. By that I mean that once upon a time, that time being the 1980's and 90's, Michael Crichton was one of my go-to authors. As I reflect back on my earliest adult novel reading days, I recognize that I tended to be drawn to big shot Best Seller authors. Throughout high school and then college where I majored in English at NYU, the books I read for scholastic purposes were classics from the literary canon. Mostly dead white men. For my leisure reading, I gravitated to household name hotshots of the publishing industry. These authors presumably made out quite well for themselves since we're talking about an era prior to cable television, incredibly realistic video games, and the internet. A period when books were pretty high up on the entertainment hierarchy, and prolific authors of the most popular ones were selling a great many copies. E-books hadn't been invented yet, audiobooks to my knowledge were not super popular yet, so print was king and reading ink on paper was a leisure activity with far less competition than is currently the case. As with the classics from English classes though, I still tended to end up reading novels by white men. But they were still alive and cranking out new titles seemingly as quick as I could read them. In my regular rotation were the books of Sidney Sheldon (who was a favorite author of both my mother and myself), Robin Cook, Stephen King, Joseph Wambaugh, Harold Robbins and Michael Crichton - all writers of popular fiction. I took a pass on Danielle Steele and Jackie Collins, thinking that their books would not contain enough testosterone for my taste. As I grew older I started pulling away from blockbusters comprising the majority of my reads and gravitated more towards literary fiction. This isn't to say that I read only literary fiction these days, or only non-genre books. Life is too short to confine one's self to a single section of the bookstore or library, so I read a little bit of many types of literature. Some books will be literary fiction, some will fall neatly into a genre, some will end up atop Best Seller lists, some will be books that failed to make their authors rich and famous. Of course these days if your name isn't JK Rowling or James Patterson or a small handful of other extremely privileged authors, chances are that you aren't splitting time between multiple mansions, but merely living a comfortable existence when not putting yourself through the hell of the writing process. Reading has not quite become a lost art, but when the phone in your hand is capable of providing such a wide variety of amusements, the book has its work cut out for it to grab short attention spans. Of the authors I used to return to book after book back in the day, Stephen King is one I have read relatively recently. Another author from back then who stood the test of time is John Irving. But the others remained in my rear view mirror. The Michael Crichton books that I enjoyed when wearing a younger man's clothes were Jurassic Park, Congo, and Rising Son. And there were more Crichton stories that I skipped reading and went straight to the movie. Timeline is one of his books that unsurprisingly was made into a film. The man had the Midas touch when it came to addictive storytelling. Unfortunately, I cannot say that I particularly enjoyed Timeline. It's about a small group of historians who end up being able to study the past in an unexpected way when they are sent back into it. I won't bother trying to describe the pseudoscience that a fictional tech company has secretly developed, except to say that it involves the multiverse in a way much less weird than Everything, Everywhere, All at Once - plus the once miraculous seeming and now rather quaint activity of yesteryear called faxing. The characters in Timeline are too unmemorable to bother naming or describing. Suffice it to say that they go back to the 1300's to bring back a member of their team who preceded them and didn't return. Once they're zapped to the distant past, the rest of the narrative is basically a drawn out action sequence. For page after page the protagonists are either being chased or else involved in a sword fight before going back to running for their lives. Meanwhile in the present, the time travel technology is damaged in an accident. Technicians race to fix it in time to bring the historians, if they survive their adventure, back to the modern world. I was not on the edge of my seat. In large part this was because I didn't really care about any of the characters. As for the guy in charge of the technology company, of course he's a greedy jerk who is far less interested in who happens to live or die than in eventually monetizing the miracle machine. Bringing the past (specifically ferocious dinosaurs who roamed the earth) into the present intrigued me more as a premise in Jurassic Park than did bringing people from the present into the past as takes place in Timeline. In large part that is because dinosaurs are really cool so a book that provides them is way cooler than one which does not. But another part of the equation is that I am not the same reader that I used to be. Had I read Timeline around the same time as I read other Crichton books along with blockbuster page turners in the 80's and 90's by authors like Sheldon and Cook, would I have enjoyed it considerably more than the 2023 version of myself? Maybe. Or maybe I should stick with my current go-to author of blockbusters, Dan Brown. Some writing ages better than others. I picked Timeline up at a bookstore that I visited while on vacation on Long Beach Island. Upon seeing Crichton's name on the cover, a wave of nostalgia urged me to take a trip back in time. Timeline didn't do it for me, but your own reading experience may differ. If I ever watch the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if it's one of the infrequent occasions where I prefer the film to the novel since it is such a visual story. The book does feature a scattering of drawings throughout to help readers visualize the setting, for what it's worth. If time travel is one of your favorite tropes, Timeline may be a book for you. But if you want my time travel story recommendation, I would suggest reading Octavia Butler's Kindred or rewatching Back to the Future instead. The former finally made it to the screen recently and the latter is now on Broadway.

The Nightingale is an exceptional, hefty novel about German occupation of France during the war that centers on the heroism of French women. Two in particular, sisters Isabelle and Vianne. Isabelle is the more bad ass of the two, not content to sit at home and wait to be saved when she can go out and do some saving of her own. Not feeling particularly doted upon by her father (who never recovered from the previous war that he fought in, or the loss of his wife, so he drinks heavily in place of being a parent), Isabelle feels free of entanglement and lives as if she has nothing to lose. Vianne has a young daughter in her care, so she is not able to be as reckless as her sister. Isabelle joins of group of rebels that help the cause of defeating Germany any way they can, such as escorting to safety various pilots who survive their planes being brought down by the German military. Vianne's husband leaves to fight in the war and is captured. This leaves her and their daughter Sophie on their own, until a German soldier moves in to their home because as conquerors they can do whatever they want and French citizens must bear it the best they can. The soldier is a fairly decent man, all things considered. But when he is on the verge of finding the pilot that Isabelle has brought to temporarily hide on the property, Isabelle shoots him while Vianne goes upside his head with a shovel. His death, which of course they must hide, leads to a new German soldier being billeted in Vianne's home. This one is far less decent. The Nightingale is a big book and A LOT of stuff takes place. Its narrative goes back and forth between Isabelle's exploits that earn her the code name the Nightingale (including falling in love with a fellow rebel) and Vianne's struggle to survive Nazi occupation of her town and home, and risking her safety by bringing Jewish children to shelter. Then there is a third thread that is visited less frequently. In it the narrative jumps forward to 1995. An elderly woman who recently moved into an assisted living complex has been diagnosed with a return of cancer. She has been invited to an event in France. We understand that this woman must be one of the sisters, but we don't know which one. This is a secret for us to find out in the book's final pages. She tries to take the trip secretly but her son is on to her, while also knowing little to nothing about her heroic past. In France for the first time, he finally learns when people who are indebted to the sisters pay homage to them, about the extraordinary feats of his mother and aunt during the war. He finds out that as much as he thought he knew his mother, she is largely unknown to him. Now he will begin to learn much of the history, though probably not all on account of a major reason that I won't spoil, of two incredible women who fought tooth and nail to preserve their own lives while also saving those of many others. Thanks to the moving prose of Kristin Hannah, we readers are led to think of the hell that is war in ways that may not have occurred to us before - starting with realization that the MEN at the front were not the only brave souls who fought and killed and died for a righteous cause. Not by a long shot. I highly recommend this novel. The writing is not quite on the level of All the Light We Cannot See, another novel about German occupation of France during World War II. But be that as it may, Kristin Hannah definitely proves herself talented enough to provide a gripping tale that readers will not easily forget....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 13, 2023","Dec 13, 2023","May 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21853621-the-nightingale

It accomplishes this feat in two for the price of one style, telling dual stories that are set a century apart. Shreve seamlessly guides the narrative back and forth. I marveled at the skill of the transitions. I have read a number of novels that tell parallel stories set in different time periods that are related to each other in some critical way. Commonly the portions are separated by chapters or sections. But Shreve virtually tells two stories simultaneously - a pretty neat trick. From one sentence to the next we go from the inner thoughts of Jean in 1995 to those of Maren in the 1800's. Jean is a photographer who is visiting Smuttynose Island, off the coast of Maine, to research murders that took place there well before she was born. Accompanying Jean are her husband and young daughter, plus her husband's brother and his girlfriend. The group is staying on a boat owned by her husband's brother, putting them in close proximity to the scene of the old crime where two women were killed in gruesome fashion and a man was given the death penalty after being convicted of the murders. Along with taking photographs of the area, Jean finds and steals documents from a local library relevant to the story she is researching. They are letters written by a woman who survived the night of the murders, and a translation of her recollections from Norwegian to English. As we read through the pages of The Weight of Water we learn about Jean, the backstory that led her to meet and marry a poet named Thomas, a marriage that we can see from the start is a troubled one precariously held together by their daughter. We also learn through the stolen pages that Jean is reading about Maren, her life in Norway marked by the early death of her mother, and her sudden decision to agree to marry the man who brings her to America in hopes of finding more bountiful waters to fish in. A crowded home in a new country comes to house not only she and her husband, but also her sister and their brother and his newlywed wife and the border who is eventually convicted for the brutal murders of Maren's sister and sister-in-law. I will refrain from delving further into the two plotlines in order to avoid straying into spoiler territory. Instead I will remark upon Shreve's incisive prose that brings us into two worlds set in the same desolate place. Heaviness lies in the hearts of both Jean and Maren for different sets of reasons. One is consumed by guilt and the other by suspicion. Both face problematic desires. Both women manage to survive while others around them do not. This is not to say though that they are especially alike, or their circumstances particularly similar. Yet Anita Shreve deftly intertwines their story arcs so that one begins where the other ends and the pattern keeps repeating, washing over us like the ebb and flow of the ocean over a rocky beach. After reading this book I discovered that the double murder portion of the story which is set in the 1800's is based on a true crime. Shreve comes up with a motive for her novel. This has been done before and will be done again by writers of fiction that re-imagines reality. The weight of masterful prose causes written words to sink into our skin and remain with us long after the reading is done with....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 23, 2023","May 23, 2023","Apr 02, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/228534.The_Weight_of_Water

Gabriel Garcia Marquez sits at the top of the pyramid I've been constructing throughout the course of my reading life as the most gifted of wordsmiths. I consider Love in the Time of Cholera to be the most magnificently written novel of all time. The fact that it is a rather polarizing book, because what one reader translates as the purest form of romantic love another reader can understandably interpret as a treatise on the art of stalking, only adds to its charm for me. Whenever some literary canon maker puts out a list of the greatest novels ever written, it is common for Gabriel Garcia Marquez to be seated at the very top. The book awarded this position most often is not Love in the Time of Cholera, but rather, One Hundred Years of Solitude. I was blown away by that Marquez masterpiece as well, but Cholera remains my personal favorite. He is not only the king of long and winding epic novels such as those two, but also a master of brevity who has gifted us with succinct gems such as Chronicle of a Death Foretold and Memories of My Melancholy Whores. The titles of his stories alone are like little poems. Not long ago my wife gifted me with a copy of The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor, which is a work of non-fiction. The vast majority of my reading attention is dedicated to fiction, but I do take detours into the world of memoirs and biographies and other forms of non-fiction from time to time, and diving into the prose of Gabriel Garcia Marquez is the very best reason for such a detour. Before Marquez became a celebrated novelist, he was a journalist who wrote for a newspaper in Colombia. It was during this time, before he had reached the age of thirty, when this true story fell into his lap. The title tells us much of what needs to be known. To flesh out the synopsis, in 1955 a military destroyer ship named the Caladas that had an 8-member crew was washed over by overpowering waves while taking what was supposed to be a routine trip from Alabama back to Colombia. Seven of the crew members drowned, one was able to get to a raft. This book is the story of the lone survivor. For the next ten days after going overboard, without food or water, accompanied only by birds and sharks that paid him periodic visits, the sailor fought to stay alive and maintain sanity while hoping to be rescued. During this time he was presumed dead along with the others and a funeral was held for him. Much to everyone's surprise, ten days after the Caladas was capsized, Luis Alejandro Velasco turned up on a deserted beach in northern Colombia. He was beaten and battered and sun baked and starving - and still very much alive. Marquez wrote Velasco's story as a series of articles that appeared in his newspaper over fourteen consecutive days, four days longer than the amount spent by Velasco alone at sea. Publication of the articles turned out to be problematic because the official government explanation for the Caladas going down was a storm, when in fact there was no storm, and the reason seven men lost their lives was because the Navy ship was overloaded with contraband. Years later when Marquez had become a celebrated author, the articles were assembled into a single little book. The story that unfolds over about a hundred pages is fascinating for three reasons. One - Marquez is a tremendously gifted writer. Two - He made the brilliant decision to write the articles which eventually became a book in first person point of view narration from the perspective of Velasco. The original 14 articles were actually credited to Velasco, with the role of Marquez not fully acknowledged until 15 years later. Three - Fighting against the elements and the natural erosion of one's body as time elapses without sufficient nutrition and shelter naturally makes for compelling storytelling. A man alone on a raft for ten days, assumed dead and seemingly on his way to making the assumption come true, fighting for survival with all of the wits and strength both physical and mental at his disposal, is page turner material no matter who is telling the story. Put such a story in the hands Gabriel Garcia Marquez and what you get is this literary marvel. I ended up with a copy of it because my wife visited a nearby Barnes & Noble that was going out of business, so there were deep discounts on the books they still had on hand. B&N, like bookstores in general, has been enduring a drawn out battle for survival much like the shipwrecked sailor. And like the sailor, against all odds, they appear at least for now to have made their way to a foothold on dry land. It seems (fingers crossed while knocking on wood) that B&N along with many independent bookstores will continue on after being considered dead. Whether it's the emergence of e-books or ending up alone in the middle of the ocean with nothing but the clothes on your back and shoes on your feet and the watch on your wrist, whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Books and humans both have tremendous will to survive no matter how bleak the landscape is. I continue to root for both of us.

Jean Hanff Korelitz wrote a You see a book with a title like 'The Plot' and of course the first question that springs to mind is ""what is its plot?"". Jean Hanff Korelitz wrote a greased lightning page turner about the writing process, one that most readers will relish and fellow writers will devour. It's about an author turned writing professor turned freelance editor for hire because after his debut novel is a success by many of the metrics that writers aspire to achieve, it fails to lead to a lucrative writing career. Subsequent efforts by Jake are considerably less lauded than book #1. While working at his second career as a writing professor at a small college named Ripley, which like Jake is also on a downward slope, he has a student one semester named Evan Parker who will come to change his life. While the failing trajectory of the school is irreversible, Jake has a reversal of fortune in store for him. That is because Evan reveals the plot of the book he's writing to his professor. The cocky student claims to be working on a surefire hit, guaranteed to become a Best Seller, land him on Oprah's couch, get a movie adaptation with an A-list Hollywood director, etc. etc. It doesn't even need to be written by anyone particularly talented at writing. The ingenuity of the plot alone will guarantee its golden fate. After being coaxed to not only produce sample pages of what he has written so far but also to reveal the plot of his work in progress, Jake must admit to himself, though not to his smug student who excels at being unlikable, that the story does indeed sound like a can't miss literary phenomenon. Several years pass, Jake has moved on to the freelance editing stage with reasonable doubt that an ongoing career as a traditionally published author is behind him, when he learns that his former student died not very long after taking his class. The legacy left behind by Evan is that of a Tavern owner rather than an enormously successful author. The book that was supposed to be a bonafide hit has not been published, perhaps was not even written beyond the small portion of the first draft that Jake critiqued years earlier. What is Jake to do with this information and his particular skill set? Just what you might expect. He writes the book himself, which is not to say he plagiarizes it since other than his memory of the sample chapter and a verbal plot synopsis, he has nothing to work from but his own talent. That plus a plot with such a clever twist that all the glory to come from multiple print runs and weeks spent perched atop Best Seller lists is a certainty. It doesn't even need to be particularly well written, but since Jake happens to be an excellent writer once he has the right plot at his disposal, Crib is every bit the success story that it was promised to be. As his rejuvenated writing career reaches the stratosphere, lucky breaks continue to come his way when he meets a beautiful woman destined to quickly become his girlfriend and then his wife. It is all too good to be true, and sure enough, the balloon is popped when Jake receives the first of what will be many menacing notes. The anonymous sender knows that Jake is not the one who came up with the plot of the book that readers can't get enough of. Jake has been found out, though not by Evan who is no longer living, so presumably by someone who knew Evan. Someone who does not appreciate that Evan's story was stolen by Jake. Someone who for unknown reasons wants Jake to confess or else...or else Jake's life will be made hell in incremental degrees unless he figures out who is tormenting him...and how to go about stopping it. After all, he is not a bad guy. He did what any writer would have done. He wrote a book that basically demanded to be written, and there was nothing that Evan could do about it any more, but there was something that Jake could do. Why deprive the world of a fantastic story when you are capable of bringing it to light? It's not stealing if nobody misses what has been taken. No great plot comes without great cost in the world according to Jean Hanff Korelitz's highly enjoyable novel. My only complaint, if that is the right word and I'm not entirely sure about that, is that I was able to correctly guess the ending. Along with being a fine novel about writers and writing, at its core The Plot is a mystery. For me, the best mysteries are those where the author leaves enough clues that it is possible for an attentive reader to solve it, yet they are unable to because of the subterfuge and misdirection surrounding those clues. If I fail to glean whodunnit (and sometimes also how and why they dunnit) because the author does not provide sufficient clues, making it impossible to figure out until all is revealed at the end, such a book is disqualified from being considered one of the best mysteries I've read even if overall I enjoyed it. When I AM able to figure out what's going on such as was the case with The Plot, I'm pleased with my skills of detection but slightly disappointed that the author failed to ""get me"". Or course, a great many novels are mysteries even if they don't technically fall into the genre. If unlike me you favor formulaic books where you know in advance how things will work out because that is what the formula dictates, that's another story. But non-formulaic books, whether they be a thriller or literary fiction or science fiction or fantasy or horror or whatever the case may be, are all mysteries at heart in that we readers go in knowing just an outline of the story (assuming that we read the cover copy or an online synopsis), and we need to experience the full book in order for all of its truths to be revealed. Readers like myself pick a novel up because we want to be enlightened and surprised by it. I greatly enjoyed The Plot and did find it to be enlightening, but the twist in the plot of The Plot failed to catch me off guard. Nevertheless I do highly recommend it, especially for those who like books about books, about writers, about that highly exasperating art form known as writing, and then beyond it to the experience of being published to acclaim, or published but nobody cares and very few read it. Another fine novel that contains a fictional story written by an author within the fictional story that we are reading is Tony and Susan by Austin Wright. You can find my  of it here at goodreads. I still have not gotten around to watching the movie adaptation of it that is called Nocturnal Animals. I couldn't help being reminded of Tony and Susan while reading The Plot, comparing and contrasting them. Consider them both to be highly recommended by me. One crucial difference between them that I'll note is that while the story within the story of Tony and Susan is edge of your seat material, the storyline outside of the manuscript that a character has written is relatively low stakes and low key. In The Plot, both the inner plot and the outer plot quicken the pulse and have you rushing to get to get to the next chapter of either one....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 05, 2023","Jun 05, 2023","Feb 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55315487-the-plot

There are books that I meander through, taking my time to fall under the spell, Before the Fall by Noah Hawley is a well constructed, absorbing read. There are books that I meander through, taking my time to fall under the spell, willing to take breaks of a day or two if busy with other life chores before getting back to reading. And then there are books like this one that I plow through, chomping at the bit to get back to it during the non-reading portion of my day. This has more to do with the nature of the story than the quality of writing. If a book is a thriller with a mystery to be resolved, natural curiosity is a compelling force. This can backfire on a book though, because the more anxious I am to see how an author has resolved a riddle, the more disappointed I may be in the end if I find it to be underwhelming. Conversely, if a book is more about the journey than the destination then I'm less likely to be a dissatisfied by non-explosive final pages. Authors have a Catch-22 on their hands in that the more cats they murder with generated curiosity, the greater the potential for let-down is if the ending fails to deliver on a riveting build up. If you peruse the backlist of videos on this channel you'll find some examples of books that I raced through only to be left wanting at their conclusions. That's a ME thing. Other readers, most especially those who frequently dive into series rather than stand-alone titles, appreciate being left hanging by endings that are not entirely resolved because that means they get to continue on with the literary adventure in subsequent books. I tend to gravitate towards novels that wrap things up within the covers of a single volume, and when there is a puzzle to piece together, I'm picky about what I find to be satisfying resolution. In the case of Before The Fall, I have no complaints. That may be because even though it is a very suspenseful novel with a mystery at its core, the story is less about Who Did What and the Reasons Why then it is a meditation on blind twists of fate that defy any explanation beyond ""shit happens arbitrarily"". But don't let my use of the word ""meditation"" lead you to believe that Before the Fall is long on philosophical introspection and short on action. It isn't. It's a masterful blend of both by an author who also toils as a storyteller for television and movies, so he knows well that it's critical for a story to be compelling enough to keep the audience in their seats. The mystery of Before the Fall is laid out in its opening pages. A private jet containing two wealthy couples taking a short trip from Martha's Vineyard to New York crashes into the ocean sixteen minutes into the flight. One of the men runs a conservative news network - a fictional Fox News. The other is a high level financial investor who it turns out is laundering money for foreign countries that are on America's naughty list. So long as he is making plenty of profit for others as well as himself, he could care less if his efforts happen to aid terrorists. As result, he learns shortly before embarking on the flight that his company is under investigation and the empire he has built may soon come tumbling down. Since he works for dangerous people, there is reason to suspect that the plane crash may have been caused by someone with an axe to grind against Ben Kipling. Or maybe the target of ire was David Bateman on account of the political spin of his television network. Or maybe it was mechanical error rather than sinister activity, though initial reports indicate that the plane was functioning properly before its sudden plunge. The crash takes the lives of both couples, the pilots and crew members, and the young daughter of David and Maggie Bateman. There are two improbable survivors. One is a painter named Scott Burroughs who is not rich and powerful like the other passengers. He is an affable fellow who does okay with the ladies and is determined to focus more on his art career and less on drinking his potential away. He scored an invite by befriending Maggie who he often runs into at the farmer's market. Is there more to their relationship than meets the eye? If so, can that possibly have something to do with the cause of the plane crash? Along with being a talented artist who happens to specialize in paintings of disaster scenes (tornadoes, train derailments, and even a plane crash), Scott is also an exceptional swimmer. This is how he manages, after not being killed immediately on impact, to swim several miles of ocean to safety. He does so not on his own but tugging the only other survivor, the Bateman's 4-year old son, forging a lifelong connection between rescuer and rescued. The narrative jumps back and forth between events before the crash and after, and the point of view switches among various characters to flesh out critical back stories. Among these other characters is one of the men investigating the crash, and also Bill Cunningham, the main news anchor at the Bateman's TV network who is determined to find a scapegoat (Scott being his primary candidate) and get the big scoop by any unethical means necessary. Then there's Maggie's sister who finds herself with an orphaned nephew to raise and a very large inheritance to manage until the boy comes of age, plus with the man that she is unhappily married to. Ultimately the narrative centers on Scott as he tries to adapt to a life turned upside down, one day a nobody, the next day a paparazzi hounded hero, and the next - the lead suspect of a horrific crime if a crime is what it is. We readers know that Scott is an imperfect but innocent man. What we don't know is what or who it is that caused the plane crash. Over the novel's pages we learn bit by bit what took place before and led up to the tragic fall from the sky. Very well done by Noah Hawley.

After reading his latest I believe there are only two or three titles in his backlist that I havenI have read nearly all of Colson Whitehead's books. After reading his latest I believe there are only two or three titles in his backlist that I haven't gotten to. One thing that you know you'll get from his work is excellent, addictive writing. Whether it's a work of literary fiction, a book so full of personal details that it reads like a memoir, an actual memoir, a novel based on true life events, speculative in nature, or an unexpected dip into the genre of zombie lit (Zone One happens to be one of his books that I haven't read yet), you know you're getting quality prose from Mr. Whitehead. If you were a stranger to his work and Harlem Shuffle was the first book of his that you picked up, a glance at the cover copy where the most notable literary awards that have been given to him are listed would inform you that you're about to read something by a critic's darling. Harlem Shuffle did not disappoint. It was much more casual in tone than the last two Whitehead novels I read - his back to back Pulitzer Prize winners 'The Underground Railroad' and 'The Nickel Boys'. I suspect that another author will win the Pulitzer for Fiction next go around, but that's by no means a knock on Harlem Shuffle's merits. This novel follows the exploits of a man named Ray Carney throughout the 1960's. Ray is a Black man, he lives in Harlem of course (which is obvious because of the book's title, not because of the main character's race) and he is the son of a criminal. Ray steps away from his deceased father's legacy by becoming a legitimate businessman, owning a furniture store. He also spends time in his father's shadow due to illegal side business that comes into his shop from time to time. If someone brings a stolen item to Ray, he has the connections to find a buyer for it. Ray's ambitions mostly lie on the legitimate side of his dual existence. He wants to enlarge the size of his store. He wants to sell upscale merchandise from the ""Whites Only"" domain, even if many of his customers would need to purchase it on layaway. Ray wants to move to a more upscale neighborhood like Riverside Drive, and perhaps someday down the line, to the legendary Striver's Row of Harlem, NY. Ray Carney is a striver personified, never mind that his wife's parents look down on him because they come from older money while Ray is just one generation removed from hood life. Ray was able to get started on the straight and narrow after surprisingly finding money gained from his father's illegal activities in the truck inherited from his dad. But it doesn't matter how you got started so much as what you do once you get there. Among Ray's goals is entry into an exclusive club for Harlem's Black elite called The Dumas Club. His father-in-law belongs to it, which perhaps makes up for the fact that his flesh and blood father was a criminal who only would have gotten into The Dumas Club if he was robbing it. Ray's initial application to the club is rejected, never mind that the bribe money he paid to improve his chances was accepted. Being a striver, there's always another opportunity somewhere down the line, even if you have to get down and dirty to create that opportunity. The only thing that endangers Ray Carney's relentless forward progress is his cousin Freddie. They were raised like brothers, but since Freddie didn't luck into finding a bundle of cash like Ray did, Freddie makes no attempts at being an upstanding citizen who honestly earns a hard day's pay. He is always on the look-out for the next score along with his next drug high. And since he knows that his cousin has useful contacts when it comes to moving stolen goods, whenever he shows up it's usually to get Ray involved in criminal activity. Since Ray feels obligated to help out his cousin, and because he is his father's son as much as he is his own very different sort of man, Ray allows himself to be drawn in despite the jeopardy that it puts his conventional, above board lifestyle into. Even if inclined to walk away from an illicit opportunity, once dangerous individuals assume that you're involved based on your history, there isn't much difference between actively seeking out trouble and trouble looking for you. Ray Carney is basically a good man who keeps hustling out in the open as well as on the down low, striving to make his grass is always greener dreams come true, moving along with the changing times amid the Harlem shuffle. I highly recommend this novel. I have no idea what Colson Whitehead's next book will be about because like Ray Carney he keeps it moving, always searching for uncharted territory to explore. Some people have favorite writers because those authors consistently deliver a similar brand of literary treat over and over. Perhaps they stick to a particular genre, or if they stray a bit, they repeatedly examine particular tropes and write about the same types of people consistently. This is neither an attribute or a flaw. It just is. Colson Whitehead is one of MY favorite authors for the opposite reason. I never know what he's going to come up with next, but chances are that it won't feel like an echo of his previous books. It will be its own thing, and the common thread between the works of Colson Whitehead, from my least to my most favorite, is the excellence....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 31, 2022","Mar 31, 2022","Feb 20, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54626223-harlem-shuffle

If you don't already know, in 1919 Sylvia BeThe Paris Bookseller by Kerri Maher is a work of historical fiction centered on the life of Sylvia Beach. If you don't already know, in 1919 Sylvia Beach founded the original Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, France. The bookshop of this name that some of you may have visited in more recent years opened in 1951 and repurposed the name of Beach's iconic store as tribute in 1964. If like myself you are endlessly fascinated with the artists of The Lost Generation then you'll want to add Kerri Maher's lovingly researched novel to your book pile. To quote Wikipedia rather than trying to put it into my own words - The Lost Generation was the social generational cohort that was in early adulthood during World War I. ""Lost"" in this context refers to the ""disoriented, wandering, directionless"" spirit of many of the war's survivors in the early postwar period. The term is also particularly used to refer to a group of American expatriate writers living in Paris during the 1920s. Gertrude Stein is credited with coining the term, and it was subsequently popularized by Ernest Hemingway who used it in the epigraph for his 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises: ""You are all a lost generation"". Well said Wikipedia. Among the notable figures of this period who populate the pages of The Paris Bookseller along with Hemingway and his alternating romantic partners are Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Dos Passos, Sherwood Anderson, Ford Madox Ford and most prominently - James Joyce. Along with the ""Lost Generation"" writers, let me not leave off painters name dropped in The Paris Bookseller who came to prominence during this period such as Matisse and Picasso. Authors like Henry Miller, William Faulkner and Virginia Woolf are also mentioned in passing, even if they didn't happen to be among the American expatriates who felt stifled by the conservative attitudes of America and so came to Paris where for a time they could live their best lives and produce their best art and spend plenty of time hanging out at the hippest bookstore on the planet. Contrast Prohibition taking place in America with drinking wine or perhaps even a sip of absinthe in France. Another prominent figure of this time and in this novel and in the life of Sylvia Beach is her longtime romantic partner, Adrienne Monnier. Before there was a Shakespeare and Company, Adrienne was a trailblazing businesswoman who opened the bookshop and lending library, ""La Maison des Amis des Livres"". Shakespeare and Company would eventually move across the street, with Adrienne's shop providing books written in French while Sylvia's shop serviced those in search of English-language books. As with Adrienne's shop, Shakespeare and Company served as a lending library along with having books for sale. If you seek works about notable women who enhanced the cause of feminism, The Paris Bookseller will scratch that itch. The same can be said if you are interested in stories about notable lesbians. Paris in the 1920's was more liberal than America when it came to living and let live in this regard as well. With talk of the US Supreme Court taking away the reproductive rights of American women here in 2022, once again American conservatism rears its head. With war being waged on Ukraine by Russia, one wonders if this conflict will spill to other lands and how many casualties and tortured aftermaths will result. Will we soon have a new Lost Generation in search of a new nirvana to escape to? History does love to repeat itself. Adrienne and Sylvia (plus Gertrude Stein) are women well worth knowing more about, and you may care to check out my  of Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald by Therese Anne Fowler. Zelda is only mentioned in passing in The Paris Bookseller which focuses primarily on the life of Sylvia Beach. That life was dominated by the presence of Adrienne Monnier and perhaps even more so by one of the writers I mentioned earlier - James Joyce. While a woman opening an English-language bookshop in Paris was a pretty big deal in 1919, the event that put Shakespeare and Company on the literary map for all time was Sylvia Beach's decision to publish James Joyce's controversial novel, Ulysses in 1922. Considered obscene by those who couldn't look past its strong language to appreciate the novelty and beauty of its prose, Ulysses needed someone brave and resourceful enough to bring it to the light of day. By publishing the one and only book under the bookstore's imprint, the course of literary history was altered. We readers have a comfortable window seat view of the coolest place to be during one of the most artistically influential periods in history courtesy of Kerri Maher's steady handed prose. There isn't much in the way of tension until the latter section of The Paris Bookseller when multiple editions of Ulysses have been published and it looks as if America will finally be open to embracing it. For the book to become available worldwide it needs a major publisher behind it such as Random House, run at the time by Bennet Cerf. James Joyce is anxious for this to happen whereas Sylvia Beach is loathe to relinquish control of the work that she dedicated so much time and effort to birthing when nobody else was willing to touch it with a ten foot pole. The warmth of their personal relationship is greatly tested as Joyce intensifies his badgering over the fate of a book that means the world to both of them. As the author, Ulysses is James Joyce's baby. As the publisher, Ulysses is Sylvia Beach's baby. Something and someone has to give. I know I'm not the only one with a weakness for stories about writers and the writing process. The publishing process is a related endeavor of course, one that at times can resemble a battlefield. If these are areas of interest to you, The Paris Bookseller will be right up your alley. If you could care less about this sort of stuff, perhaps preferring steamy romances or out of this world science fiction or edge of your seat thrillers or terrifying tales of horror featuring paranormal beings or inhuman humans, then you may find The Paris Bookseller to be insufficiently eventful and I wouldn't steer you towards it. But if you're like the character played by Owen Wilson in Woody Allen's cinematic gem Midnight in Paris, looking to escape into days of yesteryear where the person in the cafe seat to your right is destined for immortality, as is the person to your immediate left, then I encourage you to dive into the world of Kerri Maher's The Paris Bookseller. Now that I'm done with it, I'm itching to read Hemingway's A Moveable Feast for a real time non-fictionalized take on Paris in the 20's. Or perhaps a reread of my favorite Hemingway novel ""The Sun Also Rises"" is in order.

This particular one, Slam, is as Nick Hornby-esque as the rest of them. By that I mean that it's easy to read, Another Nick Hornby book polished off. This particular one, Slam, is as Nick Hornby-esque as the rest of them. By that I mean that it's easy to read, likeable characters are contained within, observations about the human condition are made in wry fashion, I smiled throughout the turn of pages at his flair for comedic touches, and then it was done and I found myself thinking that while it was all pleasant enough, I didn't like it quite as much as the film adaptations of High Fidelity or About a Boy. I did like Slam more than other Hornby novels I've read such as A Long Way Down and How to be Good. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Juliet, Naked. Slam ends up somewhere in the middle of my personal list of Hornby reads. It is about a high school boy who gets his girlfriend pregnant, and she plans to have and keep the baby. This of course has significant impact on both of their lives as well as the family members that they live with. The story is told from Sam's point of view rather than Alicia's, so once again we have a Nick Hornby tale that's ""about a boy"". Instead of having a suicidal mother such as was the protagonist's situation in that story, Sam has to deal with fatherhood way way earlier than planned. Instead of meeting a nice bloke pretending to be his father who buys him a pair of trainers and joins him onstage to share the spotlight of humiliation, Sam has a poster of the skateboard maestro Tony Hawk. Serving basically as a Bible for Sam is the book that Tony Hawk wrote about his life. It holds all the wisdom that Sam finds himself needing no matter how dire circumstances appear to be, or so Sam believes. The only other thing I find worth noting about the rather straightforward plot of Slam is that Sam finds himself transported a few months to a couple years into the future every now and again. This gives him foresight that may elude you and I, since he has a general idea how things are going to work out for him even though his lucid dreams do omit a few details that won't get cleared up until his future actually arrives. Hornby always writes with expert charm and we readers root for things to work out for his protagonists as they navigate whatever it is that Hornby gives them to deal with. Along the way love is lost and found or the other way around, insights are reached which add to depth of maturity, and then we reach the final page and go about our way. There is a relatively low number of authors that I have read three or more novels by. Perhaps one day I'll compile that list to see how many there are. What these authors have in common is that they have something to say about the world and a way of saying it that appeals to me. Either that or I just find them plain entertaining even if not particularly profound. Hornby is halfway in one camp and halfway in the other. So don't be surprised if you eventually stumble upon a  of yet another Nick Hornby novel that I decide to check out.

Turns out the answer is at least a dozen, for that is what Nigel Tetley gives us in his delightful children's book - Finger Rhymes. Just as the title promises, this book is a collection of poetry on the theme of fingers. Each one is as sweet as the smile a child will give in response to them. Several compare the shape fingers can make to seemingly unrelated objects. Like magic a young child will realize in Playground Fingers that one finger can become a seesaw, two a slide, three a a teepee, four become rope swings, and five are a roundabout spun around on to great delight. In Green Fingers little gardeners discover that one finger is a slug, two a pair of shears, three a garden fork, four grooves in the soil, and five petals of a flower. Other poems bring children by the hand and imagination to the beach, helping out parents in the kitchen or with tailoring, a day at the beach, and a fireworks display. Each one shows the reader and the read-to that there are countless ways to look at the world, and at ourselves. Starting with the five fingers that we have on each hand. The clever poems are accompanied by wonderful illustrations done by Peter David Scott - realistically rendered with a retro feel to them. From my own ill-fated attempt at writing a rhyming board book years ago, I know that maintaining a steady cadence when composing sound-alike sentences is trickier than one might think. Nigel Tetley nails each poem with a snap of his talented fingers. If you're in search of a gift for a child still being read to or perhaps just starting out with reading for themselves, I highly recommend Finger Rhymes....more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,"Jun 13, 2021not set","Jun 13, 2021not set","Jun 12, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56857304-finger-rhymes

I'm talking way back when books were not mass produced, certainly not on-demand on a digital press, but instead lovingly created with the finest of materials that were built to last. The main character of The Club Dumas, a man named Corso, is a rare book finder for hire. If you're a rich collector looking for a 1st edition copy of a book printed and bound centuries ago - Corso is your guy to track it down and obtain it by any means you're willing to pay for. There is a dual track of investigation going on in The Club Dumas. One has to do with locating the three known copies of a book entitled The Nine Doors. Allegedly this book can be used by someone who can figure out how to properly read it to summon Satan and be granted whatever is desired - at the cost of your soul for eternal damnation, of course. But in the process of tracking down these books, Corso keeps encountering people who appear to have been lifted right off the pages of The Three Musketeers. Clues suggest that Dumas perhaps sold his soul in exchange for the literary acclaim and riches and life of debauchery that he enjoyed prior to eventually dying penniless, but with his name living on forever due to publications such as Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. I have yet to read the former and just recently read Monte Cristo for the first time. Dumas is an interesting figure in literature, made even more interesting (to me anyway) upon learning that he was of mixed race. Typically if you're reading a book from the 1800's, published serially or otherwise, for a class or perhaps for pleasure, you're reading the work of a White author. Alexandre Dumas is an exception who had cream in his coffee - or vice versa. I digress as I love to do. The atmosphere of Arturo Perez-Reverte's novel is shrouded in literary fog from the opening pages (in which we learn that a book collector has been found hung to death: perhaps suicide, perhaps something more sinister) to the closing pages. In between we follow Corso around as he tracks down the three copies of The Nine Doors, doing his best to avoid and survive interruptions from curious characters who seem to have something to do with his quest. Among them are two women - one who fits the type that Alfred Hitchock loved to cast in his movies, the other improbably too young to be so improbably wise and so improbably proficient while being remarkably detached from the proceedings and ridiculously sexy. The latter woman is named after a character from the world of Sherlock Holmes, so she's borrowed from the fictional world of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (which is one of my favorite places) rather than that of Alexandre Dumas. Pretty much every sentence describing either woman lustfully describes how sexy they both are. If that sort of thing annoys you, consider yourself warned. If a storyline that touches upon devil worship and sword wielding musketeers and Sherlock Holmes and the business of producing books without modern technology (or forging them in modern times with ingenuity and patience) - if you're a fan of books about books - then perhaps you'll forgive the women described largely as sex objects stuff. They do serve critical roles in the plot rather than simply being sexual conquests. But the repetition (we get it - she's hot!) and stilted nature of some of the dialogue made me give a 3-star rating instead of 4. This is yet another book that I would rate 3.5 if goodsreads provided a half-star option. Overall I really enjoyed The Club Dumas. I won't go into spoiler territory but will simply say that I found the ending to be both cleverly satisfying and a little less than what I hoped was being built up to. Apparently the movie The Ninth Gate starring Johnny Depp is loosely based on this novel. I'm not entirely certain but I think I've seen that movie and yet I didn't realize while reading The Club Dumas that it had anything to do with the movie. So either I haven't actually seen the movie yet or else the adaptation is so loose that there wasn't strong enough of a connection to make me realize I was reading a book that inspired a movie that I'd already seen. I now need to watch the movie, either for the first time or else again. But you came here for a book , not a film critique. Overall I was fully sucked into the universe of The Club Dumas. Give me a literary, historical mystery with otherworldly elements such as The Club Dumas and you'll hook me every time. I'm already looking forward to the next one, whatever it will be.

I have a thing that I'm neither proud nor ashamed of for serial killer narratives. This interest primarily covers the category of true crime, whether it's a non-fiction book or a documentary or a screen version featuring actors playing the parts of killer and victims and cops determined to break the case. I am astounded by the levels of evil that mankind is capable of. Some of us close our eyes at the carnage while others can't look away. I'm in the second group. When skilled fiction writers decide to create a serial killer inspired by the real-life monsters who dwell among us, consider me intrigued. The fact that The Jigsaw Man, along with having a very cool title also happens to be written by a Black woman, raised my curiosity level another notch. If there are many other serial killer novels written by Black women authors, I've somehow missed the memo. Having recently watched the Netflix series Dahmer and the movie The Good Nurse (the latter being about Charles Cullen), I was primed to read this Nadine Matheson novel. It seems that The Jigsaw Man is meant to be the first in a series of books featuring Inspector Anjelica Henley. I favor standalone books over titles from a series as a general rule, in part because I don't want to feel that I need to read multiple books to get the whole story. But my number one reading rule is that I have no rules. If something about a story is intriguing to me, I'm willing to give it a shot. Ultimately, unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by The Jigsaw Man. This despite the fact that it features not one but two dueling serial killers, one a copycat of the other who is behind bars for his crimes. That is until he manages to escape in order to track down the killer who has greatly annoyed him rather than flattering him with imitation. And he also wants to mess with Anjelica Henley some more after nearly killing her when she stopped his original murder spree. Angelica bears physical scars from the knife that Peter Olivier plunged into her stomach, and psychological scars from the ordeal. They combined to temporarily push her out of the police force, and upon her return to a special unit that specializes in tracking down the most heinous killers, she is immediately on the trail of an unknown killer who is leaving body parts from dismembered victims in multiple locations throughout town. Rather than finding one corpse at a time, law enforcement finds a leg here, an arm there, the head over there. It's grizzly stuff for sure. But to be truly captivating, a book needs to do more than roll out a series of horiffic murders. It needs to make me care about some of the characters, or at least one of them at minimum. It needs to not only make readers curious about whodunnit and how they dunnit and why they dunnit, but to immerse you in a world that feels real. I have read a few crime novels that disappointed me with their ending, yet I still considered them to be excellent reads because the journey from premise to conclusion was well laid out. With The Jigsaw Man, I frequently found turns of events to be implausible. Why is this killer being treated like royalty by prison guards? How can security around such a notorious criminal be so lax? Don't expect me to buy 'budget cuts' as the explanation. How is this guy able to overwhelm everyone he encounters? Does nobody else know how to fight or use a weapon to defend themselves - not even trained police officers? As for the psychology behind character motivation, I found it less than compelling. Serial killers may kill for no better reasons than evil and envy and ego, but Inspector Henley will be the recurring character over however many of these books get published, so she is the character who should feel layered with complexities and contradictions and nuanced with traits which make us empathize and sympathize with her. Perhaps she will grow on me if I give her several books in the series to win me over. I won't rule that out. But it's also possible that this will be the only Nadine Matheson book I'll ever read. Some authors get just one shot to win me over. I see from s online that plenty others liked The Jigsaw Man considerably more than I did. I won't tell you to steer clear of it. Every book isn't for every reader.

Or perhaps I should say, a riveting read within an excellent read. The unique premise provides a thriller ploTony and Susan made for a riveting read. Or perhaps I should say, a riveting read within an excellent read. The unique premise provides a thriller plot tucked inside a less pulse pounding work of literary fiction. The story that WE the readers are imbibing courtesy of author Austin Wright is about a woman named Susan who is married to a doctor who is out of town on business for the weekend. Their kids are home with her but serve exclusively as minor background noise. Since they're teens rather than toddlers, their needs don't need to be attended to by Susan. Since her husband does not make an appearance until the book's final pages, she doesn't need to attend to his his needs either. So it's just us and Susan. We learn that her 25-year old marriage to Arthur is her second one. Previously, and rather briefly, she was married to Edward. During the period of Susan's first marriage, Edward yearned to be a writer and is mostly trying to figure out how to go about that while also managing to be a breadwinner and reasonably tolerable person to be around. These things do not naturally go hand in hand. They put a strain on the marriage that ultimately leads Susan to have an affair with their neighbor Arthur. The cheating begins while Edward is out of town trying to write, something he hasn't mastered doing at home even though distractions there are minimal. Arthur is also married but his wife has gone off the deep end, about to be permanently committed to a mental institution. When the cats are away the mice have extramarital sex, or however it is that saying goes. Susan confesses to Edward, promises not to do it again, Edward sullenly accepts it while his insecurity reasonably grows to enormous proportions, and Susan eventually returns to screwing around with Arthur who doesn't have to bother hiding things from a wife gone mad. Edward eventually has enough of this arrangement and grants Susan a divorce. She moves on to lasting marriage number two with Arthur, and Edward also marries again with better luck the second go around. I should also mention that Susan and Edward grew up together, not only in the same neighborhood but in the same house because Susan's parents took him in after Edward is left parent-less. They have a strictly platonic relationship for years, basically siblings, then hook up as young adults and transition to a romantic one that is fated to fail. This information is all contained in the book that we are reading about Susan's life. But Susan has different reading material that we are also privy to, reading over her shoulder in essence. One day, a few months prior to the weekend when Arthur is out of town, hopefully not continuing to have sex with the mistress that he promised not to screw around with any more, Susan receives a package in the mail. It's the manuscript of a novel - the one that Edward has finally gotten around to writing. He wants to get his ex-wife's opinion on it for he has always valued her opinion if not her ability to remain faithful. In the letter that accompanies the manuscript, he writes that he'll be in town a few months down the road. Perhaps they can get together then, share a drink or meal, discuss his novel. Susan procrastinates and does not begin reading it until 3 days before Edward said he would be in town. Over those days, in a relatively quiet house with her husband out of town, Susan will read the manuscript so she'll have something to say about it when Edward presses for her opinion. So we the reader end up reading two books at once - the one about Susan entitled Tony and Susan - and the one written by Edward entitled Nocturnal Animals. The latter is the thriller I referenced earlier. It is a heart pounding page turner that's near impossible to put down. The only reason we ever do is when Austin Wright chooses to have Susan put it down to return us briefly to her world. Tony and Susan goes back and forth between itself and the novel it contains, with the latter being the one that truly has us hooked. All along I found myself wondering - why didn't Austin Wright simply write the novel that his character Edward wrote since that's the one we can't get enough of. What will be the dastardly connection finally made between the inner story and the outer story? Is Edward's manuscript perhaps an elaborate clue about something he has planned for Susan - some ridiculously long awaited payback for her infidelity? No way to know until we and Susan get through Edward's book and they then have their reunion - or so it seems. Nocturnal Animals (which is both the name of Edward's novel and the name of the film adaptation that I promised myself not to watch until reading Tony and Susan first) is about a middle aged man named Tony with a wife and young adult daughter. While driving to their summer house in Maine they end up getting into a confrontation with guys in two other cars driving on the same road in the hours between midnight and morning. They kidnap the man's wife and daughter, and the next day he learns that they raped and murdered his family. Will justice be served? If not justice from the legal system, will the math professor (perhaps a coincidental job allocation since Susan also teaches for a living - perhaps not) who finds himself suddenly without a wife and daughter (neither of whom is named Susan - the Susan that eventually shows up in Edward's novel is a minor, inconsequential character) settle for vengeance with the help of a twisted cop who worked on the case? Like Susan, we are fully absorbed in Nocturnal Animals. Unlike her, we aren't burdened with contemplating what Edward might be saying about us through his novel. I won't spoil the ending of either Tony and Susan or of Nocturnal Animals. I won't even hint at whether either story's ending floored or underwhelmed me - or perhaps lay somewhere in the middle. Judge for yourself if and when you choose to read Tony and Susan, which I do recommend doing. I'll conclude this  by stating that Austin Wright was a gifted writer who basically gave us two wonderful novels for the price of one - two books that aren't even the same genre. I enjoyed both stories contained within Tony and Susan. It's a book I won't easily forget -- AND a book I won't easily forget. This novel will especially resonate with anyone who has ever written a novel and worked up the nerve to ask a loved one to read it - OR - anyone who has ever been the loved one asked to read that book. What will be the right things to say about it? What will most definitely be the wrong things? Cross your fingers and hope it will be good enough for the necessity to lie to be kept minimal....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 17, 2021","Sep 17, 2021","Mar 17, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2177370.Tony_and_Susan

Well no, technically it's a novel. Blonde is a thoroughly researched, masterfully written work of fiction aboIs Blonde a biography of Marilyn Monroe? Well no, technically it's a novel. Blonde is a thoroughly researched, masterfully written work of fiction about a lot of things that really happened to a person that everybody knows plenty about. Being one of the most famous people of all time, there is no shortage of material written about her extraordinary life. Her meteoric rise to Hollywood stardom (not just in her own time but for all time), as well as her tragic early death makes for irresistible subject matter. Along with that there is her riveting romantic life featuring high profile marriages to Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Miller plus a dalliance towards the end of her days with President Kennedy. Google ""books about Marilyn Monroe"" and a mile long list comes up featuring heavy hitter authors like Norman Mailer and Gloria Steinem. There's also MY STORY, written about Marilyn by Marilyn Monroe herself and Ben Hecht. Let us not forget the lovely song by Elton John that aptly describes her as a candle in the wind. Joyce Carol Oates perhaps takes the deepest creative dive into the world of Marilyn Monroe. The opening pages of Blonde take place when Norma Jean is a baby, and the book closes with dramatization of her final breaths. Since Oates chose to approach Marilyn's life through the lens of fiction writing, the blanks that lack firsthand witnesses to verify what was said and done and felt can be filled in. Mostly written from first person point of view, a window into Marilyn's thoughts and hopes and dreams is opened by Oates. What we readers see is a woman who led a glamorous existence, had many lovers even if not nearly enough love, and was on a lifelong search for the father she never knew and a quest to feel worthy of her mother's love. And while the world saw her as a blonde bombshell worthy of adoration for the gifts of her beauty and sex appeal, Marilyn saw herself as an artist desiring to expand her intellect and master her craft. On screen we see her being funny and vulnerable and dangerously unhinged and coy and innocent and naive and nurturing. Even those who have never seen one of her movies have superficial knowledge about the details of her brief time on earth. Surely you've seen the image of her skirt being blown up by air from a subway grating. You know that her name is synonymous with blonde haired, blue eyed variety of sex appeal. But perhaps you did not know that much of her childhood was spent in an orphanage because her mother was too mentally unstable to raise her. Perhaps you know of her marriages to one of the most famous baseball players ever along with one of America's greatest playwrights. But like me you may not have known about her first marriage that she entered as a teen after living in a foster home. The degree to which she was exploited by Hollywood power brokers who took advantage of her desire to be a movie star is heartbreaking revelation. Her unfulfilled desire to have and raise children meant that a happily ever after fairy tale ending kept eluding her, and so being the most desired woman in the world would be her consolation prize. Seeking validation from others is a guaranteed path to misery. Loving yourself for who you are does not come easily to everyone. What we all want is happiness, and the shape of particular sets of ambitions will cause people to chase after this or that or the other. Life teaches us all eventually that you can fail to achieve your goals but nonetheless be happy, and you can accomplish everything you dream of and still be a tortured soul. If Marilyn Monroe managed to secure more personal contentment, perhaps she would have acquired less fame and fanfare. Perhaps not. She had it all, including an abundance of insecurity and loneliness. When the spotlight was on, she dazzled viewers. When it was off, the character of Marilyn Monroe was put away and the reality of being Norman Jean was her burden to bear. This book was made into a miniseries back in 2001 and will soon be a movie on Netflix. The latter was given a NC-17 rating so parents of little ones will need to put them to bed before watching. I haven't seen the miniseries but my expectations for the movie are high based on the quality of the source material. Joyce Carol Oates recently said some stuff on Twitter that rubbed me the wrong way, but that won't stop me from praising her talents as a writer. I am not much of a grudge holder, and even if I was, I believe in separating the artist from the art. Blonde is an excellent work of prose. From reading it I feel like I personally knew Marilyn Monroe, which means I feel like I'm one of the many who failed her. That's what excellent historical fiction does, puts readers in that place, in that moment, in those shoes. Now that I'm done with Blonde, I find that what I wish to express has already been stated eloquently by someone else. ""Goodbye, Norma Jeane; Though I never knew you at all; You had the grace to hold yourself;While those around you crawled."" I recommend Blonde to fans of BIG books. Even if you're an exceptionally fast reader, this isn't a novel that you're likely to polish off in a couple days. I also recommend it to people interested in the golden era of Hollywood. In 2022 anybody can snag a degree of fame by having a popular TikTok channel or something like that, but back in Marilyn Monroe's day fame was reserved for the elite few. The diversity of this group lacked range for sure, but back then there was a clear dividing line between regular folk and mesmerizing STARS. Among them, none were bigger, even with the brevity of her career and lifetime, than Marilyn Monroe....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Aug 2022,Aug 2022,"Mar 01, 2021",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15975.Blonde

Erik Larson's award winning Bestseller did not disappoint. I am mI'd been curious to read this book for quite some time and finally got around to it. Erik Larson's award winning Bestseller did not disappoint. I am mostly a reader of novels written for the adult market, dominated by works of so-called literary fiction with periodic forays into a variety of genres. But every so often a work of non-fiction will pique my interest. Perhaps a biography of some well known figure, maybe a memoir that has received rave s, or in the case of The Devil in the White City, a book that is not so much an exhaustive examination of a particular individual's life, but rather, a well researched narrative of a particular time period and setting and sequence of events. The time period is the late 1800's, an era known as the Gilded Age due to rapid economic growth, especially in the Northern and Western United States. The place is Chicago, Illinois (though we do venture to other US cities and up into Canada near the book's end). And there are two parallel tracks of events. The first is the conceptualization, construction and realization of the 1893 World's Fair: Columbian Exposition that was held in Chicago. In being chosen to be the site of the Fair, the Windy City was rebounding from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The men charged with manufacturing a place of wondrous fantasy were John Welborn Root, Daniel Bunham, Frederick Law Olmstead and Charles B. Atwood. Bunham is basically the main true life character of the World Fair sections of the book, since the buck stops with him when it came to coordinating the many moving parts and pieces that eventually result in The White City. This nickname for the fair was due to the fact that its nearly 200 new buildings of predominantly neoclassical architecture that were intended to be temporary constructions, including the 14 most notable ones, were painted white. I wouldn't categorize myself as a big fan of detailed technical writing about architecture and landscape design. But Larson does a fine job of getting readers to feel the tension as conceptual artists at the top of the chain, hard working men doing the grunt work at the bottom, and everyone in between races to get the world fair ready in time for its planned opening day. Various well known figures from history are name dropped for their contributions to a variety a groundbreaking features and attractions. The brilliant minds behind the Chicago World Fair are in competitive mode as they strive to outdo the previous World Fair that was held in Paris and featured the Eifel Tower as main attraction. Decisions are made promptly on layout of the Chicago version since time is of the essence to have it ready in time for celebration of Christopher Columbus' ""discovery"" of the new world. But many bids to be the highlight of the Chicago World Fair are rejected for being either unrealistic, insufficiently impressive, or a copycat. Finally winning out is construction not of a bigger, better tower, but an enormous wheel that people can take rides on - the very first Ferris Wheel. Other things making their debut at the Chicago's World Fair were the first performance of the Pledge of Allegiance, Cream of Wheat, Shredded Wheat, Quaker Oats, the brownie, Juicy Fruit gum, Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, a device that made plates for printing books in Braille, a moving walkway, spray paint (which allowed them to paint a bunch of buildings in a hurry), and the first fully electrical kitchen (including an automatic dishwasher). Among those who gave performances at the fair were Harry Houdini and 'Buffalo Bill' Cody. An entire book can and I'm certain has been devoted to the Chicago World Fair, but Erik Larson only gives it 50% of the billing in The Devil in the White City. ""The Devil"" referred to in the book's title is the serial killer Herman Webster Mudgett, better known as Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H.H. Holmes. Many of his horrific deeds were done in the shadow of the World's Fair where he owned a hotel. Eventually he was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging for one murder, with no less than 9 deaths confirmed as attributed to him. Holmes confessed to 27 murders and is suspected to have killed as many as 200 people, mostly individuals who came to their bitter ends in the confines of Holmes' so called Murder Castle. Later it was reportedly planned to be turned into a perverse museum of murder, but the building was gutted by a fire that perhaps was arson before this twisted dream could be realized. Some of the people that Holmes' confessed to killing ended up still being alive, so the extent of his murder spree will probably never be known with certainty. Among his various talents and inclinations were bragging and lying for attention, especially once he had nothing left to lose. Not among his victims were the three women that he charmed and was simultaneously married to. Without going into graphic detail, we are shown that Holmes lived up to nicknames given to him such as Dr. Death, The Arch Fiend, and The Torture Doctor. Charles Dickens famously wrote ""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times"". Larson shows us that the late 1800's in America was a time of great promise and technological progress and also a time of unimaginable horror taking place practically in plain sight. The Devil in the White City alternates between the story of the Fair that put the world on notice of remarkable feats that America was capable of when our brightest and best put their collective minds to it, and the story of a monster in human form who killed at will for his own perverse entertainment, as well as to keep from getting caught. The story of H.H. Holmes no doubt can and has been the focus of a book dedicated exclusively to his evil exploits. After all, he has the distinction of being known as America's First Serial Killer. I watched a short documentary about him after reading The Devil in the White City. Erik Larson interestingly chose to merge two stories into one compelling narrative. I confess to being more absorbed by the creepy serial killer stuff than by the World Fair planning and execution portion. But going back and forth between the tale of American ingenuity and the tale of an American made psycho killer results in a fascinating reading experience. Larson gives us a work of detailed non-fiction that reads like a novel. In the end notes he writes that he chose to recreate just two of Holmes' murders, and in deciding how best to go about it he spent a good deal of time rereading Truman Capote's In Cold Blood for insights. That is certainly a brilliantly written place to go for inspiration. I almost forgot to mention that H.H. Holmes, who by the way was a contemporary of Jack the Ripper but possibly far more prodigious, is not the only murderer to be found in the pages of Larson's book. A mentally disturbed man named Patrick Eugene Prendergast murders the beloved mayor of Chicago, Carter Harrison - turning the closing ceremony of the Chicago World Fair into a funeral procession. Clarence Darrow defended him but was unable to save Prendergast from the gallows. Unlike Predergast who was captured immediately after his crime, Holmes was able to continue murdering for a long stretch of time. He took advantage of the fact that so many people were visiting Chicago for the World Fair, many of them unaccompanied. A fair number of these tourists never returned home because of an unfortunate choice of hotel to stay at. If it was not for his compulsion to swindle people and avoid paying off various financial debts, Holmes probably could have gone on killing people indefinitely. The reason why he is initially arrested and put in jail is because detectives track him down to account for money he has conned people out of. While he sits in prison, law enforcement realizes that it's no mere conman that they have captured, but a remorseless, relentless serial killer. I'm glad that I finally got around to reading The Devil in the White City. I plan to seek out more books, non-fiction as well as novels, that take place during the fascinating Gilded Age....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 29, 2021","Mar 29, 2021","Mar 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/397483.The_Devil_in_the_White_City

It's a story of gentrification made even more sinister than it is in real life most of the time. The back cover copy describes it as ""Rear Window meets Get Out"" which is certainly an intriguing tag line. Those happen to be two of my favorite movies. The Rear Window part has to do with characters checking each other out from the window of an across the street apartment. This is done most often by Theo who is the main male character. His counterpart is Sydney Green, a Black woman who the White Theo is drawn to. The fact that his live-in girlfriend is horrible and soon to become his ex-girlfriend who intends to evict him is certainly enough to make Theo check out other romantic options. The setting is a neighborhood in contemporary Brooklyn, NY that is too quickly undergoing changes that most of the residents aren't crazy about. The Gifford Place community has been predominantly African American since well before Sydney grew up there, but of late a lot of the Black folks have been moving away (several under mysterious, unsettling circumstances), and in their place has been the arrival of affluent White people such as Theo's one foot out the door girlfriend - a stereotypically uptight and bitchy woman named Kim. Technically Theo is the one with one foot out the door, but Kim's the one doing the pushing. Sydney first encounters Theo and Kim on a walking tour of the neighborhood. She vocally disapproves of what the tour is highlighting and what it is leaving out, the latter being contributions over the years by the majority Black population of the neighborhood. Sydney decides to create a tour of her own to counter it. And unemployed Theo with plenty of time on hand volunteers to be her assistant, never mind the hostility she does not refrain from expressing about gentrifying White people such as Theo. The man is not without charm though, and Sydney is conveniently single just as Theo is in the process of becoming, so a potential love connection is one of the book's features. It is written in alternating first person point of view perspective - so we get a chapter from Sydney's viewpoint followed by one from Theo's and then back to Sydney and so on and so forth. As the story progresses, peculiar circumstances pile up on each other and suspicions rise from mild to full blown conspiracy territory. Why are so many of their neighbors here one day - gone the next? What could cause the bodega visited just the other day to be replaced with no notice by a store that's far less typical of what the neighborhood has been for decades, but perhaps will not be for much longer? Why isn't Syndey's best friend answering her texts? What does the company that's building a hospital in the neighborhood have to do with the various strange things that are taking place? In the book's final chapters a great deal of action occurs, major revelations are made, allegiances and loyalty is tested, and we take a deep dive into the Get Out-esque aspects of the plot. Cole writes in an easy to digest manner that has you reading speedily along to find out how things are going to work out. It's all a bit too over the top to be considered realistic or literary leaning. Instead, When No One is Watching is a solid mystery/thriller with a couple of likable lead characters that are pleasant to spend time with. Judging from the list of previously published Alyssa Cole titles that are promoted on the final page, she spends a lot of time in the Romance genre. I tend to steer clear of full blown Romance novels, but not of books where romance is an aspect of the story. My taste is my taste. If you're into Romance novels my guess is that you'll like Cole's other books because she is a fine writer. And if your preference in reading material leans towards books with social commentary to make and perhaps a disappearance or two to solve along the way, I recommend that you check out When No One is Watching. I'll be watching out for future Alyssa Cole books, though probably not the ones that feature a man and woman looking longingly at one another on the front cover. I can think of no higher compliment to give an author than that I'm watching out and looking forward to what they come up with next....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 18, 2022","Feb 18, 2022","Feb 23, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49398072-when-no-one-is-watching

The style of prose goes down easily for readers who prefer accessible writing that rarely sends them to a dictionary or thesaurus to confirm what a word means. The plot follows a young Black man who is not living up to the potential that his scholastic accomplishments suggest is possible for him. Darren not only attended prestigious Bronx High School of Science but graduated valedictorian. Yet rather than moving on to higher education at an elite college, he works at a Starbucks on the ground floor of an office building. He is generally satisfied with his life despite his mother's insistence that he is cut out for far more. This is understandable since Darren and his mother live in a spacious home (along with a tenant downstairs) that his mother owns, he is the manager at Starbucks and fond of the staff, he hangs out with his best friend from early childhood on a regular basis, and he has a beautiful, supportive, soul mate girlfriend. So even though Darren can be considered to be an underachiever professionally, it's understandable why he is content with what he has without yearning for much more. But one day for no particular reason he decides to talk a customer into trying a different drink than his usual selection. The man is impressed with Darren's sales pitch, and he happens to be a sales manager at a start up company in the building. Rhett recruits Darren to become one of his sales people. Initial reluctance is eventually overcome and Darren decides to give it a shot. He and two other recruits go through what seems more like a fraternity hazing period than job training, and Darren (who is the only African American) is given the hardest time by a manager named Clyde. Each of the recruits are given nicknames, and from this point on Darren is known to most as Buck. Without going into too much detail and steering clear of spoiler territory, I'll sum up the rest of the plot in broad strokes. Buck becomes alienated from the people in his former life. His best friend Jason switches on a dime to becoming his enemy, he and Soraya break up, and his mother dies. It turns out that she had cancer and was keeping it secret from Darren, but not from their tenant who is like a surrogate grandfather (Darren's father passed away when he was a child). Darren/Buck is so furious that he was kept in the dark about his mother's condition that he throws the elderly man out of his home even though he has no other family to go to. Buck throws himself full bore into his new world. Being a great salesman at a company that is relentlessly thriving is all that matters. His work colleagues become his new family. Then comes the next narrative shift where Buck ends up becoming a mentor to other African Americans who want to better their situations by become super salespeople. It starts out with just one person, then two, and before you know it, along with his regular job he is running a worldwide but also top secret organization that cranks out success stories. The definition of success being getting hired to be a well paid salesperson in spite of not being White. Is A LOT of the plot of Black Buck over the top? Yes. Are complex social issues boiled down to utter simplicity? You betcha. Did my eyes roll over when plot machinations seemed rather implausible, such as a childhood friend becoming an enemy overnight simply because of a change in jobs? Most definitely. If you consider Black Buck to be in the category of parody/satire then you take much of it in with a large grain of salt. But is that what it is? I went to its Amazon page where there is a Q&A with the author. Askaripour is asked - ""Did you set out to write it as a satire?"". He replies: ""The straight up answer is no. In fact, before people started telling me it was satirical, I treated it as an earnest piece of work. I’ve discovered that it’s both earnest and satirical—and I’ve had to learn how to hold both truths"". In my opinion, if you read Black Buck strictly as an earnest piece of work then it is only moderately successful. If you decide that the author isn't really taking this plot fully serious (despite the fact that he confessed he was taking it quite seriously) but instead utilizing it to make pointed observations about society, you may hold this book in higher regard. Either way, it's a breezy read with nifty plot twists at the end that you may or may not see coming. I don't consider Black Buck to be strong, masterful writing - but it does make for easy enough reading. It has an initial lightness of tone with social commentary thrown in that grows darker but not overly intense as the story moves along. The characters serve their roles in moving the plot along more than becoming fully fleshed out people on the page. It's certainly a unique story that doesn't remind me much of anything I've read in the past, and originality (like readability) is easier said than done. I didn't love Black Buck but did find plenty in it to like a great deal, and so I do recommend it. As always, happy reading!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 30, 2021","Jun 30, 2021","Jan 29, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53091994-black-buck

This book has been oA classic that perhaps invented the genre of Revenge books, if that's a genre, and I suppose that it must be considered to be so. This book has been on my bucket list for ages. I now get to check it off the list. I was motivated to finally read it after watching the first season of the series Lupin. My library did not have the original Arsène Lupin source book on hand, so instead I borrowed the legendary novel - The Count of Monte Cristo. It has been a minute since I last read a book written 100+ years ago deploying a flowery type of language that nobody writes or speaks in any more. Back in my school days I used to read such books on a regular basis, and so I was used to it. But over the past couple decades I have primarily read books with a more contemporary feel. Even if the settings of some of the books I've read take place quite a ways back, they were not written during the time period that events take place, and so the prose was more accessible than a book published in 1844. After watching Bridgerton and Lupin back to back I was ready to immerse myself in the distant past, and in a story that we all know something about even if we've never read it or even previously seen a screen adaptation. There are approximately 1000 character names to keep track of in this book (perhaps a slight exaggeration), though only about 500 characters since everybody seems to go by at least two different names from early chapters to later ones. This includes the title character who starts out as Edmond Dantès before going through hell and coming out on the other side with a much fancier title and lifestyle. I can't say that I loved The Count of Monte Cristo. Maybe I was unfairly comparing it to more modern novels, not just the language in which people speak that has gotten A LOT more relaxed over the years, but the storytelling arc and pacing and character motivations and plausibility of the narrative. It was a bit too over the top for my liking, like a soap opera on steroids set in the days of yesteryear. The last old classic I read well after my days of assigned readings was probably The Picture of Dorian Gray. As with The Count, I knew going in from its lofty reputation what Dorian's story was generally about without knowing all of the nitty gritty details. Dorian Gray is a much shorter book with far fewer characters to keep track of than The Count of Monte Cristo. In the end I'm glad that I read both of these books. I'm happy to have checked them off of my book bucket list. I am not one of those people who of late have been broadly disparaging books that are part of the literary canon and are referred to as classics. There are plenty of books falling into this category that I greatly enjoyed, and yes, there are also some that I slogged through. Depending on which section I was up to in The Count of Monte Cristo, sometimes I was slogging and other times I was racing through to see what would happen next. It's certainly not uneventful book. Should I take on that other Alexandre Dumas classic - The Three Musketeers? Perhaps someday. We shall see. I'll close out this  with the final words of The Count of Monte Cristo because they are lovely and profound and worth repeating. “Until the day when God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words—'Wait and hope.'” I waited quite some time before finally reading this book. I hoped I would enjoy it. Now I'm hoping that the next book I read will knock my socks off and I don't intend to wait long to find out....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 26, 2021","Feb 26, 2021","Jan 27, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo

I noted in my  of Just One Look that its infectious page turner style of prThis was my second Harlan Coben book, the first being Just One Look. I noted in my  of Just One Look that its infectious page turner style of prose will be mistaken by no one for literary flair. Strictly meat and potatoes. This writing style effectively accomplishes the goal of all mystery books - to make readers extremely curious about who dunnit and why they dunnit. As I have found to be the case with quite a few mysteries, the grande finale portion where all/most gets solved and the culprits are revealed was a bit underwhelming. The explanation section at the end of Just One Look is so choppy and convoluted and hole punched that I stopped caring halfway through it. In other words, I raced to the end only to find myself somewhat dissatisfied by the destination. Nevertheless, I will be sure to give another Harlan Coben book a shot because he is excellent at leaving a trail of crumbs for readers to eagerly devour, and that's what we read mystery novels for - the thrill of the blind chase. Now here I am, having kept my promise to read another Harlan Coben book, ing Fool Me Once. And I can think of little to say about it that I did not already express in my earlier . My feelings about Fool Me Once are nearly identical to how I felt the last time I closed out a Harlan Coben novel, though I will say that the ending of Fool Me Once where everything gets explained was not particularly convoluted. This isn't to say that there are not a great deal of twists and turns along the way. But the summation of how we got from beginning of the mystery to its end was easy enough to follow. I was hooked on the premise of Fool Me Once from the back cover copy. How can it be that Maya sees her husband playing with their daughter on video filmed by a nanny cam when her husband was murdered a couple weeks earlier, prior to acquisition of the nanny cam? I wanted to know and so flew through this book's pages to reach the final ones where all is revealed. Maya is as tough and bad ass a protagonist as they come, a combat veteran who is tortured by demons that she doesn't let get in the way of kicking ass as the need arises. She doesn't even allow being the mother of a young child to soften her rough edges. Such qualities typically are given to male characters, so it's a welcome feminist change of pace for the relentless hero to be a woman. The two Harlan Coben books I've read to date have had significantly different plots and bring us into entirely different worlds. In this one we encounter cops and soldiers and the uber rich and guns for hire and a fancy prep school administrator and a high profile whistle blower determined to reveal unearthed truths and let them steamroll whoever is in the way. But when all is said and done - it was the similarity of reading experiences from one Coben novel to the next that most struck me. Harlan Coben is very good at what he does. It ain't broke so he does not try to fix it, but instead gives readers one edge-of-your-seat suspenseful thriller after another....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Dec 2020,Dec 2020,"Nov 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26109394-fool-me-once

As a 2016 publication it's not especially old, but whenever I would go on a bookish web site such as Goodreads, it seemed that someone in my stream had recently read it. Plenty of those readers were hyping it up, but from the synopsis it did not appear to be a particularly eventful story, and I also stumbled upon s by people who weren't feeling it. I'm intrigued by books that people either love or loathe, not too many falling in the middle. So I finally got around to borrowing a copy from the library to discover which camp I would fall into. The title provides a healthy portion of plot summary. Amor Towles' book is not about a spy. It isn't about a war hero. It isn't a coming of age story or a love story or a revenge story. It isn't about someone who comes to see the error of his ways or who comes to an epiphany after some transformative event. The book is literally about a guy in Moscow, and even that can be said to be an overly broad description since he doesn't spend time in very many neighborhoods or locations throughout the city of Moscow. What Count Alexander Rostov happens to be is a gentleman in a fancy, old hotel named the Metropol where he spends decades of his life under house arrest. His crime is a poem that was credited to him. Being that this is Russia in 1922, a poem which can be translated as a call to action of the revolt variety is sufficient cause for severe punishment. Being well connected is why he ends up on house arrest rather than executed. Revolution always seem to be a spark away in Russia, a fact that I was reminded of when a flare up took place there during the time that I was reading this book. It looked for a minute like Putin was about to be bounced, but he is a resilient guy, as is the country of Ukraine that refuses to be taken over by Russian forces. I suppose it will be while I'm reading some other book in the future that Putin's reign finally ends one way or another. Revolutions are a pretty big deal to those who are out on the streets, picking sides, waiting to see how it will turn out and what the repercussions of the result will be. But for a man residing in a hotel who rarely sets foot outside of its walls, it's background noise. A Gentleman in Moscow is about quiet observations of the poetry of the human condition set within narrow physical confines. At the beginning of the story, which has a surprisingly large page count for a book about a guy who doesn't go anywhere and do all that much, Rostov is booted from a luxury suite and relocated to a much smaller room in the hotel's attic - his small world rendered even smaller. Uncomplainingly he decides on which possessions will make the trip with him since he won't have room to keep everything. With quiet dignity and aristocratic bearing he goes about the business of living for days, weeks, months, years while the world outside goes on without his participation. He befriends a young girl who is mature beyond her years that is staying with her family in the hotel for an extended period of time. This takes place shortly after Rostov gets his faced shaved clean for the first time in however long it has been, a fact that initiates their first conversation. The friendship proves pivotal for two reasons. The first is that for some reason she has a skeleton key that can any open any locked door in the hotel, and shortly before leaving she gifts this key to Rostov. The second reason is that years later as a married woman with a daughter, Nina returns to the Metropol and leaves Sophia behind with her childhood friend while she goes off in search of her husband who was sent to Siberia. Nina never returns and so Count Rostov finds himself in the unexpected role of father. He also lands himself a girlfriend. Eventually he gets a job, working as a waiter in the hotel. He has a clique of good friends who are also employed there. Rostov ends up with the bulk of things that people aspire to acquiring - a partner, family, friends, an occupation that he is well suited for. He has everything except freedom. The primary missing ingredient in his life is mobility. Prior to his sentencing to house arrest, he was a wealthy, well traveled man who was content with his circumstances, saddened only by the early death of his sister. After his confinement at the Metropol he remains the same person with the same demeanor as the world keeps spinning. But the thing is, while the happenings of the world at large do affect us and sometimes fascinate us, the private lives we each lead are what matters most to us. Whether a Democrat or a Republican is in charge, whether economic indicators are up or down, whether it's a time of war or peace, stability or upheaval, we have our inner circles that remain largely untouched by the maelstrom outside our doors. For a stretch of pages I found myself astounded by how little was happening in this novel in terms of plot development. Yet I happily kept reading because it was such a pleasure to bask in the nothingness, in the microscopic examination of the beautiful minutiae that surrounds us daily. Whatever can be appreciated is a treasure. It might be a fresh shave, or a quality meal, or a melodic tune, or a pleasant conversation. Our ability to appreciate it is what makes a kingdom of our immediate surroundings, whether that kingdom is a humble room, a luxury suite, a stately palace, or the opportunity to reside in a wide variety of locations throughout the globe. We aren't made rich by how much we acquire, but by how much we value whatever it is that we have on hand and in our hearts. In the end, consider me among those who were enchanted by A Gentleman in Moscow. I was reminded of the movie The Terminal. National treasure Tom Hanks stars in that one as a guy who is stuck at an airport terminal for weeks because upheaval in his homeland has made him a man without a country. Due to interactions with the airport regulars, this airport takes on a feeling of home rather than being like an isolation cell in a prison. It's in another movie, Cast Away, where we see Hanks in a true solitary confinement situation, so desperate for companionship that he starts to imagine a volley ball as his friend. Count Rostov is far luckier in spite of acquired misfortunes than a guy stranded on a deserted island, because relationships with our fellow man provide us with infinite currency. This lesson is elegantly displayed in Amor Towles' fine novel....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 02, 2023","Jul 02, 2023","Sep 22, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34066798-a-gentleman-in-moscow

It is based on the true story of the Dozier School for Boys, a now-closed juvenile reform school in the Florida Panhandle, where former students have told stories of beatings and sexual abuse and where investigators have found dozens of unmarked graves. At the start of The Nickel Boys we are introduced to a man who we learn spent a portion of his youth in a reform school that made no attempt at reforming or educating. The Nickel Academy was a brutal place for young white men to wind up, and for young, dispensable black men - it was pure hell. Especially when the black kid is a conscientious, diligent, dutiful son and model student planning to attend college. The last type of person who should end up in a reform school. But when he hitches a ride in the wrong car, one that has been stolen, Elwood is considered to be an accessory to the crime and his promising future is derailed. Memories of Nickel haunt the men who served time there, and buried along with secrets are bones that once held up the bodies of those who failed to walk out at the end of their internment. In the Jim Crow south black people had very few rights in a society that invited cruelties against them. As bad as it is on the outside, black boys in a place like Nickel, most of them lacking in concerned family members waiting at home for them, can be tortured to death and made to vanish without a trace. Those who make it out are mostly broken men. But there are certain individuals who remain free of subjugation even while imprisoned. And once release from bondage is achieved, such men not only survive but thrive. No matter that they are forever scarred, because a place like Nickel always leaves its marks. Whatever doesn't kill you can destroy mind, body and soul in various ways, unless you are the type of person who is strong enough to lift the heaviest of burdens and rise above enslaving circumstances and shape a life worth living when freedom is at hand. The type of person who understands even in the midst of the grittiest of circumstances, the value of shimmering hope. Whitehead's prose is skillfully rendered and makes for easy to digest reading. He paints a bleak landscape with his words in telling a tale drenched in sorrows. This  will remain spoiler free, though I must add that I did not see the brilliant ending coming. It is one that causes you to re-evaluate all that came before it. Similar themes are addressed in the novel Sleepers by Lorenzo Carcaterra and the miniseries When They See Us - directed by Ava DuVernay. So if you enjoyed The Nickel Boys as much as I did and have not yet read Sleepers or seen When They See Us, you may want to do something about that. Another very famous story addressing similar themes that I happen to be currently reading is The Count of Monte Cristo. Similar themes addressed and yet somehow stories that are quite different from each other since the same basic story can be told in many significantly different ways....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 27, 2021","Jan 27, 2021","Jun 12, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42270835-the-nickel-boys

The earlier setting takes place in an The narrative of Chris Bohjalian's The Light in the Ruins jumps back and forth between the years 1943 and 1955. The earlier setting takes place in an Italian countryside during World War II. Mussolini's Italy was an ally to Hitler's Germany during the war, but for a portion of that time German soldiers treated Italy like an occupied nation rather than viewing its citizens as brothers in arms. During this period of uneasy alliance, members of the wealthy Rosati family have complicated relationships with the German military as well as with their less prosperous neighbors. The Rosatis host parties for the Germans (because refusing would have given them dangerous enemies), the two adult sons serve in the military and therefore are in partnership with the Germans, and their beautiful sister falls in love with a German soldier whom she believes to be more decent and humane than his comrades. The Rosati family's cozy relationships with Germans (which is set in motion by the wish of Germany to not only take over the world, but also to plunder much of its art in the process, and the Rosatis happen to have an ancient Etruscan burial site on their land) is a recipe for resentment by those who are distrustful of the Nazis and anyone who chooses to associate with them. Flashing forward to the 1950's the book's plot revolves around a serial killer who for unknown reasons is targeting members of the Rosati family, ripping the heart out of each victim to cap off the vicious murders. Two Italian detectives are on the case, a man and a woman, the latter having a relationship with the Rosati family that dates back to the war when she was severely injured and they helped nurse her back to health. Being a woman police office, an armed one, makes her a rarity in this place and time. As the fast paced novel draws to its conclusion on a dual track we learn the identity and motivation of the killer in its final pages. I neither loved nor hated this book. I suppose that I expected or hoped for a little more from it. The writing is somewhat boilerplate but effective enough to keep readers engaged and curious to see how things will work out. If you're a fan of whodunnits (not that this is one you'll have any chance of figuring out on your own), and of war novels, and of historical fiction with a dash or romance, and of art history - The Light in the Ruins will reward you with all of these elements. You may or may not fall in love with this book. You definitely won't be bored by it. This is the second Chris Bohjalian novel I have read, the first being Trans-Sister Radio. These books cover radically different subject matter so I'll have no idea what to expect from any of his other novels if and when I decide to give him a third chance....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 25, 2020","May 25, 2020","Apr 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16099189-the-light-in-the-ruins

It received a great deal of hype including the valuable OPRAH seal of approval. So I went in thinking it would blow me away. Instead I ended up liking but not quite loving it. 3-1/2 stars out of 5. Comparisons to The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead were inevitable since they both tackle the same subject matter. Both books stray from the reality of what the underground railroad was in the telling of their respective tales. In Whitehead's case he made it a literal train traveling underground, so basically the subway. As for Coates, he came up with the concept of conduction which is where certain people (such as Harriet Tubman who is a character in The Water Dancer) possess the mystical power to transport themselves and others along with them over great distances rather than needing to travel in pedestrian fashion by horse or foot. It's kind of bordering on Harry Potter territory. The Water Dancer delves into the life of a man named Hiram Walker who is a slave in possession of the power of conduction, although for much of the narrative he doesn't have full mastery of it or control over when it will happen. But even though he isn't a conduction expert yet, his talent makes the operators of the Underground Railroad greatly desirous of his services. Unlike Hiram and Harriet ""Moses"" Tubman, most slave escapes are orchestrated by people without magical powers. These ordinary escapes involve strategy, forgery, and following paths that lead to various locations of shelter by abolitionists when perilous journeys from bondage to safe haven in the northern half of the US are undertaken. Hiram, like many slaves, has half African ancestry and half Caucasian. His biological father is also his master. He is treated better than many other slaves, not quite like a son by his father or like a brother by his father's officially recognized son Maynard. But Hiram is certainly treated better than a brute animal, in part because of his talents beyond conduction such as an incredible memory and mastery of card tricks that entertains guests at parties. In blood as well as circumstances, Hiram has a lifestyle somewhere in between that of ""The Tasked and that of ""The Quality"". But neither he nor those he loves best has freedom, and without that precious commodity, time on this earth is just an advance p of Hell with stolen moments of sweetness all the more cherished because they can be taken away on a whim at any time. I didn't feel as emotionally invested in Hiram and the woman he loves (Sophia) and the woman who raises him after the death of the mother he barely remembers (Thena) as I was in the protagonist of Whitehead's Underground Railroad, or that of the wonderful Freeman by Leonard Pitts Jr.. I wasn't as impressed by the writing as I was by the prose in Edward P. Jones' The Known World or Charles R. Johnson's Middle Passage. I wasn't as absorbed in The Water Dancer as I was by the remarkable Kindred by Octavia E. Butler. Coates has not taken the literary throne from Toni Morrison and her novels such as Beloved and A Mercy. But this isn't to say that I did not enjoy The Water Dancer. It's just that I've read some incredible books that deal with the abomination of slavery. Ta-Nehisi is a very talented writer and I hope he continues gifting us with both his fiction and non-fiction writing on any topic of his choosing....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jan 22, 2020","Jan 22, 2020","Dec 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43982054-the-water-dancer

My wife ended up reading it before me and gave it her highest recommendation. Eventually I got around to it and I share her opinion that this is a wonderfully written novel by Ann Patchett. It is a quiet, slow paced story. Don't grab a copy if you're looking for international intrigue and a lot of car crashes. What you'll instead find within the pages of The Magician's Assistant is plenty of internal exploration by the protagonist to learn who she truly is, which starts out by embarking on a physical and emotional journey to discover who her deceased husband was. Early on we learn that Sabine's husband has just died. We also learn that his lover Phan died of AIDS not long before, which informs us that Sabine was married to a gay man - the magician whom she assisted. I don't consider this to be a spoiler because the reader is given this information in the book's earliest pages. The next revelation, which comes as a total surprise to Sabine, is that her husband was not an orphan bereft of any family other than her and Phan. Shortly after Parsifal's death (not caused by AIDS which he had but had not made him sick yet, but due to a ruptured aneurysm), we learn that his mother and two sisters plus a couple nephews are alive and well. And to them his name was Guy. Parsifal's greatest magic trick it seems was complete reinvention of himself. The first version is a gay boy growing up in Nebraska, dreaming of being anyplace else. The second version is a gay man (with a wife as well as a male lover) who has found that place in Los Angeles, California, performing magic shows for the joy of it and selling antique rugs for great profit. Sabine's willingness to be married to someone who is not physically attracted to women feels like a mystery to the reader - or at least it did to me. The only answer we receive is that she loved him and failed to find anyone else who made her feel the same way. So she accepts what seems to be half of a marriage at best. But when Sabine learns that Parsifal had been lying to her for years about having a family, and then learns that Parsifal's mother and one of his sisters have traveled to LA to meet her, she throws herself into solving the full mystery of her husband's life. There is one more secret in store for her to learn about Parsifal. I won't give that one away. Sabine finds out that Parsifal's family is not full of people who drove him away over intolerance of his sexuality. Her expectation that this must have been the explanation for Parsifal's secrecy and denial of his past is not met, which only deepens curiosity over decisions made by the man she assisted in work and loved offstage. And so Sabine goes back with her newly discovered in-laws to Nebraska where she hopes to unearth the full story of the magician's life. By excavating through his past and getting to intimately know the people who share his blood, Sabine hopes to find a way to move on from torturous mourning. And this assistant who is rather adept at magic tricks in her own right is able to shuffle the cards of loss she has been dealt, and somehow pluck from the void the start of a brand new family and potential for happiness. Ann Patchett pulls us in with skillfully rendered prose that keeps readers hooked throughout the story's twists and turns - weaving a tale that is absorbing from its surprising start to its quietly satisfying conclusion....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 23, 2020","Nov 23, 2020","Sep 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16055.The_Magician_s_Assistant

The dual narration alternates between two women, Sarah and the title Chris Cleave is a wonderful writer and Little Bee is a masterfully crafted book. The dual narration alternates between two women, Sarah and the title character who has renamed herself Little Bee. It is no small challenge for a male author to write exclusively from a woman's perspective, or two women in this case, but Cleave's execution in my opinion is just about flawless. There is also the fact that the character Little Bee is a a black woman from Nigeria and Chris Cleave is a white male author. I have no idea if the services of a sensitivity reader were employed. I do know that in this day and age there is increased focus and pressure on authors not to make a single misstep when writing from a point of view that is not their own personal one, even through the lens of fiction where the opportunity for make believe is endless. Some authors these days may be less willing to take chances when it comes to slipping into skin too different from their own, concerned that they will be mocked across the span of bookish social media accounts for failing an authenticity test. As an author myself I know that such voices of criticism must be drowned out. This is not to say that concerns about cultural insensitivity aren't valid, but first and foremost authors must service the stories they have dreamed into being and the characters who populate them. And while they may not share the same race or gender or nationality or economic class, what an author must share with and find within every primary character ranging from heroine to villain is the humanity we all possess. Cleave's personal background I'd venture to guess is closer to that of Sarah (a white magazine editor from England with a financially comfortable lifestyle) than it is to that of Little Bee (an undocumented refugee from a predominantly black country who is able to get out of a detention center after escaping from a violent landscape, but knows she is living on borrowed time for only so long as she can manage to stay under the radar). At no point when addressing the reader either as Sarah or as Little Bee did I detect a false note in Chris Cleave's writing. The two women in his novel are as different from each other as the places they are from. Sarah is older, a mother, a wife when she first meets Little Bee along with being another man's mistress. Her existence is more sophisticated than that of a teenager from a small village which is far less advanced in technological development. This is not to say that Little Bee comes from a poor region since there is oil to be unearthed. But the riches generated by black gold do not make it to someone in Little Bee's position. What does reach her is violence, the barbaric cruelty of men. One thing this book does not provide is adult male characters who exhibit or earn much sympathy from readers. Sarah's husband is a weak man who fails miserably when given the opportunity to sacrifice for others. His cowardice haunts him and eventually is a main factor leading him to suicide. As for Sarah's lover who has a wife and three children, Lawrence is perhaps less of a coward than Andrew but he is certainly no less selfish. Sarah of course is also flawed. But caring for a young child who is dealing with the trauma of losing his father without fully understanding what death even is, a little boy hiding from hurt behind the Batman costume he wears constantly, does not allow her much opportunity to think of herself first. And Sarah is the one who summons bravery and willingness to sacrifice on Little Bee's behalf when Andrew fails to be up to the task. These two women come from different worlds, but once their paths cross they are inextricably linked. Little Bee knows the terror of a homeland where men will murder her as an afterthought, which causes her to fantasize in every settings about how she would quickly kill herself in the event that they suddenly arrived. Are the men of England who may not physically harm her but will send her back to where she is unlikely to survive any less merciful than the men who killed her sister? When you're born into circumstances as unfortunate as those of Little Bee, when learning to speak like those from a safer place is not sufficient to stop them from imprisoning until ejecting you because all they see is a drain on resources rather than someone to show compassion towards, odds of survival are long. But in between terrors there are moments of beauty and joy and brief respites that resemble tranquility. The nobility of someone who does not have the luxury of immigrating when conveniently legal can be as difficult for citizens of a first world nation to notice as a single little bee in a field of blooming flowers. And when born into circumstances as fortunate as those of Sarah, that does not mean tragedy cannot come calling. Being spoiled by privilege will not necessarily render you incapable of fighting for a cause greater than yourself. Until arrival of the moment that puts one to the test, none of us knows if we will turn out to be a coward or a warrior. Chris Cleave does a fantastic job illustrating these truths via the women of his invention.

I am not an aThe Shadow Land is the second book by Elizabeth Kostova that I've read, the first being The Historian which is about a hunt for Dracula. I am not an avid reader of vampire books, but instead consider myself somewhat of a purist who only reads the finest of tales about the undead. Anne Rice and Elizabeth Kostova make up the entirety of my vampire book reading list. As for Bram Stoker's Dracula, I supposed I'm saving the classic that got the ball rolling for a rainy day. The Shadow Land is not a vampire book, despite its atmospheric title. It is the story of a young woman who is starting her life anew. After her brother's death and parents' divorce, she decides to leave her familiar way of life in America behind and move to Bulgaria where she will work as a teacher and figure out what shape her future will take. Shortly after arriving, a chance encounter puts her on a far different path than anticipated. Alexandra accidentally takes a bag belonging to people she has a brief interaction with, and learns that it contains an urn with the ashes of a stranger. A taxi driver is kind enough to help her return the precious package, and what starts out seemingly as a small, strange task becomes a lengthy quest fraught with peril. Where is the family of the deceased person whose ashes are in her care? And is someone attempting to prevent return of the urn? Elizabeth Kostova is a gifted writer who does not shy away from descriptive prose. It's probably no exaggeration to say that if she provided fewer details about the appearance of every person encountered and every locale visited and focused primarily on moving the plot along, The Shadow Land could be at least 50 pages shorter than it is - maybe more. To avoid venturing into spoiler territory means not saying a great deal more about the mystery that Alexendra insists on and persists in unraveling along with the taxi driver turned sidekick, plus a dog that they end up bringing along with them for the ride. I found the development of the narrative to be slow going. For much of the book's page count their mission does not seem to be especially urgent. Certainly not as big of a deal as tracking down Dracula. But there is enough strange behavior surrounding their trek from one location to the next in search of the family of the deceased to recognize that this is no simple lost and found story. Kostova takes her time in revealing how the ordinary can sometimes be a disguise for the extraordinary. Along the way she uses her prose like a microscope, making it difficult to guess at what's being examined because it's a vital clue, and what's looked at up close simply because it is there and Kostova loves to intimately describe things and people. Eventually the story line splits in two. In flashback we learn about the man who would live and love and play music exquisitely on his cherished violin until passing on and becoming the ashes in Alexandra's possession. In the present we follow along with Alexandra as she strives to bring about a reunion between the living and the departed. I confess to finding the portion taking place in the present somewhat tiresome after a while, but this was made up for by the captivating tale from the past. The two tracks of narrative run parallel to each other, with the point they meet up at marking the end of the story. Or almost, as a few final pages are spent on wrapping up one last matter to attend to. The ashes have a final destination to be brought to. With the exception of her brother's mysterious death (he goes missing from a family hiking trip in the mountains and is never found) Alexandra's life is relatively uneventful and unfulfilling until the urn ends up in her possession. Her brother is never far from her thoughts, silently traveling with her like a ghost from America to Europe. By the time she has brought the urn to its intended destination, she seems ready to move on from death and try a forward way of living on for size. I cannot say that I loved The Shadow Land, perhaps in part because I preferred The Historian. But there is no denying that Kostova is a skilled writer who immerses readers in modern day adventures that reach back into a beautifully mysterious past....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Oct 2022,Oct 2022,"Aug 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31394293-the-shadow-land

The opening line of my  of it reads ""The fact that this book explores university politics featuring east coast black upper-middle class characters made it stand out from the pack, but once you get over this facet (which I did pretty quickly), what you're left with is a well written and fairly intriguing mystery, more memorable than some I've read, less so than others."". Upon finishing Lauren Wilkinson's novel American Spy as I pondered what to say about it in , I found myself feeling similarly to how I did upon completion of The Emperor of Ocean Park. Not that these two books are particularly similar in subject matter. Carter's novel is a murder mystery and Wilkinson's is a political thriller. Instead of being immersed in the world of university politics Wilkinson thrusts us into the world of international intrigue. As the title makes plain, Wilkinson's book is about an American spy. The main character is Marie Mitchell. She works for the FBI which is sort of the Mitchell family business. Much is made of the fact that working as a spy for the US government is not typical employment for women, nor for African Americans, and most especially not for African American women. Yet Marie isn't even a trailblazer but instead following in the footsteps of her sister, not to mention them having a grandmother who didn't work for a government agency, but in passing for white did live an undercover lifestyle. Wilkinson's novel, like Carter's, received a lot of buzz upon publication. And a major part of the buzz in both cases had to do with the fact that the setting was conventional for white characters but these books feature African American leads. I suppose this aspect impresses other people more so than me. Does writing about a black woman in a white man's world mean that there will will be an extra layer of social commentary not present in your typical spy thriller? Yes it does. Was this extra layer something I appreciated? Yes it was. Does this make or break a novel for me? No it does not. In the end I'm here for the story and a fish out of water aspect is merely a component of the tale, not the hook, line and sinker. Regardless of how common or uncommon it is for characters of a particular background and make-up to be in a certain setting, what matters most is that I'm absorbed in the narrative and care about the characters and am anxious to learn how things will work out for them. I suppose I find it a little condescending for a book to be hyped largely because a black person is doing so called white things in it. We've already had a black US president in real life, not merely in Irving Wallace's novel The Man. While Kamala Harris was still in the mix it was possible that our next actual president would be a black woman. If that's plausible then certainly a book featuring a black woman working for the FBI isn't speculative science fiction so much as it is noteworthy because it is infrequent. All of that aside, I enjoyed American Spy. Lauren Wilkinson pulls readers in right away with an opening pages scene where someone breaks into Marie Mitchell's home to kill her. She thwarts the attempt, kills the assassin, and goes on the run with her young twin sons. After this exciting set up, the rest of the book details how and why Marie found herself in this situation. Most of the novel's text is what Marie writes to her sons over the course of the narrative because she has one more dangerous mission to embark upon. In case she doesn't survive and isn't around to raise her children, she wants them to know who she was and why she did what she did. Although American Spy is a work of fiction, there are characters from real life featured in it. Most notably, Thomas Sankara who is known as ""Africa's Che Guevara"" is pivotal to the plot. He is the father of Marie's sons and the reason their paths cross is because Marie is tasked with setting him up on behalf of the US government. Intervening in the affairs of other countries to make sure America's influence is the man behind the curtain rather than a Communist country pulling strings is what we do. This book is short on good guys because nearly everyone is practicing the art of deceit. Marie is constantly being manipulated while being directed to manipulate others. It's what she signed up for, despite the fact that prior to receiving this assignment she was underutilized and underappreciated by the FBI. But she is just the right race and gender and level of attractiveness to put on the case of bringing Sankara down. And he is one of the few people in this story who isn't lying with every other word he says. His intentions in many respects are noble and his ways are charismatic, so readers along with Marie wonder if her allegiance is to the right side. Or perhaps there is no right side, only a job to either do or else figure a way out of. Conflicted allegiance and fighting for survival and protecting loved ones no matter what it takes makes for solid spy story material, and it's cool that a black woman is the lead for a change, but only if the author makes us care and keeps us engaged. Lauren Wilkinson succeeds and gifts us with a fine debut novel. It's not quite an exceptional one in my opinion. Considering the genre I would have liked a little more action and peril. The book begins and ends with Marie in situations where her life is at risk and tension runs high, but in between there is far more back story establishing and mundane activity than edge of your seat situations. So in the end, rather than American Spy standing apart from the average spy novel because its lead character is a black woman, it stood apart to me primarily because I wanted more thrills per page. But it was definitely an enjoyable read and Lauren Wilkinson is definitely an author to keep an eye on. To the best of my knowledge American Spy is not intended to be book #1 in a series, but I wouldn't mind seeing the fictional Marie Mitchell in follow up stories. And I'm now intrigued enough by my introduction to Thomas Sankara to venture beyond American Spy and Wikipedia to learn more about him....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 02, 2019","Sep 02, 2019","Jul 22, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40274582-american-spy

Philip Roth asks the question - what if FDR had been defeated in his presidential run for a third term by the charismatic, anti-Semitic Charles Lindbergh whose main campaign promise was to keep the US out of World War II while having a darker motive for acquiring great power? Roth tells his story in a macro way as well as going micro and showing the impact of Lindbergh's presidency through the eyes of a boy in a Jewish family living in Newark, NJ. I decided to read this book upon learning that HBO is doing a movie adaptation of it, with portions being filmed in my neighborhood. I took the opportunity to visit the site of filming when it was taking place a few blocks from my house. It was a cool experience made cooler by getting to hang out with a few of the extras. I've long been a Philip Roth fan, and while this novel didn't impress me quite as much as the masterful American Pastoral or crack me up like the hilarious Portnoy's Complaint, it was still a great read. Parallels between the 1940's of Roth's imagination and our current political climate are striking. Simply switch the idea of a man who ascends to the presidency aided by a foreign government (Germany) with the idea of a man ascending to the presidency aided by a foreign government (Russia). Switch a celebrity with no previous political experience having an improbable, meteoric rise to the White House with a celebrity with no previous political experience having an improbable, meteoric rise to the White House. Switch people being thrown into hellish concentration camps because they're Jewish with people being thrown into hellish detention centers because they crossed a border in hope for a better way of life. One is hypothetical fiction, the other is the life we're living. The deeper into the book you get, the more you marvel at how Roth seemed to be stealing from a reality that hadn't happened yet by creating one that never happened.

If instead he was a one hit wonder and got to choose which of his Best Selling novels was to be his literary legacy, I wonder which book he would choose. He would be wise to give strong consideration to 11/22/63 because it is one of his finest stories. The main character is a man named Jake to whom a time travel portal is shown. Unlike a time machine that could bring someone wherever they chose to go in either the past or future, Jake is able to leave his time behind and enter a particular day in a particular year - 1958. He is talked into going back 50+ years so that he can change the tragic fates of a few ordinary people, and change history book level history by preventing Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating John F. Kennedy. Since JFK is not killed until 1963, Jake must stay in the past for several years in order to confirm beyond doubt that Oswald acted alone. And once that's accomplished, to stop Oswald by any means necessary. The most effective means is of course to kill Oswald before he becomes an infamous killer. In the process of waiting for his opportunity to save Kennedy, he ends up meeting a woman who will become the great love of his life. As King's hefty book heads towards Jake's date with destiny, we root for him to achieve his objective and to get the girl. It takes a while for him to dismiss all conspiracy theories and conclude that Oswald acted on his own, but loving Sadie comes easily. To keep this  spoiler free, I'll end my synopsis here. There are quite a few great Stephen King novels and this exhaustively researched one deserves a spot among the best of his best.

It is a story of American slavery, and of daring tThis novel is a grand literary achievement, well deserving of its accolades and the Pulitzer Prize. It is a story of American slavery, and of daring to dream of freedom. It depicts the shackles that physically held people in bondage as well as mentally chaining them to the inescapable past. Slaves who did not have their spirits broken by enforced servitude had one chance to claim a life worth living. They could run and hope to make it to the underground railroad. Colson Whitehead makes the interesting choice of depicting it as an actual railroad running beneath the ground, giving the story somewhat of a science fiction feel. But for the most part the narrative is a gritty, realistic one. A woman named Cora is at its center. She escapes bondage much as her mother, who was never heard from again, did before her. Freedom is fleeting. Just as Cora has grown comfortable and believes she has found a permanent place for herself, she ends up imprisoned in an attic, hiding until found and recaptured. Once again she escapes and this time she finds a utopia, a community of black people living prosperously and independently. But paradise found is only a sweet respite until it is lost. A slave catcher named Ridgeway relentlessly pursues Cora even after the man who hired him to find her has died. His determination to return Cora to bondage is a match for her desire to live on her own terms rather than those dictated by a barbaric society. Yet Ridgeway can hold Cora captive to no greater degree than one can grasp the wind. Once again she escapes and goes on the run, riding the subterranean rails towards a future that is beyond the reach of slavery. The story is told at a pulse quickening pace, with quiet moments interspersed that resemble freedom and present the possibility of Cora choosing a lifelong home, until she finds herself being hunted again. We hope for Cora's fate to be merciful, knowing that the railroad's journey to a better tomorrow is mighty long, continuing in certain ways to this very day....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,Nov 2017,Nov 2017,"Oct 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30555488-the-underground-railroad

I have read several of his novels to date and have been impressed by the Dan Brown is at it again and so is his favorite protagonist, Robert Langdon. I have read several of his novels to date and have been impressed by the consistency and reliability of their quintessential Dan Brown-ness. Will you get a page turner thriller in which the fate of the world is at stake? Check. Will you be bombarded by elements of both science and religion, with the legitimacy of faith in God seemingly in peril at every turn, yet somehow managing to persevere? Check. Will you feel like you took a college course after having learned about multiple fascinating locations and organizations and rituals that you never knew existed before? Check. Will Robert Langdon, the ultimate know-it-all, be an expert on just about everything encountered in the course of the story? Check. Will he juggle adventure going and mystery solving with a flirtation due to having a beautiful woman at the hip throughout his journey, but in the end it won't amount to much as Robert Langdon, unlike say James Bond, is the sort of hero who always meets but never gets the girl? Check. The fact that Brown never strays or deviates from his tried and true formula does not mean that I have grown weary of it. I have not enjoyed all Dan Brown novels equally, but they each have their charm. The question: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? has continued to be answered by his books in the affirmative. Origin does not feature the threat of deadly widespread peril that we got in Inferno. It strays closer to his biggest hit The Da Vinci Code in that the big climax we're headed towards is a revelation (or two or three) that will likely rock humanity to its core. In The Da Vinci Code the big reveal is whether Jesus married, fathered a child, and if there is a descendant from his bloodline living among us. That, rather than a golden chalice, turns out to be the legendary holy grail. In Origin, a genius computer whiz (who happens to be a former student of Robert Langdon) promises/threatens to reveal the answers to the two biggest questions of all time. How did all of this begin (Is the truth the Bible's Adam & Eve story, the Big Bang Theory; the result of Extraterrestrial DNA drop off; some other explanation that has eluded mankind until now) is the first question. Where are we destined to go or become is the second. This may differ from reader to reader, but I personally found the questions posed and explored in Origin to be less compelling than the mysteries unearthed in fictional form in The Da Vince Code. And mankind isn't being threatened with extinction or population cleansing in Origin such as was the case with the more urgent plot of Inferno. There is no deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by my favorite club - the Illuminati - like there was in Angels in Demons. Instead, the big payoff in Origin is basically a press conference hosted in dramatic high tech fashion by a man named Edmond Kirsch. So the stakes are not quite as high in Origin as in previous Dan Brown books. I try to remain spoiler free in s so will simply say that Edmond is initially thwarted from delivering his ""earth shattering"" messages. But where there is a will there is a way, and what Edmond cannot pull off on his own perhaps can be accomplished on his behalf by a determined Robert Langdon, who as usual is accompanied by a beautiful woman he has decided to trust, but our hero is never distracted from the task at hand. He is also aided by Edmond's resourceful Artificial Intelligence assistant - Winston. Having Winston at his constant virtual disposal, except for a period of time after he is forced to ditch his cell phone, allows the extremely learned Robert Langdon to be even more of a know-it-all than usual. But Dan Brown always has a few cards hidden up his sleeve until the final scene. I wasn't blown away by Origin. There was a predictability to the outcome in my opinion. I'm not the best at guessing how writers will wrap up a story, but with this book I did pretty well in anticipating how things would turn out. I also was a little less attached to the secondary characters than has previously been the case. How attached can one grow to a computer program? And since the woman running around with Landgon is engaged to another man, he has even less of a shot at getting the girl than usual. Nevertheless I did enjoy and race through Origin. Dan Brown is a master at getting readers to hungrily turn through his pages. I look forward to his next offering, which I will tackle when in the mood for the easiest of reads....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 27, 2020","Jul 27, 2020","Oct 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32283133-origin

I have yet to see the movie, but in general when II was vaguely aware that a movie adaptation has been made of this novel when picking it up to read. I have yet to see the movie, but in general when I see that a book has been made into a movie, I figure the book must be pretty good. This way of thinking can prove to be false of course. At most it's probably a solid indicator that the book sold well. We know that plenty of lousy movies have been adapted from far superior books, and perhaps less frequently but it does happen, a pretty good movie sometimes can be the result of adaptation from a so-so book. In the case of Water for Elephants since I haven't seen the movie, I can't speak as to which version I enjoyed best. I can only speak to the novel which I thought was mediocre. It's the story of a man in his nineties living in a nursing home who thinks back on his days spent working as a veterinarian in a traveling circus. The setting jumps back and forth from Jacob being a young man on a train with a bunch of circus folk to being an old man dealing with the erosion of his body and mind. Most of the book is dedicated to his circus days and how he ends up with the woman who would become his wife and mother of his children. These sections are where most of the action takes place. In the present it doesn't get more dramatic than Jacob being cranky about nursing home life, him becoming disoriented sometimes, and family members forgetting to visit him on the one day when a circus happens to be nearby. Yet I found the writing to be more engaging in quiet scenes set in the present where nothing much took place than the portions dealing with circus life. Plenty of elements are in place for intriguing storytelling. We have a circus owner with a complex over not being the Ringling Brothers Circus who is willing to cut losses of human lives if that's what it takes to keep the show going on. There is the paranoid schizophrenic boss who switches from charming to psychotic on a dime. His beautiful headline act wife whom Jacob can not stop thinking about. Also aboard the train are performers, some more freakish than others, and animals, some more dangerous than others, that are in Jacob's care. The scenes taking place during Jacob's youth felt rushed to me. It was as if the author wanted to include as many eventful happenings during this period as could be crammed in, but she dwells on none of them for long because it's already time to move on to the next one. Everybody seemed to be a character sketch of a personality type rather than a fully fleshed out human being. The lone exception is Jacob, but only because the book focuses on him in his senior years along with his adventurous youthful days, giving us a little more time to learn what makes him tick. Water for Elephants is an easy read that covers some interesting territory, but it fell well short of being the greatest show on earth. I wouldn't be surprised if I enjoy the movie more than the book if I ever get around to watching it. I've rounded up from 2-1/2 to 3 stars because I like the title of this book and that's as good a reason as any....more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,"Apr 09, 2018not set","Apr 09, 2018not set","Sep 01, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43641.Water_for_Elephants

So I've split the difference to give it 3 stars. Overall I'm glad I read this book. What I came into it already knowing about Houdini only scratched the surface of his accomplishments. I had no idea that he was a major participant in the earliest days of airplane flight. Not until reading the jacket cover did I know he most likely participated in spying for the government. Turns out he was also a Hollywood star (writing, directing, acting), a bibliophile who amassed practically a public library's worth of books, a man on a mission to warn the public against con artists who promised (for a price) to provide connections to the dearly departed, and perhaps least surprising - a ladies man. Houdini proved to be much better at escaping from all manner of devices than at keeping his extramarital affairs secret from his wife. The subject matter of this biography is juicy but the prose manages to be overlong and repetitive and I'll just say that it's way less of a page turner than it could have been. But I read through to the end and now feel that I know just about everything there is to know about Harry Houdini EXCEPT how he managed to pull off all that wonderful magic.

A truly extraordinary achievement and an absolute pleasure to read. The plot is perfectly simple. A family tree gets split This novel is magnificent. A truly extraordinary achievement and an absolute pleasure to read. The plot is perfectly simple. A family tree gets split into two branches in Africa. Two sisters who never get to know each other are separated, one married off to a white slave trader and the other ending up as one of the slaves held literally beneath their feet. Subsequent chapters bounce back and forth between descendants of the two sisters. Each chapter gives us a slice in the life of a character. It picks up at what seems like a random spot in a person's life, gets us absorbed in that story, and then abruptly abandons it. The next chapter introduces us to a new character who falls in the other half of the family lineage. Reading Yaa Gyasi's wonderful novel is like watching a literary tennis match, our attention drawn to one side of the net and then pulled to the other and back and forth the narrative goes. We reach the end of each chapter with a tinge of regret because it was a riveting tale unto itself and we are naturally curious to follow it further. But we are equally anxious to dive into the next story from the other side of the net. Homegoing is a novel that very much has the feeling of an anthology of short stories. Each story is a sequel to the one that we read two chapters back, introducing us to the son or daughter of the father or mother we previously read about. Inevitably the two family/narrative lines will meet up, or so we hope and expect. Ultimately it is a single family and story divided up into various segments that contain varying amounts of joy and tragedy and hope. Homegoing is the story of the atrocities of the slave trade, and colonization, and segregation, and Jim Crow, and the Great Migration, and the war on drugs, and mass incarceration which is basically full circle back to slavery in modern society. It is a story of family, not just this particular fictional one but the real world African American family. Splintered into pieces that may never reconnect. Like the characters who populate this book, each of us have entirely different and unique stories. Yet we all share the same, single path. We are each other's brothers and sisters even if fated to never cross paths. Trace back far enough and we can find where the connection began. And if we cannot, we still know that the connection is out there somewhere, and so we should relate to and treat one another with this understanding. Decades ago Alex Haley gave us the masterful Roots and now Yaa Gyasi has given us the brilliant Homegoing. The latter is a work of pure fiction but feels like truth as the best of fiction does. Put this book immediately into the literary canon. Homegoing should be mandatory reading for all students of African American history, and Black Literature, and English Majors. If you're not a student in any of those classes then read it anyway because it's a wonderful novel that you will be glad to have read. It is a story for everyone as the best of fiction is, but will resonate particularly with the souls of black folk. Bravo, Yaa Gyasi.

I've always been fascinated by the Jazz Age and the artists who gave it its reputation. Especially the AmA fine piece of literary historical fiction. I've always been fascinated by the Jazz Age and the artists who gave it its reputation. Especially the American writers who took a break from our shores to live in Paris and join the future icons from Europe in wine, cheese and debauchery. Therese Anne Fowler did an exemplary job of bringing familiar names and reputations from literature anthologies to life, skillfully transporting us to romanticized days. Reading this novel I felt like Owen Wilson's character in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris, suddenly thrust into a world where each day was filled to the brim with an excess of genius, celebration, and elegant style. In the middle of this story we find Zelda Fitzgerald, a woman who on the one hand was perfectly emblematic of this time, yet on the other could not fit in the way she truly yearned to because she was a woman/wife/mother in a man's world. Zelda was a person of bursting talent and ambition that could not be fully exploited and showcased because of her role as Mrs. Fitzgerald. Fowler explores the great passion that brought and somehow held the Fitzgeralds together over the course of their tempestuous marriage. The reader knows before turning to the first page that greatness is in store for them, most especially for F. Scott, but Zelda is more of a mystery to us. As the pages are turned and the narrative unfolds, we learn that there is more to Zelda than her reputation as a rather unstable temptress. We watch her try to be a good wife as the time period defined this term to the man she loved, while also trying to be a woman ahead of her time who hoped to carve out her own place in the history books. We watch her desires nearly destroy her as her husband's vices wreak havoc on their roller coaster marriage and his health. Various famous names flit in and out of their lives. Ernest Hemingway plays a major role in expanding F. Scott Fitzgerald's insecurities and loosening the bonds of his devotion to Zelda. There is plenty of glamour and globetrotting and name dropping and a Great War and eventually another one. In the center of it all is a fun loving southern belle who decides to take a chance on a cocky northern soldier that her daddy does not approve of. She chooses to defy conventions and expectations, and tries to discover herself along the way rather than meekly accepting who society says she is supposed to be. F. Scott Fitzgerald casts a great shadow. Seeking light nearly destroyed Zelda, but she was a formidable woman who could withstand everything but the literal flames that consumed her on her final day. With able assistance from Therese Anne Fowler, Zelda has risen from the ashes and assumed her place as an icon from a magical time....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 26, 2016","Oct 12, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/15994634-z

Matt Gallagher effortlessly (which of course likely means he took great effort) pulls us into an Army unit in Iraq and gives us a taste of what modern warfare is like for members of an occupying force. It isn't a tale of heroism so much as of following orders and doing what it takes to make it from one day to the next, hopefully without abandoning too much of one's conscience along the way.

I kept waiting for this novel to get better and less odd as it went along. Not that odd is bad, and Mr. Irving is the master of making readers fall in love with peculiar characters, even kids who seem overly obsessed with statues of legendary religious virgins such as Mary rather than normal kid interests. But as I read this novel (which has a wonderful title) I got the feeling that he simply felt like writing about writing, and aging, and dying, and religion/Catholicism, and homophobia, and sex. All things he has written profoundly about before, but in more intriguing and plot driven ways. He delves into miracles and ghosts/angels to a greater extent in Avenue of Mysteries than most of his earlier novels, though miracles are also nothing new to the prose of John Irving. The fact of the matter is, there are many familiar elements recognizable to readers of his earlier work in this book, and the author's easy to read and digest style is as John Irvingesque as ever, more or less. But at his best John Irving writes novels that I fall madly in love with, and that simply wasn't the case with this one. Something was missing, or perhaps too much of something usually restrained was present. He is still and always will be one of my literary heroes and favorite authors, but if you've never read a John Irving novel, I do not advise starting with this one....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 17, 2018","May 17, 2018","Aug 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25111109-avenue-of-mysteries

Religion serves the purpose of providing answers without needing to bear the burden of proof. By accepting the influence and omnipotence of a higher power, rather than wrestling with questions, people accept explanations that cannot be disproved.

In 2016 we call the violent radicals Islamic terrorists; the medical crisis du jour is the Zika virus; protests follow questionable shootings with riots sometimes resulting when activists from the newbie #BlackLivesMatter movement face off against police officers with #BlueLivesMatter mindsets; and Kevin Durant has left Oklahoma City to form a super team in the Golden State. What's the modern day equivalent to the molasses flood? Donald Trump's presidential candidacy perhaps. Both certainly created enormous messes to deal with....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 20, 2016","May 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2830067-the-given-day

The narrator is the product of a French father and Vietnamese mother. As an adult after being schooled in America he becomes a spy, towing the line between identity as a Capitalist American and a Communist who will never spiritually leave his homeland. He is both unfeeling and remorseful, a sensitive soul and a cold blooded killer, a loyal friend and a lone wolf, the conqueror and the conquered, Western and Eastern, Caucasian and Asian. While these ideas are interesting to examine and they are explored with beautiful command of language, this was not a book that generated much emotional attachment. My favorite types of novels are those that wrestle with ideas while also providing characters who we relate to and care for, so that as the writer places them in various situations such as falling in love or being betrayed or finding themselves in mortal danger, we readers are caught up in the moments because in reading these stories we are temporarily living vicariously through the the protagonists. With The Sympathizer there was an emotional distance between what was happening to the narrator and my reaction to it. I don't know for certain but suspect that having all of us connect to him is not the author's prime objective. The narrator is primarily a vehicle through which Viet Thanh Nguyen drives home his points about what is worth living for rather than dying for. It features a twist that you may or may not find shocking, but this is not so much a book of plot (aka what happens) than of philosophy (aka why it happens and if the reason even matters). A novel I would compare it to in tone and beyond is Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. Both are masterfully written. Both give us plenty to mentally chew on. I recently read another spy novel, American Spy by Lauren Wilkinson. Wilkinson is less poetic and inventive and playful with tongue in or out of cheek metaphors than Viet Thanh Nguyen, and while I enjoyed her debut novel, a main complaint I had about American Spy is that it was too uneventful for what I wanted from a spy story. Perhaps I'm spoiled by James Bond movies and so expected wall to wall action. The Sympathizer delivers more than American Spy in that regards, particularly in the closing section which features the best written torture scene I can recall since reading William Goldman's magnificent Marathon Man years ago. I suppose I should caution readers who steer clear of graphic violence on page that The Sympathizer is probably not the book for them. It is nevertheless a worthy Pulitzer Prize for Fiction winner, putting me one step closer in my quest to read all of them. http://lineaday.blogspot.com/2009/03/......more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 26, 2020","Apr 26, 2020","Apr 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23168277-the-sympathizer

Where there is hope, no matter how cautiously one treads from the past, there is a chance of happiness. But some people cannot or will not move forward, and for them life is a continuous echo of sorrow, an eternity of regret. Those incapable of happiness because old wounds failed to heal will be cruel to those who try to love them. Whether it desires company or solitude, misery consumes whomever is nearest. Regardless of how far one travels, anguish that has been absorbed into the bones cannot be escaped. The Lowland is a story of family, a construct we are told is bonded by blood but actually is held together by love and willingly made sacrifice. It is the story of a woman named Gauri who marries the love of her life, loses the charismatic and impulsive Udayan to political violence, and then marries his younger brother while carrying the child of the man she lost. But even though she is willing to make a new life with Subhash, she never comes to love him or see him as anything beyond the lesser of the two brothers. And since the daughter they raise without revealing her true paternal roots is a potent reminder of the man she lost, she never truly comes to love her daughter as you would expect a mother to. Leaving a country behind does little to erase memories and allow a new chance at happiness to take root. Whether it's in the lowland of Calcutta or a college town in Rhode Island, when a ghost is more real to you than the flesh over bones people in your life, the only possible existence is a haunted one. Someone who cannot love you, regardless of the ties of blood, will always be a stranger rather than family....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"May 04, 2016","Apr 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262100-the-lowland

Is it brilliant satire or biting social commentary delivered with excessively over the top weirdness? I can easily see why one might lean one way or the other. It wasn't until after reading this book that I read the author's bio and learned that he started out as a spoken word poet who launched his career by killing it at Nuyorican Poets Cafe. This came as no surprise given the style of Beatty's prose. Nearly every sentence is a rambling, poetic, rapid fire joke with multiple punch lines delivered. I have never listened to an audio book, only read ink on paper novels. But The Sellout is definitely a novel that seems written to be listened to as much if not more than it was written to be read silently to yourself. The wacky plot involves a black man who was home schooled by his social scientist father, with every lesson being about racial identity. After his father is murdered by cops, the son inherits the family farm along with acquiring settlement money. Not that they live in farm country. Where they live is in a California town that has literally been erased from the map. So in addition to providing his neighbors with incredible fruit, stellar weed, and crisis counseling in times of mental emergencies, the narrator is also on a mission to bring the town back into existence. Or rather, into recognition that it's still there. He is friends with the last living cast member of the Little Rascals, a man named Hominy who voluntarily insists on being the narrator's slave. Yes you read that right, and no I don't have an explanation for motive beyond this book is satirical with every line meant to be taken with a grain of salt. Or perhaps a boulder of salt. In addition to being a slave owner, the narrator also decides to attempt to bring racial segregation back to their town one location at a time, starting with a city bus. If what I'm describing sounds bizarre, you've got the right idea. Beatty hits readers with every cultural reference under the sun along the way. The Sellout seemed to me less of a story than someone showing off how witty he can be on the topic of our national obsession with race. There is a bit of a romantic subplot involving the driver of the aforementioned bus that's barely worth mentioning, except to make it clear in this  that while throwing everything out there, Beatty did not forget the kitchen sink. I enjoyed this book, yet reached a point where I was mainly reading to accomplish the feat of finishing what had been started. I suppose I personally prefer my satire in shorter doses. I suppose that as much as I love expertly delivered, thought provoking spoken word poetry, I look forward to a different form of artistic experience when reading a novel. I'm going to round up from the 3.5 stars that goodreads won't allow me to give and select 4 stars as my rating while fully appreciating why it would be a 5 star read to others, and why awards such as the Man Booker Prize would be bestowed upon it. I don't know if I'll read another Paul Beatty book, but I'd love to listen to him read from his work or just hear him talk about whatever comes to mind....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Jan 2018,Jan 2018,"Mar 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22237161-the-sellout

If you had only given me some hint, if you had only broken your word with me a couple of times, if you had been bad-tempered or impatient with me---if you had been a lesser man, maybe I could have taken what I saw you doing. If once or twice you'd let me catch you doing something vile, then I would have understood yesterday. Then I'd have said that's just His Way, that's My Old Man, because I'd have been prepared for it somewhere along the line.""The words above are spoken to Atticus by his daughter Scout towards the end of Go Set a Watchman. They basically sum up the entire book. As you may already know, or in case you didn't until landing upon this , Go Set a Watchman features many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird quite a few years later. Jean Louise (aka Scout) is now a grown woman contemplating marriage to Henry, whom she has known since childhood. Henry has remained in their hometown of Maycomb, Alabama and followed the footsteps of Atticus into the law profession. If Scout wishes to marry a father figure, she's all set. Yet apparently she wants more out of life than Maycomb has to offer, because she now lives in New York City, which is about as different from the small southern town she grew up in as a planet in another galaxy. Maycomb holds many ties on her though. The narrative of Go Set a Watchman takes place during a visit to the place where her identity was formed in the earliest of her 26 years.Much has changed in America from the years that Mockingbird takes place in to the 1950's setting of Go Set a Watchman. A considerable amount of the change has to do with race relations. People who were once blatant bigots continue to be so. Some things never change. But those who were closet bigots with enough good manners not to let it show in polite society now feel free to express hostility openly. Turns out they were only able to give the appearance of open minded respect for their fellow man when scales of opportunity were tilted heavily in their favor. As the scales became more balanced, the truth beneath southern hospitality was revealed. Count Henry and even our hero Atticus among those in Maycomb more willing to hear out the KKK than the NAACP. Changing times to them means time to put up a more aggressive fight against progress.Amazingly Scout has been clueless about her father's true social/political views until he is about 70 years old. Once she is finally in the know, of course she feels betrayed. Her father was a lie. Her childhood was a lie. Her life has been a giant deception and she must get through the devastation and figure out how to come to terms with this.I did not like Go Set a Watchman much. Not enough happening in the plot (no cool subplot like the one Boo Radley presented in Mockingbird). Too many long speeches that did not ring true to how people speak off the page of a novel. A domestic violence scene (I realize this was a far different time than 2016 but still) that was jarring and felt unnecessary and plain weird to me. Last but not least, I just didn't buy that it would take an intelligent woman so long to obtain an inkling of how the people closest to her feel about topics of such importance to her. It's not as if anybody was trying to hide anything from her. But somehow she only saw nobility in her father without catching a whiff of the stench of the rotten core that lay beneath his principles. Those of us who read To Kill a Mockingbird and/or saw the movie adaptation were also duped. This isn't the Atticus we thought we knew. How had that guy actually been this guy all along? Did we not read the book closely enough, all subtext going over our head? Or was Atticus given a complete personality transplant, which means not only did Atticus betray Scout, but Harper Lee betrayed us?I could choose to contemplate Watchman in a vacuum, pretending I have no awareness of Mockingbird, that I'm meeting these characters and examining their motives for the very first time. If I do, I don't think it changes my opinions much. I still see the same flaws regarding lack of an attention holding plot, too many wandering speeches, etc. Sense of betrayal would be lessened, but I would still find it odd that it took Scout so long to finally wander into a room and learn what type of people she has been surrounded by her entire life. Maybe that last part is unfair of me. After all, I know a thing or two about racist views remaining undetectable for a long period of time until the right situation brings them out from hiding. I've known parents who showed no overt sign of bigotry until their child became romantically involved with someone of another race. Prior to then, from their words and deeds and even choice of friends, few if any clues of intolerance were given. There are things we don't know about those who are closest to us. There are things we don't yet know about ourselves because the circumstances to unearth them still lay in the future. There are cowards who believe they are brave, timid people who don't realize their potential to be adventurers, and friends who do not yet know that they consider you to be their enemy. Unintentional deception is an intriguing premise for a novel. I don't feel that Go Set a Watchman examined it particularly well, but merely brushed up against the surface. I suppose that's why Lee's editor advised her to put Watchman aside and craft a new book based on an incident referenced in it. Turns out that was a fantastic piece of advice. Basically, Go Set a Watchman is originally the first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird. But it ended up being published several decades later as a sequel to the far superior Mockingbird. I suppose it can be said that the beloved Atticus Finch of the time tested Mockingbird is simply too good to be true. Maybe Atticus of Watchman is the more realistic depiction of a flesh and blood man, because the fact that he is a hypocrite is made plain. For those of us who grew up as big fans of Mockingbird and admirers of Atticus, the shattering of illusions goes down hard. http://lineaday.blogspot.com/2015/07/......more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 18, 2016","Apr 09, 2016","Mar 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24817626-go-set-a-watchman

This book was headed towards a 4-star  due to its infectious page turner style of prose that will be mistaken by no one for literary flair. Strictly meat and potatoes. This writing style effectively accomplishes the goal of all mystery books which is to make readers extremely curious about who dunnit and why they dunnit. As I have found to be the case with quite a few mysteries, the grande finale portion where all/most gets solved and the culprits are revealed was a bit underwhelming. Hence I settled on 3-1/2 stars, but GoodReads/Amazon won't give us a half star option for some incomprehensible reason, so 3 stars it is. The explanation section at the end of Just One Look is so choppy and convoluted and hole punched that I stopped caring halfway through it. In other words, I raced to the end only to find myself somewhat dissatisfied by the destination. Nevertheless, I will be sure to give another Harlan Coben book a shot because he is excellent at leaving a trail of crumbs for readers to eagerly devour, and that's what we read mystery novels for - the thrill of the blind chase. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 21, 2015","Sep 02, 2015","Aug 21, 2015",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/85418.Just_One_Look

And then there are those that one needs to be young to fully appreciate, it seems. If discovered too late in life, those in the latter category will fail to impress. I'm putting A Wrinkle in Time in that latter group. A lofty reputation preceded but when I finally got around to reading it, I simply failed to see what all the fuss is about. Yet if my theory is accurate then my daughter, who it was read aloud to, would have enjoyed it considerably more than I did. She didn't. We were both underwhelmed, though we were in agreement that it got better as it went along and we became used to the space age setting. I am dazzled by the best of science fiction because of the level of imagination required to create a new world from scratch. I would not call A Wrinkle in Time science fiction at its best. I'll stick with writers such as Philip K. Dick for that. I feel kind of bad almost that I didn't enjoy this book more than I did because I know it's such a beloved classic. A great many readers will enthusiastically recommend it to you. Take them up on it.

The plot is deceptively simple, though the narrative is laid out in intricate and inventive fashion. A young German orphan boy is handy at mechanical fidgeting, including the self taught ability to fix just about any radio and pick up whatever transmissions are able to reach him. One such transmission that gets to Werner and his sister Jutta comes from France, sent by the great uncle of a blind girl that it is his destiny to one day meet. A great deal takes place between Werner hearing the broadcasts of Marie-Laure's great uncle and finally crossing paths with her. That great deal is World War II. Due to his talent, Werner lands in an academy that trains German boys to become German soldiers. Since the alternative is working in the mines, and since the school is a much more likely place for his abilities to be expanded and lead him to a better life than would unthinking manual labor, the school seems to be a superior path for Werner, allowing him to escape the standard trajectory for someone raised in an orphanage. Even though it means leaving his sister behind. But when your country is waging a war against the world that it is destined to lose, there is no straightforward path to success and happiness, only orders to put on a uniform, pick up a weapon, and fight for Hitler's warped vision. As for Marie-Laure, who is taught to handle herself in perpetual darkness as well as can be done by her doting father, she ends up in the home of her great uncle and his top secret radio transmitter in a small French town on the sea. Eventually she is separated from her father when he is taken prisoner, but left behind with her is an invaluable gift, a rare gem removed from the museum he worked in to keep it safe from treasure seeking Nazis. There is one in particular who is determined to find it, though not so much for its monetary worth as for its rumored magical properties. It is a gift that Marie-Laure is unaware is in her possession until finally figuring out clues sent by her father that lead to its discovery. The book's point of view jumps back and forth, largely between Werner and Marie-Laure, but several other significant characters get turns as well. Sequences are not entirely in chronological order. Although the narrative mostly marches forward, it also hops back or ahead without warning in a fashion that somehow manages not to be disorienting. The chapters are quite short, typically no more than five pages. I found this to be an appealing literary tactic that resulted in particularly easy reading. That plus Anthony Doerr's wonderful style of prose and the riveting story line. I could say more, a lot more, about this special novel. But I won't, as I don't want to let slip any spoilers and do not believe that I can adequately sum up with my humble words what Doerr constructs for readers with his majestic ones. Instead I end this  here by urging you to read All the Light We Cannot See.

Much of it takes place in Jamaica where perhaps you have visitThere is A LOT going on in this novel that I admittedly found to be a challenging read. Much of it takes place in Jamaica where perhaps you have visited on vacation, but this is certainly no ""beach read"". It is told from the vantage point of multiple characters, each of them telling their own story, each of the stories related to the build up to a failed attempt on the life of Bob Marley and the aftermath. It took quite a while for me to get through this book, and I confess to considering stopping once or twice. The use of Jamaican dialect for many of the characters was a small part of the challenge. A bigger part were the chapters (fortunately not too many of them) written in stream of consciousness never ending sentence format. Yet even as I struggled to keep my reading momentum going, there was something gripping about the narrative that had me hooked. The book eventually leaves Jamaica behind and moves to New York during the enchanting crack epidemic years. I found the latter portion easier reading, perhaps because I grew up in the Bronx and have familiarity with the setting. Before coming to the Bronx I lived on a Caribbean island, not Jamaica but St. Thomas. And of course I'm a huge Bob Marley fan because I can't understand how anyone could not be. So there are quite a few elements to this story that had me looking forward to reading it, and even though it was a tougher than anticipated read, I'm glad I stuck with it because Marlon James' talent is undeniable. Every one of the characters rings true during their moments as the focus of the story. The style in which it is written, feeling like a long series of somewhat connected scenes, almost like a short story collection rather than a novel, was an author choice that I know impressed some people (since it won a Booker Award) but probably put off a fair number of readers as well. This is not a book that you casually invest some time in. It's a major literary commitment with a generous pay off. Reading much of it while listening to Bob Marley's music is not a requirement, just my personal recommendation....more",Notes are private!,0,10,2,"Aug 19, 2018May 17, 2018","Aug 19, 2018Aug 19, 2018","Mar 18, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20893314-a-brief-history-of-seven-killings

Her prose is a lullaby, taking its sweet time drawing us into the lives of the characters who populate Ghana Must Go. The narrative flits among members of a fractured family, each of them nursing their specific heartaches. What they share along with the ties of blood is abandonment, which leads to separate paths. A return to Africa to bid farewell to the man who left them is what brings them back together. Along the way we learn their secrets and sources of pain. Scattered moments throughout their lives fit together to form the image of a family, one that has been broken, but not irreparably.

The title character is put through a hell that the most evil of people would not wish upon their greatest enemy. What somehow fails to kill Ruby does manage to annihilate her spirit and make her incapable of respecting, much less loving herself. If you can't self love then another person has little chance of earning it. But despite the many horrors witnessed and cruelties visited upon Ruby, she has just enough strength to care for her spiritual children while living a shell of a life perched on the edge of madness. And this keeps her going. Her body is used and abused at the whim of men who take advantage because there is no resistance. But one man is different - a man whose love for Ruby gets him to stand up for her and himself rather than mutely accepting what is handed to him. Ephram shows Ruby that in spite of all that has been done to her and by her, she can still be viewed with tenderness, adoration even. But the world is harsh, atrocities abundant, the devil ever present, people judgmental when not being indifferent. So love is not a big enough miracle to save Ruby. Sometimes the only person who can save you is the one found in the mirror. This is not a gentle read, but it is a fantastic one....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Mar 18, 2016","Feb 11, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24902492-ruby

Is he black, is he white? The box you decide to put a person into upon introduction, the label you instantly apply to their existence, shapes the dynamics of the relationship you will have with them. If you're not sure of which box to go with, which label to use, then what is there to guide your first impression? If you're not sure what someone else is, how do you go about being yourself around them? We live in an identity obsessed culture. What are you? Who am I? We are comforted when we can tell at a glance whether someone is a star bellied sneetch or a starless sneetch. But when the truth about someone cannot be discerned by a glance at them, then either they need to forcefully declare what they identity as being, or else we'll do it for them. Loving Day is filled with indelible characters; a line-up of humorous situations; an entertaining blend of reality and unreality; a considerable amount of wry, insightful prose; great compassion; and a handful of ghosts. It is about figuring out that regardless of how clearly our stars can be recognized (thanks for helping me out with this , Dr. Seuss), it doesn't change the fact that we're all just people put here to find other people to love.

Labyrinth also had me struggling to remember my high school and freshman year of college French lessons, for whatever that's worth. The narrative provides readers with two stories to follow (somewhat similar to Raymond Khoury's The Templar Salvation), one taking place in the present and the other in the distant past, the two racing to reach a point where they will merge. There are a considerable number of characters to keep track of (perhaps a couple too many for my taste) with prime spots going to women. So I suppose this is the most feminist of the grail chase books I've read to date. It won't be the last, as I simply can't get enough of them.

My wife was a fan from childhood but I had never heard of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle before. Apparently the first one I read was written back in the 50's by Betty MacDonald whereas this one is comprised of a previously unpublished story and ideas for others that were found by her daughter. The story outlines were fleshed out into new installments in the franchise. My 8 year old, being way smarter than me, immediately picked up the more contemporary feel of this book. And as it turns out, we both liked this one better (perhaps because of the modernity, perhaps for some other reason that is a credit to Anne MacDonald Canham) than the truly authentic Mrs. Piggle book previously read. There was only one story (the one about a kid too cautious to attempt anything - from something legitimately intimidating like a climbing a tree to merely playing basketball with friends) that we found to be a total dud. Other than that we were charmed throughout. The concept of a woman with magical cures for annoying childhood behavior and vices is a timeless winner, so I can see why these books (originals and new entries) charm multiple generations of readers....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 20, 2014","Oct 20, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1025319.Happy_Birthday_Mrs_Piggle_Wiggle

It features an ambitious African American girl who sets no limitations on her future. Those ambitions are not superficial things like being a movie star or pop star, or hoping to marry her favorite movie/pop star. Not only does she have serious entrepreneurial aspirations but also practical plans for how to begin moving towards them. It starts with becoming President of her grade at school. Enter a conniving rival who is willing to stoop as low as necessary to throw a monkey wrench in these plans. Enter an ally who encourages her to put ambition ahead of ethics. Eventually Brianna learns that ambition is as noble as the path one takes to to make their dreams come true. If success comes at the expense of losing loyal friends and losing respect for yourself, can it be considered true success? Brianna Justice's attitude towards education is refreshing. Learning is promoted as interesting and fun rather than imposed drudgery. This is a girl with a good head on her shoulders and eyes firmly set on the prize. I applaud the messages of this story but feel that the execution could have been a little tighter. There was also one too many easily found ""deep dark secrets"" lying around for convenient plot machination. I'm not the intended audience of this book though. My 8 year old daughter loved it from beginning to end.

A major key to his success is that if you strip away all of the spooky supernatural stuff, you'll find well developed characters who are easy to relate to, expert pacing, and no shortage of intriguing background stories and subplots. The inhuman demons who torment his protagonists may be what King's faithful readers come for, but the terror only works if those being terrorized are likable, and their behavior plausible. That's why it's easy enough for King to take breathers from the creepy and crawly to pen equally engaging stories set completely in our real world. But when he's ready to return to the darkness that resides in his mind, nobody does it better, and nobody can keep up with his pace.

I place movie adaptatioThis is my favorite of the Nick Hornby books I have read so far, which is not to say I found it to be the best of his stories. I place movie adaptations of other Hornby books which I have not yet read higher up on my preference list of Hornby tales. To date there has been no cross over of those two lists. I've seen and greatly enjoyed High Fidelity, About a Boy, and Fever Pitch but I've read none of those novels. I've read How to be Good, A Long Way Down, and Juliet, Naked. Movies have been made of A Long Way Down and of Juliet, Naked - so once I get around to watching either one I'll be able to compare a Hornby novel to its movie adaptation. Nick Hornby likes to write about things that people are passionate about to the point of it being border line unhealthy. The obsession could be sports, perhaps a particular team. Or it could be music, perhaps a particular band or solo artist. Juliet, Naked falls into that second category. It tells us the story of a man who is fanatical about a singer/songwriter named Tucker Crowe who has not released an album in 20 years. The last album Tucker released is a musical holy grail to Duncan. He devotes countless hours sharing conspiracy theories about the singer's life and music with fellow Tucker Crowe devotees on the internet. Duncan's long time girlfriend appreciates Tucker's music as well, but she is more or less just going along for Duncan's singular focus ride. Duncan and Annie are not especially passionate about each other though, and this has been the case since the beginning of their relationship rather than the result of affection dwindling over the ravages of time. They got together because in the small town that they live in, they made more sense together than being with anyone else. Over the course of this book Tucker transitions from being a distant object of idolatry to a person that Annie corresponds with via email, and eventually, a flesh and blood person in their actual lives. Duncan has never had feelings for Annie comparable to his intensity of emotional reaction to Tucker's music. Nothing personal against Annie, as Duncan doesn't seem capable of feeling strongly towards anyone. By the story's end, Annie is perhaps finally ready to form a romantic relationship based on desire rather than convenience of location. As for Tucker, he thinks primarily about himself and the mess he has made of his life while also managing to be a decent father to his youngest child. Towards the end of the Juliet, Naked Tucker reflects that a considerable amount of significant events have taken place in a relatively short amount of time, yet he feels mostly unchanged by them. Likewise, I felt unchanged by this book despite being charmed by it. My favorite reads are of course the ones that cause you to divide your life into the period before you read it, and the period after. Transformative novels. Juliet, Naked wasn't one of those for me. But it was certainly an enjoyable and interesting read. Hornby has a very easy to ready style of prose, and he comes up with stories that Hollywood seems to find tailor made to be converted into movies. Whether you're first introduced to them on screen or on page, his characters think about themselves and about others and about their circumstances and their personal obsessions in very entertaining fashion. It doesn't much matter what does or does not take place during your visit with characters in a Nick Hornby novel. You always find yourself glad you stopped by....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 18, 2014","Aug 06, 2014","Apr 09, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6224826-juliet-naked

The Goldfinch is a deeply satisfying blend of gorgeous literary writing with a thriller style plot and Charles Dickens-esque range of scope. The protagonist Theo Decker is a character we watch from boyhood to manhood, in peril for much of that time, in possession of a cherished gift. It's a gift (a painting by Carel Fabritius, a Dutch artist I'd never heard of until reading this book) meant for all people who appreciate art and beauty, but it ends up in Theo's hands to secretly protect and preserve. After surviving an explosion in the museum housing The Goldfinch that takes his mother's life, Theo moves through his days recklessly. As a teen in his father's careless charge he immerses himself in drugs. This to some readers may be seen as the weakest part of the book, largely focusing on Theo getting drunk and high a lot, with the critical aspect of it being that this is when he meets his lifetime friend Boris. Despite Boris' corrupting influence Theo manages to make it through days spent largely without adult supervision and arrives at his own adulthood. As a grown man who has managed to secure a comfortable lifestyle with the seemingly non perilous job of selling antique furniture, he is continually drawn to danger. Theo doesn't require drugs and alcohol to figure out ways to put his safety at risk. His mindset is practically suicidal and he finds that he has both an aptitude and appetite for hustling people. We readers care about him more than he seems to care for himself. But Theo is not unloved. He is cared for by those in his inner circle: his best friend Boris, his father figure Hobie who brings him into the antiques business, and Pippa, the girl whom Theo loves from first sight but has no idea what to do about it. Theo protects a masterpiece meant to be displayed on museum walls much as he guards memories of his mother who was taken away far too soon. Memories never have to be surrendered, but eventually we all find ourselves needing to let go of what is holding us back. As this stunning Pulitzer Prize winning novel rushes towards its conclusion we hope that Theo will find a way to keep himself alive in spite of so much danger that he is continually in the middle of, and we root for a fragile work of art to remain protected in spite of the violent, chaotic world swirling around it....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"May 24, 2015","Jun 24, 2015","Jan 27, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

Great story, although too short for my taste, perhaps due to the nature of the format. Word count of even the densest graphic novel will be considerably less than a text-only book. I appreciate the existence and increased popularity of graphic novels largely because my daughter is a rather reluctant reader and the best way to get her to read sometimes is to give her a graphic novel. I've read a few Mat Johnson novels to date so was curious to give this book a shot. It's the story of a black man who can pass for white. He is a reporter from up north who travels down south to report on stories of race based cruelty such as lynchings. Undetected as a black man on account of his light complexion, he is able to get an up close view and speak with the participants, circumstances that wouldn't be allowed if they realized he was an African American reporter. Once back home he writes about these terrible events under a pseudonym. Keeping his true identity hidden to his readers as well as the awful people he writes about allows him to repeatedly go on undercover missions. But he is about done with the whole business, eager to write under his true name and identity rather than continuing to go incognegro, until convinced to go on one last journey into enemy territory. He is convinced to do so because the black man in prison for murder unless somehow rescued or proven innocent happens to be his brother. To avoid venturing into spoiler territory I'll end my synopsis here. I enjoyed this quick read and the accompanying illustrations. There are enough twists and turns in the plot that this could have been written as a thrilling text-only novel as well, and if expanded upon I could see it being adapted into a movie. But I'm here to  what the book is, not what it could have been or could be, and to that end I'll say I'm glad to have made this my inaugural graphic novel....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Jan 24, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2331616.Incognegro

Like the latter, The Ocean at the End of the Lane gives us two worlds (at minimum), the one we're all familiar with and another terrifying one in which anything goes. The invented world is vague and transient and omniscient and nearly omnipotent. There are some guidelines and boundaries it must adhere to though, otherwise it would swallow this one. I think that's a proper translation of what goes on in this novel. Gaiman does an excellent job of putting you into the main character's head, a young boy filled with terror and confusion as the fabric of his comfortable existence unravels. One child's pond is another child's ocean, but when it comes to books I'm of the opinion that you've either written a fine one or you haven't.

It's true that most of the classic fairy tales are Princess-centric. The ""charming"" prince is simply the guy who shows up and saves the day, with ""saving the day"" defined as falling in love with her at first sight and marrying her. In between those two steps he may need to do something daring like conquering a witch or dragon, or something relatively uncomplicated like ending her magical coma with a kiss. The women are slighted, even though they get to be the stars of the stories, because they are depicted as helpless. The men are slighted because even though they're the heroes, the majority of spotlight goes to the rescued damsels in distress. The Hero's Guide to Saving Your Kingdom addresses both of these matters. The story focuses on the guys who show up to save the day, but instead of superheroes we are presented with flawed men who must overcome their fears and ineptitude and lack of expertise. The princesses, although they vacate center stage, are far braver and capable of taking heroic matters into their own hands than the versions of them we've grown accustomed to. I applaud the objectives of this book along with the sense of humor displayed throughout. My main complaint is that I found it to be over-long. This tale would have been stronger had it been a little tighter in my opinion, and that would have made me more eager to tackle part 2.

His father drops out of the picture altogether, which is common enough I suppose. His mother is present but doesn't take much more responsibility for seeing Augusten to adulthood than the dad. Her parental strategy is handing her son over to a substitute home where Augusten finds himself in the ""care"" of his mother's psychiatrist. Dr. Finch (who is married but his wife is in no way a mother figure) doesn't do much to raise Augusten or any of the other minors in his household, just as he doesn't do much for his patients beyond providing medication. Are his methods unorthodox or is he certifiably insane, which makes his occupation ironic and the roles of doctor and patient practically interchangeable? He seems pretty crazy to me, which does not make him stand out from the others who populate this book. How can those under his care not be crazy when there are no rules in place, no structure, no moral compass, no guidance or sense of direction? There is simply a roof overhead and sufficient funds to get the inhabitants of the fun house from one day to the next. I didn't think of it while reading, but I suppose the stories I've read previously that come closest to Running with Scissors in nature are located in Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking books. With no adult supervision it's always playtime and bad choices are guaranteed. Much of the bizarre happenings that take place during Augusten's teen years are amusing. They take place mostly in the home of Dr. Finch or his mother's apartment, school attendance being a non-factor. But just when you've grown accustomed to the wacky Pippi-like tone, the book turns sexually graphic. No details are spared in describing the 14 year old boy's ""relationship"" with a man in his mid-30's, a man who also was ""adopted"" by Dr. Finch so technically they should be siblings rather than lovers. I found it quite jarring whenever the focus was on Augusten's involvement with Bookman, primarily because these sections are surrounded by so much silliness, and because Burrough's does not bother with hints and innuendo in describing their sex life. There is plenty of other inappropriate sex going on throughout the narrative, but much of the rest of it is mentioned casually in passing. Sex whenever with whoever is just another thing to do to alleviate boredom in this story's environment, sometimes resulting in pesky emotional attachment, sometimes not. Running with Scissors is a well written and certainly memorable memoir with an apt title. It ends with an Epilogue that tells us what became of the various people featured in the book. All things considered, life could have gone a lot worse for them.

He writes in somewhat stilted prose, his style academic rather than evocative. Unlike a movie director years later in a world that Solomon never could have imagined, Solomon is not trying with the telling of his life story (or a portion of it anyway) to draw out our tears. He is not attempting with every stroke of the pen to stir up emotions. Solomon Northup is simply telling us like it was - straight no chaser. No need to exaggerate the brutality or the tragedy, no reason to willfully demonize people whose monstrous acts and barbaric attitudes speak for themselves. Is the reader outraged, astounded that people could casually treat others in such a manner? Only if the reader has a soul. Solomon Northup doesn't place his words on page to move us the way his violin playing moved the people who heard it. He is both impartial reporter and the subject of this piece of journalism that required no investigation because it happened to Solomon directly. Years later we may need to remind ourselves that no matter how dramatic the cruelty of stealing people away from their homes and loved ones for profit may be, this is a work of non-fiction, not make believe. Solomon doesn't ask us to feel sorry for him, or to hate his oppressors. What he does is recount what it was like for a man to suddenly find himself in bondage and servitude, endure it for over a decade, and then somewhat miraculously find himself free again with a most amazing and devastating tale to tell. He reveals the truth to us in as unbiased a manner as possible and allows us judge it for ourselves. How did any man ever convince himself that it was okay to treat another this way? How did people ignore the humanity they surely saw in the brethren that they stole from another continent? How was a single one of them able to look in a mirror? Twelve Years a Slave asks these questions but is unable to answer them, nor does it bother to try. Nothing can adequately answer them. The mystery of such heartlessness has not revealed itself over a couple hundred years. This is what our country was founded on, inalienable rights unevenly dispersed with extreme prejudice. This is what America needs to atone for and move forward from. This is the stain that will never fade. Yet quite tellingly, those 12 years are not what made Solomon the extraordinary man that he was. Those 12 years happened to him but did not become him. Otherwise he probably would not have been able to write his book. The past brought us to this present, but it need not define any of us. In even the most suffocating of circumstances, we have the freedom to do that for ourselves....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 06, 2014","May 27, 2014","Oct 15, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/18478222-twelve-years-a-slave

Sam, the hero of DoThis is an excellent debut novel, although the pile up of coincidences at the end made it go out in more of a whimper than a bang. Sam, the hero of Double Feature, is a well developed character who keeps getting in the way of his own happiness. He feels short changed by his parents divorce, by a father he both emulates and is unable to connect with, by the early death of his mother whose only sin was loving an unworthy man, and by the mutilation of his movie directorial debut. As the reader you want Sam to move on, achieve some measure of closure, accept the imperfections of his loved ones, make another movie, get the girl. But for much of the story he is determined to stick with the one thing he has mastered above all - the art of brooding. Enough quirkiness and amusement is scattered about the pages of this novel to prevent Sam's journey from feeling especially somber. The narrative often feels directionless, which may bother some readers but I don't find it to be a negative trait so long as the writing is strong and engaging, and that was the case here. When someone is trying to figure out who they are and what they want to do with the life they've been given, a certain amount of meandering about is inevitable. I was reminded of the movie Garden State, which is a good thing as I'm quite fond of that movie. What they share in common is that we come into the stories at a point when events of great impact on the protagonist have already taken place, an unknown future of vague promise lies ahead, but the moment at hand seems to mostly be about hanging around and waiting, no longer a child but perhaps not quite an adult. In other words, a period of stalling before having to take the full plunge into adulthood. I was also reminded in a more superficial way of one of my favorite movies, Cinema Paradiso. Like that wonderful film, Double Feature is in large part an ode to the movies. Whether it's an intellectual art house film or a campy cult classic or a Hollywood blockbuster with dazzling special effects, we accept the enjoyment that movies have to give us for a couple hours in dark rooms and then we return to the real world. Epiphanies have been reached and loose ends tied up by the time movie end credits roll, unless full closure is kept from us because a sequel is planned. Owen King's writing career is off to a strong start and I'm curious to see what direction it will go in. He comes from a gene pool where longevity and impressive achievement is par for the course. I didn't realize when I picked this book out at the library that Owen King is the son of Stephen King. That makes him the brother of Joe Hill, who unlike Owen changed his last name to put a little distance between himself and their legendary father. Joe Hill writes horror novels as his father is most famous for, whereas Owen King has kicked things off with a fine novel that doesn't particularly remind me of anything written by his better known family members. Owen King is simultaneously following in king sized footsteps by going into the family business, and forging his own unique literary path. Or maybe he writes like his mother Tabitha King, who is yet another author in their family. And I was not surprised to learn when skimming Owen's bio that he is married to an author, because of course he is. I enjoyed Double Feature and look forward to reading whatever Owen King has for us next....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 20, 2013","Oct 04, 2013","Aug 20, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15802120-double-feature

With a book like Snuff, Palahniuk may be the only person who would ever want to write such a thing. It's not for everybody, that's for sure. The stuff of genius never is.

These passages turned off my 7-year old. I found them a tad dry myself, but I'm a stubborn reader and refuse to skip over anything. This wasn't the case so much with the first two Harry Potter installments, but the end of #3 dragged somewhat with considerable explaining dialogue. Still, it's one thing for a book to have an excessively wordy ending, by which point you're fully committed to making it to the finish line. It's another thing to start off in such a manner. Glancing at other s it seems my wife, my daughter and I are not the first ones to find the World Cup scene in Goblet of Fire rather tedious. Eventually it picks up steam.

As for me, I'll probably just watch the movies to see how it all turns out for Harry and company. The onscreen adaptations do a pretty good job of leaving out Rowling's explanatory rambling and cutting to the chase. I hear she's doing some Hogwarts based screenplay writing now. I suppose she has a pretty good idea by this point of what to include on paper to give readers the richest experience, and what is best left on the editing room floor to keep fidgety viewers on the edge of their seats....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 04, 2013","Sep 15, 2013","Jun 04, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6.Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire

Since I'm a suckeThis is one of the many cases where I wish GoodReads had a half star option, in which case I would have given this book 2-1/2 stars. Since I'm a sucker for historical fiction, particularly when the setting is one I'm familiar with, especially when a fictional conspiracy is involved regarding events that really happened, I was quick to pick this book up. The Lincoln Conspiracy contains all of these elements, as it takes places in Washington DC shortly after the assassination of President Lincoln. John Wilkes Booth is the killer, but was he a lone zealot or acting on behalf of others? Timothy O'Brien asks these questions and makes up an answer for us. On the chase is a cop named Temple who walks with a limp that he turns to his advantage by making convenient use of his cane as a weapon on multiple occasions. Abe's wife Mary Todd has a cameo, and one of their sons plays a role in the plot as well. Sojourner Truth is also put to use. But celebrity cameos aside, The Lincoln Conspiracy is basically a cop story with horse chases in place of car chases. Temple finds himself thrust into the middle of a grand scale mystery and is determined to follow through to its resolution, no matter how much opposition is thrown at him. Will he get his man? What do you think? Since the official story we all know in 2013 is that Booth acted alone, presumably Temple is not able to prove and expose what he learns.

I am a fan of Jamaica Kincaid from previous novels so my hopes and expectations were high. Even had they been lowThis book just did not do it for me. I am a fan of Jamaica Kincaid from previous novels so my hopes and expectations were high. Even had they been low, See Now Then still would have fallen short of them. Nothing that I disliked about it is unintentional. It wasn't a case of poor execution. Kincaid wrote this story in the manner that she did with purpose that simply did not appeal to me. The constant repetition of certain words/phrases did little to lull me in. This is a short novel, coming in at under 200 pages. If the repetition was minimized to a more customary amount, the word count of See Now Then probably would not even qualify for novella status. It would have to make due with categorization as a long short story. There is no plot to speak of. Kincaid's goal is not to tell a tale so much as to invoke a mood. The mood is that of hatred. A man hates his wife, his family, his life. We aren't told why specifically, except towards the end when we're informed that the wife was condescending and mean spirited to a waitress. I suppose there is no why. Once you fall out of love with someone and yearn to be with someone else, anyone else, you feel like a prisoner who of course loathes the jailer. But the narrative isn't about the event with the waitress or any other one in particular. It's about a woman being aware that the man she loves does not love her in return, and eventually he does something about it. And it's about the relativity of time, how Now and Then are basically one and the same, a point repeated ad nauseam. We are made aware of the husband's unhappiness from not much after the first sentence - a very long one, as the vast majority of them are, yet another characteristic that I didn't find endearing. The rest of the book serves only to reinforce this point. Gorgeous language can carry a non plot driven story a long way, but I wasn't so swept away by Kincaid's prose that I didn't notice or care that nothing was really happening. Not externally. Not internally. Not at all. I don't care to what degree this or any other novel may be autobiographical. I only care if I was absorbed by the tale, if I came to care about the characters. I was/did not. This is a subjective opinion, as they all are. You may love this book, and if you do, I promise not to hold it against you. :-)...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Mar 09, 2013","Mar 26, 2013","Mar 09, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13538652-see-now-then

That's because it is a book about the Vietnam War from the perspective of dThe Things They Carried is a time capsule filled to the brim with sadness. That's because it is a book about the Vietnam War from the perspective of down-in-the dirt participants rather than orchestrating politicians. That means it's about bonding with your fellow man and then watching him die before your eyes. It's about surviving to tell a jungle tale, not so much the true details of what did and didn't happen, but how it felt to know that the next minute might be your last...or the last for the guy sitting next to you. It's about being steeped in mud and surrounded on all sides by death, some of it brought about by your own hands, most of it something that you're helpless to stop and so are forced to grow familiar with. This powerful work of literature is about the things soldiers carry, physically as well as emotionally, to remind themselves that a world at peace awaits those lucky enough to make it through hell and return to wherever they came from. Not that home will be what it once was, because war permanently alters everything that it does not completely destroy. Tim O'Brien writes beautifully about awful circumstances and tragic events rendered mundane by repetition. His words transport us to a place where too many American men were sent for far too long a period of time to do little more than kill and be killed. A place to hopefully come back from in body but never quite leave behind in mind and tortured dreams. Some soldiers, such as Tim O'Brien, are able to turn haunting memories of a pointless war into an almost poetic story. It is billed as fiction but reads as memoir because it is both and so also neither. Whatever it is, Tim O'Brien committed the words to paper. That is how writers heal themselves. That is how writers educate the rest of us who didn't have to live through it, even if no matter how compelling the prose, it doesn't dissuade politicians from waging the next war at the expense of more wasted lives. This is how soldier poets are able to put down the burdensome things that they carry, so that they will be able to carry on....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 27, 2021","Dec 27, 2021","Jan 08, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/133518.The_Things_They_Carried

I was intrigued by the mystery within a mystery concept of this book. I may have liked it even more if the narrative went back and forth following the two connected storylines, alternating between the present and slave days, only not via time travel the way Octavia Butler wonderfully did it in Kindred. The fact that Attica Locke sticks to a single setting is by no means a flaw, and like Octavia, Attica is also an excellent writer. That said, I can't say that I was blown away by this novel. I was thoroughly sucked in to the story, but emerged from it wishing there had been a little more. A little more of what I'm not quite sure. Plausibility perhaps. Things wrapped themselves up a bit too neatly and swiftly for my liking. My favorite type of mystery is the kind that's solved due to brilliant deductive reasoning rather than things (like drunken confessions) falling into one's lap. I especially like when I'm given the same clues and information as the character(s) trying to solve the crime, so I have at least a fighting chance at figuring it out on my own. Deciphering between misleading and critical details is my favorite part of reading a mystery if the author plays fair. I found The Cutting Season to be no better than average in my personal scale of judging a whodunnit, but the quality of writing and depth of characterization was excellent, so I'll certainly give other books by Attica Locke a shot and I would not hesitate to recommend this one.

It is filled with Mat Johson's trademark humor regardless of the seriousness of topic at hand. The plot revolves around a recently fired African American Literature professor. Why was he fired? Because his primary focus was on examining a novel by Edgar Allan Poe, the only full length novel written by the brilliant but definitely not African American author. The name of the book is The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. I had never heard of Poe's lone novel before reading Johnson's Pym. The narrator studies and teaches this book to his detriment because he believes it holds the key to understanding White-Black race relations. After being fired, the professor and his also unemployed best friend (who has his own obsession with a painter of landscapes, specifically, with finding the precise physical vantage point that each of his paintings are based on) end up on a quest that takes them along with the narrator's cousin and ex-girlfriend and her current husband among others to Antarctica. It is on this frozen terrain that they discover a lost race of creatures representing Whiteness. This means its opposite, a tropical island representing Blackness that Poe also wrote about in his novel, is possibly out there as well. When the world as we know it seemingly comes to an end, the narrator and his motley crew perhaps being the lone survivors of Armageddon only to have become slaves of the primitive creatures in Antarctica, the search is on for whatever paradises (whether man-made or otherwise) may still exist. That's about as well as I can describe Pym's quirky plot.

Harriet is not written as a character. That is, sIt isn't often that you come across a children's book where the author really doesn't pander at all. Harriet is not written as a character. That is, she is not a collection of traits and quirks that readers are sure to find endearing and will transfer nicely to subsequent volumes of a series. Harriet the Spy is a novel that happens to feature a child as lead character, similar to how certain other novels meant for a more mature audience - such as To Kill a Mockingbird to give one example - can also be described. The author Louise Fitzhugh doesn't go to places as dark as Harper Lee or J.D. Salinger, so Harriet the Spy is firmly categorized as children's literature rather than a book one might recommend to adults. But grown folk, particularly parents, will enjoy this book because they know that kids along with being adorable can also be real pains in the ass. They can be selfish. They can be bratty. They can be unreasonable. They can be cruel. In short, they can be a lot like immature adults. Being young, they will have more difficulty coping with a traumatic event like the sudden departure of a loved one than an adult. Not enough life wisdom and experience with disappointment has been amassed yet. A child is more likely to respond by acting out, magnifying their less endearing qualities. Kids start out being quite imaginative but this trait dulls over time until a great many end up as adults who have virtually no imagination. Often imagination is rekindled upon becoming a parent and revisiting that part of one's personality. But a few fortunate people (those who end up becoming writers and other types of artists, for example) retain the ability to sculpt universes with their minds. Harriet is an 11 year old with her powers of imagination still strongly intact even though she's reaching an age where more serious things are supposed to be of concern. Her imagination is enhanced by the power of observation. She is curious about everything and everyone, and she documents all that she sees and feels in an attempt to figure the world out. She is a spy of the human condition, which I suppose is just another way of saying that she's a writer. Since she writes unflinchingly about what and who she knows, this gets her in trouble when her beloved notebook falls into the hands of her peers and they learn of the various uncomplimentary opinions she holds about them. She is ostracized. Even her two closest friends abandon her. Rather than dealing with this in a cutesy manner that you would expect to find in a children's book, Harriet responds with rage and indignation. If everyone is going to hate her, she may as well truly earn their disdain. But she's neither villain nor hero, just a girl who wants to understand and maybe also be understood, and who doesn't plan to change for anyone because she likes herself just fine as is. Kids will relate to Harriet. To them reading this book will be like looking into a mirror and discovering that their fears and insecurities and concerns are not so unique after all. They are what growing up is all about, unequal parts of wonder, delight, heartache and triumph. Harriet is a book character you'll remember because she feels like a flesh and blood person who has figured out at an early age not to try to be like everyone else, or to be liked by everyone. And she has learned that honesty can sometimes be a complex policy. She discovers that it makes the most sense to be yourself (even if that isn't always a particularly simple thing to do) and with any luck things will work out just fine....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 27, 2014","Jun 06, 2014","May 13, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/232576.Harriet_the_Spy

From the cover copy I I had never heard of this book or the author before deciding to give it a shot as bedtime reading for my six year old daughter. From the cover copy I saw it shared traits with books we've read to her so far such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Holes, Half Magic. These books each feature young protagonists and the element of magic. The twist in Penny Dreadful is that by the end we're not certain if magic ever really played a part in what took place or if certain critical events were instead the result of chance. Did Penny wish things into being or did they coincidentally take place shortly after she wished for them? With Penny being such a vague wisher, asking for improved circumstances rather than for something specific to change them with, we can't be 100% sure. The story takes a little while to get going in the eventful sort of manner that children enjoy. I thought my little one might grown impatient with the set-up and ask for another book. But she remained sufficiently intrigued so we kept reading. Once Penny and her parents leave The City and move to the interesting house they have inherited, the narrative picks up steam. In her new home the formerly rich and sheltered Penny learns the value of friendship and using her inner resources to get by in a world where everything is no longer handed to her on a silver platter. Her feisty best friend Luella is the character my daughter was most amused by and related to best. Her pivotal role is basically to introduce Penny to normalcy and childhood experienced the way it ought to be done, with joy and exuberance and curiosity and daring. Before meeting Luella, Penny knows of adventure through books. After, she finds that no adventure is greater than life itself. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 10, 2012",not set,"May 10, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7594284-penny-dreadful

So I'm back to add that this is one fantastic novel that I suggest everyone pick up and read. For starters it's about a missionary who brings his family (wife and their four daughters) to the Congo where he intends to convert as many people on the continent of Africa to Christianity as possible. No matter that he is seen largely as a fool to humor until it no longer suits them. No matter that his family is made miserable by his relentless pursuit. No matter that he puts his supposed loved ones in grave peril. But after a while the story stops being about him and becomes multi-focused narratives of the women who manage to survive his impact on their lives. Some of them leave Africa. Some do not. All of them are brilliantly etched characters who make the pages of this masterful novel breathe with life. In the end it isn't about religious conversion, or family, or Africa, or coming of age, or race relations, or clashes of cultures, or politics, or any of the various topics that are intimately examined. Ultimately the Poisonwood Bible is about what each and every one of us has to do - figuring out how to make the best of the lives we've been given and navigating the chosen and unchosen experiences that inevitably shape our efforts to pursue happiness.

As with A Mercy, Home comes in at an unintimidating page count. But in this novel, in addition to brevity (it can easily be read over the course of a day if you have some spare time) we are also gifted with greater accessibility. Many non-book readers, and non literary fiction readers, steer clear of Toni Morrison because her exquisite use of language does not make for light reading. Her poetic verse can be challenging to those unable/unwilling to sit still and focus. If you have been avoiding her magnificent body of work for these reasons, avoid no more. Home is the book for you. Morrison’s prose, which remains as lush and eloquent as ever, is more straight forward here than in her previous books. Faithful fans will get their fill and I encourage new ones to jump on board. Just don’t expect a leisurely beach read. She has not gone quite that far. A synopsis comes easily, contained in one sentence. A veteran of the Korean War, haunted by blood soaked memories of his time there, returns to his hometown in Georgia to rescue his ailing sister. Along the way, Toni Morrison paints the backdrop of their lives. Cee has spent the majority of hers dependent on the kindness or lack of it displayed by those she encounters via circumstance. Frank comes back to save her life, but in order to claim and do something of worth with it, Cee realizes she must develop her own inner strength. Frank is wrestling too many demons to always reliably be her hero. Much has changed over the course of the years since Frank last set foot in the town where they were raised. Plenty remains more or less the same.

Unfortunately it was considerably less After reading Half Magic I was delighted to learn, as was my daughter, that Edward Eager wrote a sequel to it. Unfortunately it was considerably less charming than the original. I got the feeling that Eager felt pressured (maybe by his publisher, maybe by himself) into writing this book to capitalize on the success of the first one. But he'd already accomplished what he set out to do in Half Magic, so Magic by the Lake feels forced. In the first story the children do not realize initially that they have obtained a magical coin that can make their wishes come true. Therefore the first few wishes are made accidentally. Then there's the fact that the magic is only potent enough to make a wish come half true, causing all manner of trouble until they figure out how best to utilize it. In the sequel it's an entire lake that is magical, with a talking turtle as its representative. The magic is no longer halved. Instead, what the kids wish for needs to be water based. There's a bunch of negotiating with the turtle to establish and re-establish rules for the magic that I found to be needlessly convoluted. In books as in life, magic is difficult to recapture. Once is enough when done right and Half Magic was done just about perfectly. Transporting the magic to a lake was an unnecessary trip. By the end of the story the kids feel they are done with it. I don't blame them. Too much of a good thing can transform it from wondrous to tedious, from exhilarating to a major hassle. This is the message I got from Magic by the Lake, though I'm not sure if Eager intended to make this point by boring his previously captivated audience....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 23, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/295809.Magic_by_the_Lake

But it was not until 2012 that I finally read the book. I've been reading children's books aloud to my daughter at bedtime from practically day one. They have grown in sophistication over the past 5 years but have shared a trait in common. Up until now they have all been short enough to read in a single sitting. I wanted a particularly compelling story to ease her transition from illustration rich books that can be devoured in a few minutes to chapter books read over the course of several nights. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was chosen as the inaugural ""big kid"" read, and it did not disappoint. But it did leave two big questions in its wake. 1) Who enjoyed it more, me or my daughter? 2) What book will be next? Considering the resounding shout of glee from my daughter when we reached the part where Charlie (spoiler alert) finds the golden ticket, I'll give the greater appreciation nod to her. As for what book will be next, you'll be seeing it as one of my ""Currently Reading"" titles here at GoodReads in the very near future. Stay tuned.

Trinidad is as much a chMonique Roffey is a fine writer and her vivid descriptions of Trinidad make readers feel its tropical heat and lush ripeness. Trinidad is as much a character as the setting of The White Woman on the Green Bicycle. Readers are transported to this island (not too far from my birth place of St. Thomas) and observe its shifting political climate over the course of turbulent decades. The struggle for independence from the authority of Europeans is backdrop to the story of a rocky marriage that is up front and center. In the first section, the title character does a great deal of complaining and bemoaning her situation. I found it difficult to like or relate to this miserable woman. Even though her husband is no saint, at first he is the more tolerable of the two. Yes he's an alcoholic and a serial adulterer, one who in his older years does not bother to have mistresses but settles for prostitutes. But we also see decency in his dealings with people and root for his efforts to atone and win back his wife's affections. I don't want to divulge any spoilers so will simply say that after the dramatic conclusion of the first section, we are brought back in time to when the couple first arrives in Trinidad. They are much younger, more vibrant, seemingly deeply in love with each other, more open to giving things a chance. But while the husband is happy to be in Trinidad where he knows he can be far more successful than he would have been in England, his wife sees island life as a temporary necessity to experience, and then to endure. The cause of her unhappiness is the same from beginning to end, and she is honest about it all along. Her husband selfishly and dishonestly leads her to believe throughout the years that he has an exit strategy, that they will eventually be returning home. But in truth he feels that they already are home, and believes or at least hopes that his wife will come around in time. If she does not, his attitude eventually becomes - ""so be it"". Rum and women and professional achievement and growing wealth help him to deal with the aggravation of having a wife who hates where she is yet will not or cannot leave. Time marches on and revolution is in the air. If the Trinidadians achieve the freedom they long for, perhaps the woman on the green bicycle will get what she desires as well. But she is waiting for this outcome to happen, not making it occur by taking action. She does not attempt to change her circumstances but instead suffers them noisily, as well as quietly in letters she writes but does not send to a politician. The book draws to a close as the day of her personal emancipation seemingly draws near, but we know it must be a mirage because we have already learned from the first part of the book which takes place in later years that Trinidad will not let loose of its grip on her fate. Not everybody can enjoy a book that is about someone who holds a little less hope and a little more bitterness with each passing day. By the end, which returns us full circle to the book's beginning, she is relentlessly resigned to her fate. But that doesn't mean her bicycle doesn't have one last ride left in it. This is by no means an uplifting tale, but it is well written and I am happy to have discovered this sad book. If demonstrates the profound truth of the cliche that the grass is always greener. Somewhere a woman sits in her modest apartment in some bustling city on a cold winter's day, staring out the window, wishing she was sipping margaritas in a bathing suit on a tropical island. Somewhere else another woman lives a life of leisure on a provincial island that she would be happy to visit on vacation, but is miserable being there indefinitely because it will never feel like home....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 31, 2012",not set,"Dec 09, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6559778-the-white-woman-on-the-green-bicycle

Only truly special writers can slip readers beneath the skin of a character, make them feel as if they are experiencing the events happening on page first hand. Reading Salvage the Bones one is drawn into the oppressive summer heat of Louisiana; aches with helpless desire; is burdened by a stifling sense of loss; vicariously goes through youthful yearning to be loved, even if only as much as a treasured pet. Prior to the arrival of Hurricane Katrina, the pace of the narrative is slow and steady. We wait for the inevitable devastation to arrive, knowing far more about what is to come than the family we're observing up close. A motherless girl lets the local boys take what they please from her until she meets one that she wants something back from. She is a lone woman in a world of men, and it is through her eyes that we pass idle time waiting, watching, remembering, wishing for what is plain will not be, settling for whatever she is able to grab hold of. This girl does not get placed on a pedestal like her brother's prized dog, but like China she is able to nurture when called upon, ready to fight tooth and nail for survival when necessary.

The Templar Salvation was entertaining as well, but I can't quite give it a ringing endorsement. It reads fast enough as the narrative is essentially one long chase scene. Technically it's two long chase scene, one taking place in the present and the other in the distant past. The smaller portion of this novel that takes place hundreds and hundreds of years ago is the ""hide"" portion of the plot. The more substantial modern portion is the ""seek"". What's being sought? Something biblical/mythical that will shatter the Christian faith and thus humanity, of course. I'm pretty sure that's what was being sought in the first book as well, not to mention some Dan Brown novels. Brown is the superior writer, or so I recall. Much of the prose in The Templar Salvation is borderline amateurish. Forget about exploration of emotions and character development, not that Khoury leaves this entirely out, but it's certainly not his strength. No, his strengths are deluging readers with ancient information in easily digestible fashion and writing action scenes with good guys pitted against bad guys in a deadly struggle, no less than the fate of the world riding on the outcome.

Liquor destroys a marriage that begins with much promise, its grip not loosening on the father until he has been sent off to make a new life for himself. Their son Tick becomes an alcoholic as well, remaining sober for long enough stretches to set up an enviable situation working on the training staff for a NBA team, but repeatedly losing his battle to take things ""one day at a time"" and having to start all over again. His sister, like their mother, is not cursed with alcoholism but with having alcoholics as her closest blood ties. Josie copes with the pain and embarrassment by being away from her family. She has a dream fulfilled job as a scientist who studies her beloved ocean far removed from Ohio where her parents and brother reside, and she is married to a good man who treats her with respect and tenderness. In this setting it seems she has escaped the hurt that her parents and brother must endure. But Josie has self destructive tendencies also. She may not need a drink to make it through the day, but her inability to reach true intimacy with the man who has opened his heart completely to her wreaks its own brand of havoc. To survive their separate yet connected hurts, Josie and her brother and parents need to forgive each other and themselves. In clean and easy to read prose, Martha Southgate shows us that not everybody in this often sad world is strong enough to do that....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 08, 2013","Jan 30, 2013","Sep 20, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11052304-the-taste-of-salt

The writing is basic and the degree of in-depth analysis you'll find between the covers is rather elementary. None of this took away from my enjoyment of Play Like You Mean It. I happen to be a die-hard NY Jets fans so I am the primary audience. But fans of football in general, sports in general, and the motivational process required by a coach in the NFL and beyond will also find this to be a valuable read. If you enjoyed the HBO program Hard Knocks that featured the Jets leading up to their 2010 season, don't walk but run to get a copy of this book. You'll fly through it so quickly you may decide to immediately read it a second time just for the heck of it. Even if you are not a Jets fan I'd think anyone that has heard interviews with or even just brief soundbites from Rex Ryan will find him to be an intriguing figure. Everybody want to have a boss like him, someone who shows such relentless confidence in your abilities that you can't help but fall for his spell and perform at optimum level. His cockiness is contagious because it's built on genuine belief that he has an eye for talent and the ability to get the absolute best out of those who buy into his program. His positive energy would infect anyone but the most cynical of people, and extreme cynics are not the type you want around anyway no matter how talented they may be. Read this book if you're a Jets fan. If you aren't, there's a pretty good chance you will be by the time you reach the last page.

The title of this book serves as partial synopsis. To flesh it out I will add thaSimplicity is a powerful weapon, and often times less truly is more. The title of this book serves as partial synopsis. To flesh it out I will add that Ptolemy Grey is nearly 92 years of age and suffering from dementia that leaves him in a helpless state. He's at the sad stage where he won't even turn off his television or radio which simultaneously play 24/7 because he surely won't remember how to turn them back on. When the grandnephew who visits periodically to check on him is killed and a less good hearted relative replaces him, the final act of Ptolemy's life starts to undergo a transformation. He eventually finds himself with a new roommate who cleans up the pile of filth he lives in without messing with his sacred memories. In fact, his memory and faculties are restored by a doctor's experimental medicine. The medicine is sure to reduce the number of Ptolemy's remaining days but also makes them worth living, allowing him to put his affairs in order, to finish up plans that had been laid to rest, to administer justice as he sees fit, and to remember for awhile what it feels like to love and be loved. This is a beautiful story told by a master craftsman....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 14, 2011","Aug 03, 2011","Mar 01, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7951334-the-last-days-of-ptolemy-grey

Previously I had only seen movies based on his novels, including Gone Baby Gone which is the prequel to this story. His style can easily be lifted from the page and put on to the screen based on Moonlight Mile, so I'm guessing GBG was a pretty faithful adaptation. As crime novels go, Moonlight Mile holds its own with the finest of the genre. The reader likes and can easily relate to Patrick Kenzie as he relentlessly pursues primarily because he has promised to do so. He is tracking down the same person that he found twelve years earlier when she was kidnapped at the age of 4, haunted by the difficult decision he made back then to choose one form of morality over another, no matter the personal cost. His conscience is neither dirty nor clean as result of his choice, and the opportunity to once again find Amanda McCready may provide a chance for redemption that he doesn't necessarily seek, because above all Patrick is a man who keeps the promises he makes. Being true to his word is what absolves him from regret case after case until the day comes when he is done promising to fix the messy mistakes of others....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 04, 2010","Dec 16, 2010","Dec 04, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7853757-moonlight-mile

As with the others I've read by this American treasure of an author, his writing is wry, insightful, sarcastic, timely and thought provoking. Hocus Pocus is written in the form of a fictional memoir put together on various scraps of paper while the protagonist kills time in a prison cell awaiting trial. Of particular concern to Vonnegut in this yarn are issues such as war waged American style; corporations selling out to the highest international bidder as solution for nipping at an overwhelming national debt; what it means to be a have in our society; what it means to be a have not; the role race does and doesn't play in the equation; and some sex thrown in for good measure.

Franzen is a fantastic writer and towards the end of this rambling novel I was absorbed, truly felt I knew and understood the main characters, and found myself caring and hoping for the best. The minuses. I think Franzen could have accomplished just as much with not nearly as much. He gives a great deal of detail about areas that I frankly did not care all that much about. I am marginally interested at best in bird migration patterns and the environmental politics of overpopulation. Even if I found these subjects to be fascinating, when reading a novel I'd still want less data and more story. A good novel is often one that is well researched, but there's sharing information in a way that's interesting and advances the narrative, and then there's oversharing every bit of knowledge acquired on a topic whether critical to plot development or not. Some readers will be strongly tempted to skim certain parts of this novel, and if they do I can't say they'd miss all that much. They certainly wouldn't lose track of the storyline, which considering the bulk and page count of Freedom is relatively straight forward despite not being told in linear fashion. It's the story of a marriage, the two people within it and the loved ones closest to it. The couple has two children, a boy who a considerable portion of the book focuses on, and a girl who is really just a secondary character. Had it been the other way around the story would have been minimally impacted. The most significant person in Walter and Patty's lives is Richard Katz. Walter basically has a guy crush on the college roommate who ends up becoming a rock star, and Patty has romantic/sexual interest that eventually is acted upon. Walter later gets a romantic interest outside of his marriage as well, the much younger Lalitha who works with him and basically lives with him and Patty. Patty is jealous of Lalitha from the get go even though Walter is about as loyal a guy as you can find. Until he gets cheated on, that is. This is just one of many ways that Patty has become increasingly overbearing. Good old Walter trusts both his wife and best friend completely until he finds out that they have betrayed him, which is especially overwhelming since their relationship got started in the first place when Patty didn't screw Walter over by screwing his best friend, though this is due to RICHARD'S restraint, not Patty's. The latter part of Freedom, after Walter finds out about the affair his wife finally allows herself to have along with the rather poor opinions she's held about him throughout their relationship, is by far the book's strongest section and ultimately made it worth reading through to the end. I'm glad that I overrode my impulse to quit on account of waning interest in the lives of rather self absorbed people. Franzen writes about these characters rather than through them, which makes it harder to care about them, particularly when what they're doing and going through is not all that riveting. But he writes so well, I held fast to the belief that if I kept with it, I would eventually be rewarded for my perseverance. And so I was. I know there are people who think more highly of this book than do I because Franzen received much public praise for it. I also know people who gave up on it rather than pushing through, and I see their point of view as well. Hence this mixed . But I tend to give more credit for finishing than starting strong. so Freedom has that going for it. Franzen's prose earns my upmost respect. The ultimate thing a novel should accomplish though is not achieving a certain rating (I went with 4 out of 5 stars in my goodreads rating), but making readers want to read the author's next book. I'm not sure if that will be the case with Franzen based on how hard he needlessly made me fight to make it through this one. There are 3-star reads that made me interested in reading another book by the author more so than this 4-star read did for Jonathan Franzen. But there's no denying that along with turning research notes into not particularly necessary prose, when he gets back to the actual story the guy sure can write....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 12, 2011","Oct 24, 2011","Sep 16, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7905092-freedom

I can't believe it has an average rating of under 3 stars prior to my entering of this . Why do I give it such high praise? I'll tell you why. I challenge anyone out there to provide evidence that their child fights sleep as hard as my daughter. She truly loathes closing her eyes and missing out on all the fun she must imagine she's missing while down for the count, not that she stays down for very long. This book, which is not a story and not really a poem so much as it is a meditation, somehow does the trick of lulling my daughter. She insists that I not read it at night precisely because she knows it makes it that much harder for her to resist sleep. Maybe it only works with my daughter. Perhaps I somehow figured out the perfect way to read it aloud. All I know is that it has repeatedly done the trick. Reading it in just the right tone along with some gentle stroking of her cheek puts her in a near-coma state, and that's precisly what we're shooting for. It's time to sleep, it's time to dream, it's time to purchase a copy of this book because I can only renew it from the library so many times in a row. Thanks so much, David A.

Novels such as Catch-22 or The Invisible Man come to mind. The setting is the past (all clues point to mid 20th century New York), yet since it's a version of the past that differs substantially from reality, it also has a futuristic science fiction feel. The somewhat peculiar premise elevates (pun intended) the elevator to mythical status, its potential literally unlimited, the key to reaching a future that can scarcely be imagined. The alternate universe plot provides us with a thrill ride as the main character (an elevator inspector, first African American woman to attain such an esteemed position) is on the run, trying to prove her good name after apparently being set up to look inept for political reasons, danger lurking at every turn. The imagined politics revolve around one faction that believes the best way to inspect an elevator is by physically examining it, and another that conducts inspections (at a higher success rate) via powers of intuition. If this sounds weird to you that's because it is, and no matter how deeply you may get pulled into the story, it still doesn't really cease to be weird. As with most thrillers, much is not as it first appears to be. Friends turn out be be foes in disguise and those perceived as enemies are not necessarily so. Among the featured cast of characters are ruthless businessmen, ambitious at all costs politicians, university professors and students, and the mob. If you're looking for a novel with action and suspense in it, you'll find a fair share in The Intuitionist. Yet truth be told, the story is neither historical nor science fiction nor action adventure mystery crime noir spy novel. These are merely elements that are used to make a pointed commentary on race in America and our onwards and upwards no matter what culture. Along the way the reader learns plenty of real and fabricated things about elevators and what makes them go. This is a peculiar book, not for everyone, but certainly interesting and compelling while also full of details both personal and technical that keep the narrative at a sure and steady pace rather than racing towards resolution of the mystery. This makes perfect sense since the mystery isn't really the point of the story, just a vehicle used by the author to make his points....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 19, 2010","Jul 31, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16271.The_Intuitionist

He was right. It's quite easy to sum up the message of this story, which is that by the time we reach 40 years old or so, most people are done looking forward and preoccupied with looking back, obsessed with youth which we barely appreciated when it was around because youth is no longer in our possession. I was reminded a little of Nick Hornsby's prose, but perhaps mainly because the characters are British. Towards the end of Dead Long Enough the protagonist makes a vital life altering decision, spurred on by the death of an old friend. In essence he opts to try another way of living rather than continuing a slow but steady march towards dying. I'm not really giving anything away because the ending is revealed within the first few pages, and we read on to find out precisely how/why forecasted events take place. More how than why really, because we know why the characters feel and think and act as they do from the get go. They're no longer young but still wish they were. Their future is no longer limitless and crammed with potential, but there's still plenty of worthwhile living to do, so might as well make moves to make the best of it. The alternative of course is acceptance that it's all quickly downhill from here, and perhaps the downhill part is inevitable but we can at least do a little something about the rate of acceleration.

Not only my reading of this particular book but the entire series. I wished to see the story through to its end and now I have. If this doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement that's because it isn't. As I have noted in s of the first two books, Larsson's writing is not my cup of tea. Every rule that serious writers are told to follow gets ignored. Larsson was the master of telling when he should have been showing. Being that his books are the stuff of genre rather than literary fiction, we're supposed to excuse inelegant prose and dime-a-dozen formulaic elements because in exchange we're getting a pulse quickening plot that has us on the edges of our seats. Perhaps that applies to the first two books, but by this one most of the action packed sequences have already been attended to. When we reach book # 3 we're no longer reading a whodunnit because we already know who did what. The element of danger remains present but is far less pressing than in the earlier installments. What's left is for all of the bad guys to be exposed and punished for their deeds, and for the hero to be vindicated. It takes over 500 pages for Larrson to make that happen. Much of the word count is dedicated to subplots that scarcely impact the main story line. If this had been the first book in the series it would have become a Did Not Finish. Since I had already read the more interesting if not necessarily better written first two books, I was determined to finish it off. And so I did. Looking forward to my next read and I'm happy that it won't be a part 4 of this particular series. To end this  on a positive note I will add that Lisbeth Salander is a pretty cool character.

But he had a knack for creating indelible characters. Lisbeth Salander is a fascinating woman whom readers first meet in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. In The Girl Who Played with Fire we learn about her background, gain insight into the events she managed to survive and thus shaped her into a pint sized dynamo with a knack for overcoming astronomical odds. We're introduced to her evil father and comic book style villain of a half brother. There are also a bunch of secondary characters in this book that seemed barely necessary. Since this is the second part of a trilogy, presumably there is wrapping up of subplots and fuller development of background characters in the final installment.

In this tale he paints the portrait of a middle aged man who has reached an impasse, a proverbial fork in the road of his life. For decades he has attempted to prove that he is not his parents' son, that he is a better person than either of them ever was or had any intention of being. But as Shakespeare once conveyed, he who protests too much probably does so to mask that what he's proclaiming is the opposite of truth, although it's not so much a lie as an attempt to shape reality and identity into a more pleasing form. Those who know us best, faithful spouses and loyal friends and family members who have been around for the long haul, cannot be fooled nearly so easily as we manage to fool ourselves. The past is explored to help us figure out how we got where we're at and determine what changes are needed to get us where we want to be. But the past will not be the same as it once was upon return visit. As our perspective changes, so does the appearance of our experiences. Emotional journeys inevitably travel full circle until we find ourselves back where we began, being who we've always been, who we have little choice of being. If we're lucky, those we abandon to go exploring will await our return while we learn that going back to WHERE we were happiest is not the same as returning to HOW and WHY we were that way.

But children, like adults, can also be judgmental and terribly conformist. In this wonderful book a little girl is ecstatic over the yellow tutu she received as a gift and quite entertained by a whim to wear it on her head, thus transforming her into a flower, a lion, the sun. When her friends mock rather than share in her excitement, she is crushed and confused. Fortunately she finds a like minded peer who is able to appreciate the power of imagination, bringing about the birth of a beautiful friendship. The message in this book is a valuable one. It is a collaboration by sisters, one who wrote the story and the other who provides extraodinary illustrations. One particularly poignant page features a picture of the teary eyed girl so skillfully rendered that it could grace the wall of the finest museum. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"May 10, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6611688-the-yellow-tutu

It may not be for everybody, certainly not for readers This novel by Chester Himes is basically an example of existentialism old school Harlem style. It may not be for everybody, certainly not for readers who want a clear cut answer at the end of their whodunnits, but I'm pretty sure Kafka and Camus would have approved of Blind Man with a Pistol. Who killed the pants-less man, why did that woman kill that guy, is any one person or organization behind the marches that quickly escalate into riots and looting? Questions such as these are asked, most are not answered definitively. Why not? Because Himes isn't really interested in providing a mystery to be solved. His goal is to make the point that most violence is like a blind man with a pistol, without aim, without strategy, without a point. Tragedies happen because people keep butting into each other. It's the way of the world. I especially liked the final chapter which stands apart from the rest of the book while also representing all that came before it. Personally I would have liked a little more cohesion to the plot, at least one case solved by deductive reasoning. That's a main reason one chooses to read a detective novel after all. But Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones are no ordinary detectives, or at least their situation as representatives of the law but also outsiders to it is unique for a crime novel. One could argue that it's actually a sociological and/or philosophical book masquerading as a cops and robbers tale. Coffin and Grave Digger walk the line between white and black worlds and sometimes you may wonder where their loyalty will lie, but the matter is never truly in doubt. They are honest men whose goal is to do their job as permitted to do it, and to keep alive. Sometimes this allows them to catch a few bad guys. Other times the bad guys have too much pull to be troubled much by the lowest guys in the legal totem pole. No matter. There's always another case to work on, another corpse on their beat, another reason why someone has to die, but never a particularly reasonable one. A blind man with a pistol doesn't really aim, he just points and fires and whoever gets hit goes down. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"May 17, 2010","Apr 18, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/359265.Blind_Man_with_a_Pistol

When Lily inherits a house in upstate New York she uses this as an excuse to move there for the summer while working on her obscure dissertation, never mind that the small town's library is insufficient for her needs. Her husband Duncan is an ad man, balancing his eat or be eaten profession with taking the trip upstate once a week to spend weekends with his wife. So they're separated, but not really; married but no longer intimate in any sense of the word; perhaps still in love with each other but neither certain how to express it. The change of scenery brings various quirky characters into their unsettled lives and immediately puts blood on their hands, that of a not so wild boar which turns out to be the town mascot. Duncan has a jeans campaign that he's in charge of as distraction from the state of his marriage, Lily has an unlikely friendship with the local Peeping Tom willing to show her the ropes as diversion, and together the couple find a mystery to literally unearth in the form of a scattered skeleton buried in their garden. But the various odd characters and events that populate this tale mainly function as backdrop to the story of a couple trying to determine if they've reached the end of their road, or merely a slippery turning point.

I'm pretty sure my  will end up a good bit longer than the book itself. I knew that The Giving Tree was a ""loved it"" or ""hated it"" kind of story, and any work of art capable of polarizing people like that intrigues me. My wife is on team Hated It, her sister is on team Loved it. Now that I've read it I'm joining my sister-in-law in the group of devotees, though I certainly understand why it unsettles many people. In fact, although one of my GoodReads shelves is named ""For Children"", and based on length, simplicity and illustration style The Giving Tree should certainly qualify as a children's book, I did not give it the ""For Children"" tag. Why not? Because as much as this book irks many adults, many kids who read it would surely be quite bummed out by it. Why did I enjoy, or perhaps better phrasing would be appreciate the message of this book that bothers so many others? It's all in the translation, that's why. Those who dislike The Giving Tree interpret it as a story of pure selfishness. The tree gives and gives and gives, the recipient greedily takes without gratitude or appreciation or acknowledgment. Many have deduced that Silverstein is making a statement about the role of parents, how their job is to sacrifice everything for their children without concern for their own well being because that is how love is defined. I don't believe that was the intent of Silverstein's story. I don't believe the tree represents parents. As a parent I know full well that I get at least as much out of being a father as I give, my efforts are constantly rewarded, I am by no means a martyr. As I see it the tree represents anyone who gets supreme satisfaction from serving another. You could say a devoutly religious person for example falls into this category, devout to the point of fanaticism, that is. To such individuals, love of God is far more important than love of self. Love of God is seen as being the ultimate expression of love of self. If you live your life to please another and you believe you are constantly succeeding at this goal, just as the giving tree continues to accomplish its goal of making the person he loves happy, then your life is tremendously rewarding. You are pulling off precisely what you have set out to do, and isn't this something that gives people great pleasure? We wouldn't bother to set goals if reaching them did not provide joy. If you get off on self sacrifice then the definition of the word sacrifice changes, because you are in fact getting something out of the relationship rather than strictly giving to it. Readers feel bad for the tree because at no point does the boy who we watch grow to old age ever come to appreciate all that the tree does for him. But the tree does not need to be appreciated, does not care if it is appreciated, does not want to be appreciated. The tree simply wants to serve, it needs to make the boy/man happy and make his life easier due to its efforts, and the tree manages to do just that time and time again. So the tree IS happy according to its own terms/definition, as so is the boy/man as far as we know. We the readers are the only ones (those of us who find the story depressing, that is) who fail to be satisfied, and rather than its failure, that is the brilliance of this strange little tale. Happiness isn't what outsiders decide we should be satisfied with. Happiness is defined by each and every one of us specifically for each of us. Nobody can accurately say that you shouldn't feel content because you have failed to meet THEIR requirements for contentment but HAVE met your own requirements. This is not a typical message for a children's book, but it is an insightful one for readers of all ages....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 15, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/370493.The_Giving_Tree

Larsson's debut novel and its two sequels have topped Best Sellers lists for what feels like forever. As has happened previously to me mega hits such as Harry Potter and The Da Vinci Code, curiosity won out. I was simply incapable of letting the cult phenomenon pass me by. Nobody wants to be the only person at the literary water cooler who hasn't read the book that's dominating the conversation. I was not overwhelmed when finally getting around to reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The character this novel is named after is its strength. Her distinctive personality and outlook set her apart from cookie cutter characters to be found in many genre titles. But the writing was mediocre at best (and I'm being generous here, though perhaps the translation from Swedish to English shares some of the blame) and as for the plot, it's engaging but by no means tremendously original. This is a whodunnit, but the ending is not especially difficult to guess at least partially if not completely. I don't even consider myself a particularly strong follower of clues in mystery novels, but one does not need to be Nostradamus to make accurate predictions here. I'm by no means trashing the book. It's fairly engaging and easy enough to read. But my final verdict is that unlike many other people who picked this book up, I don't feel compelled to read parts 2 & 3.

The author's note at the end explains that it comes from the Alfred, First thing first about this lovely, bittersweet novel is that I love its title. The author's note at the end explains that it comes from the Alfred, Lord Tennyson poem ""Locksley Hall"" which itself was heavily influenced by Arabic poetry written in the sixth century. It's difficult to give a concise synopsis of Let the Great World Spin because it barely has a plot. It's basically a collection of wonderful short stories, and some of the tales end up meeting at an intersection with one or two of the other tales. Every narrative crosses paths, even if in a slight, superficial way, with at least one of the others. But this is not to say that all of them connect to all of the others. One of the sections is based on a true event, something I also came to learn in the author's notes, so I'm glad I decided not to stop at the last line of the story and instead ventured a bit into the book's backmatter. On August 7, 1974, which was nearly one year to the day after construction of them was completed, a man named Phillippe Petit walked a tightrope wire between the World Trade Center towers. I was unfamiliar with this event until getting to the end of Let the Great World Spin. Colum McCann fictionalizes Philippe Petit for a portion of this novel, but the main story line isn't about the daring tightrope walker. Is isn't about any of the people who witness the incredible event, or learn that it's taking place in their fantastical city of New York, or the judge that the daredevil is brought before after making it safely across the wire and into the arms of police officers, or the judge's wife or the woman she ends up becoming close friends with in spite of their significantly different stations in society. Truth is, no story line in particular takes top billing but instead they share it. The book starts out by introducing us to a man named Ciaran but we learn less about him than we do about his brother Corrigan who I initially assumed would be the book's focus. Corrigan is an interesting character, not quite a priest or monk but basically living a lifestyle that appears to be modeled on the modest one of Christ. Except that while we read in the Bible about only one prominent prostitute whom Christ knew well, Corrigan lives among a bunch of them. His home is a tenement apartment in the Bronx that never has a locked door so that his friends can use it as a place of refuge or a quick bathroom break in between tricks. Eventually their pimp figures out that he is not competition or trying to interfere with the street walking business. Corrigan eventually succumbs to temptation of the flesh, though it isn't a proverbial hooker with a heart of gold that he falls for but a widowed woman named Adelita with two young children. The story abruptly leaves Corrigan when he, along with one of the prostitutes he befriends, is killed in a car accident. The narrative then follows the people behind the wheel of the other car for a while. Later it jumps to a woman named Claire who is in mourning for the death of her son in the Vietnam War. Claire meets at alternating homes with a group of other women who have lost sons to the war. One of them is Gloria who ends up adopting the children of Jazzlyn who is the woman killed alongside Corrigan. Jazslyn's mother Tillie is also a prostitute and eventually takes a turn as the focus of the narrative from a prison cell where she is grateful to know her granddaughters may have a way out that she was never able to provide to her daughter. Towards the end of the book we meet the adult Jaslyn who is one of the two little girls who lost their biological mother in the car accident, and as result escape being the next generation of women in the family to make ends meet as a whore. Two people are in the vehicle that clips Corrigan's van from behind on the highway. They are a married couple, both artists. It is a hit and run crime that effectively ends their marriage. While the husband Blaine wants to move on and act like the tragic event he does not believe was his fault ever took place, Lara is consumed by guilt that compels her to reach out to the people whose lives were upturned. In being drawn to the the victims of the crime, she ends up meeting and subsequently falling in love with and marrying Ciaran. I've touched on most if perhaps not quite all of the people who get a turn on center stage as Colum McCann lets his fine novel veer from character to character. Sadness permeates many of the pages. There is plenty of pain and regret to go around. But as their lives crisscross with one another or fail to do so, there is also hope for the promise of a better day. Life arbitrarily keeps and breaks such promises. It can sometimes feel as perilous as walking across a tightrope stretched taut across the top of skyscrapers, and at other times be as wondrously miraculous a thing as falling into the arms of the person you are meant to be with. McCann patches chapter together in a manner similar to the movie Love Actually. Multiple stories take turns grabbing your attention, every so often a connection of some kind is made between them, but in the end you're left with no one story in particular. And you don't mind one bit because you know that your very own life is not a single tale but a patchwork quilt of happenings and occurrences that compose the entirety of you. Colum McCann is a brilliant writer. I look forward to reading more of his writing at some point in the future. But for now I will leave the world of his magnetic prose behind and haphazardly spin to that of another....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 29, 2019","Jul 29, 2019","Dec 11, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

Pretty much everybody in this beautifully written novel is in agony. They are each perpetrators and victims, the tormentors and the ones suffering from a brutal disease. The cycle appears to be endless, but Kenzie is fighting to break the pattern. This novel, which is told from her point of view, is filled with unfathomable cruelty that it seems nobody would be foolish enough to stick around and take. Surely fleeing for their lives is an option. But instead of running from barbaric cruelty they are each running from their own demons. These demons take on liquid form and exist in bottles obtained from bars and liquor stores. The reader pities them for their hopelessness, urges those being bullied to take a hint and act out of self preservation rather than inexplicable loyalty. But neither Kenzie nor her brother nor her mother listen to the reader, or to friends, or to each other, or to concerned strangers such as policemen sometimes called to the scene of the crime. The jaded officers know in advance that their advice will be ignored, for the story is a sadly common one. The thing about a cycle is that it's extremely difficult to locate an exit point. No matter where you are it looks the same. There are glimpses of small hope, moments of grace, occasions that provide a view of genuine happiness, but eventually the moment to suffer comes back around. As long as Kenzie is consumed with understandable hate, she suffers and requires destructive medication to deal with the pain. She cannot escape by running, but rather, by confronting and figuring out how to forgive.

The Prince of Tides was a revelation. Like other Conroy novels suchPat Conroy is an author who has dazzled me with the gift of his prose in the past. The Prince of Tides was a revelation. Like other Conroy novels such as The Great Santini and The Lords of Discipline, The Prince of Tides was adapted into a pretty good movie. With all this in mind I dove into his latest novel, South of Broad, prepared to be floored. But this was not to be. Although the lushness of his prose when describing his beloved South Carolina continues to be on full display (various other setting elements are carried over from his previous writings as well), I did not find myself to be nearly as invested in the characters who populate South of Broad as I was in those brought to life in The Prince of Tides. Rather than feeling I was getting to know new people intimately, which is what the best of fiction does, it seemed to me that Mr. Conroy merely presented a lineup of caricatures this time out. Each of them was a specific type who spoke and acted according to predetermined dictates. The book is full of melodramatic events, and this sentence may be the greatest understatement I’ve ever made. Pretty much every tragedy other than the holocaust happens to these characters. Incestuous rape, abandoned orphans, stalking by pscho killer, flaunting of extramarital affairs in faces of spouses, suicide, AIDS, caught in a hurricane, victim of pedophile priest - you name it, this book has it. And I’d be happy to consider all of this to be a plausible series of events among a small group of friends so long as I did not feel that the majority of them were cardboard cut outs rather than real people. Pat Conroy appears to be going through the motions when it comes to developing these characters, strictly interested in putting them through the roller coaster pace of his plot while paying homage to the beauty of Charleston every few pages. There is a gay male character who perhaps literally is not given a single line of dialogue that is not sexual in nature. We get it, Pat, he’s gay. Gay people talk about more than just the fact that they’re gay, you know. The movie star is a self involved diva from beginning to end, always performing for her friends and for Conroy's readers rather than simply being a human being from time to time. The snob is a snob in all he says and does. How he doesn’t manage to permanently alienate himself from a group of people he considers himself to be far superior to is beyond me. Why he continues hanging out with people he barely finds worthy to wash his car is beyond me. Pat Conroy determined that they will remain in each others lives for the sake of his book's storyline, so they do. The African American characters are noble and overachieving from beginning to end, no flaws evident other than an inability to tell the snob to go screw himself when he says something racist. One of the orphans becomes an upstanding citizen, the other goes crazy for no particular reason to be gleaned other than that at least 50% of those with screwed up childhoods surely will go on to become screwed up adults. The protagonist, Toad, is the one character with some nuance. He is remarkably unemotional and reacts to pretty much everything with a flip comment. His specialty is always having a joke at the ready, delivered with a straight face. His father is a saint, his mother a bitch except for when she’s being a nun, and Toad somehow ends up as a gossip columnist who every now and then reacts to tragedy by being admitted to a mental institution when he can’t come up with a punchline. We see these characters at two points in their lives, when Toad and his friends are in high school, then years later when they go on a rescue mission on behalf of one of them to San Francisco for a couple weeks and then return to the greatest place on earth - South Carolina. Conroy makes it abundantly clear that while the south has its excessive bigotry and rigid class distinctions separating bluebloods from the riffraff, it’s also really really pretty. In between these two points members of the South of Broad cast have married off in pairs, sort of like the TV show Friends. Poor Toad gets the crazy one because it's his lot in life to catch bad breaks. He also lusts after the one who marries the snob for no better reason then that it's her destiny to be Mrs. Snob.I found far too much reader manipulation in this novel for my taste, soap opera / telenovela level writing rather than Masterpiece Theater. Perhaps if I did not come in as such a big fan of The Prince of Tides I would have given it more leeway. I may have cut a little more slack if reading a book by someone I'd never heard of before. But regardless of how I feel about an author’s previous work in the instances when I’ve read it, I can still recognize heavy handedness when I see it. I’m able to notice when an author is taking short cuts to draw emotion rather than carefully building tension. I can spot border line absurd dialogue in place of what feels more natural for people to say. I am capable of detecting paper thin character development when it’s evident. All of these flaws were discovered in South of Broad. Pat Conroy’s sheer talent at constructing sentences got me to keep on pushing through to the end. The novel's final 50 pages or so are the strongest. I think this is because Conroy was just about done with his plot machinations (just a twist or two or three left), so most of the characters are dispensed with, sent to the backdrop of Toad’s life, allowing the reader to spend a little one on one time with him. When he doesn’t have anyone around to make inappropriate wisecracks to, we get an extended peek at Toad’s inner thoughts and he finally starts to become interesting just in time for the book to end. Pat Conroy is an enormous talent, but South of Broad is one of his off days in my humble opinion....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 19, 2010","Oct 08, 2010","Oct 27, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6135237-south-of-broad

The best of his best (Garp, Hotel New Hampshire, Owen Meany, Cider House Rules) are amongst the finest novels ever written in my opinion. This isn't to say that I'm incapable of finding fault in his books. For example, I found Son of the Circus to be disappointing. But John Irving at his worst is more fascinating to read than many writers at their best. An interesting thing about Last Night in Twisted River is that it is in many ways a meditation on his writing career. It's as if he decided to give a gift to faithful readers who have followed him book after book by tossing in as many familiar elements as possible. The more John Irving novels you've read in the past (I've read them all), and the more you happen to know about his personal life which works itself into his books, the more elements/themes you'll instantly recognize. Some examples are bears, farting dogs, wrestling, loss of a child, car accident caused while sexual activity is taking place in one of the vehicles, abortion, New Hampshire, Canada, and a main character being a writer. That character masters his craft at the Iowa Writer's Workshop. One of his books is adapted into a film and wins an Oscar. Sound familiar? Irving seems to be winking at his beloved long time readers throughout this book, giving them liberal dashes of the old while presenting them with the new. Technically the plot is about a man and his son spending the majority of their lives on the run because of an accidental killing and their attempt to cover it up. But what this book is really about is the process of becoming a writer, a process that never stops no matter how many books one has already written. Each book is a new beginning, a new opportunity to learn how to get from beginning to end, even if this means going from end to beginning. It isn't for everyone, the way I feel some of his biggest successes happen to be.

Although I wasn't a Sag Harbor summer kid myself, the author and I are about the same age so much of his reminiscing about his experiences as a 15 year old stirred similar memories I possess. Sag Harbor is a work of fiction, not a memoir, but it reads as much like the latter than as a novel, and no doubt it was largely inspired by the author's youthful days. Not a whole lot happens in Sag Harbor, basically a group of teenagers kill the abundance of time they have on hand, and I know plenty of readers would have a problem with this. I certainly wouldn't have minded if the story had been more eventful. After all, if you're writing a memoir about a period of time when nothing particularly earth shattering took place but it nonetheless was vivid in your thoughts because it was a critical period of your life, then you need to be true to what did and didn't happen. But if you're writing a novel, certainly you can feel free to throw in a little drama. Whitehead resists this temptation and simply gives us a first person tale about an introspective person on a summer vacation somewhere roughly in between the end of his childhood and beginning of his manhood. What does Benji think about as he makes his transition to becoming Ben? For the most part he reflects on his days up to that point for he knows they will soon be coming to an end, and he wonders what the future will hold for him. He holds memories that are both crystal clear and cloudy.

It shows us events through the lens of multiple characters, some repeatedly visited, others glimpsed just once or twice. A man named J. Sutter is the one most frequently observed, so I suppose he is technically the main character. But the true MC is a particular weekend in a particular town where an event possibly took place many years earlier, featuring a person who possibly existed. The event was a man defeating a machine at the feat of drilling a tunnel through mountain to allow the continuation of train tracks. The man of course, is John Henry. He is the stuff of legend regardless of whether he was ever one of flesh and blood, so a stamp has been created to commemorate him and a festival is taking place to mark the occasion. Colson Whitehead approaches this weekend from a wide variety of angles. Among the people involved in the build-up is a man researching the origins of a song written about John Henry, a man who collects railroad stamps, a woman who owns a hotel in the town where the festival is taking place, a man so obsessed with John Henry that he turned his home into a museum dedicated to him, that man's daughter, a journalist covering the events of the weekend, and John Henry himself. Hints are given throughout the book that just as the famous race ended in foretold tragedy, so will the commemoration. Whitehead has a beautiful way with words. If you're looking for a character driven novel where you'll deeply identify with and care for the protagonist, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a traditional beginning, middle, end style story rather than one which jumps back and forth in time and place, go find another book. But if you're interested in a distinctive approach to examination of a symbolic event, one that will be timely so long as people either resist, embrace, take advantage of, or become victims to the changes brought about by the march of progress, then I point you in the direction of John Henry Days. John took a last stand for human determination before it was replaced by mindless but more efficient machinery. Win or lose, his effort was in vain. He may as well have been battling death. We can postpone arrival of the Grim Reaper, but inevitably his date of arrival will be reached. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 24, 2011","Dec 30, 2011","Aug 12, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16276.John_Henry_Days

Obama recently stated that American kids spend too little time in school, putting them at a disadvantage with other students around the globe. This is a debatable statement since while it is true that kids in many other countries have more school days, it's not true they all spend more time in school. But it is valid to say that in the United States there are many examples of gains when time is added to the school day, and as result, many schools are going beyond the traditional summer school model in which schools give remedial help to kids who flunked or fell behind. Summer is a crucial time for kids, especially poorer kids, because poverty is linked to various problems that interfere with learning. No Child Left Behind? The True Story of a Teacher’s Quest by Elizabeth Blake is a memoir about a woman who for 3 difficult years taught in a school district with focus on education for “at risk” students. As a small town, middle aged white woman, to a degree it is a fish out of water story. Mrs. Blake is not from the world inhabited by the students she tries with varying degrees of success to teach, but she takes the plunge and gives a laudable effort. The cover copy led me to believe this book would be comparable to movies I had seen about education in inner city schools such as Lean on me, Stand and Deliver, Dangerous Minds, etc. But that did not really turn out to be the case, because those stories which received Hollywood treatment had a substantial degree of stability to the narratives. They were each focused on a single class, or a single school, and the events to unfold took place over the course of at least a full semester. As viewer you grew attached to the teachers/principals/students because a fair amount of time was vested in them. Due to what struck me as an incredibly ineffective education set-up, Mrs. Blake only gets to be with a particular group of students for 7-week blocks of time. She is just beginning to get to know some of the students in a class when time is up and she must move on to the next one. On top of that, she doesn’t even have the luxury of remaining at a single school. Against her wishes she ends up teaching at no less than 3 schools over the course of 3 years. With such lack of continuity, “No Child Left Behind?” has no opportunity to be a character study with the exception of Mrs. Blake. Rather, this compelling memoir is an observation and indictment of a particular American school district which most likely does not stand alone in its callous inadequacies. We learn a bit about the sampling of students she chooses to zero in on, and some of them are indeed dangerous “bad seeds”. But considering the bizarre ineptitude exhibited by several of her supervisors, people shown to have total disregard not only for the student body but also for the teachers trying in vain to make a difference, and it’s no wonder that a bad situation is set up to only get worse. Mrs. Blake is a determined woman with deep faith in God and conviction in her goal not to abandon the children who need her guidance, but within 3 years she is burned out and understandably leaves the school system behind her. Towards the end she quotes Gandhi: “You may never know what results come from your actions. But if you do nothing, there will be no result.” One wonders if Gandhi himself would have been able to remain in that school district much longer than did Mrs. Blake. She cites the chilling statistics that up to 50% of new teachers will leave the profession within their first five years, estimating that in her school district it was more like 90%. Yet the tone of her memoir is not one of bitterness, but of hope that change will someday come; satisfaction that she did do something to help as many kids succeed as she was somehow able to reach; and gratitude that in the process of affecting their lives they blessed her own....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Sep 29, 2009","Jul 30, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4904412-no-child-left-behind-the-true-story-of-a-teacher-s-quest

For every rule there is an exception, and from time to time there are books I feel compelled to power through rather quickly. Motherless Brooklyn by Jonathan Lethem makes it to that list, in part because it is a mystery and I tend to put the pedal to the metal when it comes to whodunnits. My absolute favorite mystery novels are those that make me insanely curious to learn the solution to the riddle, yet at the same time the who/what/where/when/why and how barely matter. That's because the very best reading experiences are about the journey, not the destination. My favorite mysteries are almost a disappointment when the criminal matter is resolved, because that means the book is over and I no longer get to accompany the protagonist sleuth. Not until/unless they show up in another book to solve the next crime. My all time favorite mysteries are those where the detective is as interesting, or perhaps I should say more so, than the crimes being investigated and criminals to eventually be caught and brought to justice. Sherlock Holmes, Hercules Poirot, Jane Marple, Philip Marlowe, Easy Rawlins, Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones. To that stellar list I'll add Lionel Essrog, and while I suspect that Jonathan Lethem may only feature this character in a single novel rather than giving us multiple appearances in a series, Lionel certainly makes his one book count. Motherless Brooklyn is a wonderful blend of masterful literary fiction and the mystery genre. As with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Motherless Brooklyn features a main character who is more adept at tracking down clues and getting to the bottom of puzzling events than he is at relating to other people in possession of more ordinary, modest minds. Whereas characters such as Sherlock and Hercules make ideal detectives because they are blessed with remarkable gifts of observation and deduction, Lionel Essrog must overcome great obstacles presented by his Tourette's Syndrome. He is a prisoner within his own mind, constantly battling and mostly failing to keep his compulsions under control. Whether it's needing to keep a particular count, or inability to resist touching something, or most of all being unable to rein in his insatiable appetite for exploring language and speaking words real and/or created on the spot in rapid succession - getting from one end to the other of a brief conversation with someone can prove challenging for Lionel. So solving a murder is presented as a Herculean mission. But when the man who showed the most compassion for Lionel is murdered, he is determined to track down Frank Minna's killer. Not that Frank was in any way a saint. He commands a small troop of orphans to do his bidding, $20 bills and bottles of beer and the chance to be somewhere other than an orphanage or school being their reward, so Frank is a far cry from Father Flanagan. The Minna Men are tasked with various legal and illegal enterprises in service of their leader. Frank considers Lionel to be a freak the same as everyone else does. But that doesn't prevent him from having a soft spot in a hard world for Lionel, and this sentiment is repaid with undying loyalty. Lethem does an admirable job at putting us in the head of Lionel, a place unlike any we've been to before. We readers want Lionel to crack the codes put before him and eventually the perplexing case, because like Frank we have grown fond of him. We know that nothing comes easy for Lionel, and that makes us root for him all the harder. Along the way he meets a girl that just may be the one meant for someone like him. Not that the Brooklyn orphan with the Tourettic burdens is all innocence and virtue. His friend has been killed and he will follow the trail wherever it takes him regardless of the perils it leads him to. But this doesn't only mean that he wants answers. It also means that Lionel wants payback. I enjoyed every page of this unique, topsy turvy novel and recommend it to all readers regardless of what types of books you tend to read.

The marriage of Herbie and Noon is made vulnerable by the fact that it is not consummated due to a dark secret in Noon's past. She escapes her demons through church and Herbie does likewise in nightclubs and in the arms of another woman, when she's around and when she'll have him, a woman named Ethel who is everything that his wife is not. Nevertheless Herbie and Noon come to raise two daughters just months apart in age who are left on their doorstep, Fannie as an infant and Liz later on at the age of 5. There are multiple mysteries to unravel from first page to last, many struggles for the family to endure mostly because of the secrets and lies and maintained silences between them. The reader comes to feel strongly for each of the vividly and skillfully etched main characters, rooting for them to find light at the end of their individual tunnels, pulling for them to remain together when fate seems determined to tear their world apart.

You'll feel as if you are walking the streets of Benares or Dehli, tasting the food, experiencing the heat, brushing away the dust, inhaling smoke from the funeral pyres, experiencing the claustrophobia of jam packed train rides, and taking in the vividly detailed sights. The first person narrative comes from the perspective of a journalist who is foreign to India by birth and race, but has been immersed in the culture long enough for it to be ordinary rather than exotic to him. He is not so much stranger in a strange land as an observer who has seen what India offers, recognizes the differences and similarities between his American homeland and the country from where his paychecks are earned, and accepts them with minimal judgement as the ways of the world. Miller's novel is neither plot heavy nor a character study, but rather, a story of place and slow to change times which subtly indicates the fine line between escaping where you are and who you are. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"May 26, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6404931-from-where-the-rivers-come

Spectacular - Fantastic - MasterpiecAll of the overused superlatives you expect to see piled on a Pultizer Prize winner apply to this wondrous novel. Spectacular - Fantastic - Masterpiece. But I'd say the most applicable description that I cannot take credit for is written on the back cover of the edition I own, taken from a  by New York Magazine. It states ""I'm not sure what the exact definition of a 'great American novel' is, but I'm pretty sure that Michael Chabon's sprawling, idiosyncratic, and wrenching new book is one."" Yeah, what that person said is right on the nose. According to Wikipedia, ""The Great American Novel"" is defined as a canonical novel that generally embodies and examines the essence and character of America. Huck Finn and Moby Dick and The Great Gatsby are cited as examples. Despite having been an English Major back in my college days, I've yet to read Moby Dick. Huck and Gatsby fit the bill. If I was to compile my own list of GANs (and perhaps I will at some point), I wonder which books I've read that I would place on it. Whether I chose to list them alphabetically, chronologically from most recently read to those read longest ago, or by some other metric - The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay would land towards the top. This novel is about the immigrant experience, particularly that of Jewish people who came to American shores from Europe to escape Nazi persecution leading up to and during World War II. It is a war novel, meaning that violence and survival instinct and noble pointlessness are on full display during the frozen battlefield portion of the narrative. It is about magic and illusion and escapism of the nature best exemplified by Harry Houdini. One of the more interesting non-fiction books I've read was about Houdini and its subtitle is 'The Making of America's First Superhero'. Harry is mentioned frequently in this book, which is a work of historical fiction so various other well known figures from history are also name dropped or have brief cameos. Speaking of superheroes, the kind to be found on the pages of comic books, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is very much about them, and about the earliest days of the comic book industry. The title has a double meaning since this book is about both the adventures that Kavalier and Clay create, and the adventures that they live. In 2023 we are accustomed to comic book hero industry being fully embraced, with nearly all of the most popular characters having film franchises and plenty of the lesser known ones getting a crack at celluloid stardom as well. A lot of page count is dedicated to the fictional superheroes and sidekicks and arch rivals invented by Joe Kavalier and his cousin Sammy Clay, the most notable being The Escapist. Houdini is the inspiration for this character, and living in the time of Hitler provides the authors and illustrators with no shortage of reality generated villains to enhance comic book style one panel at a time. Furthermore, this novel is a story of family. And it is about marginalized peoples, those who fall into this category because of their religion, or because of their sexual preference. Last but most certainly not least, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is a love story. Two love stories actually - one straight and one gay. Given the time period, the latter is clandestine and ultimately heartbreaking. As for Joe and Rosa, their love is suffocated by Joe's loss of family members during the war, particularly his younger brother who he comes close to rescuing and bringing to America to join him, but comes up tragically short. Joe tries in any way he can think of, including eventually enlisting in the military, to exact some sort of revenge against monumental forces of hate. A result of this, and of Sammy not being able to outwardly embrace the lifestyle he wants and the man he wishes to share it with, is that Sammy is the one who ends up married to Rosa. Her son Tommy, named after Joe's lost brother, grows up not knowing that the mysteriously absent Joe is his true father. Eventually Joe returns to the scene of their fabricated nuclear family in dramatic fashion, with a planned leap from the iconic Empire State Building which happens to be the location of the office of the comic book company where Joe and Sammy worked together. Being artists rather than businessmen, they do not reap the majority of financial reward for the sweat of their labor. That is a tale as old as time and commerce, and another thing that this big, bold, beautiful novel is about is the obsessive creative process. If I thought on it some more I could probably come up with additional things that this book is about. When younger I used to hope that one day I would write THE Great American Novel. I now know that no single book can tell America's full story, but certain ones do manage to tell a great deal of it while also being about specific people living their lives within their particular sets of circumstances. If like myself you are drawn to sprawling stories that take place over a considerable number of years (think Charles Dickens or John Irving), this is one for you. If you are drawn to stories in which spectacular events take place with ordinary day to day as the backdrop (think Let the Great World Spin), this is one for you. If complicated and convoluted and not necessarily 'lived happily ever after Rom Com style' love stories appeal to your sensibilities (in its closing pages I was reminded of my own novel [plug alert] Matters of Convenience), then The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is a book for you.

For 50%+ of the page count the narrative is quite uneventful, a stomach churning journey at sea being as dramatic as it gets. This journey takes the protagonist, a young Irish woman, from the small town she has grown up in and is all she knows to Brooklyn, NY in the early 1950's. Once she arrives in the strange land that is New York City-America, you expect the narrative to pick up steam. Or I did anyway. But it does not. Instead it quietly moves forward via a writing style that is not at all showy, but simple and straight forward and lovely and easy to be carried along by. Just as we're beginning to seriously wonder if anything dramatic is ever going to happen, something does, something that returns Eilis to Ireland for a month. To keep this  spoiler free I won't say what the event is, not that specificity matters all that much here. What matters is that once Eilis is back in her hometown she comes to realize that life contains a handful of vital choices - some that are made for you and some you make for yourself; some that are well thought out over a long period of time and others that are made in an impetuous flash; some which can be easily undone, some that are tortuous to undo, and some that are irrevocable. Each of us is in charge of our own destiny. Each of us is equally subject to the whims of fate, helpless to do anything about it. Eventually we will look back and see this is where THAT phase of life ended, this is where THAT one began a new phase. And we will reflect on the fact that our lives easily could have gone far differently - if only. . Dwelling on what did not come to be will get us nothing except for a solitary trip down memory lane. Whether we decide that we made the right or the wrong choices, choices must be made. If they are not - that's a choice in of itself and also a life unlived. These lessons are masterfully laid out before readers patient enough to see the story through to the end. And I will add that while it does not because it cannot capture all of the complexities of a beautifully written novel, the movie adaptation of Brooklyn is very well done....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 30, 2012",not set,"Mar 26, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4954833-brooklyn

But I’ve gotten ahead of myself (yet more time traveling) as I pen this  about a most wonderful young adult novel – The Time Cavern by Todd A. Fonseca. I typically do not read much fiction geared towards pre-teens and those in their early teenage years, having left that period of my life decades behind. Prior to The Time Cavern I suppose the last book I read that fit this bill was the first Harry Potter book. There was a tiny bit of buzz about Ms. Rowling’s wizardry series (perhaps you’ve heard of it too) so I decided to check out Part I and found it to be an enjoyable read, though it did not inspire me to pick up additional titles in the saga. I appreciate the ultimate achievement of the Harry Potter books beyond making Rowling a gazillionaire and launching a number of movie star careers. Millions of young people in their formative years who may not otherwise have been turned on by reading in a day and age where one’s phone provides as much entertainment as an arcade decided to check out a book (and then another and then another) because tremendous buzz made it a trendy thing to do. No doubt a good many of them moved beyond the Potter books and became lifelong readers, just as the Jules Verne books I read as a grade school kid sparked my addiction to books, not only as a vociferous reader but also as a writer. Young people lucky enough to stumble into The Time Cavern will be similarly affected. In it, a bright, curious, mechanically inclined boy named Aaron moves to a new house in a rural area with his family. Initially he feels like a fish out of water but his acclimation to a new home is sped up when he befriends Jake, a classmate who is not crazy about her real name “Jacqueline” or about being passive and stereotypically “girlish”. She has a spirit nearly as adventurous as Aaron’s, which is a good thing because they soon find themselves on an adventure upon discovery of a century old diary page that eventually leads them to a most extraordinary tree. Throughout the course of this briskly told tale Aaron and Jen become detectives on the trail of a case that is simultaneously ancient and futuristic. Their interest in scholastics, particularly science, serves them well as they unearth clues in a number of inventive ways, including a most ingenious use of a tanning bed. The backdrop to their caper (which also put me in mind of the Dan Brown blockbusters but featuring considerably younger protagonists and minus the violent aspect of adult thrillers) is an Amish community, people who Aaron comes to learn have basically suspended time with their lifestyle choices rather than joining the progressive march of technology. Whether it’s a trip to a cornfield or to a planetarium, each experience throughout the narrative is learned from and the knowledge is used to propel Aaron and Jake’s progress into uncharted territory. Fonseca cleverly intertwines the following of time honored traditions with science fiction elements to generate an enthralling plot that is sure to lure any young reader away from his wii game system. As this book shows, kids today may be considerably different than kids of even just one generation prior, but what kids of all generations and all ages have always been drawn to is the opportunity to embark on a thrilling adventure. The Time Cavern showcases masterful storytelling that will immediately be passed forward to one of my nephews. I highly recommend picking up a copy for the young explorers that you love....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Mar 16, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4541172-the-time-cavern

One of the people following trails both hot and cold is Steven Pengelly, a man wrongfully convicted of murder who gains his freedom after two years of imprisonment when the body of the woman he was supposed to have killed surfaces from the depths of the sea, freshly deceased. Although he has no further need to clear his name, the sister of a woman gone missing convinces him to join her desperate rescue mission. A man who does need redemption is Alec Grimstone, the detective who saw to it that Steven was convicted and now must follow the only path that will lead to a clean conscience, and to the true abductor/killer behind an escalating series of crimes. I will delve no further into the plot, with Ferryman being a mystery that I don't wish to spoil for anyone. Better to pick up a copy for yourself and follow the twists and turns that lead to a villian whose perversity is only matched by the clever measures he takes to maintain his depraved secrets.

The book is populated by colorful characters described in smile to laugh out loud fashion. Two of the three ex-cons are larger than life, so Johnson puts the narrative in the hands of the third since he is the straightest arrow and thus the character readers are most likely to identify with. Snowden ended up in prison basically by unfortunate accident whereas his two colleagues earned their sentences through actions caused by their volatile personalities. One is a brute who operates in brawn over brains fashion, the other an intellectual firebug. The three men start off their new jobs by moving furniture but quickly graduate to creating additional vacancies by killing tenants who are deemed unworthy of the new Harlem they are bringing about. This brings on moral dilemmas for two of the three men, but by then they are in so deep that rather than turning back it makes more sense to keep swimming until they reach the other side, if in fact there is one. Do the ends justify the means when it comes to revitalizing a community? How about when it comes to becoming a Best Selling author? Johnson asks these questions with addictive prose in Hunting in Harlem.

A young man is in the wrong place at the wrong time, and due to his poor decision making on this one ill fated occasion, ends up wrongfully accused of murder and condemned to death row. Set during a time when race relations were strained and tilted heavily in favor of privileged whites at the expense of struggling blacks who were looked down upon (in other words, a time much worse and yet insufficiently different from today), the best that his lawyer can think up as a defense is to compare the defendant to a dumb hog. When this fails to prevent Jefferson from being convicted and sentenced to the electric chair, his godmother calls upon local grade school teacher Grant Wiggins. What she asks of Grant is both simple and seemingly impossible. Jefferson cannot escape an unfair verdict in an unjust world. But instead of pitifully accepting designation as a brute animal, maybe he can find a measure of dignity in his final days, allowing him to take his final steps with head held high like a man. Grant is a cynic and less than a true believer in what we're taught about God and an awaiting Heaven. It takes the bullying of his aunt to make him accept the ultimate teaching assignment. He does his best. Jefferson does his best. Readers may do their best in the end not to cry.

The science fiction aspect is pretty spare for although the concept An excellent novel that wonderfully blends science fiction with literary fiction. The science fiction aspect is pretty spare for although the concept of time travel is critical to the narrative, the author does not go into much detail about it. It simply happens for reasons that are left unexplained physically (Why bother explaining the impossible anyway? Doesn't make it any more plausible) but make sufficient sense for the reader to easily accept. The main character (Dana, a black woman recently wed to a white man in 1976) needs to keep an ancestor (who is white) from dying on a few separate occassions throughout the course of his life in order to sustain the family lineage that will eventually lead to her. She doesn't need to keep Rufus (who she first meets as a boy) alive to a ripe old age, just long enough for him impregnate the woman who will give birth to the earliest relative that Dana was aware of having. The extremely unfortunate thing for Dana is that the time she is repeatedly transported back to is America's period of mass production by slavery. She has no control over when she'll be called back in time. Rufus summons her subconsciously and perhaps consciously as he grows older whenever he is in grave danger. Dana is able to return to 1976 only when her own life is in immediate peril, something that usually but not always is beyond her control. The amount of time she spends on the plantation does not match the length of time that she is whisked away from her real life. Months in the past correspond to the passage of a couple hours in 1976 on one trip. On another trip, two weeks in the present correspond to three months in the past. So the connection is arbitrary, which is fine, for as I said this book isn't really about H.G. Wells style time travel. It's about the kind of time travel that affects all of us, because reality dictates that what happened in the past impacts our present and shapes our future. And as we learn more about our past and discover what had previously been unknown or misunderstood, our present understanding of the world adapts and generates a different future than the one we were previously headed towards.

TheWith Black Betty, Mosley delivers what you'd expect from an Easy Rawlins mystery if you came to it having already read a few others such as I had. The crime to be solved is made to seem convoluted but ultimately turns out to be relatively simple. Yet as with each book in this series it isn't really about the plot. It's about Easy's singular way of seeing and evaluating and dealing with the people he encounters along the way, his perspective on a period of time that seems both long ago and immediate. His character is further fleshed out with each novel, and going along for the ride with him on the particular case he's working on is always a pleasure. If you enjoy the writing of Raymond Chandler you'll probably enjoy that of Walter Mosley and vice versa, only with Mosley you get an added dose of social commentary, not to mention Easy's psychotically entertaining buddy, Mouse....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Feb 22, 2009","Feb 09, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4020066-black-betty

There's a certain clarity to the prose that's considered and well judged - just enough to paint the picture and more than enough to drive along the narrative."" - Khome (UnheardWords.com)Named a 2012 B.R.A.G. Medallion™ HonoreeSynopsis: Tony Johnson is a studious young man planning to soon graduate from much more than high school. Although his zip code places him in a Bronx tenement pre ""rise of Obama"", his sights are set far beyond the trappings of his humble upbringing. Collegiate dreams and falling in love with a white classmate put him strongly at odds with his father. His brother C.J.'s rebellious ways endanger his life on gang ruled streets and the chastity of their sister Tanya is clearly approaching its demise. But it is Tony who incurs the majority of Lionel Johnson's wrath for the sins of ambition, exhibiting color blind love by daring to be with Janet Mitchell, and refusing to bend to his father's will. Seeing unrealized goals reincarnated in the eyes of his eldest son harshly remind Lionel of what once could have been, and of what went wrong. His own childhood in a segregated southern town established a bitter, prejudiced outlook that is the only legacy he has to pass down to his children. When his job and role as primary breadwinner are lost, Lionel's authority quickly erodes and he drowns his disappointment one drink at a time. This affords Tony, who lacks the seemingly servile patience of his mother, an opportunity to assert independence rather than allowing his fate to be set by chance and circumstance. But throughout the course of Roy Pickering's engrossing debut novel, Tony comes to learn that the world is not as black and white as he and his father's opposing mindsets would suggest.Available in print at Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932CX7ZY?...And Kindle edition: http://tinyurl.com/ydoamc3Or direct from the author, at a discount rate if multiple copies are being purchased for a book club, at http://roypickering.weebly.com/Top Ten Quotes from Patches of Grey - http://www.quotationsdiary.com/indie-...Review by RawSistaz Reviewers - http://ow.ly/15UmwxReview at AlvahsBooks.com by Randall Radic - http://www.alvahsbooks.com/?p=417Review by five bourough book  - http://fiveboroughbooks.blogspot.com/...Review by Good Books and Wine - http://bit.ly/eOTF4YReview by John Paterson:Patches of Grey is a story in the tradition of the “coming of age” literature (think SE Hinton, or Catcher in the Rye) in an urban African American setting. Roy Pickering captures the angst of boys becoming men with the added complexity of race permeating events and the environment. The author does a remarkable job illustrating the internal dialogue and conflict all teenagers face as they struggle for identity, but from the perspective of a young black man. The gift is his ability to translate this conversation to a wider audience, to identify both common ground (girls, fathers, social strata) and also present differences that make one appreciate how race, culture, and familial relationships are perceived differently in different groups: e.g., the conflict between being “all you can be,” and being loyal to the group. The domestic violence was jarring, as was the relativity. Things weren’t “good” or “bad,” but “better than” or “worse than.” Is having an abusive father/husband (who cares for his family) better than having no father around at all? At least he’s not as bad as . . . It’s a world in which nothing is taken for granted, and nobody can really afford to be easy going. Seeming cool even carries a certain intense, deliberate and intentional quality. There is love, but very little is given – at home or to others -- freely, generously, or without conditions. It’s a lot of work, with a lot of stress hanging in the general atmosphere. On the other hand, there is a core element of pride, strength, survival – and dare I say – hope and change to the story. Nobody is a naïve fool, or sucker. They are smart and strong characters who may not have started with a lot of advantages, but can take anything. There is “something” in them that will live on forever no matter what changes.I agree with others who’ve said this should be on the Junior High/High School reading list. (May have to edit some parts?) I think it could be so meaningful, and even change lives, with young readers at that point.In reading the book I found myself thinking that I really hope the author has son(s), coaches, mentors, and/or is in big brother program. It would be great for the world.  * * *In addition to Patches of Grey, Roy Pickering is the author of the novella - Feeding the Squirrelshttp://www.synergebooks.com/ebook_fee...

As for the deepest wounds, they tend to come from those who love us considerably less than by all rights they should. This wonderful little book eloquently expresses both of these points. It belongs to that popular category of fiction which is narrated in first person from the perspective of a character who is emotionally and/or mentally challenged, thus magnifying commonplace exploits to Mount Everest proportions. I'm looking for a shorter term to name this genre so that perhaps I will be given official credit. The Pleasure of My Company falls into this category, yet also rises above it in spite of its brevity.

This is definitely browse and highlight what you find most useful materiaI don't think I'll be able to force myself to read this all the way through. This is definitely browse and highlight what you find most useful material. The fault is not so much with the author's writing ability as it is the fact that there's basically enough formation being provided to fill up a useful article, but since it has been made into a book instead, the author resorts to an astronomical amount of padding. The same exact point is repeated in as many different minutely different ways as possible to get the page count up to triple digits. This is not made any less annoying by the fact that just about one sentence per paragraph and a half needlessly ends with an exclamation point. So I cannot recommend this book as something to read for pleasure. This doesn't mean it will not ultimately prove to be a wonderful resource that delivers on its promise to teach a child under the age of 3 to read. If the techniques prove succesful perhaps I'll feel compelled at a later date to come back and improve my current rating. After all, I didn't buy this book to be entertained. I bought it to learn how to teach. But it would have been a nice bonus if the book was easier on the readability meter....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 20, 2008","Oct 13, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3337457-native-reading

The rule of ""show don't tell"" (not that I'm a strict rule follower) is completely obliterated, and perhaps the biggest sin for a book billed as a thriller - it was not particularly suspenseful or thrilling. I somewhat reluctantly pushed my way through since it was easy enough to read (the author makes little attempt to utilize poetic prose or vocabulary anyone would need to look up in the dictionary). But if you like your reading material to be of superior quality to something you could have written yourself by 9th grade, I recommend taking a pass on this tepid tale. English is not the author's native tongue, although he has become comfortable enough with it to write a couple novels in English according to his bio. I'm not entirely sure if Hidden in Havana is one of them or if it was translated, but either way it fell short of my expectations for a work of fiction put out by a major publisher (or a minor one, or self pubbed for that matter). I learned a little about Cuba in the process of reading this book, which is cool because I'm a bit of a Cubaphile. Other than that this was a novel soon to be forgotten. I'm actually forgetting it as I write these words.

I personally prefer loaves that need to be sliced, but I digress). The blurbs throw around names of authors I deeply admire such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but the only literary work I was reminded of was On the Road. Kerouac was smart enough to keep his tale of random wandering fairly brief, whereas readers have nearly 600 pages to plow through to make it to the end of The Savage Detectives. I stopped after about 150 of them when it became apparent enough that there would be no characters created with sufficient depth for me to care one way or another about, and no particular plotline to speak of. Roberto Bolano was a talented writer who apparently had little interest in writing beginning-middle-end narratives. I could see why certain people would love this novel.

I'm placing it in the exhalted position of one of my 3 favorite books of all time, sitting alongside The World According to Garp and Love in the Time of Cholera. It is a magnificent chronicle of a Dominican-American family and the fuku that haunts them throughout generations, with its main focus on poor Oscar, a heavyset nerd personified in eternal search for love, preferably the variety that is accompanied by sex. The narrative jumps back and forth in time, telling several marvelous stories in non-linear fashion within a single tale. Oscar's sister Lola (the story is narrated by her boyfriend who is also Oscar's closest friend) and their mother and the cousin who raised her and Oscar's bilogical grandfather each take turns at center stage before returning the spotlight once more to Oscar. As a Pulitzer Prize winner one expects masterful writerly style prose, and this book does not disappoint in that regard. But it also has a skillfully rendered contemporary feel that one might expect to find in an urban novel, and it reads as a polished piece of historical fiction with footnotes galore as well. This book gives you everything you could expect to find in a literary masterpiece and then some. It will break your heart while simultaneously making it soar because above all else The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao is about the most valuable possession any human being can hold - HOPE.

Perhaps the abridged edition would have tempted me to give a 5 star rating because this book certainly deserves its status as a classic. But man was it long. You'd have to write a pretty teriffic book with a splendidly inventive plot and compelling characters to get me to commit to well over 1000 pages of prose. That's precisely what Stephen King accomplished, particularly with the early part of this mega-novel when the virus is doing its nasty business. Definitely no dragging going on there. But once the survivors have found each other hundreds of pages in, forming a community and establishing rules to live by in their post-Apocalytpic world, the story drags just a bit. Eventually the plot gets us to the final showdown portion which could be considered a tad anticlimatic since there was such a tremendous amount of build up to it. Anything short of the book spontaneously combusting in my hands would probably have seemed a little disappointing. But I'm no doubt being too picky here because I feel like I was reading this book for at least 6 months. It really is a wonderful novel, probably worth purchasing rather than borrowing from the library like I did so you don't have any pesky due date to worry about.

The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 26, 2011","Feb 26, 2011","Aug 14, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18314.The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray

The narrator of that book did one stupid thing after another and the reader was supposed to accept these actions as reasonable because the character is described/defined as a bumbler. In real life of course people do not fall quite so neatly into such categories. Someone may bumble most of the time in certain areas but navigate smoothly through other sets of circumstances. As Chris Rock noted in one of his comedy routines when describing his political leanings - ""I have some things that I'm conservative about, and some things that I'm liberal about"". Nobody is always liberal or always conservative or always a bumbler, though it is true that some people act a certain way far more often than not. The ""title"" character of The Unknown Terrorist is a fairly complex one with a well fleshed out background, and the story line is fueled by much bigger ideas than the comical Arsonist book. But I couldn't shake the feeling as I sped through its pages that the actions of pivotal characters were specifically intended to promote strong opinions held by the author and nothing but. He wanted to make certain points about politics and the media and about how easily the sheep like masses can be led to a prefabricated conclusion. If at any point one of the major characters in this reasonably well written book responded to incidents in a way that I personally believe would have been more realistic, the book would completely fall apart because little else was holding it in place. The wrongfully accused woman needs to be so paranoid from the get go (her drug use helped in this regard) and distrustful of authority that the only thing she can think to do is run and hide even before she's really being chased. The decision makers in the media need to be so obsessed about breaking a big story that not only does truth become irrelevant, but so does having supporting evidence of any kind. The author is OBVIOUSLY cynical about our post 9/11 world, and anyone who does not have their head shoved deeply in the sand can recognize why this might be so, but I found myself torn between wanting to follow the story line to where it was blatantly leading and wanting the characters to break free of the author's plot machinations and act in a common sense manner that would likely clear matters up within a few pages of text. Despite such frustration with plausibility, this was definitely a gripping and smooth flowing read....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 19, 2008","Aug 03, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/438100.The_Unknown_Terrorist

Other than being a fan of the film version of his novel ""Fight Club"", I didn't know a whole lot about him. Now I know that he is a writer to greatly admire and envy. It took me a few pages to adjust to the experimental form this novel is written in, but once its hooks were in me the book never let go of my rapt attention. Slowly but surely it reveals its secrets, not showing you the little man behind the Wizard of Oz in one fell swoop, but rather, exposing the method behind the madness in brilliant little increments. By the end I was left in a joyous daze.

If you like a heavy dose of absurdity mixed into your mysteries, and plenty of literary references tossed in for good measue, this is the book for you. If I was the type, this would probably qualify as a single sitting read. Mild curiosity and amusement along with a dash of irritation at the narrator's inability to solve relatively simple problems in blatantly simple ways (because he is by definition a bumbler, and the author insists he must live up to this description no matter what) propels the reader forward to an ending that is not intended to take anyone by surprise, but manages to be somewhat poignant if not quite profound....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2008","Jun 20, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/733462.An_Arsonist_s_Guide_to_Writers_Homes_in_New_England

Crammed full of historical data and anecdotes, it felt to me that a substantial portion of the backdrop could have been omitted without significantly subtracting from the overall plot. This book is largely told in letters, though the type of detail crammed letters only to be found within a novel, because not even writers correspond so thoroughly in real life unless what they're writing is a novel. The point of view shifts throughout the narrative, although instead of switching from one person's perspective to another it usually switches from one person's set of letters to those of another. But the reader (those of us outside the book) presses on because we're chasing after the second most charismatic villian of all time, trailing behind only Satan himself. I must say that I enjoyed Anne Rice's books more, not that it's a competition. Rice had the distinct advantage of making her vampires the main characters whereas Kostova chronicles the overlapping adventures of a group of vampire hunting historians. Dracula (spoiler alert) makes no more than a cameo appearance towards the end of The Historian, because this novel is not so much about the catch as it is about the pursuit. Ironically, even though much of the book felt stretched out longer than I felt was necessary to keep readers hooked, the end seemed a bit rushed and anticlimactic. I was reminded of my experience reading The Stand in that there was so much build up over such a long period of time (I'm not the world's fastest reader, so when I invest in a book with a page count in the 1000 neighborhood it takes me a while to get through it) that I would have only been fully satisfied if the book literally combusted as I read its final thrilling pages. Those who consider Twilight to be top shelf literature probably won't make it past page 100 of The Historian, but readers who enjoy meticulously researched historical/literary fiction that transports them through many countries over many centuries will find this book a worthy treat to sink their sharpened teeth into....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Jan 2010,"Jun 17, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10692.The_Historian

Obtaining a copy proved to be a challenge in itself (this must have been before I was internet savvy), but after searching in a number of bookstores and libraries I finally found one in The Strand. With the book finally in my possession would it end up being worth my effort to obtain it? Fortunately it lived up to the hype. Now that Barack Obama is running for President this compelling novel has fondly been brought back to mind. The first half of this  was written prior to Barack Obama's election to the highest office in the land. In case you haven't figured it out by now, this novel is a fictional account of the first black President. He isn't elected to the position, but rather, the president, vice president and some others ahead of him in line are killed and suddenly the United States finds itself having a black man in the oval office for the very first time, and that black man finds himself overwhelmed by an avalanche of responsibilities and pressure. But as one of my favorite expressions goes - ""I may have been born yesterday but I stayed up all night"". On the job training is often challenging, especially when it's the most difficult job in the world, especially when many are resentful of your ascendancy, condescending about your ability to be up to the task, or both.

I'm a big fan of John Irving and loved the idea that he had written a children's book, giving my daughter a chance to become one of his fans as well at quite the young age. She typically makes it very clear which books are among her favorites. Time will tell whether this one gets added to that list, but based on the first reading I suspect that Mr. Irving and the very talented illustrator he worked with have passed her test. I will refrain (at least for the time being) from giving it a star rating because I feel you can gauge the success of a book written in such a simple manner for such a young audience only by repeated readings. It certainly earn points for not being the typical all ends on the happiest of notes children's book that I am accustomed to reading. My wife commented as I read that the book might give our daughter nightmares. I can't say if it did or not, but when asked how her sleep time went this morning her response was a novel and surprising - ""interesting"". Coincidentally I happened to read this book directly after reading one called Scaredy Mouse that my wife bought the day before. That book is especially charming and was an instant hit with our daughter. I mention this only because it was interesting to read aloud two books in a row, one featuring a mouse that is terrified of a cat (and everything it sees that it initially mistakes for the cat), the other featuring two little boys who are imaginitively frightened by an unseen mouse. Due to the rodent role reversal in these tales I think I'll continue to read them back to back. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Apr 08, 2008","Mar 27, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4655.A_Sound_Like_Someone_Trying_Not_to_Make_a_Sound

The extremes that the author and other bodybuilders go through to reach their perceived version of physical perfection (e.g. - cutting calorie intake dramatically in the days leading up to a competition in order to achieve a shredded look to the point that even toothpaste is avoided) were compelling to learn about. The reader is given a glimpse into this familiar yet foreign world from someone unlikely to be there in the first place. I'm a physical fitness enthusiast myself and know people who have given competitive bodybuilding a shot, so the subject matter was intriguing to me. The motivation and mindset of people who willingly enter such a carnival type atmosphere is described in a manner and from a perspective that most others would be unable to provide, from the dual vantage point of an outsider looking in as well as an insider looking out. There is a certain fascination about people who are willing to treat their own bodies as a science experiment. Such experiments do not come without risk of course, so Muscle is basically the story of an accidental adventurer kind enough to take us along for a strange and wild ride while it lasted. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Mar 11, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/510493.Muscle

I adored this book which I read several years before the movie Bruce Almighty came out. My first thought after seeing the movie was that despite its wonderful cast the movie is not nearly as interesting as the book, though I suppose the flick provides more laugh out loud moments. Far too many details that I found quite interesting in the book about the powers and limitations of temporarily being God were barely touched upon in the movie. But upon further research it seems that the movie is not an adaptation of this book after all, which in my opinion makes it a pretty blatant rip-off. If the author of Almighty Me did not make any money off of the movie Bruce Almighty and its sequel, he should definitely sue. As for the book, it is based on a fascinating concept and the smooth execution of its clever plot results in a memorable read....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Feb 21, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/323112.Almighty_Me

Perhaps the most mesmerizing and powerful book ever written about race... perhaps the most mesmerizing and powerful book ever written about anything. Richard Wright created the gold standard when he gave us the story of Bigger Thomas, a young black man in the 1930s who, in a momentary state of panic, kills a young white woman without meaning to do so. He goes on the run and refuses to take accountability for actions that he feels were forced upon him by an unjust world. Rather than giving us a main character cruelly and unfairly treated on account of his skin color and therefore automatically garnering the reader's sympathy, Wright gives us one who does the unforgivable and therefore invites scorn. Rather than being repentant, Bigger grows increasingly outraged that he was made to become what it was not his natural destiny to be. Do you sympathize with or loathe Bigger Thomas, see him as a cold-hearted killer or helpless victim? The answer that you give to this question is revealing. The very best novels are not commentaries but mirrors. My opinion that the courtroom scene at the end drags on a bit too long and is basically a monologue rather than a continuation of the riveting plot is the only thing that keeps me from awarding this masterpiece 5 stars.

There is a magical element to Holes just as there obviously is to the Potter stories, but in Holes there's only a layer of fantasy added to a mostly realistic tale rather than fantastasical elements at every twist and turn. The former is how I prefer my fiction regardless of what age range it is geared towards. Even if I never read Holes, based on the movie I'd certainly recommend it to my daugther years from now when she's old enough.

My appreciation of that along with the amount of research obviously involved in writing this book, and the fascinating premise of his final novel, keeps me from panning this novel. But I'm not going to rave about it either because I was ultimately underwhelmed by The Castle in the Forst. Watching Hitler from birth to adolescence through the eyes of one of Satan's minions who is helping to guide his path to pure evil sounded like a brilliant concept when I read the synopsis. But Mailer's execution fell a good bit short of expectations built by the premise along with Mailer's sterling reputation and appreciation I had for previously read books of his. I can excuse the odd fascination that The Castle in the Forst shows with bowel movements, less than fragrant smells, and other unpleasantries. Mailer chooses to equate bad hygiene with evil as if the best way to convince readers a person is born to be bad is by making him gross. Considering that in this book Hitler is the result of incest, something I'd never heard about Hitler before, I suppose it makes sense that he wouldn't be especially cuddly and huggable from well before evil and hunger for power took full control of him. So I took the rampant incest and pedophilia in stride. I'm less forgiving however of the ridiculous amount of detail that is given to the raising of bees. Yes, the goings on of a beehive is intriguing. The Secret Life of Bees is a book that pays homage to this fact with just the right amount of attention in my opinion. The Castle in the Forest goes on and on about bees well beyond what my interest in the subject was willing to tolerate. Then there is a big chunk of this book that leaves the main plot behind to follow another one about the coronation of Nicholas II. This section is connected to the rest of the novel because the narrator remains unchanged, but it has far less to do with the plot of Hitler's upbringing than the word count warrants. Mailer actually states in the book that readers can skip this section if they wish to and resume reading 40 or so pages later, and after slogging through the section anyway I wished I had taken his advice. The Nicholas II section should have been edited way down. If I'm being overly harsh it's in part because I had such high hopes for The Castle in the Forst based on such rich opportunities the plot seemed to provide, and the heralded talent of the author. The end result is not a bad book, simply an admirable effort that I found more disappointing than memorable....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 26, 2008","Feb 12, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12466.The_Castle_in_the_Forest

Things Fall Apart is the story of an African man named Okonkwo. He is an important man in his tribe and lives the way he understands a man's life is meant to be lived. To compensate for the weaknesses of his father his main purpose is to demonstrate strength. In order to achieve a greater degree of success he figures he must be more ambitious, aggressive, and domineering. And this is what he pulls off. So long as his place is firmly established in a world that is familiar to him, one in which he understands the rules and what it takes to excel, all is well. But after Christian missionaries arrive in the village we learn that this is not the story of a man, but rather, the chronicle of a way of life that is destined to fall. Okonkwo's gods fail to measure up against the Christian God mainly because ancient ways are always overwhelmed by the march of modernity. The gun is mightier than the machete, science outmatches superstition, and what on the surface appears to be a more compassionate way of life triumphs over barbarism because biblical cruelty is more cleverly disguised. A fascinating novel indeed....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"May 20, 2012",not set,"Feb 11, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37781.Things_Fall_Apart

This country has a very complicated relationship with race and Caucasia is one of the more intriguing examinations of this relationship that I've read to date. Most novels about race showcase how blacks feel about whites and vice versa. But for a biracial person a whole new layer of complexity is added to the equation, especially when the decision is made to pass as exclusively white. Caucasia is a fantastic book, one that readers who love action-filled plots can appreciate as will those looking for quieter introspection on social issues that were prominent in the 1970's setting of this novel and continue without full resolution to this day. It isn't easy to understand who you are from a cultural viewpoint when you happen to belong to both sides. Do the two halves negate each other, leaving a blank to be filled by the choices you make? Do they add up for a richer, fuller comprehension of the world than that possessed by those who see themselves strictly as either one or the other?

The first two attributes are on account of Charles Johnson's mastery of the written word. His prose grips the reader from first sentence and doesn't let go for a second. It goes by so quickly that I found myself wishing it had been padded to last another 50 pages or more. Why was it surpising? Well, I expected it to focus primarily on the horrific middle passage in which people were enslaved and transported in barbaric fashion from Africa to America. And the bulk of this book does in fact describe such a voyage. But before we get to it we are introduced to the protagonist, a fascinating character who is a freed slave that ends up on the ship basically by accident as he flees to avoid a forced marriage to his impatient girlfriend, a seemingly mild mannered lady who has taken matrimonial matters into her own hands in rather brutish fashion. Once Rutherford Calhoun is aboard ship and particularly once it has monstrously taken on cargo, which includes not only members of an ancient African tribe but also their god, the narrative is so intense and perilous and chock full of life and death double dealing on the unpredictable high seas, that the early part of the novel is mostly forgotten. But without giving too much away, as Middle Passage reaches its conclusion suddenly we are back in the world of the original cast of characters. The physically battered protagonist is much changed mentally and emotionally due to his adventurous ordeal. But he has one last dangerous set of circumstances to navigate before he can be fully saved. Ironically, being saved means opting for a degree of monogamy and commitment that his avoidance of got him into so much trouble in the first place. Freedom has an entirely different definition to him from beginning of the story to the end. So yes, this book as expected was about the atrocities of the slave trade. But slavery is more of a backdrop than focus of the action packed tale. What it ultimately ends up being about is the lengths a man goes to live a carefree existence, and what he must go through to learn that caring for people other than himself is a far superior way to live....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 25, 2011","May 09, 2011","Feb 01, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/231113.Middle_Passage

I don't suppose there are too many readers who are not already familiar with it. I wrote a blog post on Huck Finn in 2011 http://lineaday.blogspot.com/2011/01/... due to the decision to put out a new edition with all instances of ""the N-word"" omitted. The reason why this decision was made and the reason I was opposed, despite its good intent, says all that needs to be said about why this book is a classic. The brilliance of Twain's novel is that it shows how basically good people can be conditioned to have reprehensible attitudes and not even realize their wrong doing. We forgive Huck Finn's ignorant beliefs because we recognize that he is a good person at heart. This makes us wonder what sins by others in real life we should perhaps be more forgiving of, and which ones we ourselves may be unknowingly committing.

But the prediction made by the man who played the most prominent position for his team established a legacy that would only become enhanced by time. As a testament to greatness during a period of turbulent change as the stuffiness of the 50's gave way to the revolution of the 60's and the ""have your cake and eat it too"" excess of the 70's, Joe Namath was a product of fortuitous circumstance. To his credit, like Frank Sinatra he did things his way and this ultimately turned out to be very lucrative for him. As a man, he comes off as an amiable drunk who is not particularly loyal to those who stood by him and those he fought alongside with. Mostly he is loyal to the protection of his legacy, particularly the revenue it generates, and to his children. He has made good money by living on his past but knows better than to live in it. Joe Namath's greatest accomplishments were backing up a prediction with the help of players he was isolated from who were alienated by the double standard put in place for him, and living a bachelor lifestyle that created an image he was able to capitalize on. By the end of the book he is a heartbroken (left by his wife) alcoholic loner rather than a carefree alcoholic surrounded by hangers on but not necessarily true friends. His life goes on, making his living autobiography a work in progress. As for the bio adeptly written about him by Mark Kriegel, I found it be engaging and informative. Longtime football fans will especially enjoy it, particularly Jets fans looking to relive past glory....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 12, 2008","Jan 30, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/200722.Namath

But if I had to pick my all time favorite book I'd probably go with ""The World According to Garp"". Irving takes us on the path of T.S. Garp's life from conception to death and I was enthralled every step of the way. This book is full of humanity, full of both light and dark humor, and full of insight into the human condition. Irving took over from Charles Dickens and put his own unique spin on telling a tale and creating characters that stay with you. I'll also add that while the movie based on it is less than a masterpiece (not that it wasn't a valiant effort to condense a lenghthy complex story), Robin Williams gave an admirable performance that showed he had a lot more range and substance as an actor than most people probably realized at the time, and John Lithgow was nothing short of glorious. But this not a movie , so let me conclude by stating that if you are a fan of masterful story telling and larger than life but still quite realistic characters, pick up this book.

Love in the Time of Cholera is for people who may also experience great desperation in their lives, but they're damn sure not going to be quiet about it. I will add a disclaimer that if the subject of stalking is a trigger for you, this may not be the book for you. As an old perfume ad campaign went, between love and madness lies obsession.

He plays with women's hearts, minds and bodies without so much as a care or concern. But there's a thin line between lust and hate.As each chapter describes a different sexual conquest, author Roy Pickering Jr. gives readers more insight into Michael and just how far he's willing to go to get what he wants - carnal pleasure.

The main character, Michael, is a writer, philanderer, conceited and wealthy playboy who spends his time searching for his next conquest while attempting to pen the greatest novel. Chapter by chapter he details the different women he conquered and the roles he plays to win his next lay. FEEDING THE SQUIRRELS is an interesting account of one man's deception in manipulating women for sexual satisfaction, until he is faced with devastating consequences.

Pickering Jr. is a short E-book surrounding the interesting but realistic dating life of Michael. As much as we as woman don’t want to encounter a man like Michael, many of us do…not always being aware that it’s all about the “dating game” with no desire of commitment. Then there are those of us that are aware and think we can settle a man like Michael down to being with only “us.” Yes, Michael is a worldly man when it comes to women. Michael is a handsome and successful man afforded the opportunities to live life as he wants due to an inheritance left to him after the death of his father. Michael introduces you to several of the woman that he comes across in life as an eligible bachelor. From Natalie, a Spanish speaking housekeeper to Jennifer, his high school sweetheart to Sally an online dating encounter. You will either hate Michael, be amused or say…once upon a time, I knew a man just like him. Michael is calculating, not willing to be committed to one woman…enjoying the challenge of the chase of his target, then after his thirst is quench…finding the right way to walk away…this is the story of Michael.Feeding The Squirrels is a great read in opening the doors to discussions on the reasoning behind this kind of approach to dating…is there true fulfillment from stepping into relationships this way or is there something missing and is Michael over compensating for… Come meet Michael and the women he has charmed.S.E.
