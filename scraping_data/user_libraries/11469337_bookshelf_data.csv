The last part of the book very much fell off for me - the sort of ""this is what I think of life stuff"" felt almost like riffing.

It is, after all, writing about times and places in which you were not present and which you must resist the urge to imagine. This one opens very well, with a moving recitation of Cary Grant's last few days. After that, I began to feel like the book would not live up to those pages. But we are talking about a complicated life that spans decades and continents and within that there are bound to be a few lapses here and that pull you from the trajectory of the subject matter. Some have criticized the book for having too many details - but after all, that is why you read a biography. If you did not want details, you would settle for an online profile or wiki somewhere. There were a few times where the narrative centered a bit too much on someone not Grant, but in the totality of things, it added body to some of the relationships he had. The real challenge for me is that like so many others, I held Cary on a pedestal. He was a very complex person who faced many personal challenges. The nice thing is that after reading about it all, he is still on the pedestal. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 27, 2022","Feb 22, 2022","Jan 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892415-cary-grant

Remains of the Day, which I re-read this year, was such a fascinating book for its even pace and the ability to look so closely at a life overlooked, even by the person who was leading it. And in some ways, that is what Klara and the Sun seemed to me to be. There was even a very strong echo from Remains of the Day - a scene where a servant being mocked by a party of gentlemen who ask him questions to which his response is that he regrets he cannot be of service is mirrored in a scene with Klara where a party of teenagers put her in a similar position and where her response is similar. But while this book was a pleasant read and was about a provocative main character who is an artificially intelligent being, I did not get it. This is likely my failing as I am quite literal and quite linear much of the time which makes deep symbolism a challenge.

Anyway, on the up side, she can really weave a tale and all of the things she brought to the Harry Potter series, she brings here. But that is a two-edged compliment in that while the Hogwarts novels had a huge cast of characters, that was great in a fantasy novel. In a mystery, it can be daunting to keep track of everyone and all the threads. That is what makes it fun too but it can be overwhelming. Like the HP novels, with each progressive book they get longer and more involved and more intricate. For me, this one was a bit of a challenge at times keeping track of who was who and what they did.

It was very insightful, though kind of ignored, to see a failed parent who was himself the product of a failed parent, convey that damage on down the line with his own children. The book is very well written, but memoir can be tricky for both the writer and the reader. Here I was struck by the clarity of many of the childhood memories, but lack of clarity related to more recent events. Some memories related in the memoir had obvious issues - where for example a person said to be involved in a particular traumatic event has no memory of it, yet the author includes them in the setting anyway. In any case, it is obvious that the author experienced a good deal of trauma growing up and overcame huge obstacles to emerge on the other side of it, and her story is compelling and at times inspiring. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 06, 2020","Oct 14, 2020","Oct 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35133922-educated

There was nowhere better to start. When I first read this story of a butler whose primary tenet in life is a focus on dignity as defined by his role and his ability to fulfill it, I was not that moved by it, nor did I understand the nuance. I saw someone whose world was so narrowly defined and in which he was a willing captor. Now I was much more focused on the aspect, also inherent in the story of course given the title, of taking stock of one’s life and this time that was the emphasis for me.

The book itself also presented some challenges for me in that it sometimes skips about chronologically, making it difficult to keep your bearings, which is probably not unlike its subject. It is well researched and very thorough and in fact, sometimes for some perhaps, too thorough in its detail. It is an important and sad read. The sadness is really rooted in the fact that this was someone who really achieved what he wanted to professionally, but did not seem to understand his own life. On the latter, I think it is something with which we can all identify. One last point, I thought the book was not well named.

It is a novel, but it does not feel like a novel, it feels more like an epic poem. And the author is a poet. Written as a long letter to a mother, it also does not feel like a novel because it feels so autobiographical, but I do not know that to be accurate at all. And it is dark. It is very dark. The beautiful title - On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous - is almost a little misleading in that there is not a happy or gorgeous moment. It is almost all tragic.

This is quite a book, and very difficult to categorize. Ostensibly a novel, it reads like a memoir and one of the jacket blurbs refers to it as an “ethnography” and I don’t even know what that is. Perhaps the most outstanding thing is that it was published by a 21 year-old author who manages very well to pin down so much of the nuance of each kind of despair that attaches to one’s self growing up gay in a hostile environment. The prose is not beautiful, nor would you want it to be. Rather it is spare and direct which counterbalances the emotional gravity of the subject matter. One drawback is that even when the writing is intending to give us some insight into other characters, it still is steadfastly focused on the main character. It is only his perspective and only about him. Still, I’m not sure I would have had it any other way.

The most gratifying thing about biographies is that they put the public caricature of the famous into real world context. The famous in the end, are people - who have lives and to whom things happen - sometimes quite ordinary things. But there were two mysteries in this one that stood out. The first was her disappearance in 1926. I found the description of it in the book to almost be distracting - an academic analysis vis a vis those of others - but without being particularly illuminating. Maybe it can’t be. There is too much that is not known. It is impossible to know what went on and what motivated. One can only speculate.

This is partially because the main character Willa Drake, is a child when it starts, in her 30s a bit later and the bulk of the action takes place when she is in her 60s which means that the accompanying characters we meet along the way, drop off.

But, while presented as a memoir of his care for his mother, this book is really more focused on the author and his quest to grow up. There is nothing like being a care partner for a parent to force your round peg into that square hole. Also, having written a memoir myself that was very linear, I very much appreciate that he was able to skip back and forth in scenes and time to add important dimensions to the writing. That said, there were times when I had a hard time following. But all in all, a tale of caring and vulnerability is told here with humor and charm.

And starting it, I had a hard time warming up to it for several reasons, not the least of which was feelings about the Confederacy. The novel is highly structured, set in the course of 7 weeks in which someone from her past, a child she began to raise who was of mixed race, meets up with her near the end of her life in New York. They meet each Sunday and then there are flashback memories discussed in the course of each. It is a fascinating journey told by a character who is portrayed as having little sympathy with the events that shaped her life, but being carried along by them, beginning with marrying a man at 17 who was almost as old as her own mother. The character as drawn by the author grows significantly in each of the memories portrayed in the book, and her persona is quite divorced from the politics of the time, which I did have to question somewhat. However, in fact, she and the wife of Ulysses Grant did become friends after the war and even vacationed together. That gives you some illumination into how fascinating of a life this was and even though not a biography, sticks very close to factual timelines and events. Like Cold Mountain I was at first put off by an almost claustrophobic feeling that the strong character and characterizations lay down on you when reading, but either the novel stopped doing that, or I got used to it. A very nice novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 07, 2018","Jun 14, 2018","May 06, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35068510-varina

But I have read every one of Steven Saylor’s Roma Sub Rosa series and enjoyed everyone of them immensely and this was no exception. The series centers on Gordianus the Finder who is a young man in the first book, and who now has aged to 66. He has had a remarkable life and has met everyone in Rome worth meeting. The latest installment has worked its way up to the murder of Caesar. The novels are always well written and Gordianus is a compelling and charming character - and one suspects the same of Steven Saylor.

And in fact all of the characters leave a vivid impression, but it is the decency and reflections of Brunetti in the face of circumstances over which he has no control and which are often the result of monumental human failure, that is the guiding light that brings me back again and again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Apr 20, 2018not set","Apr 28, 2018not set","Apr 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35576032-the-temptation-of-forgiveness

At first, I was engrossed as it begins deep in the memory of the main character and narrator, reliving his first moments encountering someone he would come to deeply love. My first problem with the book is that is where you stayed, and it became highly claustrophobic. You never left his immediate observations/memories of his feelings, his wants, his desires. You never got anything external facing. Set in Italy, there was not much outward observation - nothing of the house, the scenery, the food. I mean it is Italy. But actually there was not much description about other people, even the object of his affection. It was all centered on his feelings at any given moment, which leads to the second problem I had with it which was the fickle nature of the main character. He certainly is obsessed to a degree about the person he loves, but in the very next moment, he is fixated on someone else, and then back to his lover. Granted with respect to both of these issues, we are looking at the world through the eyes of a 17 year old - often an age when one is self absorbed and fickle. That makes it accurate I guess, but it does not make it particularly interesting. All that said, there are some lovely bits of writing and perspective....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Mar 25, 2018not set","Apr 02, 2018not set","Feb 19, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10706388-call-me-by-your-name

One of the most gratifying aspects of this book though is to take someone who might be one-dimensional in our perspective - a “Renaissance Man” -a “genius” - and succeed in making him multi-dimensional - making him very human. There is much in this book that was not taught to use growing up - like Leonardo not only being gay, but being very gay. Think Elton John only as a genius.

Growing up with Truman Capote, writing your first novel that becomes perhaps the greatest seller of the century and seeing it made into a film, working as a researcher for In Cold Blood - all fascinating. It is the story of someone made by their success and also somewhat tricked by it. The read is very good and provides a lot of great backstory to the phenomenon that was To Kill a Mockingbird. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 07, 2017","Sep 17, 2017","Sep 17, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/114408.Mockingbird

One reason was that the characters Jonathan and Claire are rather unlikeable - they were highly self-absorbed and mostly lacking compassion and I kept trying to figure out if that was intentional. The other thing was that the sections written by Bobby were the most beautifully written and revealing of a sensitive and likeable and knowing soul, but you would not have gotten that from the way other people described him.

It was hard to be sympathetic with him when he and his decisions seemed do unguided by any moral center.

By the same token it has been many years since I tried so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I found Moveable both very satisfying and dis-satisfying at the same time. Published posthumously about living in Paris in the 1920s, the book does not follow any chronological order, nor does it really have a central theme, which can be disorienting a bit. The most interesting parts involved the interactions with other people - Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound - who he distinctly liked and Ford Maddox Ford - who he distinctly did not like. The chapters about Fitzgerald were the most interesting parts of the book because both he and Fitzgerald really came to life and had depth and it provided a lot of insight into them both. Miss Stein was largely one-dimensional. You find yourself wanting to know Ezra Pound much better. A good deal of the book centers on his first marriage, but that really did not ever come to life. It is definitely worth a read and I'm glad I got reacquainted with Hem - as he refers to himself - but I did find myself wanting a bit more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 02, 2017","May 13, 2017","Feb 17, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4631.A_Moveable_Feast

These are not action packed novels, nor are they riddled with suspense. There is no great intellectual game afoot to figure out whodunnit. The beauty of this series are the characters and their relationships with one another and with Venice. It is about their outlook on life, about feeling good in the face of things that are not good. They are about food and cooking as expressions for enjoying life and one another. And that is why I love them. In this one, we get a lot of Guido (not enough of Paola), but it is a welcome intimacy with Guido as he explores himself outside of the city and away from his family. One can hear the water lapping at the side of the boat. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 10, 2017","Feb 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32332914-earthly-remains

The plot is charming, the writing is charming and above all, the main character is utterly charming. The novel starts in 1922 in Moscow and follows the life of a man confined to house arrest in a vast hotel - the Metoprol. The premise, I have to say, sounded claustrophobic when I thought about it. I picked up the book and then put it down. But receiving it as a gift, it made it into my pile of things to read. And I'm so glad I did. It was anything but confining to be in the Metropol with Count Rostov - there were rooms and rooms in which to roam and people to meet and stories to hear. And beyond the aforementioned attributes, the introduction to such a fine character as Count Rostov also provides lessons in how to live. And while learning those lessons, you are endlessly entertained. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 07, 2017","Mar 11, 2017","Feb 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430012-a-gentleman-in-moscow

Like James Joyce's Ulysses, the book is as much about the writing of the book as the subject about which is being written, if you take my meaning. There is not a continuous narrative, but rather a series of observations made by a multitude of observers - some of them living (at the time in which the novel is set) and some of them dead (also at the time at which the novel is set). Some of the observations are memories - looking back from those still alive providing points of view - sometimes conflicting - of what occurred. One thing the living and the dead have in common is that they do not seem to know why there are where they are. In any case, the book follows the days after the passing of Willie Lincoln and the grief of President and Mrs. Lincoln. But I would not say that the book is actually about the Lincolns, rather this brief point in time is the vehicle for conveying a lot of thoughts about living (and of course, dying). I actually avoided reading s of this book prior to reading it for the reason that I sensed that it was a book best tasted oneself so that one could decide how one felt. But I confess after reading it, I am not sure how I feel. It was interesting and it was extremely creative but I am left wondering if my intellect was up to this. However, I can say I would recommend that others take the journey and see how they feel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 11, 2017","Mar 18, 2017","Feb 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

The city was big and dirty and a little scary and there was no AIDS epidemic. It was a different time. It was also the kind of time and one was at an age where you cultivate the friendships that are extremely important - that have the kinds of bonds that allow you to easily and comfortably run into a friend from those days and begin having a conversation right where you left off all those years ago. It was a place and time in life where you forge the experiences that define you later as a person.Just Kids captures all that and more. It is worth a slow read because her prose should not be rushed. She evoked tears in the beginning of the book and again at the end. You don't have to be a fan of her poetry or her music to relate to her experience and journey as someone young who is growing into her own or to understand fully how special it is to find someone you love so fiercely and to accept them for their wonder and their faults. She lived in the Chelsea Hotel and so this book spoke to me. And moreover, it is a story of NY in an age that is as far gone as the days of the flapper and the speakeasy. I read this book after reading M Train, which I actually thought was even better writing. She has a distinct way of relaying events and memories that while somewhat minimalist in nature delivers fully on the experience. There is observation, poignance and no preaching or crushing point of view to burden the reader. Read it if you are fan of her music. Read it if you love New York. Read it if you love her poetry or art. Read it if you like magnificent journeys. If you don't like any of those things, read it.

One other true gift of the author is that he especially catches the mind of the adolescent in a very accurate and poignant way - apparent in Bridge of Sighs and here in the childhood recollections of a vacation long past. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 29, 2016","Dec 29, 2016","Dec 29, 2016",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/6303733-that-old-cape-magic

His writing is so skillful and his characters strike such a deep chord, often verbalizing a feeling of which I have been aware, but unable to articulate so clearly. This happens again and again in A Wild Swan. This is the second book I've read recently that picks up fairy tales and re-invents them a bit. My favorite in this collection was called Little Man - and was a re-fashioned Rumplestiltskin. They are all artfully done and honestly you could read this entire book in one sitting and if you do, I would choose a rainy afternoon where you can curl up in a daybed by a window and have a puppy nearby - that is what I did and I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful confection from a favorite author. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 02, 2016","Feb 13, 2016","Jan 02, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23848124-a-wild-swan

Most are case histories and he has always picked intriguing and compelling subject matter that consistently demonstrate the vulnerability our lives - and even our identities have - to our brains. Other books of his have tended more to the autobiographical side - revealing bits about himself - such as Uncle Tungsten. This book is a blend of the two sides of Dr. Sacks - someone I truly wish I had known. The most striking thing perhaps is in the beginning of the book when he reveals that he told his father that he was gay when he was very young in a time and a place not receptive to such news. After reading most of his books, I never knew this about him. And it is not a central theme to the book by any means, but because it is such a deeply personal book, it cannot be ignored. What emerges is a profile of a man who is such a dichotomy. So successful in his professional pursuits, despite the fact that in many ways, he did not fit in professionally. And so unsuccessful in his personal life until late in life. I took my time with this book. I picked it up when it came out, and started it but put it down. I think I was a bit stunned by the beginning. But I'm glad I took my time with it because there is much to digest here - both on the medical side and the personal side.
