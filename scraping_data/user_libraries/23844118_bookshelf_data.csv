Janice Hadlow manages to keep the spirit of Jane Austen in her story about Mary -the poor Bennet sister who is always overlooked and not considered beautiful compared to her other sisters. The Other Bennet Sister follows the beginnings of Pride & Prejudice but from Mary's point of view and continues on following Mary in her journey of finding her own happiness and way in the world. Mrs. Bennet is the same selfish jerk of mother, Caroline Bingley is still a force to be reckoned with and many other P&P characters still play a special role in Mary's adult life. I really appreciated Hadlow's version of Mary and giving her her own stand-alone story.

I have been a fan of Val Kilmer's work for a while and who he is as a person (as much as you can get from a memoir) is pretty much who I thought he would be. A bit vain with some humility, a lot of spiritual and over the top at times. This memoir is probably not the best he could have written, but considering all that he has been through this past decade, maybe it is?He does go through his experiences in all of his greatest movie hits and even some not so great. I think for some, he looks into the past with rose-colored glasses. Ex: The Island of Dr. Moreau. He dives into each movie almost equally, but he does give The Doors and Tombstone a little bit more concentration for good reason. He loves to love women. So be ready for his falling deeply in love with many women in this book! To give you an idea of the general feeling in this memoir through Val's movie characters. These are the ones that kept popping up in my head while reading: Iceman (Top Gun), Jim Morrison (The Doors), Thomas More (The Saint), Doc Holliday (Tombstone) and Gay Perry (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). This could be because they are some of my favorites. Actually not true, I hated his Thomas More character in The Saint.If you like Val Kilmer, it is worth the read. However, do not expect to be wowed by it. I say this with respect to Val who I believe could have written a more amazing memoir (mine would be boring AF). I recommend just reading this book and not listening to the audio. The only narrator I enjoyed was Mare Winningham and she does not get as much narration time!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 10, 2020","Jun 26, 2020","Jun 10, 2020",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/48577722-i-m-your-huckleberry

I think that this story will resonate more with men than women, but clearly I liked it. I started by reading the paperback and then transitioned to the audiobook because I saw that the brilliant Ron Perlman was the narrator. He did not disappoint. (My husband has currently commandeered the paperback) Yes, this story is crude in parts (mostly Kolya) and definitely has a ""series of unfortunate events"" but that is to be expected from a book set during the war. However, I loved the dynamic between Koyla and Lev and the rather odd quest that pushed the unlikely pair together. Though Kolya could be a bit much at times, I ended up not taking him too seriously. He was more of an odd comic relief. I appreciated his older brother mentality towards Lev. Poor Lev was just a kid trying to survive in a horrific world. This was a fast read for me. It was uncomfortable and heart-wrenching at times, but that was the story!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 27, 2019","Dec 07, 2019","Nov 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1971304.City_of_Thieves

This book was not a page-turner for me, but truthfully, most historical books I had to give myself time to think about my rating/ for this one. This book was not a page-turner for me, but truthfully, most historical books take me longer to read, so I can't give this a lower rating because it didn't grip my attention the whole time! First, I highly recommend that you listen to the audio version of this book. I started out with the paperback version but realized quickly that I was going to need someone to pronounce the Egyptian names, places, etc. Even in my head, I do not like not knowing how to correctly say a word. The author, Dr. Kathlyn Cooney, narrates the book. She is not the BEST narrator, but thanks to her, I can pronounce Hatshepsut as well as my own name :)Second, go into this book knowing that most of the book is conjecture (though scholarly). Most, if not all, of Hatshepsut's ""KING"" history was erased by Thutmose III. Also, Egyptians were not known for sharing incredible detail (hieroglyphics made it hard to do so) and they rarely recorded unpleasantries about people or events. Hatshepsut's story is an important one and one that deserves a place in Egyptian history. She was a woman who rose to become pharaoh of Egypt not with bloodshed but with masterful strategy. The theories as to why she was erased are an even more intriguing and an eye-opening look as to why female and not male rulers were looked down upon in Egyptian (or if we are honest ALL) history. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 19, 2018","Dec 04, 2018","Nov 19, 2018",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/25197108-the-woman-who-would-be-king

Kristin Hannah does an amazing job of creating the harsh and beautiful environment of the Alaskan frontier as well as the VERY small but supportive community living within in it--great character development. The Allbright family themselves are a whole other layer of the story and the father, Ernt Allbright, was a perfect parallel to their environment (unpredictable). I appreciated the truthful depiction of a family forever altered by the psychological damage of war.

That being saiMyths can be difficult to understand as they are supernatural fables that have no need to be realistic and often contradict each other. That being said, Madeline Miller does an amazing job of creating a comprehensive and entertaining story of the witch-goddess CIRCE. I listened to the audio version read by British actress Perdita Weeks (Lost in Austen, Penny Dreadful) who gives Circe a perfect narrative voice. Circe is the daughter of Perse, an Oceanid nymph, and the Greek God of the Sun, Helios (Titan). Madeline Miller creates the early life of Circe, a goddess not loved by her family because she has more mortal characteristics than god-like. Circe struggles to find her place amongst the Gods and eventually finds power in witchcraft. The story tells of the actions and events that lead up to (and beyond) Circe's eventual banishment to the island of Aeaea where we know her best in the epic tale of the Odyssey. This is a pretty basic summary but I do not want to give too much away :)As we know next to nothing of Circe's life beyond her connection with Odysseus in the original Greek myths, there are liberties taken in this story and the author does a masterful job of weaving other Greek mythological tales within the life of Circe. I do not mind the liberties taken--they are myths!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 05, 2018","Nov 12, 2018","Nov 05, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/40043563-circe

Evelyn Hugo is possibly a mix of Elizabeth Taylor, Rita Hayworth, Greta Garbo and Ava Gardner with a twist. According to the author, Ava Gardner actually started a tell-all book with a ghostwriter and placed an excerpt in Vanity Fair. She was persuaded not to publish it but it later leaked after her death-- hence the inspiration. ""They go to bed with Gilda; they wake up with me.""- Rita Hayworth Such a simple but yet profound quote that encapsulates the truth of all famous people-- we don't really know them. This story follows the life of bombshell actress Evelyn Hugo in her own words. On the outside, she lived a glamorous life but the truth is messier and less picture perfect. The story of her memoir's writer, Monique Grant, is stronger at first but fizzles within until ending with a bang. I cannot share too much of synopsis without giving it away. I will say I appreciated the author's choice of including many of the Old Hollywood (and sadly today's too) taboo issues in the story.

This story is beautifully written and I liked it, I just had a hard time keeping engaged in the plot. For a story about a hostage situation (inspired by the 1996 Lima Crisis), it's rather subdued. The hostage event starts off in the typically chaotic, violent mess but then settles into an almost utopian like housebound life where both sides just settle into their fate. This idealistic hostage life is mostly due to the lovely operatic singing of the lovely Roxane Coss. Apparently, she's spell-binding. This is where the story was lost on me because as much as I love good music and understand the need to hold on to something beautiful during a crisis, opera is just not my cup of tea. I did enjoy the interrelationships of the hostages and terrorists.
