I found the book to be a humanizing look at what happens in the deserts and mountains of the southern United States. The book was poetic at times and I was really pulled in by the last section where he attempted to help Jose as much as he could. We need more stories like this to help others hear the stories of what happens in the borderlands. After reading this, I came to Goodreads to give it a rating and to write a short . I was shocked to see some of the 1-star s, with some people saying that this was a ""cop-loving"" story about how hunting down humans was some kind of game or adventure. I never found this to be true at all while reading this. I don't see where this perspective comes from, as Cantu was simply telling his story about what it is like down on the border. Never did I get the sense that he was a ""human hunter"" or that he relished what he did. He seemed like people I know: a complicated human being seeking perspectives to understand the world around him....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Apr 05, 2018not set","Apr 14, 2018not set","Feb 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34818440-the-line-becomes-a-river

The science in ""Artemis"" is interesting, fun, and original, since Weir had to basically invent a lunar city. That's where I would give the book more stars than just three. But when it comes to plot and characters, it falls flat. The characters are predictable, one-dimensional people and Weir's ability to write a female protagonist runs into some unfortunate obstacles (jokes that simply don't work, inner monologue that is questionable at best). The story itself can be riveting at times, but that mainly happens because of the setting (1/6 Earth's gravity, moon dust that will tear you up, habitats where fire & chemicals could kill you in an instant). Overall, it was a fun, quick read, but I really hope that Weir works on his characters and story for his 3rd novel. If he can improve that, and keep his science clear, the 3rd novel could be better than ""The Martian.""...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Dec 2017,"Dec 12, 2017","Dec 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34928122-artemis

Jahren does such a wonderful job of weaving her scientific pursuits with the story of her life in labs and the field. Books like this are hard to put down because they are written in such a unique style, at times almost wandering into a kind of poetic/scientific language. Plus the relationship she has with her lab partner Bill makes you smile, scratch your head, laugh, cry, and hope all at the same time. I highly recommend this book for a variety of reasons: to peer behind the scenes at scientific research, to investigate the deeper parts of our lives, and to make us think about those we are closest to, especially our friends and colleagues, and how much they mean to us in our lives. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 24, 2017","Feb 15, 2017","Dec 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25733983-lab-girl

The problem was with character development and usage, foreshadowing issues, and lack of depth in terms of certain situations.For example, when characters are introduced they are fully-fleshed-out and they seem incredibly important, and then some of them just fade into the background, almost useless to the plot. Also, one high profile character dies midway through the story. The narrator makes it seem as if there will be all kinds of problems from here on out due to their loss. Yet the story goes on without a hitch. There are multiple times when the dangers of space travel are brought up. Things like ""We'll be so close to the sun! Danger! Asteroid belt! Danger!"" and then nothing at all happens with those areas of space. Time was spent explaining what could happen and how they were protecting their ship from it, and then NOTHING HAPPENS.The ending was kind of neat, but it all felt quite rushed and required tons of explanation on behalf of the characters and narrator. That could have been unveiled better throughout the last third of the book. Also, the parts of the story that included cameras and filming seemed like they were thrown in there with no purpose or point. They were useless scenes. The editor should have just dumped all of those.But I still enjoyed the overall story!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 12, 2016","Sep 11, 2016","Aug 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24611668-saturn-run

Not only is the investigative journalism spot-on, but the author crafts the story in such a way that it reads like a great narrative with mystery, surprise, and fear. This book opened my eyes to the opiate epidemic in the United States. I knew that it was a problem, but I had no idea of how it started, who it impacted, nor the players involved. I cannot recommend this book enough, especially because Quinones shows us that opiate addiction through OxyContin, black tar heroin, and other pills is not relegated to the back alleys and shadowy places of our society. Opiate addiction is affecting all races and classes. Teenagers are dying from overdoses. Workers are going into doctors with a shoulder injury, getting a prescription, and ending up dead a few years later. They become addicted and keep trying to find that perfect high.

Yes, a new style exists here, with many excellent characters, ideas, and alternative ways of thinking about this genre, but it was as if the author just said to himself, ""Hey, I'm just going to keep inventing new stuff on every page."" It reminded me of ""Lord of the Rings"" how every single object has four names and different histories.

After about 30 pages, I wasn't sure about it, but it came roaring up at me after that.

This book had some interesting moments, especially the way the world sort of ends slowly but pockets of civilization remain. It's not one big catastrophe like so many other books in the genre. That was interesting, but the characters were fairly hollow and the dialogue was weak. Plus the middle third of the book was basically each character saying the same thing. ""Oh, you want answers? You'll have to wait."" Even when Frida meets her brother, he's all tight-lipped and mysterious and she's just cool with that. The way the characters act in terms of their conversations is not very realistic.

Yes, it does meander and the most important parts of the plot are often a subplot that makes little sense for 2/3 of the book. However, I enjoy Mitchell's characters because I often have difficulty warming up to characters, yet he describes his in such a way that you think they're real. But I love a great story that arcs across centuries, that delves into mystery and metaphysics, and has you almost ripping the page to see what will happen next.

David Finkel takes you inside the lives of a handful of soldiers who have returned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This was the kind of book where I went into it thinking I knew exactly how it would be written, how the soldiers' lives would be described, etc. I picked it up because it was on so many must-read lists. It did not disappoint at all and it turned the tables on all of my predictions.These soldiers, and their families, have had their lives thrown into the shredder, and Finkel spares nothing in his descriptions of their day-to-day activities. You get wrapped up in the little bureaucratic battles they deal with and you are floored by the depths of their depression and pain. This is not a happy book for the most part. There are small victories here and there. This book takes you deep into the emotional centers of these men and women and you feel like you are feeling their pain, feeling it flow through you like a cold liquid.Books like these should probably be required reading for citizens living in a democratic republic like ours. Finkel shines a light on the problems of our soldiers that are hiding in the corners of their minds. They may try to repress their pain and their anger, but it is there and it must be dealt with....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 10, 2014","Jan 20, 2014","Dec 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17568768-thank-you-for-your-service

Wendel's coverage of baseball in this book is very enjoyable. And that's what he should have focused on.The baseball portions of the book are really the heart of the story. I had two complaints about this book. First, Wendel didn't need to talk about football, basketball, the Olympics, or the events of 1968 much at all because it took away from the baseball story. It was as if he was trying to cover as much as he could but couldn't decide how much of each sport/event to put in the book. There's nothing wrong with covering the other sports and events of '68 but he gives them short shrift so you don't end up knowing much about those things at all. They are just tiny side stories in comparison to the baseball.The other problem I had was the way it was organized and Wendel's writing style. He would jump from one thing to another quite often. One section, for example, included talking about the Cardinals, then the next paragraph was about Bob Gibson seeing MLK Jr. at an airport, the next paragraph was about what they would have talked about if they had talked, and then the final paragraph was about MLK's enjoyment of sports. The book had odd paragraph structures like that from time to time. They just didn't work.Overall, though, if you just want a history of the '68 baseball season, I recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 03, 2013","Dec 08, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13058200-summer-of-68

You're kept guessing how in the world they're going to figure out a way to keep living, but then, there it is.This is the kind of sci-fi that I love because it involves humans and technology and our own failures.

Sometimes the descriptions of his world are a bit over the top, but you get used to it.I only had a couple of problems with this book and they were rather large ones. Pessl's writing style has a tic in it. She tends to vastly overuse simile and metaphor, so almost any description of someone, something, or some event has to be described in an unnecessary way. Sometimes those descriptions can be a nice addition to the story, but more times than not it gets in the way of the story. The second problem are the three main characters (McGrath, Hopper, and Nora). They don't seem to have very deep or detailed personalities. They're mainly just represented as people who are caught up in something they don't understand. They just have reactive emotional states similar to anyone else you know. Nothing grand or specific.Other than those two things, I still really enjoyed the book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 19, 2013","Sep 06, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10112885-night-film

They actually work either way, but after reading this fantastic book, I want to go back and read the 2nd book again.Oryx and Crake is imaginative, but in a way that is also quite unsettling. It takes place in our future, one possible future, in which we are doing really horrible things to ourselves and the Earth. In other words, it's where we're headed if we don't make any changes to what we currently do. People's behaviors are still pretty terrible and this society only brings out the extremes. I know Atwood doesn't like to consider it science fiction, instead calling it ""speculative fiction."" Either way, she does a great job of capturing some of our worst tendencies in this story.Atwood has a unique ability to exhibit the deeper emotions, feelings, and thinking of characters than other authors I have read. There are times when you feel so sorry for Jimmy, the main character, and other times when you hate him. Crake is creepy but his storyline arc is long, so we may see him in a different light when this is all over. This book helps me ask myself the question, ""Where are we going as a species and as a society?""

""Death from the Skies"" chronicles all of the possible ways that our planet, and life as we know it, could be destroyed by non-terrestrial natural events. This is definitely not light reading nor does it always perk you up, but it is funny, highly informative, and humbling. Plait's description of our solar system, galaxy, and universe help you to appreciate our position in the cosmos. But how do we survive? Here's how.Plait covers a wide range of deadly outer space culprits in an attempt to show you just how powerful nature is. The list includes: gamma ray bursts from black holes, solar flares/coronal mass ejections, asteroid impact, comet impact, galactic collision (that's a slow death), and many others. Each chapter starts with a fun little 2-3 page story of humans observing these things from Earth, and they can be a bit scary. After that, the writing is filled with excellent science writing mixed with Plait's clever humor. You come away from this book with far more knowledge of nature than just what can kill us. Plait does an excellent job of explaining how so many different natural forces work, from gravity to chemistry to geology to quantum mechanics.Here's the good news: most of these things are not going to kill us. The chances of gamma ray bursts or galactic collisions happening are slim. However, the two chapters that I enjoyed the most are actually the chapters the tell the story of our two most likely killers: solar radiation and asteroid/comet impacts.Plait makes a great case near the end to increase funding towards protecting our planet against solar radiation and impacts from extra-terrestrial bodies like comets and asteroids. There are some great ideas, scientists, and programs out there that just need more funding to get their plans off the ground. A coronal mass ejection could wipe out our power grid and send us plunging into medieval times. It could even damage our ozone layer, which leads to huge long-term problems. And we all know what an asteroid or comet impact could do. The dinosaurs know all about that. But we can prevent these, the most likely problems, if we just work harder at it.This was a fun, engaging read that I recommend to folks who enjoy a good science book, especially those of you who enjoy astronomy....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 29, 2013","Feb 28, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3864977-death-from-the-skies

It's one of the most engaging and thrilling novels I've read in awhile. It's based on a real event, the Franklin Expedition to the find the Northwest Passage to Asia through the arctic. We don't know much about what happened to the expedition, but Dan Simmons is brilliant by filling in the details for you. And scaring you quite a bit in the process.There are a few characters, too, that you become especially attached to because they reveal themselves in stages throughout the story. The characters become darker as the story grows due to the fact that conditions worsen in the expedition. The descriptions of the arctic and the cold and the disease and the pain are so real that you sometimes feel like putting on more clothing or getting out one more blanket. You feel for these men, not just because they were real at one point in time, but because Simmons writes them so well. It's as if you're watching them do all of this right outside your window.This story mixes man v. nature, science fiction, mythology, European v. Native attitudes, the slow descent into the inner core of who man really is, and countless other intriguing storylines. You find yourself turning the pages quicker and quicker. And just when you thought you might have something figured out, Simmons scares you again with something out-of-the-ordinary. I can't tell you too much without giving away the story.

Oh, but wait, they are the ancestors of some people who are living right now. Who cares? What did that have to do with anything?I found most of the characters in this book not believable. It's as if you simply took some people from 2012 and plopped them down into a different setting. There really isn't a sense of 100 years of apocalypse. People still talk the same way, Guilder and his minions still behave the same way, and important details are just left out. How do they find fuel when they're driving the bus towards the east coast? A guiding hand. What? And what was with that scene near the end when Guilder suits up in robes and says, ""It's game time""? What was that? That's terrible writing. And then Amy transforms, the Twelve die, and the very next chapter, our heroes are just running the show and behaving like regular folk. No one is grieving, no one seems to be in the depths of depression or anguish because they just destroyed half a city and twelve giant vampire beasts. No, everyone just goes on with their lives. This book lacks energy and fear. It's named ""The Twelve"" and you barely ever see them. They emerge from beyond the horizon, agree to get put in the back of a semi (?), get transported to a stadium, and then get destroyed by a few humans.

David Quammen has written some excellent science and nature essays in the past and I thought this book, his newest, would be a fun try at his longer work.It did not disappoint.The subject of the book is zoonosis, which is the transfer of a disease from animals to humans. Some of our most famous and deadliest diseases are zoonotic. Quammen travels the globe interviewing doctors, scientists, and patients who have either been infected with or worked with countless bacteria, viruses, or parasites. He chronicles malaria, hendra, hanta, ebola, SARS, flu, HIV, and others. It will definitely open your eyes to how susceptible we are to nature's cruelest bugs. Quammen's writing style can be deep but also contains quick jabs that will spook you like a scene out of a horror film. You'll be reading fascinating pages about different forms of a virus, how it was isolated, the processes used to identify it, etc. and then all of a sudden he tells you a story about someone who got it and how it spread. The hair on the back of your neck stands up as the science gives way to the gruesome reality of these diseases. The only part of the book I did not care for was a section he included in the HIV chapter. In it, he creates a sort of historical fiction of how the virus may have traveled from southeast Cameroon over a century ago into the Congo. It's pretty good fiction writing but I didn't feel like it meshed at all with the rest of the science writing in the book. It was kind of an outlier section that made you feel like the book was going in the wrong direction.I learned a ton from this book. It helped dispel certain urban legends and pieces of misinformation about quite a few viruses. The chapter on SARS will keep you riveted and the chapter on HIV will make you proud of the hard-working scientists who traced HIV back over 100 years into Africa's past.If you're into science and want something that will both pull back the curtain and scare you at the same time, I recommend this heartily....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 04, 2013","Oct 06, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13637215-spillover

Now I don't believe that EVERYONE is going to think this is five stars, but this author nailed it in almost every area of fiction writing that I enjoy. This book contains very few characters who are introspective and ask big questions about what the world is going to be like now that most people are dead. More importantly, though, this book has many layers and contains great scenes in nature and exploring the depths of human love. Some of the scenes between the main character and his deceased wife (from memory) are hauntingly beautiful and sad. Plus, the main character has a great dog who is one of his best companions.For me, a great fiction rattles me to my core and makes me feel like the actual character in the book. I feel as if I have been there with him, in his skin, wondering about the world around me.

I found the book fairly predictable, which isn't always a negative, but I thought that maybe she would prove me wrong and have an ""ah ha!"" moment within. The writing was good, but not stellar. Sometimes she would describe something very beautiful or deep, but other times I felt like those descriptions or accounts seemed forced.However, the positives of this book outweigh the few negatives. I'm a sucker for an outdoors story. Ms. Strayed does an excellent job of recounting her life along the trail and how it connected to her life off the trail. Some people read books like this and claim that they are obvious, that it's common sense that time in nature will heal you or open you up to new things. And I say to them, ""So what if it's obvious?"" We need more books like this that help people to see that there are simple, delightful things in life and that we probably don't do them nearly as often as we should.I've always been a proponent of the idea that if something is important, you make the time for it. Often I will hear (and actually say myself) people say, ""I don't have time for that."" Sure you do. You just have different priorities. Ms. Strayed reminds us that you need to think about your priorities from time to time in order to live a better, happier life.There's a scene near the end when she has finished hiking the trail and she meets a lawyer near an ice cream shop. He is amazed at her journey and how far she has come. She tells him that if she can do it, anyone can do it, including him. He says, ""No, I'm too busy."" One of the things I try to remind myself is that I don't want to be that lawyer throughout my life. Sure, I will take care of the things that need to be taken care of and I will do my job as best I can, but I never want to say that I'm too busy to do something that I know I'll love and cherish forever. We shouldn't have to look back on our lives one day and realize that we didn't do the things we loved. Do them now.

This place had everything, including this book, ""The Swamp."" I had to buy it.This book is fascinating, mainly because it mixes the history of South Florida from the early Spanish days up through the modern day with the environmental history of the Everglades.

You won't find any other environmental structure like them on Earth. And they're dying. We're killing them with sprawl, chemicals, and bureaucratic neglect. Grunwald does a nice job of weaving the story of how man has lived with the Everglades ever since the Seminole and Miccosukee Indians lived there (and some still do).There are times when the author gets a little distracted with one person's story or some silly government red tape crap, but overall this book inspired me to think more deeply about places like the Everglades.

Now that society has collapsed, why would we want to have the same society all over again? Why would we want to live lives that take us away from the truest things out there? Why would we want to recreate the same lifeless jobs and activities that drain us of desire, of passion? I enjoy my life but I can see what he's getting at overall. Here's an opportunity to create something new, to learn from the mistakes, and to embrace something more human, tied to the natural, not the artificial.Of course you have to read it to find out what happens in the end. This book surprised me by how good it was. I highly recommend it.

I'm so glad I did because this was my favorite book so far this year. In a nutshell, the author shows how a rare book collector in the 1400's finds one of the only remaining copies of Lucretius's ""On the Nature of Things"" and has it copied from a monastic library. From there, the work sees a resurgence of interest, much to the chagrin of the Catholic church and other traditional institutions at the time. After that the work becomes a huge hit with the great thinkers of the Renaissance and afterward, up to Thomas Jefferson. You have to read it to get all the details, but the thesis is that the rediscovery of Epicureanism, which has been grossly misconstrued by centuries of traditionalists, lies at the root of our modern world. It was Lucretius's work that helped people to see the world in a completely different way and thus made the world ""swerve"" towards a new future. My only complaint was that Greenblatt only spends one chapter (the last one) connecting great thinkers and ""On the Nature of Things"". I would have liked to have seen more writing on how famous thinkers adopted it and used it in their ideas and their writing.

In a way it is, but it's written by John Tierney of the NYT so it reads more like the traditional solid non-fiction that I enjoy. The book's ideas center on the human concept of willpower, what it is, and how it works. The research is pretty interesting and each chapter shows you examples of studies in which humans are tested on their ability to use willpower. What I didn't know is that willpower is like a fuel tank; you can use up all your willpower before the day is over and it can be hard to get back. When our willpower is low, we make very poor decisions. Willpower actually uses up glucose so when you are hungry, you make very bad decisions, so you need to refuel in order to have energy to actually be decisive.

This book is more than just baseball and I found myself making quite a few peeks into my memory banks from Moby Dick, Emerson, and a few coming of age novels. The reason I enjoyed this book so much is that it is about the art of fielding, but not the type of fielding that you find on a baseball field. The characters are all searching for ideas about who they really are and who they are trying to be. They don't know how to deal with the problems that life has given them. They sometimes don't even know how to build their souls, like Affenlight and Owen talked about at the end of the book. For me, the story rings with the idea that you leave a little bit of yourself in different points of time throughout your life, and those places and people become a part of you as well. Baseball itself doesn't teach these young men how to be grown men. It's their relationships with each other that help them try to become better human beings, but even after some maturity you still fail, like Affenlight did.Like Franzen's Freedom, I enjoyed this book because it seemed real TO ME. In my experience, I have known people like this. They are not caricatures. I know that people have had these kinds of feelings in their lives. Harbach isn't just creating some silly archetypes. He has actually pulled emotions from real life and made good characters out of them. If you don't agree, then I think it's a matter of your own personal experiences.

It's not exceptionally written, nor does it give you any profound ideas. Really all it does is remind the reader that every life requires balance, and that balance can be achieved through disconnection from technology from time to time.

This book stands up for science and shows, in great detail, how there are no links between vaccines and autism. The author does a great job of showing the evidence for the benefits of vaccines and how groups claiming vaccines are bad have no evidence at all. The book covers the international epidemiological studies, the Special Masters decision of 2008, the decades of disease prevention, and many, many other examples of science working for the benefit of people. The author also does an excellent job of highlighting the problems, errors, willful ignorance, and lack of scientific expertise and knowledge of many so-called ""experts"" on the side of the anti-vaccine crowd. The one figure who needs to apologize to families everywhere is Jenny McCarthy, who continues to spout myths and people believe her.I'm glad I read this book. I sympathize greatly with families who have autistic children and I hope that they one day find out why their children have this disorder and that they may find a cure or method of prevention.
